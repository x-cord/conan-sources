1
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:04,581
The murder that took place at the new Nichiuri TV building

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:07,743
turned into a serial bombing case.

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:11,932
Hattori Heiji and I assisted the police investigation,

4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:15,763
and uncovered the terrifying truth the true culprit had plotted.

5
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:17,273
However...

6
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:22,623
Hey! What are you filming for, you idiot?!

7
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:26,513
Ryohei must be Suemura.

8
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:30,218
If we copy this video and distribute it to everyone, no one can betray us.

9
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,362
All right. This is it.

10
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:35,262
We should contact the Hyogo police immediately.

11
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:36,213
Wait!

12
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:38,643
Look at the screen.

13
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,523
There are four men in the shot, right?

14
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:45,023
Then who's shooting the video?

15
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:49,212
So there were five robbers.

16
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:50,033
Yeah.

17
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:53,413
Which means in the presence of the final man...

18
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:56,163
It's already been set.

19
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:59,383
A bomb that could go off at any time.

20
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,762
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

21
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,652
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

22
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,362
Find the final remaining bomb!

23
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:12,322
The climax will have you on the edge of your seat!

24
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,882
Always determining the one truth

25
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:15,662
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

26
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:18,143
his name is Detective Conan!

27
00:02:56,163 --> 00:03:02,163
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba (Finale)

28
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:10,773
They went to question Ishizawa after that,

29
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,994
but it seems like he didn't talk.

30
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:16,813
It was already nighttime, and they were at a hospital.

31
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:18,624
They couldn't push him too hard.

32
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,754
Which means it's our turn at bat.

33
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,134
Yeah. It's time to do whatever it takes.

34
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:26,884
That's right.

35
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:33,104
What? Ran-chan, you're not going to audition?

36
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:36,104
No. It's not really my thing.

37
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:37,943
Why not?

38
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:41,964
Well, you know, I have to look after the kids.

39
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:44,123
I guess it can't be helped.

40
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,114
You've got to consider Kudo-kun's feelings, too.

41
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:47,824
It's not like that.

42
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:51,073
But I'm doing it, even if I'm doing it alone.

43
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:54,584
I'm going to get the part and shake Gomera's hand!

44
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:58,243
I-I'm not sure you can shake Gomera's hand.

45
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:00,304
Then Kamen Yaiba's!

46
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,613
We should probably leave soon.

47
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:04,474
You're right.

48
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:08,243
I'll get the others. Let's go to Abeno Harukas together.

49
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:08,974
Okay.

50
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,354
No New Messages

51
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:17,864
That Heiji...

52
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:20,864
Kyoto-Osaka Serial Bombing Investigation HQ

53
00:04:24,754 --> 00:04:25,994
Well, everyone?

54
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,573
Found anything?

55
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:29,374
Nothing yet.

56
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:34,703
The Hyogo police already conducted a thorough investigation, so it's not that easy.

57
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,723
I know that.

58
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:39,384
I'm telling you to figure something out.

59
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:40,754
Listen up, everyone.

60
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:46,264
We've learned that what we thought was a team of four robbers was actually a team of five.

61
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:51,814
Not only that, but it's possible a bomb has been planted in the vicinity of the fifth man!

62
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:54,433
They must've left something behind.

63
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:56,063
Find him!

64
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:56,974
Yes, sir!

65
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,074
Explosion at Osaka Nanko

66
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:06,054
Well, well.

67
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,704
You seem to be doing well.

68
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,583
Who are you?

69
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,454
Curious about that article?

70
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,193
Of course you are.

71
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:21,304
After all, the bombs you made are killing your old accomplices one after another.

72
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:23,714
So you're with the police.

73
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,474
Didn't Yonekura attack you and lock you up?

74
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:32,913
I think it'd be best if you gave yourself up and talked to the police.

75
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:35,284
You've got your last accomplice to worry about.

76
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:39,604
Isn't there still another bomb you made?

77
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:44,734
So wouldn't it be planted near your surviving accomplice?

78
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,243
It'd be better to talk to the police and have him taken into—

79
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:49,744
I don't know! I don't know anything!

80
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,864
Hello? What's up?

81
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:59,084
What? Got it! I'll head back immediately!

82
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:19,434
Abeno Harukas

83
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:23,913
Wow!

84
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,623
Look at all these Gomeras!

85
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:27,534
What a view!

86
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:29,153
Let's go over there!

87
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:29,714
Yes!

88
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:33,753
There are so many kaiju balloons.

89
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:35,364
Yeah, you're right.

90
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,413
You still haven't heard from Hattori-kun?

91
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:41,493
It's fine. He's always like this.

92
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:44,964
I know. Ran-chan, take some pictures for me.

93
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:53,703
Nice.

94
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,714
Kazuha-san.

95
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,644
Thank you for coming today.

96
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:01,894
This is Suzuki. He'll be running today's event.

97
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:04,503
I'm Suzuki of Nichiuri TV.

98
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,274
Thank you for auditioning today.

99
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:09,534
Thank you for having us.

100
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:13,954
Didn't you MC the production announcement event, too?

101
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:18,613
Yes. I'm terribly sorry about everything that happened then.

102
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:22,483
Anyway, I'll show you to the audition space.

103
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,964
Your green room is there.

104
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:25,184
Okay.

105
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,003
Naniwa Police Hospital

106
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:34,014
Changing Room Authorized Personnel Only!

107
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:51,653
Chief, we've confirmed there were five robbers.

108
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:53,033
I knew it.

109
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,553
They were caught on the security cameras.

110
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:56,204
Hey.

111
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:57,374
Yes, sir.

112
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:02,874
Here you are.

113
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:07,744
This is the entryway of the victims' home.

114
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:13,534
Look closely at this gap.

115
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:17,144
He's got a watch on his right hand.

116
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,573
So he's left-handed.

117
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:20,264
Yeah.

118
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:25,483
None of the other four are left-handed.

119
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,904
Which means this is the fifth man.

120
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:34,373
The Hyogo police knew there was a left-handed man in the group,

121
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:37,353
but that wasn't enough for them to go on.

122
00:08:37,354 --> 00:08:41,453
All right. Search their associates for left-handed men.

123
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,294
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,264
It's me, Katsuji. You're in there, aren't you?

125
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:02,723
There better not be anyone with you.

126
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:03,694
Nah.

127
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,814
What? Ishizawa has a brother?

128
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:11,443
Is that true?

129
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:12,224
Yes.

130
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,063
Ishizawa lost his parents when he was young.

131
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:20,574
He and his brother Koichi, who's two years his senior, were raised at an orphanage in Kyoto.

132
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:24,833
Koichi went missing after he left the orphanage at sixteen.

133
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:27,894
Ishizawa himself left soon afterwards.

134
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:32,843
Koichi seriously injured his right leg in a fight when he was fifteen,

135
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:35,654
and he has a slight limp.

136
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:39,844
And his brother Koichi is left-handed.

137
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:41,344
What?!

138
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,043
Bro, what are you going to do?

139
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,523
Run, obviously.

140
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:47,444
Where?

141
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:51,683
I don't know! If I stay here, the police will come for me eventually.

142
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:54,213
Then why didn't you flee sooner?

143
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:57,193
Yonekura's on the news.

144
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,744
I've got my hands full evading debt collectors!

145
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,033
I don't have time to watch the news.

146
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,223
They shut off the power to my house.

147
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:05,524
I see.

148
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:07,944
So that's how it is.

149
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,374
What are you guys doing here?

150
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:13,634
We just followed you from the hospital.

151
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:18,424
Your brother's the fifth robber, isn't he?

152
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:21,184
Bro...

153
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:21,884
Damn it!

154
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:23,814
Move!

155
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:26,723
Run, bro!

156
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:28,394
Hey, let go!

157
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:33,794
Don't let him escape, Kudo!

158
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:47,041
Damn!

159
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,369
Don't make this difficult.

160
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,799
You can't escape now.

161
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:32,069
Damn...

162
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,778
Thank you for coming to the "Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba"

163
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:45,428
production announcement event.

164
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:52,079
Please turn off your cell and smart phones,

165
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:58,089
and please refrain from taking pictures or videos.

166
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,038
Yeah, we're on the West Amagi overpass.

167
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,289
Thanks.

168
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:06,858
A text?

169
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,269
It's from Kazuha.

170
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,649
Jeez. She's so carefree.

171
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,148
Did something happen?

172
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,478
No, it's nothing.

173
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,028
I'm sorry, bro.

174
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:18,899
Jeez.

175
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,698
If I'd known this would happen, I would've gone into work instead.

176
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:23,728
Sorry.

177
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:26,228
You're supposed to be working right now?

178
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:26,909
Yeah.

179
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,539
Yonekura asked me to work security at an event for him.

180
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:32,959
Where?

181
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,788
Abeno Harukas.

182
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,838
I think it was a movie production announcement or something.

183
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,729
What?

184
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,198
Ran and the others should be at that event.

185
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:42,308
Yeah.

186
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:44,639
Did Yonekura give you any other instructions?

187
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,988
I can't remember all of that.

188
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:48,558
Answer the question!

189
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,269
There are lives on the line!

190
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:52,888
It's no use. They're not answering.

191
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:53,479
Damn!

192
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:57,038
He really didn't give me any details.

193
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,538
He said there'd be kaiju balloons or something,

194
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:01,739
and that I should stand next to them.

195
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,109
Balloons? You mean these?

196
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,719
Yeah, probably.

197
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,619
There are numbers written on the weights of the balloons.

198
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:14,568
He told me to stand between numbers 26 and 27.

199
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:15,758
That's it, then.

200
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,499
Yeah.

201
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,879
There are two bombs: one in 26, and one in 27.

202
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,409
The bombs are probably in the weights of those two balloons.

203
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,218
Shouldn't we cancel the event?

204
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:36,939
I wish we could, but if people find out about the bombs, it could cause a panic.

205
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:40,488
These bombs are incredibly unstable.

206
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:43,449
The slightest shock could set them off.

207
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:48,949
In other words, we have to do something until the bomb squad arrives.

208
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,829
Thanks to your cheers, Yaiba was able to defeat Jocker's monster!

209
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,759
Finally, let's thank Yaiba with a loud cheer!

210
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,248
Ready, everyone?

211
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:02,458
Yeah!

212
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,528
"Kamen Yaiba, thank you!"

213
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:06,718
Kamen Yaiba, thank you!

214
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:09,929
They said they'd provide a costume, but...

215
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,929
Do I really have to wear this?

216
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,309
What is this?

217
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:20,319
Th-There are all these balloons?

218
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,568
Let's split up and search.

219
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:23,819
Got it.

220
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,428
Damn it. Where are they?

221
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:36,369
Officer!

222
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:38,228
I'll help.

223
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:43,258
In that case, could you check to see if balloons have been placed anywhere else?

224
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,558
Got it.

225
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,128
Otaki-han! Have you found them?

226
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:48,688
Not yet.

227
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,588
There's so many of them.

228
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,929
I found it!

229
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:54,569
I found 26!

230
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:58,999
I'm opening it.

231
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:17,398
Ten minutes left.

232
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,928
We don't have time to wait for the bomb squad.

233
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:21,049
It's an emergency!

234
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:27,089
One Gomera and one Yaiba balloon have been moved to the stage on floor 58!

235
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:28,629
What?

236
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,848
I became a huge fan after my brother took me

237
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:37,168
to see a Gomera movie when I was three.

238
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,689
If I'm given the opportunity to appear in "Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba"...

239
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,518
What should we do, Hei-chan?

240
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,578
You guys head upstairs.

241
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:48,949
Kazuha and Mori-san's daughter are there.

242
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:50,838
We'll handle things here.

243
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,198
But...

244
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,268
There are tons of guests upstairs.

245
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:56,579
You'll need people to help evacuate them.

246
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,558
Got it.

247
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,829
But if things get dangerous here, you'd better run.

248
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,459
Yeah, I know.

249
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:05,499
Let's hurry.

250
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:06,399
Got it.

251
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,629
Kosugi-san, you stay here. I have a request.

252
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:13,139
A request?

253
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,009
It's time for our final participant.

254
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:21,018
Kazuha-chan, you can do it.

255
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,749
Toyama Kazuha-san.

256
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,728
Huh? The music...

257
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:33,739
Did it break?

258
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,899
I wonder what happened.

259
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:37,809
Kazuha-chan...

260
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,008
I'm terribly sorry, everyone.

261
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:44,999
Due to technical difficulties, we'll be taking a break now.

262
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:50,378
We'll be holding a handshake event with Gomera and Yaiba in the elevator hall.

263
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,679
Please feel free to participate.

264
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,828
What's going on?

265
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,388
I'm sorry. There's actually an emergency.

266
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:59,289
What?

267
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:02,299
I was asked to give you this.

268
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:05,389
Hello?

269
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:06,109
Kazuha, is that you?

270
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,979
Heiji?

271
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:10,328
Listen, Kazuha. Stay calm and listen.

272
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,858
A bomb has been planted on that stage you're on.

273
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,109
What?!

274
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:17,909
Ran-oneesan?

275
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:19,808
Let's hurry.

276
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,468
If we don't get in line soon, we'll be too late.

277
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:23,359
Okay.

278
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,489
Let's go.

279
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:34,578
Is this a joke? A bomb?

280
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,919
See the two balloons onstage?

281
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:42,229
Yeah. There's one of Yaiba and one of Gomera.

282
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:48,749
There's a bomb inside the weight that has the number 27 written on it.

283
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,069
I found it.

284
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:53,498
27 is written on Gomera's weight.

285
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:56,788
All right. Unzip it and open the lid.

286
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,018
Got it. Give me one second.

287
00:17:59,019 --> 00:17:59,979
Well?

288
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:00,619
Okay.

289
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,009
The surrounding wires are bypasses, so she just needs to cut them in order.

290
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:10,379
Then she can remove the detonator.

291
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,469
Got it.

292
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,628
What is it, Kazuha?

293
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:16,009
No, no, no! I can't do this!

294
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:17,639
Calm down, Kazuha!

295
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:20,198
Let's leave this thing and get out of here.

296
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,179
You idiot!

297
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,719
What do you think will happen to the other guests if a bomb goes off right now?

298
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,519
There's no time to evacuate everyone.

299
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,068
Listen, Kazuha.

300
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,529
Otaki-han and the others are headed there now,

301
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,779
but we don't know if they'll make it in time.

302
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,279
I need to deal with the bomb here, so I can't go to you.

303
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:44,338
What? There's a bomb over there, too?

304
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:48,169
Yeah, so you'll have to disarm that one.

305
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:50,909
You just have to do as I say.

306
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,539
It's okay. I know you can do it.

307
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,679
What should I do?

308
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:58,729
Okay.

309
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,558
Switch to video and show me your bomb.

310
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,729
Got it.

311
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,428
Switch to video...

312
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:07,978
Let me. I'll do it.

313
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,059
Ran-chan.

314
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,069
Just like I thought, it's the same as this one.

315
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:23,598
Kazuha, there should be small scissors in the sewing kit you carry with you.

316
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,749
Use those to cut the wires.

317
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,748
Okay. I'm ready anytime.

318
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:29,769
All right.

319
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,749
First is black.

320
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,629
Kazuha, the black wire is first.

321
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,708
I'll try cutting mine first. If nothing happens, you cut yours, too.

322
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:40,389
Okay.

323
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:42,889
Here we go.

324
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:48,769
Okay. Cut the black wire.

325
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,029
Got it.

326
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:51,949
I did it.

327
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:52,769
All right.

328
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,348
Let's keep going.

329
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:55,719
Next is yellow.

330
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,779
Okay. That just leaves the big one.

331
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:05,998
Inside the tube connected to the red wire,

332
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,998
see the tube connected to the blue wire being held up by some plastic rods?

333
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:10,919
Yeah.

334
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:15,718
Remove the dangling tube without touching the surrounding tube,

335
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,089
cut the blue wire, and you're done.

336
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:23,878
First we'll unscrew the plastic rods supporting it, and...

337
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:24,849
I can't!

338
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,649
What's wrong, Kazuha?

339
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:30,019
I don't have a screwdriver.

340
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:32,238
What should I do?

341
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:35,528
You don't have one in your sewing kit?

342
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:37,229
Of course not!

343
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:39,989
Damn! We're so close...

344
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,598
This isn't good, Hattori.

345
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,909
We've got less than three minutes left.

346
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,159
Is there anything in the area that you could use instead?

347
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:51,499
There's nothing that convenient just lying around...

348
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,508
I found it. I found something, Heiji.

349
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,419
Hurry, Kazuha! There's no time!

350
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,609
Forgive me, Yaiba.

351
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,668
Give me the scissors.

352
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:02,619
Okay.

353
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:18,819
Ran-chan, cut it!

354
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:25,468
Is it over?

355
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:27,929
Looks like it. It didn't explode.

356
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:31,148
There's no bell or buzzer or anything?

357
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:33,579
No. It's over.

358
00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:37,079
You did a good job, Kazuha.

359
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:40,789
Yes!

360
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:47,748
By the way, Kazuha...

361
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,099
What?

362
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,459
That outfit looks great on you.

363
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:56,789
Don't look!

364
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:39,904
Filming Underway!!

365
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:42,719
So they blew up the new building in the end.
