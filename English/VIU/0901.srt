1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:00,891
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:03,790
Come on, dad, hurry up and get ready.

3
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:06,090
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The movie's going to start.

4
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,091
No way.

5
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:08,290
Huh?

6
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,390
I don't want to go.

7
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,490
What?

8
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:12,090
Why not?

9
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:17,890
You were looking forward to seeing the new movie starring Yoko Okino.

10
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:19,991
I don't like what it's about.

11
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:23,090
What it's about?

12
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,790
I don't mind that Yoko Okino's playing

13
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,491
"Court Detective, Saki Kirie" -a beautiful and talented lawyer.

14
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:32,190
But her boyfriend's a former police officer and incompetent detective,

15
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,290
"You're under arrest!" -who accidentally becomes a suspected murderer

16
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:39,590
"Objection!" -and cleans his name using her detective skills.

17
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:42,090
"You're the only one for me!" is what he cries

18
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:46,090
as the detective clings to his girlfriend

19
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,490
in this moving love and mystery.

20
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:50,691
Who would go to see this movie?

21
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,090
It sounds interesting...

22
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:57,690
Maybe they based his character off Pops.

23
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:03,090
Besides, those movie tickets are for premium seats.

24
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,190
"Invitation, Premium Seats" -Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,990
Eri probably got them for me.

26
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:09,390
Well, yeah.

27
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,391
Unbelievable.

28
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:14,390
She's definitely planning on showing up so she can tell me

29
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,391
to reflect on my mistakes like the detective in the movie.

30
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:22,491
Does that mean there are things you think you need to reflect on?

31
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,090
You're starting to sound like Eri.

32
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,091
Really?

33
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,490
I don't like it!

34
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:34,490
If more impertinent women start appearing in this world,

35
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,790
we're done for.

36
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,891
Geez.

37
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:47,690
A friend request on my messaging app?

38
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,891
I wonder who it is?

39
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,890
Huh? Mom?

40
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:55,790
"Eri Kisaki" -But we're already friends.

41
00:01:55,791 --> 00:02:00,990
Maybe her secretary, Ms. Kuriyama, sent a message as a joke.

42
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:01,991
Is that so?

43
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:04,191
Then I'll add her to the group.

44
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:09,490
"Eri Kisaki" -"I've been captured by some bad people."

45
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:12,690
"Could you call the police?"

46
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,090
What?

47
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:15,691
Ran, let me see.

48
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:17,791
What should we do?

49
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,490
Start by asking her if that's true.

50
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,390
Okay.

51
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:25,291
Is that true?

52
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,690
She responded.

53
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:34,190
She says she doesn't know where she is.

54
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:35,390
Darn!

55
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:38,990
Sounds like she was kidnapped from her office.

56
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:42,090
"Eri Kisaki: Just kidding! I'm joking!" -It was just a joke?

57
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,090
Geez, Mom.

58
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:47,390
But wait... Look.

59
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,290
"That message was from an impostor!" -The icons are different.

60
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,490
"They're using my phone to send messages!" -They're probably

61
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,490
not the same Eri you just added.

62
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:54,790
Hold on.

63
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:58,690
If the person using Eri's usual icon is an impostor...

64
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:02,591
The one without an icon is the real Mom...

65
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,990
"What are you talking about? I'm the real Eri!"

66
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:09,890
Darn it! They changed from Eri's usual cat icon to no icon!

67
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:11,490
"What are you talking about? I'm the real Eri!"

68
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,190
"No! I'm the real Eri!"

69
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,590
"Shut up, impostor."

70
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,591
"You're the impostor."

71
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:16,591
"No, you are!"

72
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:19,991
Mom are multiplying?

73
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:23,590
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

74
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,590
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

75
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:27,790
There's something wrong with these phone messages.

76
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,190
What happened to Attorney Kisaki?

77
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,890
He sees through the one and only truth.

78
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:33,790
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

79
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,191
His name is Detective Conan!

80
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:21,743
"Attorney Kisaki's SOS (Part 1)"

81
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:29,742
"Two hours earlier..."

82
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:30,743
"Law Eri Kisaki"

83
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:34,042
Attorney Kisaki, I'm back.

84
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,742
Here's your tomato juice and sandwich.

85
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:38,742
Thank you, Kuriyama.

86
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,842
I didn't have time to eat lunch.

87
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:42,542
I'm starving.

88
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,642
-Should you be eating that? -What?

89
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:47,642
Don't you have a movie date

90
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:49,642
with your ex-husband after this?

91
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:52,142
We're not divorced, we're separated.

92
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,242
And it's not a date.

93
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:54,842
I'm just going to see a movie

94
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:56,543
because my daughter wouldn't stop pestering me.

95
00:05:57,743 --> 00:06:01,542
Besides, there's no telling what he'd say

96
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:05,042
if my stomach growled during the movie.

97
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,442
Really?

98
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:10,242
You don't mind your stomach growling in front of your clients,

99
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:13,442
but it bothers you if it's in front of your husband.

100
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:16,443
Oh, is that right?

101
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:23,642
Huh? We shouldn't have any more clients coming today.

102
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:25,442
Could you go check?

103
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:27,842
It could be a walk-in.

104
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:28,943
Sure.

105
00:06:39,443 --> 00:06:42,342
If it's a client,

106
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:44,042
I'll probably have to eat lunch

107
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:46,743
in the car on the way to the theater.

108
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,643
Kuriyama, was it a client?

109
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:56,443
Kuriyama?

110
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:00,643
Kuriyama!

111
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:10,343
Gosh. Who are you?

112
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,542
This is emergency services.

113
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:16,242
Are you calling about an accident or a crime?

114
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:19,443
Eri Kisaki, we're with the Victims Association.

115
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:27,943
Geez!

116
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:31,542
Your mom's going out.

117
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:33,443
Stay there and behave like a good cat.

118
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:39,442
It hurts...

119
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:42,542
Gosh. How could you let a woman beat you?

120
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:44,242
Sorry...

121
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,442
Hello? Is something wrong?

122
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:49,642
-Hello? -Sorry, prank call.

123
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,743
Hey!

124
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,042
Hey, what should we do with the unconscious secretary?

125
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,942
Who cares? Just leave her.

126
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:03,342
She didn't see our faces.

127
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:07,242
You're taking the lawyer's phone with you?

128
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:08,342
Yeah.

129
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:10,942
We're going to show her husband, Kogoro Mouri,

130
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:14,643
an embarrassing video of his wife.

131
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:31,943
Okay.

132
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,342
Bring the case with the lawyer upstairs.

133
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:36,542
Okay.

134
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:39,942
I'll head up there first and help set up for the shoot.

135
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:41,143
Got it.

136
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:54,642
She's bleeding?

137
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:57,443
Darn. I don't believe this.

138
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:02,542
What?

139
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,442
The suitcase is bleeding?

140
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:08,642
But we're ready to start filming!

141
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:11,842
Maybe she bit her tongue off.

142
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,042
Open the case and check its contents.

143
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:16,142
Hey.

144
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:17,342
Huh?

145
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:21,343
Tell him to be careful when he opens it.

146
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:24,943
Huh? Yeah, I know.

147
00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:32,942
Hey! What happened?

148
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:34,242
Answer me!

149
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:35,943
Hey! Hey!

150
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,743
My tomato juice plan worked.

151
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:51,543
It's no use. The shutter's too heavy.

152
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,443
Just as I thought, it's locked.

153
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:01,842
The windows are reinforced with wire.

154
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,743
I doubt I can break them.

155
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:09,742
Looks like I'll have to hide somewhere

156
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,842
in this abandoned building

157
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,943
until help arrives.

158
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:17,642
You idiot!

159
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:20,542
You mistook tomato juice for blood?

160
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,642
I told you to be careful when you opened it!

161
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:26,542
Sorry...

162
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,743
On top of that, she stole your phone.

163
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:32,842
If she escaped,

164
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:36,542
then we now have the opportunity to enjoy capturing her.

165
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:40,142
Now let's catch that escaped doe

166
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:43,243
and rip her skin off.

167
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:55,543
But where should I hide?

168
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,942
Come to think of it, the other day Ran said...

169
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:12,142
That's right.

170
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:17,142
The culprit hide a corpse inside a dresser in the zombie case.

171
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,643
What a surprise, right?

172
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:23,142
That trick involved using a cart

173
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:24,642
so the body wouldn't be found

174
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,243
even if the drawers were opened.

175
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:32,343
It should be good enough to hide in.

176
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:38,542
Hey, Attorney Kisaki.

177
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,242
Are you in here?

178
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:43,442
Hey, come on out.

179
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:46,842
Making this difficult isn't in your best interest.

180
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:47,943
Hey.

181
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,542
The drawers are sticking out a bit,

182
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,642
but I was able to hide.

183
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:57,442
Next I'll use this phone I stole from that man

184
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:58,742
to contact the police.

185
00:11:58,743 --> 00:11:59,743
"Incoming call, unknown caller"

186
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:03,742
Hey, are you calling your phone?

187
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:05,342
Huh? Yeah.

188
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:09,542
But looks like she silenced my phone.

189
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:13,142
What if she calls the police?

190
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,042
Don't worry.

191
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:19,142
She doesn't know where we are.

192
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:20,942
And if she makes the slightest sound

193
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:23,542
while explaining her situation,

194
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,442
that's when we'll catch her.

195
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:29,042
All right. We'll split up and look for her.

196
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:31,542
Let's not make any sound either.

197
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,342
If I can't call anyone, I'll have to e-mail them.

198
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:38,142
But I don't remember anyone's address.

199
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:42,143
I know. I remember Ran's messaging app username.

200
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:47,942
Crap!

201
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:52,042
She's talking to her daughter through a messaging app!

202
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:53,642
Seriously?

203
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:54,643
Look!

204
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:58,342
Darn it! We have to stop her!

205
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:01,242
Pretend to be the lawyer

206
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:04,242
and join the chat to confuse them.

207
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:07,442
In the meantime, we'll find her.

208
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:10,242
Okay. Got it.

209
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:13,142
Use the same icon she's using.

210
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,143
Got it.

211
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,642
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Darn it!

212
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:19,142
They changed from Eri's usual cat icon to no icon!

213
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,942
"No! I'm the real Eri!" "Shut up, impostor."

214
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,042
"You're the impostor."

215
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:23,842
"No, you are!"

216
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:26,142
Mom are multiplying?

217
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,742
Darn it.

218
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:31,743
Now we don't know which messages are coming from the real Eri.

219
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,508
"No, you are!"

220
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:45,008
What's going on?

221
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:48,208
It's my fault for turning it into a group chat.

222
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,008
A group chat?

223
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,508
But why isn't mom calling me?

224
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,708
Because she can't make any noise.

225
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,908
Huh?

226
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:01,108
She probably escaped from her kidnappers,

227
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:04,208
and is contacting us from wherever she's hiding.

228
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,808
Then end the group chat immediately.

229
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:08,708
If you ask them separately for her birthday or something,

230
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,308
we'll know who's the real Eri.

231
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,408
Okay.

232
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:15,408
No, I think it's better to leave it like this.

233
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:16,409
What?

234
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,208
But the bad guys can see our conversation.

235
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:25,908
But she doesn't know where she was taken, right?

236
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:30,008
Attorney Kisaki said she doesn't know where she is.

237
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:33,208
So wouldn't it be better to keep chatting with the bad guys

238
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:36,009
so they reveal themselves?

239
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,408
Attorney Kisaki's smart.

240
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:43,408
I doubt she'd say anything that would reveal her hiding place.

241
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:45,808
Yeah, but...

242
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:51,008
We don't even know if it's the real Eri who's claiming she was kidnapped!

243
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,208
We do.

244
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,308
-Huh? -What?

245
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,808
You can tell, Conan?

246
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,608
Attorney Kisaki is a lawyer, right?

247
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:00,808
Yeah.

248
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:04,808
Shinichi told me lawyers use Western commas

249
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:05,908
"Japanese Comma" -instead of Japanese commas

250
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:08,008
"Western Comma" -in their documents

251
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:10,908
when writing horizontally.

252
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:15,708
That habit shows up in their normal writing, too.

253
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:16,709
You're right.

254
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,808
"I have to be up early tomorrow." -The messages I received from Mom before

255
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,808
all have Western commas.

256
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:27,908
Then check the "I've been kidnapped" message you received first.

257
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:28,909
Okay.

258
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,108
It uses Western commas.

259
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:36,208
Darn it. So she really was kidnapped.

260
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:39,208
Okay. I'm going to call the police

261
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,908
and have them check her office.

262
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,108
Ran, stay here and keep chatting.

263
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,109
Okay.

264
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,508
Tell them you don't know who the real Eri is.

265
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,508
Make sure you use Western commas.

266
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,909
Got it.

267
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:58,208
Darn it!

268
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,708
We can't find her anywhere!

269
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,308
Where is she hiding?

270
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,908
Calm down.

271
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:10,008
She can't get out of the building.

272
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,308
She's a rat in a bag.

273
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:14,008
Yeah.

274
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,808
Hey, how are you doing? Are you confusing them?

275
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:21,009
Yeah, by pretending to be her.

276
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:24,208
Sure enough,

277
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:27,409
she can't tell who's who.

278
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:30,209
This is great.

279
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:33,108
"Ran Mouri: Which is it?" -Ran started using Western commas

280
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:35,008
in her messages.

281
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:38,409
Looks like she knows which messages are mine.

282
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:41,908
"Can you see anything?"

283
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,909
"Like the Toto Tower or the Metropolitan Government office building?"

284
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,208
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What are you asking her that for?

285
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,208
If she answers that,

286
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:56,708
the bad guys might figure out where she's hiding.

287
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:01,908
We don't even know if her hiding place has windows to the outside.

288
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,708
Yeah. That's why I doubt Attorney Kisaki will answer

289
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,709
but the bad guys might.

290
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:10,409
"I can see the government office building"

291
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,409
"but I can't see the Toto Tower." -She responded!

292
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,308
"I can see the government office building,"

293
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,408
"but I can't see the Toto Tower."

294
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:21,108
I see. So they're someplace where the Toto Tower is visible.

295
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,709
That's right.

296
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,508
It's nearly 5 pm.

297
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:30,608
Ran, tell her to call us immediately.

298
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:31,808
What?

299
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,608
But if she speaks, they'll know where she is...

300
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:37,209
She knows that!

301
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,208
"Can you call me now?"

302
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:45,509
Call?

303
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:53,108
They're calling.

304
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:55,008
"Incoming Call" -Darn it.

305
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:58,408
It's an IP number starting with 050.

306
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:00,208
Hello, Mom...

307
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,408
Attorney Kisaki, you don't have to say a word.

308
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:05,408
Just do as I say.

309
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:09,708
The bell of the church near the detective agency will ring soon.

310
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,008
If you can hear it from where you are,

311
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,508
could you tap your phone with your fingernail twice?

312
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,508
If you understand, tap your phone once.

313
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,709
Conan?

314
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,509
Okay. It should be ringing soon.

315
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,608
About three seconds.

316
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,208
What? What about three seconds?

317
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:41,708
Sound travels at about 340 meters per second,

318
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,608
and there's practically no wind today.

319
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:46,008
So Attorney Kisaki is probably in a place

320
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:49,909
about a kilometer from here from which the Toto Tower is visible.

321
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,208
Let's go!

322
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:54,409
Okay.

323
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,708
Conan...

324
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,208
He's just like Shinichi.

325
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:05,509
Come to think of it, this had happened a bunch of times.

326
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:09,408
Ran, what are you doing?

327
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,508
Let's go!

328
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:12,109
Coming.

329
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:19,909
Don't. I need to focus on rescuing Mom right now.

330
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,408
"Law Eri Kisaki"

331
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:25,908
Yes, that's right.

332
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,008
Yes.

333
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:30,808
Ms. Kuriyama just seems to have been knocked out with a stun gun.

334
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,508
She's fine otherwise.

335
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:35,908
I see... Got it.

336
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,508
By the way, Mouri, what are you doing?

337
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,709
You seem to be short of breath.

338
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:45,308
I'm heading to the place where Eri was taken!

339
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,408
What? You know where she is?

340
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:51,308
I'm panicked because I don't know!

341
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:55,208
It's okay, Mom! We're on our way!

342
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:58,309
Don't worry! Keep hiding!

343
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,008
What?

344
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:07,808
The lawyer and her daughter stopped chatting?

345
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:08,908
Is that true?

346
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,408
Yeah. My messages aren't showing as read.

347
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,608
Maybe she's using the phone she stole to call her daughter.

348
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,808
If the police figure out his number,

349
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,308
won't they be able to find us?

350
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:23,408
Don't worry.

351
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:26,608
I took the SIM cards out of our phones.

352
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:29,108
We can only make VoIP calls.

353
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,208
In other words,

354
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:35,108
they can't use cell towers to determine our location.

355
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:40,108
Besides, you removed the SIM card from her phone

356
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:42,008
and disabled the GPS, right?

357
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,108
Yeah.

358
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,208
More importantly,

359
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,708
apparently the daughter asked what she could see.

360
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,608
Did the lawyer answer her?

361
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,908
Uh, no.

362
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,608
Which means it's likely she's hiding in a closed space

363
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:59,108
where she can't see out any windows.

364
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:01,608
Focus your search on those kinds of places.

365
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,208
Got it.

366
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:08,008
So we need to search all the lockers and drawers in this building.

367
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:09,108
That's right.

368
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,509
I'll call you if we find her.

369
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,509
"Next Episode" -Attorney Kisaki, are you listening?

370
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:48,208
You got a message from Attorney Kisaki.

371
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,608
What? No way.

372
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,008
Let's see.

373
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,508
"The crab's only half-boiled,"

374
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:55,208
"but as a result the two swordfish look delicious."

375
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:58,908
"Since it's light out tonight, why don't we eat outside?"

376
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,508
Well, even if her daughter gets here,

377
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:06,509
we'll just capture her and skin her along with her mother.

378
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:12,709
