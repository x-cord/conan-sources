1
00:00:01,594 --> 00:00:03,394
In order to appear as guests on a travel program

2
00:00:03,394 --> 00:00:04,794
to be aired on Nichiuri TV,

3
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:07,394
we headed off to Hiroshima.

4
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:09,194
Strange things begin to happen

5
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:12,394
one after the other to the TV staff.

6
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:14,394
We get to know a woman, Yayoi

7
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:15,994
who works for a long established shop,

8
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:18,594
Misenya that is known for their special maple buns,

9
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:19,794
and find out about the legend of the 7 wonders

10
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:20,794
that is known in the Misen area,

11
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:23,794
and the connection it may have to the strange things that are happening.

12
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:25,594
Moreover, we find that

13
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:28,794
the suspicious man that had been asking around about the TV staff

14
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:32,194
seemed to be Yayoi's older brother, Shinroku.

15
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:34,894
Could there be any connection

16
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:36,594
between the accident that happened two years ago,

17
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:40,594
of the parents of Yayoi and her older brother falling to their deaths

18
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:43,594
from the Misen and the TV crew?

19
00:00:43,594 --> 00:00:46,494
Moreover, the director Mr. Koshiji is attacked

20
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:48,394
and Misenya catches fire.

21
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:52,394
Was Shinroku responsible for all this?

22
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:53,694
Or...

23
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,494
Brooding over passing seasons

24
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:16,594
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

25
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:18,294
The seven mysteries are solved.

26
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:20,394
At the end of the trip, an unexpected culprit is caught.

27
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:22,094
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:24,094
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:25,994
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:56,565
"Hiroshima, Miyajima 7 Wonders Tour (Hiroshima Edition)"

31
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,460
"Kenichi Miyamoto (55)" -I am Inspector Miyamoto

32
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,760
from the Hiroshima Prefectural Police.

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,460
How is Mr. Koshiji?

34
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,760
How's his condition?

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,160
He's unconscious and in critical condition.

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,760
-Oh, no. -How terrible.

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,560
I'm sure that guy's the culprit!

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,760
Right, Mr. Detective?

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,060
No, no decisive conclusion yet.

40
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,160
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,060
I've heard of your great reputation many times.

42
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,160
Hello.

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,460
As to the culprit

44
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,160
are referring to Mr. Shinroku Ayase at Misenya here?

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
What?

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,360
Excuse me, but you're Mr. Ayase's younger sister?

47
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
Do you remember seeing this?

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,660
This is... My older brother's!

49
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,760
It seems to have been found

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,560
at the site where Mr. Koshiji was attacked.

51
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,960
Am I right, sonny?

52
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Yep, that's right.

53
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,160
And, what was the cause of the fire?

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,260
Although it's not conclusive yet, the fire started

55
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,760
most likely by the boundary between the shop next door and here.

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,960
Since there was nothing to start the fire,

57
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,560
the possibility of arson is high.

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,260
Inspector!

59
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,660
When the fire broke out,

60
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,760
it seems that a person who resembles your older brother

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,660
was seen in the vicinity.

62
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,660
What?

63
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,160
Then, it's true...

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
That her older brother...

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
He attacked Mr. Koshiji,

66
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,860
and set fire to his own house?

67
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,060
No! It's a lie!

68
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,760
My older brother would do nothing like that!

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,460
Yayoi.

70
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,760
True.

71
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,060
If say, Shinroku were the culprit,

72
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,160
why would he set fire to his own house?

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,760
-What's up, sonny? -Huh?

74
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,460
Talking about fire...

75
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,060
could this be one of the 7 wonders,

76
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,960
inextinguishable fire, a symbol of it?

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,860
-True! -Another one of the seven wonders!

78
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,160
What's this about?

79
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
Well, I do think it's just a mere coincidence, but...

80
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,860
I see.

81
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,560
In other words, as to your parents' death,

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,460
at about the same time they got into an accident,

83
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,260
your older brother had his doubts about the TV crew that were here,

84
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,360
so taking advantage of the seven wonders.

85
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,860
I'm just stating a possibility.

86
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,060
But...

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,960
I confirmed with Yayoi a while ago,

88
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,560
her parents got into the accident the day after we left.

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,660
Which means that

90
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,660
Mr. Koshiji has nothing to do with the accident of her parents.

91
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,160
However, Shinroku who didn't know about this, misunderstood and...

92
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,960
Either way, we, the police need to know

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,560
the whereabouts of Mr. Shinroku Ayase as soon as possible, too.

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Where are you, Shinroku?

95
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,660
Although he's in hiding,

96
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,860
it can't be concluded that Shinroku is the culprit yet.

97
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,760
Somebody may be making it look that way,

98
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,560
so it could be that the culprit is among those people there too.

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,660
But, when Mr. Koshiji was attacked,

100
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,460
Mr. Hamada, Mr. Shimokura and Mr. Yatsukawa

101
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,460
were with us at the Ordination Platform.

102
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,760
Ms. Miyake was with Pops.

103
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,160
In the midst of the fire, Mr. Kitamura

104
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
called from his hotel, in Hiroshima.

105
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,860
It takes 10 minutes to Miyajimaguchi Station.

106
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,260
From there to Hiroshima Station where the hotel is,

107
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,160
it takes 25 minutes by train.

108
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,460
If he returned to the hotel after attacking Mr. Koshiji,

109
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,060
he wouldn't make it back in time.

110
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,960
Which means that the only one without an alibi is Mr. Kamisuwa.

111
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
Come to think of it, even back then...

112
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,860
Fire... He was there...

113
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,160
Bad news! Misenya's on fire!

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,860
What?

115
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,460
Fire, on that fire?

116
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,060
It seems he mistook fire to be something else.

117
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,360
Wait a sec.

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,760
Time wise there's no way

119
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
that Mr. Koshiji could've known about the fire.

120
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,660
In that case, the "kaji" blurted out by Mr. Koshiji was...

121
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,760
Could it be that...

122
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,060
"Misenya"

123
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,160
Sonny. Is this the picture you wanted?

124
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,860
Thank you very much.

125
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,160
I had one extra one left that I had printed.

126
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,160
The one that I had decorated in the shop burned.

127
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,660
Maybe the arsonist wasn't after Misenya, but rather...

128
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,660
"Atomic Bomb Dome"

129
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,460
The following day, we returned to Hiroshima,

130
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,560
and joined Mr. Kitamura who was resting at the hotel.

131
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you yesterday.

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,860
Are you okay?

133
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,160
Yes, totally recovered.

134
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,460
Do you have any idea who could've given you

135
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,860
the drink that gave you the stomachache?

136
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,060
You mean if it's symbolic of anything...

137
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,660
I heard about it a while ago, and was surprised.

138
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Talking of ideas...

139
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
All I ate was the lunch box that was brought to us on the site.

140
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,060
Maybe somebody put something inside it.

141
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,160
So, what should we do from now?

142
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,160
After what Mr. Koshiji went through,

143
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,460
maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...

144
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,260
What is it, try me.

145
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,560
I don't think a chance like this comes by often.

146
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,560
"Renown Detective of Gourmet Tour Solves the Case!"

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,660
I'm sure we'll get high viewer rating!

148
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,560
I agree.

149
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,260
-I'd hate to back off like this! -Right!

150
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,460
I'm sure that Mr. Koshiji is also vexed!

151
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,460
I'd to clear my name too. Please!

152
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,460
Okay, I'll tell the higher ups.

153
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,760
Yatsukawa, you take charge of directing in place of Koshiji.

154
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Yes, sir!

155
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,960
So, Mr. Mouri.

156
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,860
The contents of the plan may be a bit changed,

157
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,760
but we'd appreciate your cooperation.

158
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,960
You can count on me for things like that!

159
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
That's...

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,460
-All right! -Let's get to it!

161
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,660
We're counting on you, Mr. Hamada!

162
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,960
Will do!

163
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,660
Maybe...

164
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,360
Let's say that if Shinroku believed that

165
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,560
the TV staff who came here two years ago

166
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,660
had something to do with the death of his parents,

167
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,660
it's possible to think that he attacked the TV crew

168
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,260
taking advantage of the legend of the 7 wonders of Misen

169
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,960
where his parents' died!

170
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,960
But the people who came to Miyajima two years ago

171
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,560
are Mr. Koshiji, Mr. Kitamura and Ms. Miyake.

172
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,460
So, isn't it strange that salt would be inserted

173
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,860
in Mr. Yatsukawa's coffee, symbolizing the Ebb and Flow Rock,

174
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,060
despite he is not having been here?

175
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,860
That's true.

176
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,860
Well, it's probably because he's also a staff member.

177
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,460
You mean, he who hates Peter harms his dog?

178
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,660
Right! That's it!

179
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,460
Which means, I'm next in line as the culprit's target?

180
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,860
It could be me.

181
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
No matter who the culprit is,

182
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,860
it's for sure that he's going to do something

183
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,960
symbolized by the Dragon Fire Cedar of the 7 wonders!

184
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,560
We decided to visit Shinroku's friend who resides in Hiroshima.

185
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,260
Well, I haven't seen Shinroku

186
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,860
for more than half a year already, you see.

187
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,660
"Rainbow Arch Bridge" -After his parents' passed away,

188
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,360
Shinroku went bad,

189
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,860
and Yayoi who was going to a two year college in Osaka,

190
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,360
returned to Miyajima.

191
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,060
Is he really the culprit?

192
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,760
Come to think of it,

193
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,060
there was no condo.

194
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,460
Don't tell me that...

195
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,460
"Hiroshima Castle"

196
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,460
Shinroku?

197
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,560
I wonder, I have no idea either.

198
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,460
Hey, hey.

199
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,660
May I ask you something about 2 years ago?

200
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,260
Yep, about what?

201
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,960
I see. Just as I thought!

202
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,260
Shoots! Mr. Kamisuwa's gone!

203
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,060
Where is he? Where'd he go?

204
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,460
Yayoi?

205
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:15,627
Mr. Kamisuwa!

206
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,327
Yayoi?

207
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,227
Why...

208
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,627
A dragon pattern?

209
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:31,927
The last of the 7 wonders that's left.

210
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:34,027
This symbolizes the Dragon Fire Cedar?

211
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,927
Mr. Kamisuwa's cell phone.

212
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:41,527
Was he attacked from behind while he was on the phone?

213
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:46,327
Did you see the culprit?

214
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:48,827
No. When I got here,

215
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:51,927
Mr. Kamisuwa was already on the ground.

216
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,027
Then, what brought you here?

217
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:55,927
I got a call from someone

218
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:58,427
who said he was calling on behalf of my brother.

219
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,927
The person told me that my brother said

220
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,327
he wanted to tell only me about what really happened,

221
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:04,427
so for me to come to Hiroshima Castle.

222
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:07,427
Someone on behalf of your brother... Really?

223
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,427
-Huh? -Are you suspecting Yayoi?

224
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,227
If the motive of your older brother

225
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:13,827
was to avenge his parents' death,

226
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:17,127
the same would apply to you his younger sister as well.

227
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,127
Oh, no?

228
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,127
Next, it's me.

229
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:23,227
Mr. Kamisuwa who didn't come here together

230
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:25,927
with the staff two years ago was attacked too, so...

231
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:27,827
If the culprit is attacking at random,

232
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:31,427
we could be attacked again, too.

233
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,627
Are you saying that

234
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,427
I may not get away with plain salt the next time around?

235
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:37,327
Because the culprit's attacking at random, you see, at random!

236
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:39,427
Darn it! What a rat!

237
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:48,827
I'm not letting the culprit do as he pleases any further!

238
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:50,827
It's our turn next!

239
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,427
What?

240
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:57,427
Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa?

241
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:59,127
They passed away?

242
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:00,327
No joke?

243
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:03,827
We just got a call from the hospital.

244
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,827
Too bad.

245
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,927
Oh, no.

246
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:10,827
Was the killer that guy, Shinroku Ayase after all?

247
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:13,827
Yes. We got an arrest warrant for him just now.

248
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,627
That rat!

249
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,527
How dare he kill Mr. Kamisuwa too!

250
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:44,227
We have him in our custody.

251
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,927
It was just as Mr. Mouri had deduced!

252
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:50,027
He's the culprit!

253
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:52,327
-What? -Oh, no?

254
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:53,527
No way!

255
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:55,527
You...

256
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:02,227
Dad.

257
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:05,627
Well, I don't have the slightest idea what's going on either.

258
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:17,827
So, this is the much rumored Sleeping Kogoro!

259
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:19,127
Mr. Kitamura.

260
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:23,727
You're the culprit who caused all the incidents up to now!

261
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,827
You worked up an elaborate scheme,

262
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:27,627
which made it look as if Shinroku committed

263
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:30,627
the series of incidents involving the 7 wonders

264
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:33,427
in order to avenge the death of his parents.

265
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:36,827
Your purpose for doing what you did

266
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:39,327
was to kill the director Mr. Naoto Koshiji!

267
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:40,727
What?

268
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:42,727
What do you mean?

269
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:44,527
Let me explain.

270
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:47,327
First of all, what gave you the idea of

271
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,227
putting the blame on Shinroku?

272
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:53,227
It was because Mr. Kitamura, you were responsible

273
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:56,627
for his parents falling to their death!

274
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:57,727
No joke?

275
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:58,927
In autumn, two years ago,

276
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,327
after you finished the interview,

277
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,427
you alone decided to stay back in Miyajima

278
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:05,227
because your hobby was walking through the mountains.

279
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:07,127
I heard about it from Conan.

280
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:09,727
Isn't that right, Ms. Miyake?

281
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,527
-Yes. -When you climbed Misen,

282
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:15,427
you entered the off limits area

283
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:19,527
and the parents of Shinroku and Yayoi cautioned you for being there.

284
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:22,127
I don't know what happened there

285
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:25,727
but as a result, their parents fell to their deaths.

286
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:31,827
Shinroku searched the site and found an accessory

287
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:33,627
that turned out to be

288
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:36,927
the mascot on the zipper of the jacket you were wearing.

289
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:41,627
It's the same as the one you have on your bag right now!

290
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:43,327
Conan!

291
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:45,427
Yes!

292
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:46,927
Here you go.

293
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,427
The zipper of Mr. Koshiji's jacket...

294
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,627
Really! It's the same thing!

295
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:55,327
Back then, two years ago,

296
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:58,927
Mr. Koshiji happened to borrow your jacket and was wearing it.

297
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:01,627
I think he said, he had a slight cold and was a bit cold,

298
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,127
so he wanted to borrow it.

299
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,127
Shinroku found the zipper mascot

300
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:08,027
at the site where his parents fell to the death.

301
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:11,327
Mr. Kitamura, you're the one who dropped it, aren't you?

302
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:13,627
What on earth happened back then?

303
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:15,427
It... It was an accident!

304
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:18,527
We got into a slight argument and it happened...

305
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:21,127
I didn't think something like that was going to happen!

306
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,227
Let's have the police thoroughly check out

307
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:25,627
what really happened then.

308
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:30,127
Shinroku realized the meaning of the thing that he found,

309
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,727
only two weeks ago,

310
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:35,727
after seeing the photo taken two years ago that

311
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:39,327
the owner of the souvenir shop had decorated in a picture frame in his shop.

312
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:42,027
That's why Shinroku mistakenly thought that

313
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:45,627
Mr. Koshiji was involved with the death of his parents.

314
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:46,627
Right.

315
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:51,027
So, Shinroku went to Tokyo to confirm the truth of the matter.

316
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:54,227
Isn't that right, Shinroku?

317
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:56,827
Yes, sir. Exactly.

318
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,127
I went to Tokyo

319
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,827
and started to investigate the surroundings of

320
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:04,527
the director called Mr. Koshiji.

321
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:05,927
Then, I was told,

322
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:09,927
"I'll take you to see him. You can count on me."

323
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:13,427
Mr. Kitamura approached you.

324
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:14,427
Yes, sir.

325
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:15,927
You called Shinroku over to Hiroshima

326
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:17,727
when the crew came to film the program,

327
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:20,927
and confined him to this room all the while.

328
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,927
Then you attacked Mr. Koshiji taking advantage of the 7 wonders.

329
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:27,127
You also burned the photos that would serve as evidence

330
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:30,727
after disguising yourself as Shinroku, Mr. Kitamura.

331
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:32,127
Well, but...

332
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:35,327
Mr. Kitamura had an alibi, didn't he?

333
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:37,627
Mr. Kamisuwa called this hotel

334
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,727
and confirmed that he was sleeping,

335
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:43,027
and at the time of the fire, Mr. Kitamura himself called.

336
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:45,927
The person that the hotel maid saw sleeping in bed

337
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:49,227
when she checked the room

338
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,427
was actually Shinroku who was sleeping

339
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,327
under the influence of sleeping pills.

340
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,927
After shaving and matching the hairstyle,

341
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:58,727
it would be hard to correctly identify the person

342
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:01,227
even if the police were to confirm how he looks later.

343
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:05,127
In the meantime, Mr. Kamisuwa saw through Mr. Kitamura's trick.

344
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:08,327
The condo's not there.

345
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:14,327
Yes, he realized that the condo that is in view from this window

346
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,727
was not displayed on the screen of the telephone TV.

347
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,327
I confirmed what was going on.

348
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,027
Yes, true.

349
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:26,227
Near the Miyajimaguchi arrival and departure port of the ferry...

350
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:29,227
another chain of our hotel is there.

351
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,927
The interior is exactly the same as it is here.

352
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,827
The hotel was used as a stand-in.

353
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:37,427
He crossed the sea with the ferry,

354
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:40,127
checked in at the hotel that was nearby,

355
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:42,227
called Mr. Kamisuwa from there

356
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:44,727
and established an alibi.

357
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:49,527
But there was only one difference between the two guest rooms.

358
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,527
It's the color of the curtains!

359
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:53,327
The ones here are sky blue,

360
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,027
but the ones at Miyajimaguchi are peppermint green.

361
00:18:56,027 --> 00:18:59,127
That's why he couldn't close the curtains.

362
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,727
But because of the difference in the night scenery,

363
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:04,427
Mr. Kamisuwa realized this.

364
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,327
So...

365
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:09,327
Hello. Is this the Red Leaf Hotel?

366
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:15,127
You broke the cell phone

367
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:17,527
because you wanted to hide the fact that

368
00:19:17,527 --> 00:19:19,927
Mr. Kamisuwa called the hotel.

369
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,327
You were also thinking of putting the blame on Yayoi

370
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,927
who you called simultaneously, if you could possibly could.

371
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:27,727
What?

372
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:30,727
There seems to have been rumors from before

373
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:33,527
that someone was running an illegal casino.

374
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:37,527
Isn't that someone you, Mr. Kitamura?

375
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,127
Those words that Mr. Koshiji mentioned...

376
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:44,627
Kaji (Fire)... ita (He was there)...

377
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:46,727
He actually wanted to say,

378
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,327
"Casino... Kitamura was there"!

379
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:52,927
Mr. Koshiji knew what you were doing behind the scenes.

380
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:56,727
Didn't he try to convince you to turn yourself in?

381
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,827
But you went off and told Mr. Kamisuwa that

382
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:01,927
you thought Mr. Koshiji was doing something suspicious.

383
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:03,527
That's why during the shooting,

384
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:07,327
Mr. Kamisuwa and Mr. Koshiji were both acting awkwardly.

385
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:10,927
Weren't you also planning to frame Mr. Koshiji who had been killed

386
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:14,927
as the one who was running the illegal casino?

387
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:19,527
I started the casino just for fun at the beginning.

388
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:21,727
But I got stuck in it over time

389
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:25,427
and by the time, I realized what was going on, I couldn't quit!

390
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:27,427
I had no other choice!

391
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,827
Because you had no choice,

392
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,427
you attacked Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa,

393
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:33,527
then tried to put the blame on Shinroku

394
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,827
and tried to get rid of him too?

395
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:38,027
What makes you think that such a selfish justification

396
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:40,627
is going to get you through?

397
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,427
That's right, I forgot to mention that

398
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:59,827
Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa are not dead.

399
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,727
-What? -What?

400
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,827
We got word from the hospital that they got better

401
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:07,427
and that they've overcome the critical moment.

402
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:10,027
It was all done under my orders.

403
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:13,527
I apologize for ending up in somehow deceiving all of you.

404
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:15,127
But I thought that by doing this,

405
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,027
the real culprit would relax

406
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:21,027
and go on to try to get rid of Shinroku.

407
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:50,127
Later, Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa's wounds

408
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:52,227
were well on their way to recovery.

409
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:54,827
Shinroku also returned to stay with Yayoi

410
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:56,827
and they were safely reunited joyously.

411
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:05,027
It's hot!

412
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:06,127
Delicious!

413
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:09,227
Hiroshima Okonomiyaki is the best!

414
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:13,427
The beer is just great, too!

415
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,527
A second serving, please!

416
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,327
But, what's going to happen about putting the program on air?

417
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:22,627
Hey, hey. We're in trouble if they don't air it.

418
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:24,227
I mean, this is the first time

419
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:26,727
I'll get to see the fantastic deduction I made with my own eyes, you see.

420
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:29,227
True, because it's a fact that you're always asleep,

421
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:31,927
Sir Sleeping Kogoro.

422
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:34,627
By the way, I wonder what's up with Sonoko?

423
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:37,927
Speak of the devil.

424
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:40,327
Sonoko! What on earth...

425
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:42,227
Just what's taking you so long, Ran?

426
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:44,027
Hurry and come over here.

427
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:46,027
It really feels good this island!

428
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:47,627
Island?

429
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:51,627
Really, it's really great here in Miyakojima!

430
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:55,527
You made a mistake and went to Miyakojima.

431
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:57,327
Okay, cut!

432
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:01,727
"Next Episode" -I hear that the program that kiddies like

433
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:05,727
Kamen Yaiba Show is produced here too.

434
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,627
I went to see it last week, too.

435
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:17,627
The back of the corpse is wet.

436
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:20,127
It wasn't raining anymore and yet, why?

437
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,227
This is probably a case of homicide

438
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,127
made to look like suicide!

439
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:29,527
Next Conan, "Alibi of a Fall"

440
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:47,427
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:49,427
"Fountain Pen"

442
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:50,727
Are you still drinking?

443
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,427
Just one more last drink!

444
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:54,727
-Let's go already, Ran. -Let's.
