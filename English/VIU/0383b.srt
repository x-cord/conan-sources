1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:02,969
Bottom of the 2nd inning, Konan High School batting,

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,369
Nagashima in the batter's box.

3
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:08,669
Pitcher Inao is on the mound.

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:09,769
Here it comes!

5
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,169
He hit towards third base.

6
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:22,069
It's a long ball.

7
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,369
Fast! The one who hit the ball is fast.

8
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,669
The left fielder sure is taking his time.

9
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:29,169
I think the runner's going to make it to third base, don't you?

10
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:31,269
Go! Go!

11
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,669
Left! Left! Just what do you think you're doing?

12
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:43,769
Nagashima rounds second and heads for third.

13
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:46,169
The left fielder throws it to the infiled, a fast one to third base.

14
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,969
It's a good throw.

15
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:54,369
Nagashima is almost to third, he dives.

16
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,269
The third baseman catches...

17
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,169
-Safe! -Safe!

18
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,769
The fleet-footed Nagashima gets a three base hit.

19
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:08,569
No out third base.

20
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,469
I guess them scoring a point can't be helped.

21
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,869
No, you can't tell yet.

22
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:16,769
That pitcher sure got guts.

23
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,269
It's the first round of the spring preliminaries

24
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,469
We are now in the 18th inning of overtime.

25
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,369
This match between Teitou High School and Ohgane High School

26
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,469
has had its share of ups and downs.

27
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,669
At the bottom of the 18th with two outs,

28
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:38,169
Teitou High School is hitting with a runner on first.

29
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:41,169
In the batter's box is number four, Yamamoto.

30
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:49,669
Inao faces off against Yamamoto.

31
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:51,269
Here's the pitch.

32
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,269
A cell phone?

33
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,069
Was it there from before?

34
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:17,869
Maybe the man who passed by here a while ago dropped it.

35
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:18,969
Let me see.

36
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,569
Hello? Are you the one who dropped this cell phone?

37
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:26,869
Yes.

38
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:29,269
Then come to the right stand.

39
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:31,869
Having fun?

40
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:32,969
What?

41
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:42,869
I'm asking you if this place is such an enjoyable place?

42
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,469
Who are you?

43
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:49,169
If it's okay with you, let's play an even more enjoyable game.

44
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,269
It's way more fun

45
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,169
-than this baseball game. -Strike!

46
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,769
An exchange of lives that will make your blood stir.

47
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:02,569
Well, it is an exchange of lives, but the one who's going to die is me.

48
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:08,069
You idiot! If you want to die, go and die on your own.

49
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,369
Yes, I'll do that.

50
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:13,869
But I can't die alone.

51
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:17,469
Being alone is much too lonely.

52
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,969
What?

53
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:21,369
The rule is simple.

54
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:25,969
Each time the third, sixth, and ninth innings end,

55
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:29,369
I'll call the cell phone that I've left somewhere on this baseball ground.

56
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,569
Ball!

57
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,769
I will ring my cell phone that will be the clue to where I am.

58
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,569
I will be near the phone that will ring after the game ends.

59
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:52,469
Strike!

60
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,769
I will ring only three times.

61
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,569
If you don't answer by then,

62
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,569
it's three out and game set.

63
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,869
Of course if you gather all the cell phones

64
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,469
before they ring and find me before the game ends,

65
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,469
it's your win.

66
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:12,269
Hey, you got to be kidding. Cut out your stupid talk!

67
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,269
I'm hanging up.

68
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:16,469
You'll find out whether I'm kidding or not

69
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:20,069
after the end of the bottom of the second inning.

70
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,569
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

71
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:28,869
So your first clue is written in the mail of the cell phone.

72
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,669
Yes, tell that to the police detective sitting next to you

73
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,669
that I'm looking forward to seeing him, too.

74
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:38,369
Okay, then. I'll talk to you later.

75
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:39,669
Wait up.

76
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,469
At least tell me your name.

77
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:47,069
Me? I'm...

78
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:52,069
The Demon of Koshien.

79
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,569
You can call me that.

80
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,969
-The Demon of Koshien? -The Demon of Koshien?

81
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,569
Hey, you!

82
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,769
Strike! Batter out!

83
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,069
-Okay! -Okay!

84
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,969
Is the bottom of the second inning finished?

85
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,869
It's still one out.

86
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,969
What's with you, Heiji? Aren't you watching the game?

87
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:34,269
The strike out ball just now was a very fast ball.

88
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:36,069
I found it!

89
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,269
This is it.

90
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:40,269
96, 7, 13.

91
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:41,969
What's that?

92
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:47,969
The telephone number of the whereabouts of the owner of this telephone.

93
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,969
What's that? Why doesn't he come get it himself?

94
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:53,869
I wonder what it is though?

95
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:56,869
96, 7, 13.

96
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:59,469
It doesn't seem like a seat number.

97
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:00,969
Could it be some kind of code again?

98
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,369
Enough of codes!

99
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,269
Thanks to an odd code,

100
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:09,569
we ended up not being able to go to Takarazuka.

101
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:15,469
If it's 8, 1 and 2, it's the Alps stand.

102
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:17,469
-Alps stand? -Alps stand?

103
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,969
Why?

104
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:26,669
Because 8 (hachi), 1 (ichi) and 2 (ni) is pronounced as "Heidi".

105
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:31,669
And Heidi is connected with the Alps, right?

106
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,769
So lame.

107
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,869
Please, Dad.

108
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:42,769
Oh, well.

109
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,669
Mr. Ohtaki, please help us find him.

110
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:50,669
But this is the best part.

111
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,269
Don't worry. We'll be done right away

112
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:55,969
if you come with us, Mr. Ohtaki.

113
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,569
Are you going too, Conan?

114
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,169
Because it sounds like fun.

115
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:06,369
Well, don't worry. We'll give it to the owner

116
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,269
and come right back.

117
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:14,569
What's with him?

118
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,569
He's the one who wanted to come here with us.

119
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:18,969
Seriously.

120
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:43,169
What? Suicide?

121
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:46,269
Really? Heiji?

122
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,269
Yes! He saying that if we don't find it

123
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,969
before the end of the game, he's going to die.

124
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:54,169
He says he'll kill someone along with himself, too.

125
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,469
But maybe it's just a prank.

126
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,169
I think it's most likely not a prank.

127
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,969
The one who called didn't change his voice,

128
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:08,969
and the manufacture number seal was pasted on the cell phone, too.

129
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:12,069
It means that he doesn't mind his identity being revealed later, right?

130
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,369
Moreover, he's doing something like this

131
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,069
knowing that you're an inspector, Mr. Ohtaki,

132
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,069
which means that this man must really be desperate.

133
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,569
At any rate, please use your police badge, Mr. Ohtaki.

134
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,069
And let us in behind the back net.

135
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:31,769
What? Why behind the back net?

136
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:35,669
On the phone a while ago, I heard the referee call out strike.

137
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,369
He could still be there.

138
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:39,369
Right.

139
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:46,369
No.

140
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,769
Oh, no. Heiji,

141
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,969
he's not going to die until the game ends, right?

142
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:55,269
The man says he'll show proof after the bottom of the second inning.

143
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,869
What?

144
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,069
We're going in, Mr. Ohtaki.

145
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:09,069
If the cheers that we heard just now was for the third out...

146
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:11,069
Maybe he's already done something.

147
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,769
No good. Just as I thought.

148
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,869
The bottom of the second inning is over.

149
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,369
You go down.

150
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:30,769
I'll go up. Mr. Ohtaki, please search the center.

151
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,569
He's a suspicious looking man wearing a cap.

152
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:33,869
Okay.

153
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:01,569
Darn it! He's not here after all.

154
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:10,469
But nothing is happening.

155
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,969
Nothing.

156
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,918
The third inning, batter for Ohgane High School

157
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:26,618
is number nine. Right fielder, Seki.

158
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:29,518
Sakuraba, with the pitch.

159
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:30,818
Here it is.

160
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:32,318
Hit!

161
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:34,318
Straight down the third baseline, the third baseman picks it up.

162
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:37,518
And a fast one to first!

163
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:38,618
And he's...

164
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:43,818
Out!

165
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:58,318
A picture-perfect play by Konan High School's third baseman, Nagashima.

166
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:02,118
Seki makes one out here at the top of the third for Ohgane High School.

167
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:12,818
Hey, Heiji.

168
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,618
What's going on?

169
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:16,918
There's nothing happened, right?

170
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,618
Strange.

171
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:21,618
The guy who called said that he'd show evidence

172
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:23,718
after the bottom of the second inning ends.

173
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,018
Maybe it's a prank after all?

174
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:31,818
Who'd do a thing like that at the finals of Koshien?

175
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:33,218
Hey.

176
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:34,418
I wonder what that is?

177
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,718
There. On the other side of the freeway.

178
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:42,018
What is it?

179
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:44,618
Smoke is rising.

180
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:46,718
It looks like fire.

181
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:50,118
It seems to be around Tekiryokumachi.

182
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:52,518
Mr. Ohtaki, you once told me

183
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:54,518
that you have a superior working at the Hyogo Prefectural Police, right?

184
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:56,518
Yes.

185
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,818
Won't you please call and ask him?

186
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,018
Okay.

187
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,118
What?

188
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:24,318
A bomb?

189
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:26,318
Is that true, Mr. Kazuhisa?

190
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:28,918
As for the details, I can't say for sure

191
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:31,918
until I see the report of the fire-fighters after they put out the fire,

192
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,618
but it seems to be so.

193
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:37,618
A company called Takano Transport seems to have caught fire.

194
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:40,918
According to what the neighbours are saying,

195
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:45,118
before that place caught fire, a loud boom seems to have been heard.

196
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:46,818
I see.

197
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:49,718
Fortunately, that company was off today.

198
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:53,318
So there seems to have been no casualties.

199
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:56,618
They think a bomb went off because the sound

200
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:59,318
came from a building that was supposedly empty.

201
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:02,318
And do you know when the building caught fire?

202
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:03,918
Well...

203
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,518
Hey, Numata.

204
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,718
Yes, sir?

205
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:09,718
You know that fire that's being put out now?

206
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:12,918
Do you know what time it started?

207
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:17,318
I think it was about 2:40 in the afternoon?

208
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,418
Just around when...

209
00:13:19,718 --> 00:13:22,118
Around when the bottom of the second inning ended.

210
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,818
This looks bad, Hattori.

211
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:28,118
If the evidence that the guy warned us about over the phone

212
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:30,418
was that explosion that caused the fire,

213
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:31,618
maybe the way he's going to commit suicide is...

214
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:33,318
Moron.

215
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:37,018
If he commits suicide with a bomb in a place like this with so many people,

216
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:38,918
it would cause a grave disaster!

217
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:55,218
Hey, Ohtaki.

218
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:58,918
Come to think of it, aren't you at Koshien today?

219
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,818
How do you know about the fire?

220
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:02,618
Oh, well...

221
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:04,518
Heiji, what do you want to do?

222
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:06,818
Do you want to tell the police about this?

223
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:07,918
No!

224
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:09,518
The guy who called is saying

225
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:12,318
that he's going to commit suicide when the ball game ends.

226
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,218
We don't want to start a useless commotion here and end the game.

227
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,218
Because the minute it ends, we will all be blown up.

228
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:20,518
I think it would be better to listen to what the man has to say for now

229
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:22,618
and solve the codes one after the other.

230
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:25,518
Trace the three cell phones

231
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:28,918
and arrest the man.

232
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,618
Either way, we'll have to solve the codes

233
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,418
before the bottom of the third inning ends

234
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:35,618
and find the first cell phone

235
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:39,118
that is hidden somewhere in the stands of Koshien,

236
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:41,318
or we're finished.

237
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:54,918
The top of the third inning,

238
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:56,518
one out and runners on first and second base.

239
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:59,118
There is a map of the stands

240
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:02,218
right behind the back net of gate number eight here.

241
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,618
I guess I'll go outside,

242
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:06,518
look at the map, and use my head and decipher the code.

243
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:11,018
The meaning of these numbers 96, 7, 13!

244
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:17,018
I'll go borrow the radio from Pops then.

245
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:19,618
We need to know how the game is progressing, or we'll be in trouble, right?

246
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,518
Do so, will you?

247
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,318
Position number three, Pitcher Inao.

248
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,718
All right! Clean up time.

249
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:37,118
I guess this game is going to be a long one.

250
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:38,418
Let's go, Heiji.

251
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:39,718
Okay.

252
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:29,047
-Ball! -Ball!

253
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:33,647
It's clean up, but the pitcher is not quite in control of the ball.

254
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,947
If the runner gets to walk, then it'll be one out with the bases loaded.

255
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:45,647
And then comes the fourth batter.

256
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:49,947
Heiji and the others sure are late.

257
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:53,747
Maybe they can't find the owner of the cell phone yet.

258
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:57,447
If so, why don't give up already and hurry on come back here?

259
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:01,447
The man who dropped it is to blame, and not us.

260
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:02,747
True.

261
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:03,847
Don't worry!

262
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:08,847
We'll find that man for sure,

263
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:10,447
so wait a while longer.

264
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,747
Conan.

265
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:16,747
Pops, will you please lend me your radio?

266
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,147
Huh?

267
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,747
Searching for that man,

268
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,247
we won't be able to tell how the game is progressing.

269
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,747
Okay? You'll lend it to me, right?

270
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,347
Gosh.

271
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,447
Don't break it.

272
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,247
Here you go.

273
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:33,147
Thank you.

274
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:36,447
And if you see a suspicious man wearing a white cap,

275
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:38,947
call Heiji on the cell phone, okay?

276
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:41,447
Hey, Conan!

277
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,547
They look so much alike.

278
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,447
Conan's face just now...

279
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:53,947
looked so much like him back then.

280
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,247
He hit the ball! This is a big one!

281
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,947
Right back! Right back!

282
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,747
What? It's coming this way!

283
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:05,247
I think the ball will make it.

284
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:08,047
Thrust forward by the beach wind, the ball flies into the right stand...

285
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:11,647
He caught the ball!

286
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,347
The runner on second base starts!

287
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:15,147
The ball goes pass second base.

288
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:16,847
-Safe! -Safe!

289
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,847
From that fly ball to the right field to touch up

290
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,247
makes for two outs with runners on first and third base.

291
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,047
Although the hit looked to be a homerun,

292
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:25,347
the ball was blocked by the beach wind

293
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:27,247
and both wings spreading out wide over this vast Koshien of 96 meters!

294
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:35,747
Both wings are 96 meters?

295
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:42,147
96, 7, 13.

296
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:45,447
Where is it? Where is it?

297
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:49,447
I'm sure that it's indicating the seats somewhere here.

298
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,647
Heiji, we'd better hurry or we'll run out of time.

299
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,747
Darn it.

300
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:55,947
Where is it?

301
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:03,047
Heiji!

302
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:05,147
I borrowed the radio!

303
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:06,647
How's the game going?

304
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,747
The top of the third inning just finished,

305
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,947
and the score's still zero-zero.

306
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,447
Three outs left.

307
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:16,947
Hey. Do you know that is there such a wing in this ball field?

308
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,147
Wing?

309
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:20,347
Because I heard them say,

310
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:24,047
Koshien have both wings with 96 meters on the radio.

311
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:34,347
You really don't know a thing about baseball, do you?

312
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,747
Well, they don't say both wings in other games

313
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,247
so I guess it can't be helped, but...

314
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:41,147
Kid, both wings with 96 meters

315
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:45,147
means that the distance from the home base to the pole is 96 meters.

316
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,647
Don't tell me that the first 96 code

317
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:55,347
means the seats by the end of the pole?

318
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:57,347
But which way, Heiji?

319
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,447
There are poles on both sides, the right and left.

320
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:05,747
Then maybe the next number seven in parenthesis means something?

321
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,147
-Seven... -Seven...

322
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,147
Hey, this looks bad!

323
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,747
It's three balls three strikes and one out!

324
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:19,047
Kid, turn your back on me!

325
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:20,147
Huh?

326
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:21,847
Like this?

327
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,147
I see!

328
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:24,347
You see what, Heiji?

329
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:29,147
The number of the outfit the boy's wearing is 55, not 7.

330
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:31,147
Right the number on the back of the outfit!

331
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,347
In high school baseball, where is the player wearing number seven?

332
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,947
Number seven is left field.

333
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,847
Which means, Heiji...

334
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:42,847
In other words, it's the seat at the end of the left pole!

335
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:46,147
Then, what about the last 13?

336
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:49,047
Probably the seat on the 13th aisle!

337
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,247
The first cell phone is there!

338
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:58,347
It's the bottom of the third inning. The two batters of Konan High School

339
00:20:58,347 --> 00:21:00,647
struck out three times in a row and now with two outs.

340
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:04,147
The next batter is number one left, Iwata.

341
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:08,747
The pitcher flings his arms high in order to throw his first ball.

342
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,547
Strike!

343
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,847
Straight in high.

344
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:18,147
The pitcher throws his second ball in good rhythm.

345
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:19,447
Strike two.

346
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,347
Outlaw, another straight!

347
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:28,147
27, 26, 25.

348
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:29,247
The pitcher flings up his arms.

349
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:33,147
21, 20, 19.

350
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:34,647
The third pitch...

351
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:36,447
15, 14.

352
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:37,447
He has thrown the ball!

353
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:38,647
13!

354
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:39,647
Over here!

355
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:44,247
Strike three!

356
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:50,347
Don't answer it! Give it to me!

357
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,847
Hello? Hello?

358
00:21:56,247 --> 00:22:00,147
Hey, you! What's so funny?

359
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:01,547
It's really interesting.

360
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:04,647
You kids sure are interesting.

361
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:08,447
Hang in there a while longer and entertain me, will you?

362
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:14,247
I love to see people making futile effort.

363
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:15,847
Hold it, you!

364
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:18,747
Hey! Hello? Hello?

365
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:20,647
Darn it! He hung up.

366
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:22,147
Hey, look!

367
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:25,147
The next code is on the display.

368
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:29,647
47, 3 and 4.

369
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:33,247
47, 3 and 4.

370
00:22:38,147 --> 00:22:41,947
Yes, futile effort.

371
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:46,947
There is no such thing as a victory

372
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:49,347
that can be won through effort.

373
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:53,347
It doesn't exist.
