"Cafe Poirot - Closed"

3
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:09,116
Good morning!

4
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:10,816
Good morning.

5
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:13,016
Good morning, Mr. Mouri.

6
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:15,616
But we're not open yet.

7
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:18,916
Well, it smells so good.

8
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:24,216
We're serving meatballs and cabbage stewed in milk and tomato this morning.

9
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:26,216
Looks good.

10
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:28,816
I'll have the morning special.

11
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:29,817
Gosh.

12
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:31,416
Sorry.

13
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,916
Come in.

14
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:34,716
What will you have, Ran?

15
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:36,916
I'll have the morning special, too.

16
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,017
What do you want?

17
00:00:39,117 --> 00:00:40,316
Me, too!

18
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:41,816
Roger that.

19
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:43,817
"Cafe Poirot - Open"

20
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:49,016
What? Has there always been a refrigerator here?

21
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:52,216
Yeah, since about a month ago.

22
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:54,916
It's a cake fridge.

23
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:57,316
"Poirot's Special Cake" -Oh, that cake?

24
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,216
Ran, have you had it?

25
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:01,817
"Tokyo Summit Starting Soon" -Yeah. It's really good.

26
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:07,217
After all, it's Amuro's special cake.

27
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:12,016
What? You use an electric kettle?

28
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:15,616
Yeah. Our water heater's old.

29
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,116
It takes forever to boil water first thing in the morning.

30
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:22,416
If I turn this on with my phone when I leave the house,

31
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,916
it's boiling right around now.

32
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:28,316
With your phone? So it's an IoT appliance.

33
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,016
IoT appliance?

34
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:34,816
They're electrical appliances that can connect to the internet.

35
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:37,216
Like that electric kettle.

36
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:38,416
-Really? -Really?

37
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,216
Now let's see.

38
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:41,617
Again.

39
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,617
What is it? What happened?

40
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:49,316
You don't need to shout.

41
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:53,016
But they melted again. Why?

42
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:56,016
There was nothing wrong when you made them last night.

43
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,616
Again? This isn't the first time?

44
00:01:58,617 --> 00:01:59,817
-Yeah. -Yeah.

45
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:05,516
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

46
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:07,516
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

47
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:11,816
Amuro's new special cakes face trouble first thing in the morning!

48
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,516
He sees through the one and only truth.

49
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,716
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

50
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:18,417
His name is Detective Conan!

51
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:03,595
"The Melting Cake!"

52
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:18,795
Here, Dad.

53
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:23,194
I said I didn't want any.

54
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:27,395
Why are we having cake first thing in the morning?

55
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,095
It's good!

56
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:35,394
You can really taste the egg.

57
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:38,294
I use more than usual.

58
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:41,394
It tastes as good as ever.

59
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,394
But with them looking like this,

60
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:46,294
we can't serve these to our regular customers.

61
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,294
Why did they fall apart?

62
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:50,894
Maybe they were made wrong.

63
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:52,394
Dad.

64
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,594
If it happened twice, it could happen a third time.

65
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,394
Dad!

66
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:59,994
You might be right.

67
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,794
Unless we can figure out why this is happening.

68
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:03,094
Yes.

69
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,595
We should come up with some way to solve this.

70
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,894
"Agasa" -Yes, we're at the Dr. Agasa's house right now.

71
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,794
You should come, too.

72
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:19,895
We're flying the drone the Dr. Agasa made.

73
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,894
"Stand by" -Apparently it flies really high.

74
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:26,195
Dr. Agasa, hurry.

75
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,395
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

76
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,195
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

77
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:53,594
What was that about?

78
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:55,794
How does this thing work?

79
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:58,294
What happened, Mitsuhiko?

80
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:02,494
The drone started flying on its own!

81
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,594
No one touched the controller.

82
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:08,794
It flew without anyone touching the controller?

83
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:11,995
Hey... What is this?

84
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:16,994
I told you not to fly it without me.

85
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,594
We didn't.

86
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:21,395
We didn't touch the controller.

87
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:27,694
I just made this too.

88
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:29,994
It'll take time to fix that.

89
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,194
-What? -What?

90
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,694
But what about today?

91
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,394
Don't count on it.

92
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,494
It won't be able to fly today.

93
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,994
-No way. -No way.

94
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:41,594
Anyway, the flight's been canceled.

95
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,694
Where are you, Conan?

96
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,594
I'm at Cafe Poirot.

97
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:46,894
What?

98
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:50,194
Cafe Poirot has this really yummy cake lately.

99
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:52,094
We were just talking about that cake.

100
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,594
It's not fair that you're the only one who gets cake, Conan!

101
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:57,194
Then we'll go get some cake too!

102
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:58,195
-Yeah! -Yeah!

103
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:00,994
But the cake is...

104
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:02,095
What?

105
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:06,394
Haibara, come with us.

106
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:08,194
I'll pass.

107
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,194
I need to help the Dr. Agasa.

108
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,194
"Beika Electric" -What?

109
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:14,194
"Sorry. Poirot's special cake is sold out today." -There's no cake?

110
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:17,294
You should've said so earlier.

111
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:20,094
I was trying to when you hung up.

112
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:22,994
But I was so excited.

113
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:24,494
Sorry.

114
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:27,794
The electrician's fixing it right now.

115
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,194
It should be fine tomorrow.

116
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,694
I examined the refrigerator

117
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:34,394
and there's nothing wrong with it.

118
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,594
What?

119
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:38,694
Then why are the cakes falling apart?

120
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:40,095
I don't know.

121
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,594
Maybe...

122
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:48,595
Hold on! What's gotten into you, Ayumi?

123
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,994
Look at these cakes.

124
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:55,994
They look like the cake before it melts, don't they?

125
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:59,894
Are these cakes copies of Amuro's?

126
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,794
Keep your voice down.

127
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,794
It is suspicious, though.

128
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:05,994
Hey, guys.

129
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:08,294
"Luxurious Extra Cream Cake" -How much do you have on you right now?

130
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:09,594
Just this.

131
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,594
This isn't nearly enough.

132
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,794
Conan, cough it up.

133
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:16,894
We know you have a lot of money.

134
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,595
Why?

135
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:27,494
Dough that uses a lot of eggs is typically this color.

136
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:30,794
And if you apply the same amount of cream in the same way,

137
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:32,694
it does look similar.

138
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:35,794
So it's not plagiarism?

139
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:38,294
I don't think so.

140
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:39,795
Thanks for the food.

141
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:47,694
-Thanks for the food. -Thanks for the food.

142
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:50,094
It tastes completely different.

143
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:53,694
Yeah. Cafe Poirot's cakes taste way better.

144
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,794
That solves the mystery.

145
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:56,994
Does it?

146
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,794
That baker is breaking in during the night,

147
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:03,694
and destroying Amuro's cakes.

148
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:07,994
So they can't sell their cakes since they taste better?

149
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:10,894
I'm 100 percent sure they're wrong.

150
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:13,794
That makes things simple.

151
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:15,694
What's simple?

152
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:18,394
We'll conduct a stake out here tonight.

153
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:19,694
Who?

154
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,895
Us, of course.

155
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:26,095
-The Youth Detective Squad! -The Youth Detective Squad!

156
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:29,294
You can't.

157
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,294
You're children.

158
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:33,694
It's all right. We can do it.

159
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,195
Guys.

160
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:40,294
Do you not care if you never get to eat Amuro's cake again?

161
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:43,595
That can't happen! We have to catch the perp!

162
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:53,094
Fine...

163
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:56,294
Azusa, can we set up a camera here tonight?

164
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,494
What? A camera here?

165
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:01,394
Conan, you don't need to do that.

166
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:04,894
Yeah. This is the store's problem.

167
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,194
But...

168
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:07,394
Don't worry.

169
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:11,594
I'll feed all of you delicious cake soon.

170
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:12,994
-Really? -Really?

171
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,094
Have you come up with a solution?

172
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:18,195
Yeah, I've got an idea.

173
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:27,894
What? You were filming the store from outside?

174
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:31,294
Yeah, from closing time yesterday to this morning.

175
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,494
I'm curious why the cakes are melting

176
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:36,294
when the fridge isn't broken.

177
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:40,294
You look into anything that makes you curious.

178
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:44,894
Actually, it's because those kids who are excited

179
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,394
about your cake would be disappointed.

180
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:48,594
Really?

181
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:52,595
So you'll investigate anything for the people important to you.

182
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,595
So, did you find anything after watching the store all night?

183
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:01,694
I didn't notice anything suspicious.

184
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,094
Here you go.

185
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,994
What? It's not melted.

186
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:07,794
Yeah, it was fine today.

187
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:10,694
They don't melt every day?

188
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:13,794
They fall apart...

189
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:17,194
about two out of every three days.

190
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:19,794
Two out of three days?

191
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:22,294
And it's not regular either.

192
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,595
Really?

193
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:32,815
"Teitan Elementary school" -I set up a camera watching Cafe Poirot

194
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:35,616
"Class 1-B" -for three days after that.

195
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:40,216
What?

196
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:43,015
We can't see inside the store.

197
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,115
Why?

198
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:47,315
It's hard to tell from this video.

199
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:50,915
"Day 1 - 21 April, Day 2 - 22 April" -It happened twice out of three days.

200
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,215
"Day 3 - 23 April" -The first time was 11 seconds

201
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,315
"11 seconds at 01:00 am" -at 1 am on the 21st.

202
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,815
"12 seconds at 02:26 am" -The second time was 12 seconds

203
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:00,815
at 2:26 a.m. today, the 23rd.

204
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:03,315
"Sorry. Poirot's special cake is sold out today." -The 21st and today?

205
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:05,815
Those are both days the cakes melted.

206
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,315
-We knew it. -We knew it.

207
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:11,515
In other words, it's likely something happened

208
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:13,815
during the time we couldn't see inside the store.

209
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,915
I know!

210
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:19,115
The perp came in during that time and melted the cakes.

211
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:22,315
But the store was locked.

212
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,815
Are there any signs the lock was broken?

213
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:27,115
No, there aren't.

214
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:29,615
In other words, this is an impossible crime.

215
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:33,715
Or else the perp is someone who has the key.

216
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:34,815
Oh.

217
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:38,315
What? You think I did it?

218
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:39,715
Hey.

219
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:43,015
There's always a car passing by

220
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:45,515
when we can't see inside the store.

221
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,915
Yeah. What about it?

222
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:53,015
It always passes by when we can't see inside the other stores, too.

223
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,315
See?

224
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,915
You're right.

225
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,015
Is it the perp's car?

226
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,615
It's possible.

227
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,615
Right, Conan?

228
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:07,115
Yeah, but cars pass by even on days when the cakes don't melt.

229
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:10,115
We can't draw any conclusions from this.

230
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:13,015
But it happens every time the cakes melt.

231
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:15,716
It must be connected.

232
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:21,415
Well, we don't have any other clues.

233
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:25,016
I'll ask the Dr. Agasa to make it easier to see.

234
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:30,815
By Dr. Agasa, do you mean the Dr. Agasa who makes all kinds

235
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:32,215
of interesting gadgets for you?

236
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:34,316
What? Yeah.

237
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,816
I see.

238
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,515
-That's a taxi. -And...

239
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:50,715
"21 April" "23 April"

240
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:53,015
"Teiko Transit 227" -It's the same taxi on both days.

241
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:57,616
The same taxi passes by when we can't see the interior of the store?

242
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:01,215
Has there always been a refrigerator here?

243
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:04,515
It's a cake fridge.

244
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:06,615
Why?

245
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:09,515
There was nothing wrong when you made them last night.

246
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,815
I examined the refrigerator and there's nothing wrong with it.

247
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,315
The drone started flying on its own!

248
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:18,715
No one touched the controller.

249
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:20,616
Is it the perp's car?

250
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:23,515
I finally figured it out.

251
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:24,615
-What? -What?

252
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:27,016
The perp destroying the cakes.

253
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:35,215
"Teiko Transit 227" -Car 227, head to Beika Station.

254
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:39,015
Car 227, there's a Mouri at Beika Station.

255
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,015
Can you get there?

256
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:43,115
Yes. This is Car 227.

257
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:46,216
Mouri at Beika Station. Roger that.

258
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:50,415
Excuse me.

259
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,315
"Azusa Calling" -It's from Azusa.

260
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:53,715
Then it must be.

261
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:55,015
Yeah.

262
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:57,115
Excuse me.

263
00:14:57,116 --> 00:15:00,615
I'm sorry, but I already have a passenger.

264
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:03,615
I know. I'm Mouri, the person who hired this taxi.

265
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:05,615
What? Mouri?

266
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:09,615
Yeah. We're the one who called for a taxi.

267
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:13,616
But the perp who melted Cafe Poirot's cakes is...

268
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,115
"Cafe Poirot"

269
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,515
Ayumi was right.

270
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:21,615
"Sorry. Poirot's special cake is sold out today." -The cakes melted

271
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:24,515
when we couldn't see inside the store.

272
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:25,715
I knew it.

273
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,215
But why couldn't we see inside?

274
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:30,515
Because the windows fogged up.

275
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:32,515
Why?

276
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,615
It's because of...

277
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:35,715
this.

278
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:37,316
-What? -What?

279
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:41,216
This kettle expels steam when the water boils, right?

280
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:44,915
Yeah.

281
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,115
Is that what made the windows fog up?

282
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:52,115
Yeah. And this electric kettle is an IoT appliance, right?

283
00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:55,715
So you used your phone to boil the water?

284
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:56,915
I got it.

285
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:01,215
She was turning the kettle on using her phone during the night.

286
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:04,715
That makes it possible to melt the cakes without being in the store.

287
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:08,215
Hold on. I wouldn't do that.

288
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,915
It's not Azusa.

289
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,415
What? Then who did it?

290
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:18,315
The perp was reflected in the windows of the store.

291
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:19,515
What?

292
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:20,915
That car?

293
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,015
It was a taxi, right?

294
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,715
Yeah. We talked to the taxi driver of that car.

295
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:28,915
"Teiko Transit 227" -Every night after midnight,

296
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,015
he naps near Cafe Poirot.

297
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:35,016
When he's radioed by dispatch...

298
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,616
He passes by in front of Cafe Poirot.

299
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:44,515
The window fogged up by the steam

300
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:47,915
from the electric kettle makes it reflective like a mirror,

301
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,815
reflecting the taxi passing in front of the store.

302
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:54,915
When I examined the times he was radioed,

303
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,915
it was the times the window fogged up.

304
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,215
In other words, it matched the days the cakes melted.

305
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:04,315
So did the taxi driver do it?

306
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,715
No, the perp is...

307
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:09,615
The perp is the taxi's radio.

308
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:10,715
Right?

309
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:13,115
That's right. The kettle's electrical circuits were being activated

310
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,815
by the taxi's radio.

311
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:17,115
The frequency of the taxi's radio

312
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:21,715
and the on and off switch of the kettle happened to match.

313
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:25,115
What? Is that possible?

314
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:27,315
It's called radio-frequency interference.

315
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,615
It happens all the time.

316
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,215
Really?

317
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,715
It's what happened to the drone that flew on its own at the Dr. Agasa's.

318
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:35,716
What?

319
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:41,015
You were talking to me with your badge, remember?

320
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,515
That's it.

321
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:46,315
Our badges were causing radio-frequency interference with the drone.

322
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:50,915
Yeah. These badges have a broad range,

323
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,315
so their radio waves must be strong.

324
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:57,415
We'd better tell the Dr. Agasa to change the frequency of his drone.

325
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:02,415
And that radio-frequency interference was causing the cakes to melt.

326
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,515
-What? -How?

327
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,015
You always keep the kettle here, right?

328
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:08,315
Yeah...

329
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:09,415
Oh.

330
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,515
That's right.

331
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:12,116
This electric kettle...

332
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:15,615
expels steam when it boils.

333
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:22,215
The vent on the back of refrigerator draws in the hot vapor,

334
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:26,315
turning the inside of the fridge into a sauna

335
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:29,615
for the several seconds the windows are fogged up.

336
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:31,415
That makes the cakes melt,

337
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,115
and then they're chilled that way.

338
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:37,115
Then I'd better stop using this.

339
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,615
Couldn't you just put it somewhere else?

340
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,915
Oh, right. I'll try it.

341
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,615
Does this mean we can eat Amuro's cake again?

342
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:49,915
Of course you can.

343
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,516
But it's a slightly different cake now.

344
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:59,215
It's a half-baked cake that's melted from the start.

345
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:00,915
Half-baked cake?

346
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,515
It looks like a shriveled cake.

347
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:07,015
It's made that way on purpose.

348
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:12,015
But the sponge inside is cooked.

349
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:13,416
See?

350
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,415
Amazing!

351
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,015
It looks delicious!

352
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:21,815
What? The solution you mentioned...

353
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:22,915
Yeah.

354
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:27,315
With these, unlike cakes that are already frosted,

355
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:31,315
I can store the cream and cake separately.

356
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:34,515
Then you don't have to worry about them melting.

357
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:37,215
That's right. I just have to add the cream and fruit

358
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:39,615
before serving them to customers.

359
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:42,515
That's not too much trouble at all.

360
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,215
Nope. And now you can tell them apart from the cakes

361
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,215
from that other bakery.

362
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:51,815
Amuro, you were thinking of recipes for cakes that couldn't melt

363
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,415
instead of why the cakes were melting?

364
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,615
Yeah.

365
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:59,915
After all, isn't that my job?

366
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,615
Well, that aside,

367
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:06,615
I hope you're doing your job as a public security officer.

368
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:08,016
Hey!

369
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:12,615
You've got something tasty looking there.

370
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:17,015
In that case, why don't all of you try it?

371
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,516
-All right! -All right!

372
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,616
"Cafe Poirot"

373
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:46,615
This place's cakes are so good.

374
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:50,515
Who said he didn't want cake first thing in the morning?

375
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:52,915
Dude, these are really good!

376
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,215
They're even better than the last cake!

377
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:59,215
The creamy texture is great!

378
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:04,315
Maybe that's why they taste even more strongly of eggs than before.

379
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:07,415
Yeah. I use the same number of eggs,

380
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,915
but in a half-baked cake,

381
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,315
the flavor comes through stronger.

382
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:14,015
And this cream. It's not too sweet.

383
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,315
I use yogurt in the cream and dough.

384
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:22,015
So this is yogurt cream I'm tasting.

385
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:26,715
Yes. Putting yogurt in the dough makes it softer.

386
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:30,815
Putting it in the cream makes it taste better with fruit.

387
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,615
You can have bites of just dough or just cream and fruit.

388
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:38,415
It's fun how you can eat it in all kinds of ways.

389
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,915
I'm delighted to hear that.

390
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,715
That's right.

391
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:46,515
I forgot why I came here.

392
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:47,815
Here.

393
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:48,816
Thank you.

394
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:50,415
"This letter is to notify you of the Tokyo Summit traffic control plan."

395
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,615
Oh, it's for next month's Tokyo Summit.

396
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:58,015
Those roads are going to be closed the day of the summit.

397
00:22:58,016 --> 00:23:03,215
Azusa, I've told the manager but I'm taking that day off.

398
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,315
I'm counting on you.

399
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,815
Sure.

400
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:08,215
The manager told me.

401
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:12,815
Which means Amuro will be involved in the summit's security?

402
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:13,916
Amuro.

403
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:18,915
You're not neglecting your public safety duties.

404
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,916
You sure do love investigating, don't you?

405
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:27,915
At the time, I had no idea the Amuro,

406
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,415
who was enjoying baking cakes over solving cases,

407
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,715
-There's more. -would do something like that.

408
00:23:32,716 --> 00:23:33,816
All right!

409
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:45,616
"Next Episode" -Mifuyu! What's wrong, Mifuyu?

410
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:50,015
Mifuyu, hang in there!

411
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,515
Why?

412
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:56,215
Is this really where your friend was stabbed in the chest and died?

413
00:23:56,216 --> 00:24:00,315
And there's a knife over here.

414
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:04,615
Tabata must've dumped Mifuyu's body on the way here.

415
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:06,515
Darn it! She got us!

416
00:24:06,516 --> 00:24:12,616
