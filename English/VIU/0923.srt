1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:02,735
"We apologize for the inconvenience. We are working as safely as possible."

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:04,335
"We appreciate your cooperation."

3
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:06,035
"No Authorized Access"

4
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,741
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

5
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:21,041
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,641
The Youth Detective Squad were at the crime scene,

7
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:24,641
but Conan doesn't seem to be around.

8
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,141
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:27,841
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,241
His name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:17,305
"A Day Without Conan"

12
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,661
The victim...

13
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:24,861
"Sadakazu Unmo (30)" -is a serial blackmailer named Sadakazu Unmo.

14
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:26,561
There's no weapon at the crime scene,

15
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,861
but he most likely died instantly

16
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,961
when he was hit over the head with a metal pipe.

17
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:33,261
But Mitsuhiko...

18
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,461
They're finished. I'll call you back.

19
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,161
These hot springs are great!

20
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,361
Compared to how cold it is in Tokyo, this place is paradise!

21
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,761
Come on, kid!

22
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,461
Let's stuff ourselves!

23
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:52,361
"Gift. Kogoro Mouri." -Pops got free hotel vouchers somewhere.

24
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:57,761
Ran was unable to come, so he made me come with him.

25
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,861
So the estimated time of death

26
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:04,361
is today between 3:30 to 4:30.

27
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,761
It's four.

28
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,261
That's when...

29
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:11,061
the tall man wearing sunglasses and a mask came out.

30
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,261
And you kids were

31
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,761
watching this construction site from across the street then?

32
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:21,261
Yes. We saw a woman in trouble.

33
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:23,561
It was regarding her grandson who lives with her.

34
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:27,461
"Hisae Kubo (73)" -Not only can he not hold down a job,

35
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,361
"Housewife" -but lately he's being going out in the evening

36
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:32,161
and staying out until morning.

37
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:35,961
That idiot is out gallivanting around when he doesn't even have a job.

38
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:39,961
We should catch him while he's out fooling around

39
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,961
and advise him to stop.

40
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,161
-Yeah! -Yeah!

41
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,461
It's not like we're meddling.

42
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,661
I feel bad for that woman.

43
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,361
I didn't say anything.

44
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:55,961
He should be going out soon.

45
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:58,061
Hide.

46
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:07,961
That's a huge dude.

47
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,661
The suspicious man...

48
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:17,361
came running out after about five minutes.

49
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,561
He ran away.

50
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,761
Did something happen?

51
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,761
We were curious about what happened, but then...

52
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:26,761
"Kubo"

53
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:29,861
"Yukihide Kubo (19)" -...the grandson in question came out.

54
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,061
"Hisae's Grandson"

55
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,261
When we followed him,

56
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:36,861
we discovered he was actually working.

57
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,561
He was working nights.

58
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:42,861
He's still a trainee.

59
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:46,461
He planned to tell her once he became an employee.

60
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:52,761
By the way, who was that man?

61
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:04,961
The man you kids saw certainly sounds suspicious,

62
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,861
but without knowing his appearance or age...

63
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,861
But he was really tall.

64
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,961
There are lots of men like that.

65
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:16,561
Unmo himself looks to be almost two meters tall.

66
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,461
Inspector Megure, it seems that

67
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:22,961
the suspect was being blackmailed by Unmo.

68
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:27,461
It seems Unmo had no relationship with his neighbors.

69
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:32,861
The culprit was being blackmailed by that Unmo guy, too.

70
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:36,561
So they lied about paying him,

71
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,861
asked to meet him here, and killed him.

72
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:39,961
Most likely, yes.

73
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:44,861
"Incoming Call: Conan Edogawa" -Conan.

74
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:47,261
Hello?

75
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,061
There's something bothering me.

76
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,761
There was no weapon at the crime scene, right?

77
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,261
Yes, we believe the culprit took it with them.

78
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:58,961
But the man who fled wasn't carrying a metal pipe, right?

79
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:00,261
You're right.

80
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,961
Perhaps he was hiding it under his coat.

81
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:07,061
Got it. I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

82
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:09,261
Let's find the culprit then.

83
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,161
"All You Can Eat, All You Can Drink" -Got it.

84
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,961
-It hurts! -Pops!

85
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,961
"We apologize for the inconvenience."

86
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:16,961
"We are working as safely as possible." -What?

87
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,261
"No Authorized Access" -You can't come back now?

88
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,361
"Hospital" -Yeah, sorry.

89
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:25,461
Stick with the police and tell me everything you learn.

90
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,461
Got it.

91
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:27,561
"Unmo"

92
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,761
Found it.

93
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,661
"Client List" -It's a list of the people he was blackmailing.

94
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:36,261
Ten men and one woman?

95
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:39,061
Let's split up.

96
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,361
We'll join you.

97
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:46,661
We can't let you do that.

98
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,661
We saw the culprit.

99
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,661
If we encounter the suspect, we may be able to recall something.

100
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:00,161
It doesn't make sense.

101
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:03,061
What happened to the metal pipe?

102
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:06,561
Perhaps he was hiding it under his coat.

103
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,161
If that's true,

104
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,561
then they would've noticed him running unnaturally.

105
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:14,961
Which means the weapon disappeared later.

106
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:18,161
Did someone take it?

107
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:23,061
We're sorry to have bothered you on your day off.

108
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,661
"Rika Samei" -That just leaves Rika Samei.

109
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,161
A woman.

110
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:32,461
Maybe that person was actually a masculine woman.

111
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,261
It's not her.

112
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:42,461
Someone who makes such cute drawings

113
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,161
couldn't kill a person.

114
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:49,061
And she's hardly a masculine woman.

115
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:51,761
"Rika Samei (28), Illustrator" -She's frail and small.

116
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:56,561
Rika Samei, where were you at four yesterday?

117
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,761
I was...

118
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,561
Oh, Kuniko.

119
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,561
Yes?

120
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,961
I was in my apartment yesterday afternoon, right?

121
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:08,161
"Kuniko Tago (36), Rika's Neighbor" -What? You started working at around 3.

122
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:09,661
Did something happen?

123
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:11,761
No, thank you.

124
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:12,861
I see.

125
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,061
Well, see you later.

126
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:25,961
"Rika Samei, 28, Illustrator. According to the neighbor,"

127
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,361
"Kuniko (housewife), she started working around three." -We didn't...

128
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:28,961
get any hits.

129
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:32,361
Then let's try calling the other group.

130
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,961
We're on the phone with them right now.

131
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:37,261
What? I see. Got it.

132
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:41,661
Everyone they spoke with had an alibi, too.

133
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:42,661
What?

134
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,261
All the suspects are innocent?

135
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,761
We're stuck.

136
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:54,361
Then who killed that guy with the dumb face?

137
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,161
Dumb face?

138
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,861
The victim, Sadakazu Unmo,

139
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,361
didn't have a particularly dumb face.

140
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:05,361
That's because you didn't see the body, Conan.

141
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:06,561
Hold on.

142
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:14,461
Hello, this is Mouri.

143
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,861
What? Are you feeling better?

144
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:21,261
Yeah. Could you put Officer Takagi on the phone?

145
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,861
Very well. I can't refuse a request from you, Mr. Mouri.

146
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:30,861
I see.

147
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,961
Were his front teeth knocked out when he was hit?

148
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,361
No, they weren't.

149
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:37,061
"Yamamoto Dental Clinic, Sadakazu Unmo" -They're dentures.

150
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:39,261
We found them in his apartment.

151
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:42,761
He was going to have them put back in at the start of the week.

152
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:46,461
So they were out since before he arrived at the crime scene.

153
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,461
I was just curious. Sorry to have bothered you.

154
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:55,761
Anyway, the real problem is all the suspects are innocent.

155
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,761
Why can't we find the man who killed this person and fled?

156
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:08,861
He was wearing a button-down shirt.

157
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:11,361
Could it be...

158
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,361
But...

159
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:19,361
"Unmo" -They're making a new list of suspects?

160
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:21,261
So we're back to square one.

161
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,861
The estimated time of death?

162
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:26,861
I told you, it was around four.

163
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:31,961
That's when you guys saw the tall man running away, right?

164
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:34,261
What time did the police determine it was?

165
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:38,961
Between 3:30 and 4:30.

166
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:41,461
"Hospital" -Until 4:30, right?

167
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,861
Yes. What about it?

168
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,461
So that's how it is.

169
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,940
He was wearing a button-down shirt.

170
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
Could it be...

171
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
But...

172
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,940
The estimated time of death?

173
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,240
I told you, it was around four.

174
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,240
That's when you guys saw the tall man running away, right?

175
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,640
What time did the police determine it was?

176
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,240
Between 3:30 and 4:30.

177
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
"Hospital" -Until 4:30, right?

178
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,140
Yes. What about it?

179
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,140
So that's how it is.

180
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,640
"Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya: Call Ended"

181
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,640
That explains everything...

182
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,340
about why we can't find the tall man,

183
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,540
the missing weapon,

184
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,440
and the victim, Unmo.

185
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,640
I even have some idea of why the culprit did that.

186
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,940
The problem is...

187
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,540
who is the culprit?

188
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,040
According to Mitsuhiko, all the suspects have alibis.

189
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,840
No, are we sure that's true?

190
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,840
Mitsuhiko, sorry. I want you guys to split up and do something for me.

191
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,440
The first is to confirm her alibi with the witness.

192
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,640
The second is a treasure hunt.

193
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,840
Got it. We'll give it a shot.

194
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,940
He's ordering us around without even explaining why?

195
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,640
He treats us like errand boys.

196
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,940
Errand boys?

197
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,440
We just need to solve the case, right?

198
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,140
And Conan's always making us run errands for him.

199
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,540
But this time he gave us orders over the phone.

200
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,640
Why not? It's up to us to find the key to solving the case.

201
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,740
You're right.

202
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,640
Let's go. We'll start with the treasure hunt.

203
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah!

204
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I guess I'll talk to the witness.

205
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,040
But I'd better give Edogawa a piece of my mind first.

206
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,940
Did I visit my neighbor Rika Samei's apartment yesterday?

207
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,240
No, I didn't.

208
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,640
Then how did you know she started working at three?

209
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,340
Oh, because she came to ask me for something yesterday.

210
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,840
I have a job I need to finish by tonight,

211
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,840
but I'm being followed by a strange fan.

212
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,140
If someone knocks on or yells outside my door,

213
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,840
could you tell them I'm out?

214
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,740
So you want me to send them away.

215
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,240
-You got it. -Thank you.

216
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,040
Now I can focus on my work.

217
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,340
She made her request

218
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
and went back into her apartment around three.

219
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,440
She was definitely working, right?

220
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Fortunately, no weirdos showed up.

221
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,740
Oh, Kuniko.

222
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,740
-Yes? -I was in my apartment yesterday afternoon, right?

223
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,740
What? You started working at around three.

224
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
Did something happen?

225
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,340
No, thank you.

226
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,640
In other words, we don't know if she was actually

227
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,140
in her apartment after three.

228
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:24,440
Yeah, but she looks nothing like the tall man.

229
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,340
That's not important anymore.

230
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,040
Just tell me already!

231
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,340
What treasure are we looking for?

232
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,840
He just said to thoroughly search the area around the crime scene.

233
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,640
What's that? It's waving.

234
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,940
Is this...

235
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,440
This belongs to the culprit!

236
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,340
I understand why they got rid of the weapon,

237
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,140
but why did they leave their coat and other belongings?

238
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,940
Let's call Conan.

239
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,540
-Oh, right. -This must be the treasure.

240
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Conan will be so surprised.

241
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,840
It's me! We found them.

242
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,740
The metal pipe and coat, right?

243
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
What?

244
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,240
How did you know?

245
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,440
Call the police.

246
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,140
We will, but what does this mean?

247
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,640
I made him tell me.

248
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Edogawa's deduction.

249
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,640
Take them back and have them examined immediately.

250
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,540
Conan figured it all out?

251
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,140
Is he back?

252
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,340
No.

253
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,940
He figured it out based on the information we gave him.

254
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,740
Come with us.

255
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,640
Conan isn't with us, though.

256
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,740
This time I'll run down the culprit.

257
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,540
-You? -You?

258
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,640
I'm more than just an errand boy.

259
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,940
It's still bothering him?

260
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,040
There's nothing wrong with having some backbone.

261
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,940
The other suspects' alibis are rock solid,

262
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,340
but Rika Samei, you can't say the same, can you?

263
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,340
My neighbor Kuniko can...

264
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,940
Wait.

265
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,340
Your neighbor didn't actually see you.

266
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
You're right,

267
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,340
but it doesn't matter if I have an alibi.

268
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,440
Wasn't Unmo killed by a tall man?

269
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,640
We never would've found him.

270
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,440
Not the man we saw.

271
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,240
-What? -What?

272
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,840
Because that man is...

273
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,140
He made it just in time.

274
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
Who are you?

275
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,240
Pops is incredibly resilient.

276
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,340
Even the doctor was surprised!

277
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,840
-I'm all better now! -You just had too much to eat.

278
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,440
More importantly, why couldn't you have found him?

279
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,540
Tell them, Mitsuhiko.

280
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,740
Me?

281
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,940
Okay.

282
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,140
The tall man wearing sunglasses, a mask, and coat...

283
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,040
was Sadakazu Unmo himself!

284
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
-What? -What?

285
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,540
Nice one.

286
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
Really?

287
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,340
Hold on. The victim, Unmo...

288
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,140
Was also the culprit?

289
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,940
Not the culprit, the suspect.

290
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,740
Mitsuhiko.

291
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,440
Conan, could you handle the rest?

292
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,740
You're the one who solved it.

293
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,440
Fine.

294
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,240
Yesterday at four,

295
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,540
Unmo came to the construction site to blackmail someone.

296
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,940
Since it was cold, he wore a coat.

297
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,540
In other words, the tall man

298
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,740
the Youth Detective Squad saw...

299
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,940
was Unmo himself.

300
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,740
They're still not here.

301
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,140
Jerk!

302
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
No, you don't!

303
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,640
Don't underestimate me!

304
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,440
I killed them.

305
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Believing he had killed them,

306
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,640
he threw away the metal pipe and fled,

307
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,040
which was witnessed by the Youth Detective Squad.

308
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,640
Later, Unmo returned.

309
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,440
-He returned? -He returned?

310
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,640
He must've remembered that his fingerprints were on the weapon.

311
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,040
This isn't good!

312
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,240
I need to get rid of that metal pipe!

313
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,040
Where did it go?

314
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,640
Unmo was killed by his blackmailing victim,

315
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,640
who had only been knocked unconscious.

316
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,740
That was around 4:30.

317
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,440
Then the culprit removed Unmo's coat,

318
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,340
and disposed of it along with the metal pipe.

319
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,840
The reason I thought the tall man they saw might be Unmo

320
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,440
is because I saw this photo you sent.

321
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,540
Since it was a cold day, he must've been wearing a coat,

322
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,940
and if he was going to blackmail someone,

323
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,740
he would've hidden the fact that his front teeth were missing with a mask.

324
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,440
Once we eliminate the requirement of "tall man,"

325
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,340
we should be focusing on the certainty of their alibis...

326
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,140
when determining the culprit.

327
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,440
Why did the culprit need to remove Unmo's coat?

328
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,740
When they were fighting Unmo,

329
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,940
it's possible their blood got on Unmo's clothes.

330
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,440
Blood?

331
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,640
Forensics just reported that they found blood on the coat.

332
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,940
It belongs to the victim Unmo and one other person.

333
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,640
It's mine.

334
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,140
But I didn't mean to kill him!

335
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,840
He asked me to meet him yesterday and blackmailed me.

336
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,840
When I asked him to stop,

337
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,840
he told me not to underestimate him and started strangling me.

338
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,140
In order to defend myself, I grabbed a metal pipe,

339
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,140
but he nearly killed me.

340
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,640
I attacked Unmo with the metal pipe when he returned

341
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,140
because I feared he'd come to finish me off.

342
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,040
I was caught up in the moment.

343
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,240
Huh? That contradicts your story.

344
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,840
You made your fake request to your neighbor

345
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,740
before you went to see Unmo, right?

346
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,440
If you hadn't been planning to kill him,

347
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,540
you wouldn't have done that in advance.

348
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,240
You're right.

349
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
-Yeah! -Yeah!

350
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,140
The little brat is right.

351
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,940
I asked that pest to meet me and killed him!

352
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
Yes!

353
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,740
Case closed!

354
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,340
We did it!

355
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,940
Impressive work, Conan.

356
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,540
It's thanks to the information you provided me.

357
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,840
Thanks for all the work you did.

358
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,340
That doesn't sound like you...

359
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,340
But in the end, you did the heavy lifting.

360
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,740
Guys.

361
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,640
Look at them commending each other.

362
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Huh?

363
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,140
Is it another case?

364
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,640
All right. Let's go.

365
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,340
Yeah!

366
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,240
"Next Episode"

367
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,640
No!

368
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,140
I won't let anyone treat them so carelessly.

369
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,240
So this is what he meant when he said we were his only visitors.

370
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,540
Is something wrong?

371
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,640
Hey!

372
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,940
Over here!

373
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,940
Next Conan,

374
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,840
