1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:05,389
Pops was scheduled to make an appearance on the iconic show,

2
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:08,389
"The Most Useful School in the World" from Nichiuri TV.

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:11,589
While visiting the TV station where the filming would take place,

4
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:13,789
the prominent enka singer,

5
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,789
Mr. Noburo Kimijima, who was also appearing on the same show

6
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,689
showed off his proud vase to us.

7
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:23,189
The appraisal of his vase was to be conducted during the show.

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,989
According to Mr. Kimijima,

9
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:27,889
it was valued at over 100 million yen.

10
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:34,389
However, that vase suddenly disappeared during the rehearsal.

11
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:37,189
Could someone have stolen it?

12
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:38,489
If that was the case,

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,289
the culprit would have to be in this studio.

14
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,389
Like the fog clears.

15
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,489
Let's see through love and crime as well.

16
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:53,289
Surfacing from that popular show

17
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:55,389
is the mystery of the sudden missing vase.

18
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,089
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,889
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:01,189
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,108
"The Most Useful School in the World Case (Part 2)"

22
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:55,578
Will you hear me out, Mr. Kimijima?

23
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:57,678
Since the beginning of the rehearsal,

24
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,778
I haven't stepped out of the studio at all.

25
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,678
Well, it isn't just Principal Sakai.

26
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:07,578
If I'm right, no one carried any personal belongings

27
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:11,678
large enough to contain a vase, out of the studio during rehearsal.

28
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:14,278
"Mikihiko Kamisuwa (52)" -Anyway, let's split up

29
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,478
"Nichiuri TV's Producer" -and search the studio carefully one more time.

30
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,678
"Daisuke Tsuchiya (45), Director" -It's nowhere to be found.

31
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:37,878
Did it vanish just like that?

32
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:39,378
Vanished?

33
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:41,378
It's not like it's a magic vase.

34
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:43,978
There's no way it could have vanished on its own!

35
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:46,278
"Noburo Kimijima (67)" -That's a vase from the Qing Dynasty

36
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:48,078
"Leading Figure in Enka" -with an estimated value of 100 million yen!

37
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:51,278
I'm sure someone was dazzled by its worth

38
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:53,478
and hid it away with the intent to steal it!

39
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:54,478
Calm down, calm down.

40
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:57,278
We can't be sure about that at this point.

41
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,778
The sudden disappearance of an item...

42
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:03,178
That reminds me. Mr. Takikawa conducted an interesting experiment

43
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:05,478
in his lab last week.

44
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,678
A fake flower placed on top of a pot filled with rice

45
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,878
disappeared all of a sudden.

46
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,478
The truth was that a hose was inserted from underneath the flower pot.

47
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:15,678
When air was pumped out from it,

48
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:17,578
the rice grains above floated with a swoosh.

49
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:20,478
The force supporting the flower plummeted in an instant,

50
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,878
causing the fake flower to sink into the rice.

51
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,678
That's why it looked as if it disappeared.

52
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:28,378
But that trick is not applicable to this case.

53
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:32,878
As such, someone among us has to be the culprit.

54
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:37,278
I have a request, Mr. Mouri.

55
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,778
Once and for all, can we rely on the deductions

56
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:43,278
of the great detective, Kogoro Mouri to find the vase?

57
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:46,078
Kindly lend us your strength again.

58
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,678
But even if you say so...

59
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:49,778
It'll be all right.

60
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:52,778
I'm sure Mr. Mouri can find the vase without fail!

61
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:55,078
Of... Of course, I will!

62
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:56,378
All right, then!

63
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,378
The great detective Kogoro Mouri

64
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:03,078
shall definitely recover Mr. Kimijima's vase without fail!

65
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:04,978
Leave everything to me!

66
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,478
All right.

67
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,678
Will dad be all right after blowing up a huge balloon of confidence?

68
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:13,278
Well, he has to do his best now.

69
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:17,478
Now, according to the testimony of the assistant director, Mr. Hashimoto,

70
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:19,078
"Yoshinari Hashimoto (22)" -Up until the end of rehearsal

71
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:20,378
"Assistant Director" -for the first period,

72
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:23,078
the vase was definitely still there.

73
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:26,978
Yeah. I was checking the props.

74
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:29,578
I also witnessed the vase at that time.

75
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:33,978
That said, if we assume that somebody stole that vase,

76
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:38,178
they would've had to do it during the second period rehearsal.

77
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:41,078
While we were paying full attention to the puffed grain candy machine,

78
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:44,978
they seized the opportunity, stole Mr. Kimijima's vase,

79
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:49,078
and hid it somewhere in the studio in the blink of an eye.

80
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:51,378
However, we've searched everywhere just now,

81
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,478
but we still couldn't find the vase.

82
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,278
No. There is still a place we haven't searched yet.

83
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:01,178
Mr. Yamazaki, let me ask you one thing.

84
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:02,878
"Tetsushi Yamazaki (32)" -What is it?

85
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:05,178
Regarding the storage case of the puffed grain candy machine,

86
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:09,478
you were the one who checked its content, weren't you?

87
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:10,578
Yeah.

88
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,778
Are you sure

89
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:16,878
we won't find Mr. Kimijima's vase inside it?

90
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,178
Hold... Hold on a moment!

91
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,478
Are you suspecting me now?

92
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,778
Mr. Yamazaki, you have a motive.

93
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:28,478
During my rehearsal for the first period,

94
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,478
you were secretly taking pictures of Ms. Yoko.

95
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:33,678
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:35,978
I'm a fan of Yoko, so I couldn't help...

97
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,878
If you're a fan of her, you should respect her even more!

98
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:47,878
Mr. Kimijima was furious at you

99
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,878
for taking pictures of Ms. Yoko without permission.

100
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:53,078
So he snapped your cell phone in half.

101
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,978
Holding a grudge against him for that,

102
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:59,978
you stole Mr. Kimijima's vase to get back at him, didn't you?

103
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:01,178
What nonsense.

104
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:05,878
If you say so, why not show us what's inside your case?

105
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:08,178
When I was testing my puffed grain candy machine,

106
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,678
I remained on set the entire time!

107
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:14,478
How on earth would I have time to steal the vase?

108
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,078
That's precisely where the blind spot is.

109
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:23,478
At that time, I believe nobody kept their eyes on you the entire time.

110
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,878
So why didn't you do the hammering yourself

111
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,078
instead of asking Ms. Yoko to do it?

112
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:32,378
Everyone's eyes were fixed on the candy machine in that instant.

113
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:38,078
Therefore, I believe no one was able to witness your whereabouts.

114
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,578
That's just your assumption!

115
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:41,778
Well...

116
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,578
The reason why I did the hammering

117
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:47,678
was because it was written on the script.

118
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:50,878
Hey, hey. Wise up, Pops.

119
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,878
That's why we've been telling you to at least read the script.

120
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:55,278
But...

121
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,778
Dad, Mr. Yamazaki took photos of Ms. Yoko without permission

122
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:02,178
and left a bad impression on you,

123
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,378
so you jumped into conclusions, didn't you?

124
00:08:04,378 --> 00:08:08,578
Nonsense! I'm not as narrow-minded as you may think.

125
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:11,478
That man is definitely hiding something from us.

126
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:13,778
I have no doubt about it.

127
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:16,878
I shouldn't be surprised that Pops noticed it, too.

128
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:18,378
What are you doing?

129
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,478
At any rate, we should be able to find out

130
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:22,378
once we see the content of that case!

131
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:24,878
Mr. Yamazaki.

132
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:26,178
I'm sorry to ask this,

133
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:29,278
but could you let us take a look inside your case as a precaution?

134
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:31,578
That... But...

135
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:41,878
Understood.

136
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:49,678
That's my...

137
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:51,978
Mr. Yamazaki.

138
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:55,178
Would you care to explain what this is about?

139
00:08:55,178 --> 00:08:58,978
I'm sorry. My impulses got the best of me.

140
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:01,578
As Mr. Mouri said, I was indeed furious

141
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:05,178
because my cell phone was snapped into pieces.

142
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,578
As a grown man,

143
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,378
it's insolent of you to take peeping photos of an idol.

144
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:10,678
You should be ashamed.

145
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:14,478
But still, you didn't have to break it!

146
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:18,178
Screw it! I'm going home!

147
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:21,378
Wait! Please hold on.

148
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:25,178
After that, I noticed the handkerchief Yoko was using

149
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,678
fell onto the chair.

150
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:30,178
So I thought if I auctioned off the handkerchief and a photo of Yoko

151
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:33,178
as a set over the internet,

152
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:36,078
I could maybe sell it to the fans for a high price.

153
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,878
Bastard! Stop screwing around like that!

154
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,978
Hold it, dad! Calm down!

155
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:44,678
But wasn't the photo in question unusable

156
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:48,478
since it was destroyed by Mr. Kimijima along with the cell phone?

157
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:53,478
I bet he set it so that photos will be saved in a memory card.

158
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:55,378
By doing that, his photos will remain intact

159
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:57,878
even if the cell phone is not.

160
00:09:57,878 --> 00:09:59,278
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:00,578
You've caused another problem.

162
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:03,878
But for now, we need to focus on Mr. Kimijima's vase.

163
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:06,778
Where on earth did it vanish to?

164
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:11,978
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

165
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,078
"Kentaro Honma (70)" -What's the matter, Mr. Honma?

166
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:15,878
"Antique Appraiser" -Why are you asking me that?

167
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:18,178
If problems keep surfacing like that,

168
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,678
the filming for today will be called off, right?

169
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:23,778
No, we haven't decided on doing that just yet.

170
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:27,978
I have a busy schedule. Please do excuse me.

171
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:31,278
Please wait, Mr. Honma.

172
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,378
My apologies, but before you leave,

173
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:37,878
would you mind showing us the contents of that large baggage?

174
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:41,178
Mr. Honma! Are you the culprit?

175
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:44,178
How will you explain this, Mr. Honma?

176
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:57,703
Mr. Honma! You were pretty intrigued by that vase.

177
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:00,903
Remarkable...

178
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,503
Where did you get this?

179
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:06,603
Well, well, Mr. Honma.

180
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:09,403
I can see that it caught your eye.

181
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:12,303
Also, during the puffed grain candy machine demonstration...

182
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:22,603
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

183
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:24,903
I'm not interested in that.

184
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:28,903
Didn't you leave the set all by yourself?

185
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:32,803
Are you saying I'm the culprit just because of that?

186
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:34,903
I merely think that it's possible

187
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:39,703
to conceal a vase in a baggage like that.

188
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,203
I see.

189
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,403
Are you satisfied now?

190
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:51,903
It isn't there. My vase isn't there!

191
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:54,503
I apologize for doubting you.

192
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:57,203
No, it's true that if one carries such a large baggage

193
00:11:57,203 --> 00:12:00,703
out of the studio, suspicion will surely ensue.

194
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,703
Please don't worry about it.

195
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,203
Now, please excuse me.

196
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:06,803
Please hold on, Mr. Honma.

197
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:08,603
What else do you want?

198
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,403
It's not like we have decided to terminate our filming.

199
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:15,603
Forget Mr. Yamazaki's second period lecture for a moment.

200
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:18,503
As for your third period lecture, Mr. Honma,

201
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,603
we will still continue filming as planned

202
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:23,103
if we recover Mr. Kimijima's lost vase.

203
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:26,703
As such, may I ask you not to go home just yet?

204
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,203
Even if you do manage to find the vase,

205
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:31,503
I doubt you'll be able to continue filming.

206
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:34,103
-Pardon? -Oh, no.

207
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,803
It was nothing.

208
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:38,703
They won't be able to film even if the vase is found?

209
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:40,803
What does that mean?

210
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,903
Does he know something else?

211
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,103
Mr. Kamisuwa.

212
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:48,703
Even if you say so, we're already fairly behind schedule.

213
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:51,503
Enough is enough!

214
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:54,503
Hey! The culprit is among us, isn't it?

215
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:58,003
In that case, show yourself and return my vase at once!

216
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:00,603
Please calm down, Mr. Kimijima.

217
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:02,703
Besides Mr. Yamazaki and Mr. Honma,

218
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:05,903
nobody in this studio has personal belongings

219
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:09,203
large enough to conceal your vase.

220
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:12,203
Then, where on earth is my vase?

221
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:15,803
It's true that no one carried a container out of the studio

222
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:18,703
that's big enough to conceal the vase.

223
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:21,303
Having said that, we did search everywhere in the studio

224
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:23,603
but failed to locate the vase.

225
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:27,903
But of course, it couldn't have vanished just like that.

226
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:30,403
I'm sure I've missed something.

227
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:31,803
What could it be?

228
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:34,603
We can't help it.

229
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:36,803
Let's call it a day and stop our filming.

230
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:38,003
Okay.

231
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,603
Apologies!

232
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:41,903
As for today's filming, we'll call it a day here.

233
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:44,803
The art staff members, please disassemble the set!

234
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,803
Dissemble the set?

235
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:50,103
Hashimoto, lend me your cutter.

236
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:51,403
Sure.

237
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,603
I see! So that's how it was!

238
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:04,403
Dad, isn't it about time you got sleepy?

239
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:06,603
We still haven't located the vase.

240
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:10,703
Getting sleepy is not something...

241
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:13,403
I should do or I shouldn't...

242
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:16,603
Monkey see, monkey do...

243
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,703
Hold on for a moment.

244
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:22,103
The first thing we need to deal with is not the set,

245
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:24,203
but the case.

246
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:26,803
Then, do you know who the culprit is?

247
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:29,203
Yeah. The whereabout of the vase, too.

248
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,703
Are you sure?

249
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:34,303
So this is the Sleeping Kogoro's famous deduction.

250
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:37,103
We shall see its true worth with our very own eyes.

251
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:41,103
The culprit still has the vase.

252
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,203
The culprit still has it?

253
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:44,903
Still has it?

254
00:14:44,903 --> 00:14:48,303
But everyone here is empty-handed, dad.

255
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:49,903
Look closely, Ran.

256
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:54,403
Among us, two people are wearing waist bags.

257
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:03,903
When the staff said they were disassembling the set earlier,

258
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,903
I confirmed the contents of Assistant Director Hashimoto's bag.

259
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:11,603
Please check it however you want.

260
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,603
I only put these things inside it.

261
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:16,803
In that case, Ms. Shinobu Oki,

262
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,903
-you're the one... -Hold it right there!

263
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,803
What on earth are you saying?

264
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,803
That vase from the Qing Dynasty

265
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:25,603
could never fit into such a small waist bag!

266
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:28,703
Right, of course. However,

267
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:33,703
it's more than possible if one shatters the vase.

268
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:36,903
What did you say? The vase was...

269
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,203
shattered?

270
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:42,403
That Qing vase valued at 100 million yen?

271
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,103
Ms. Shinobu.

272
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:53,003
But if the vase was shattered,

273
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:55,503
wouldn't everyone immediately notice the sound?

274
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:58,303
Nobody was able to notice that.

275
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:01,103
Everyone, please recall what happened

276
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:02,803
during the rehearsal for the second period lecture.

277
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:08,303
When all of us were focusing on the puffed grain candy machine,

278
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:11,503
you secretly went through the back of the set

279
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,703
and put the vase in a bag you prepared beforehand

280
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:17,003
so that the shards wouldn't scatter.

281
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:21,403
Then, Ms. Yoko used the hammer to hit the machine.

282
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:23,203
With that timing...

283
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:27,103
All right, here we go!

284
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:33,203
You shattered the vase from outside the bag.

285
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:38,003
Finally, you stuffed your waist pouch with a bagful of vase shards.

286
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:41,903
And you reappeared at the scene like nothing happened.

287
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,103
I see.

288
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,003
She took advantage of the loud noise from the puffed grain candy machine

289
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:48,303
to cover the sound of the shattering vase.

290
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:50,203
Is that true?

291
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:04,403
Why... Why did you do that?

292
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:05,903
Why?

293
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:08,903
Answer me!

294
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,703
That's it! You!

295
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:14,803
You were always yelling at her like that.

296
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:18,503
I bet she hated you for that, Mr. Kimijima.

297
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,703
Is that right?

298
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:22,603
But...

299
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:24,703
whatever hatred she might have had...

300
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:26,803
I still can't believe someone in their right mind

301
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:29,403
would smash a 100-million-yen vase.

302
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:33,203
It just goes to show how much she despises him!

303
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:43,003
Still, I have one more thing I'd like to ask Mr. Honma.

304
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:48,703
It is about the appraisal result of that vase.

305
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:50,903
You want me to reveal that now?

306
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,403
Yes.

307
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:55,803
But it doesn't seem like she wishes for that.

308
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:57,203
That's true.

309
00:17:57,203 --> 00:18:01,203
But if this keeps up, Ms. Shinobu will be viewed as a bad person.

310
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:03,903
Isn't that her choice as well?

311
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,403
I know that.

312
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:07,403
However,

313
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,903
there is always only one truth.

314
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:15,403
Even if it may go against Ms. Shinobu's will.

315
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:16,903
Very well.

316
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:22,503
On the subject of the Qing vase in Mr. Noburo Kimijima's possession...

317
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:28,603
I deem it a remarkable counterfeit.

318
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:31,403
That... That can't be.

319
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,303
That can't be true!

320
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:37,503
That vase was a counterfeit?

321
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:39,703
-No way. -It can't be.

322
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:44,403
Then, earlier today...

323
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:49,303
It's this one.

324
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:53,003
What do you think? It's quite a work of art, right?

325
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:56,403
This is... Excuse me for a second.

326
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:02,103
Remarkable...

327
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:05,303
You meant to say it was a remarkable counterfeit?

328
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,303
That's correct.

329
00:19:09,303 --> 00:19:12,503
As expected, you have seen through its fakery.

330
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:15,303
If I were to declare it a fake during filming,

331
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:18,503
Mr. Kimijima would lose face as a result.

332
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:22,103
At the same time, I cannot lie about my appraisal results.

333
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:25,103
Troubled by this, I...

334
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:29,103
tried to leave the set without a word before filming, but failed.

335
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:33,403
I'm afraid she had the same feeling.

336
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:34,603
Ms. Shinobu.

337
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:38,303
Knowing how deeply Mr. Kimijima values his vase,

338
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,903
you couldn't bring yourself to let out the truth.

339
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:44,303
Then comes the invitation to be on the show.

340
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:46,703
If the appraisal were to take place on the show,

341
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:49,403
it would be revealed that it is a fake.

342
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:52,203
Since you didn't break the news up to this point,

343
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:56,003
your master was about to lose face on national television.

344
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:57,803
Worrying yourself over this,

345
00:19:57,803 --> 00:20:00,103
you decided to make it look like a vase theft

346
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:02,803
to halt the filming, didn't you?

347
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,703
Yes. It's exactly as you said.

348
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,503
Shinobu, when did you find out

349
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:11,503
that the vase was a counterfeit?

350
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:15,003
A year ago, before your wife passed away,

351
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:17,203
she called me to her bedside.

352
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,303
Although that vase is a fake,

353
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,803
it's still an irreplaceable treasure to you.

354
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:27,603
So she told me to keep you from finding out at all costs.

355
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,303
But since I couldn't keep the promise,

356
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:31,803
and things turned out like this,

357
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:35,403
I am unable to remain by your side, Master Kimijima.

358
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:38,803
With this, I will hang up my hat,

359
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:40,803
give up on my singer dream and go home.

360
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:44,403
Thank you very much for all these years!

361
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:48,903
Shinobu, do not embarrass me any further.

362
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:52,703
It's true that my eye for vases is gullible.

363
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:58,103
However, I believe my discerning eye for singers is unclouded!

364
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:01,603
Earlier, I received a call along with a reply.

365
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:04,603
Your debut has been approved!

366
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:09,103
Since the producer was rather indecisive,

367
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:12,103
I went ahead and gave him an earful.

368
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:15,103
Don't make me repeat myself!

369
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:18,703
I said there's nothing to worry about, didn't I?

370
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:19,903
Nonsense!

371
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,703
Are you saying you can't trust my judgment?

372
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:25,303
Shinobu Oki is a true talent!

373
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:27,403
You have my assurance on that!

374
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:31,503
Do you still plan to go home despite all this?

375
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:37,603
Thank you very much. Thank you very much!

376
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:39,603
Congratulations, Ms. Shinobu!

377
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:41,703
Congratulations!

378
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:49,303
"THE MOST USEFUL SCHOOL IN THE WORLD"

379
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:17,203
Looks like I've somehow solved another case, but...

380
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:19,903
It's no good, I can't remember anything.

381
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:21,903
Mr. Mouri!

382
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,903
I forgot to mention, but your necktie...

383
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:28,203
So you've indeed noticed it?

384
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,703
I wore this just to attract your attention, Yoko!

385
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:33,603
It got stained by the gravy from your lunch box!

386
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:39,203
Have a nice day!

387
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:46,503
I'm gravely in shock.

388
00:23:46,503 --> 00:23:51,003
Even a necktie can't save him from embarrassment.

389
00:23:54,903 --> 00:23:56,203
Look out!

390
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:01,403
What? In that case, is she really the real estate king

391
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:04,603
Mr. Ouzaburou Katayose's granddaughter?

392
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:06,603
That freak car was your doing, no?

393
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:08,003
Were you driving the car?

394
00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:11,103
The garden fence! You put a hole in it, didn't you?

395
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:17,903
Where did the culprit disappear to?

396
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:22,903
