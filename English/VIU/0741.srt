1
00:00:00,492 --> 00:00:05,292
Ran and I, in order to have lunch with Ran's mother, Attorney at Law Kisaki

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:09,992
went to the condo where she was working to wait for her.

3
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:13,592
There, we coincidentally run into Masumi Sera.

4
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:17,592
Masumi asks Ran to help out with the investigation and she agrees.

5
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:20,892
As a part of the investigation,

6
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:24,392
we look for a resident of that condo.

7
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,192
Waka?

8
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:33,092
Please get a hold of yourself! Waka!

9
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:35,692
Waka...

10
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,792
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

11
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,692
are slashed by the light of deduction.

12
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:58,692
Sera's deduction and another mystery.

13
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,692
A shrewd trick that you'd want to close your eyes on.

14
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:02,292
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:04,192
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:06,592
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:38,831
"The Restroom Where Ran Also Collapsed (Part 2)".

18
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:44,273
A detective?

19
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:47,573
"Kenya Settsu (22), University student" -What do you mean, Rumi?

20
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:48,773
"Rumi Kitao (21), University student" -There's rumor going around

21
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:51,373
that you haven't broken up with Waka yet,

22
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,873
so I...

23
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,873
Rumi, you...

24
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,073
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:58,673
At any rate...

26
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,673
Circumstances show that

27
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:05,673
"Mitsuaki Kaga (22), University student" -either one of you is the perp!

28
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,573
That's true,

29
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:11,973
but there's still another possibility.

30
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:14,673
Rumi.

31
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:19,673
I found this picture in the living room.

32
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:22,373
In the picture, all of you are wearing glasses.

33
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:25,073
Why's nobody wearing glasses now?

34
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:28,173
That picture was taken about two years ago.

35
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:30,773
Everybody's using contacts now.

36
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:36,973
What?

37
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:38,473
The murder weapon was found?

38
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:39,573
Yes, sir!

39
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:41,073
Luminol reaction was detected

40
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:44,373
on the golf club that was found in the living room.

41
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:47,573
In addition, a tiny bottle of chloroform and syringe

42
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:50,373
were found in the drain of the sink.

43
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:52,873
And from the drain of the bathroom,

44
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,873
a red paint-like fluid was found.

45
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:57,573
Red paint?

46
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:00,173
Why would something like that be...

47
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,473
The shower that was left running in the bathtub

48
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:04,373
was also strange to begin with.

49
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:05,773
In order to camouflage the estimated time of death

50
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:08,373
without lowering the temperature of the rectum,

51
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,373
all you'd normally do is shower the water directly on the body, no?

52
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:15,873
What the hell's going on with this case anyway?

53
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:20,973
Ran. Rumi's the one who used the spare key

54
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:22,973
to open the door of this room, right?

55
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:23,973
Yes.

56
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,673
Did she has some difficulty back then?

57
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:28,873
No, not really.

58
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:31,773
It looked like she was used to doing so.

59
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:36,773
But when she took the key out of her pocket like this...

60
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:42,373
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,173
Pick it up for me, please.

62
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:45,373
Give me a break.

63
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,573
Oh, well...

64
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,473
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:52,173
Thank you for helping me pick them up!

66
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,273
Here you go.

67
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,473
Be careful not to drop it again.

68
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:59,173
Just as I thought.

69
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,973
So, that's the story!

70
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:06,873
The fact that I realized this means she probably did too.

71
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,173
Telephone?

72
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:10,673
With who?

73
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:15,673
Hey, is my deduction wrong?

74
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:20,373
At any rate,

75
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:23,573
the ones who were able to slug the resident of this room, Waka Hashitani,

76
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,373
to death

77
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:28,173
are you, Mr. Settsu, who was going with her until six months ago

78
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:31,173
and still had the spare key to the room

79
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,673
and you, Mr. Kaga,

80
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:36,673
the one who was here drinking with the victim till 5:00 this morning,

81
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:40,073
and had the possibility of having taken the key home.

82
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,173
Just the two of you!

83
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:46,973
It seems that you were supposed to meet the victim at this condo

84
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:50,373
for a lunch date.

85
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:54,873
Mr. Settsu goes to the restroom 30 minutes before the scheduled time.

86
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:58,273
And Mr. Kaga comes to the lobby after noon,

87
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:01,073
but your whereabouts before that are unknown.

88
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:02,773
Come on, and spit it out!

89
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:05,673
One of you two did it, didn't you?

90
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,773
Hey, hold it.

91
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:11,373
Waka was collapsed on the floor of a bathroom

92
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:12,773
filled with chloroform, you know!

93
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,273
If we're the perps,

94
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,973
why would we have to set the bathroom up like that?

95
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:20,573
I'll bet you were planning

96
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:24,073
to put Rumi who went to call the victim to sleep,

97
00:06:24,073 --> 00:06:27,773
in order to delay the discovery of the corpse or something.

98
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:29,373
The more delayed,

99
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:32,673
the more ambiguous the estimated time of death becomes.

100
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:35,873
Rumi's saying that until she went to call Waka,

101
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:39,873
she was together with a detective or something,

102
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:42,073
but who knows if that's really true.

103
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:44,073
Kenya...

104
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:47,673
Since Rumi used to room share this condo room with Waka,

105
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,373
she may still have had the key on her too.

106
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:52,273
It could be that she's pairing up with that detective

107
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:54,473
to match their story.

108
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:57,173
Don't the pieces fit in too well?

109
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,873
She suddenly comes out

110
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:00,473
and says that Rumi has an alibi

111
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:03,073
because they were together right through.

112
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:07,373
No, I never said that Rumi has an alibi.

113
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:11,373
All I said was that,

114
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:13,473
if Ran who went to Waka's room together with Rumi,

115
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:16,073
found Waka's dead body,

116
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:19,773
the perp is one of you two men.

117
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,173
If that corpse wasn't Waka,

118
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:25,873
it would be a different story.

119
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:28,973
What?

120
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:30,773
But I...

121
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:33,273
Really, it was Waka's body.

122
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:35,973
Maybe you just think it was?

123
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:39,273
You've never met Waka before, have you?

124
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:40,873
That's true.

125
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:43,673
On top of that, the corpse was face down,

126
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,073
with a facial pack on her face

127
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:47,473
and a towel wrapped around her head.

128
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:48,673
And the bathroom was smoky

129
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:51,373
because of the steam from the shower too, right?

130
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:55,073
Even if somebody else was disguised as her,

131
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:57,673
you wouldn't have been able to tell.

132
00:07:57,673 --> 00:08:01,373
Hey, Conan, don't you think so too?

133
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:02,573
Yep.

134
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:04,873
She... Don't tell me...

135
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:07,173
Somebody was disguised as her?

136
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:10,573
Just who are you saying was disguised as Waka?

137
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,573
She was lying on the floor wrapped only in a bath towel, right?

138
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:14,673
Yes.

139
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:17,573
I'm sure it was a woman.

140
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:18,773
If so,

141
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,173
the only one who could've done that

142
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:24,173
would be the one who came to call Waka with you...

143
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:26,373
Rumi, right?

144
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:31,873
In other words,

145
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:34,473
when Rumi came here with Ran,

146
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,173
she pretended to go to the living room

147
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:41,573
then made Ran goes to the bedroom that was on the opposite side,

148
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:43,573
and made her look for Waka.

149
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:47,973
Then, Rumi, goes into the bathroom

150
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:50,073
and changes into a bath towel while Ran isn't looking

151
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:51,973
and puts facial pack on her face.

152
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:57,973
She then wraps a towel around her head,

153
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:01,473
and pours drops of red paint her head,

154
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,873
to make it look as if she's dead.

155
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:07,073
In just about the time that Ran would come

156
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:10,073
and find the body in the bathroom,

157
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:11,773
Rumi used the syringe

158
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:14,373
to inject chloroform into the air

159
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:15,973
and let it evaporate.

160
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,973
Are you all right?

161
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:21,273
Waka?

162
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,973
Ran who goes into the bathroom...

163
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:29,773
then fainted.

164
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:35,573
Of course all this time, Rumi holds her breath.

165
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:36,973
Hold it!

166
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:39,073
Where was the victim at that time?

167
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:41,273
I think she was sleeping in the living room.

168
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:45,073
Because like they said, Waka previously also slept

169
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:49,573
on the veranda by the living room when she got drunk.

170
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:55,973
If Rumi knew that Waka and Mr. Kaga were drinking here till morning...

171
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:01,873
"Waka Hashitani" -After Mr. Kaga leaves,

172
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:05,173
and at just about that time, Rumi calls Waka on the phone

173
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:10,073
and urges her to go to the veranda to sober up.

174
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:13,373
It would've been easy for her to put Waka to sleep as is.

175
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:15,773
Right.

176
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:18,273
After Ran fainted,

177
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:20,073
Rumi leaves the bathroom once

178
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:23,073
and airs the chloroform out

179
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:26,373
and washed away the red paint.

180
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:31,373
Rumi puts on her clothes wakes Waka, who is sleeping in the living room up,

181
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:34,073
and tells her that an unknown girl is collapsed on the floor

182
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:36,673
in order to make her go to the bathroom.

183
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:40,473
Then she finds Ran collapsed on the floor.

184
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,873
While Waka is in shock at what she sees,

185
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:45,573
Rumi slugs her to death with a golf club from behind.

186
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,873
Rumi then wraps a towel around Waka's body,

187
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:49,573
puts facial pack on her face

188
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:51,873
and wraps a towel around her head.

189
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:55,473
Then, she fills the bathroom up with chloroform again.

190
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,473
And this time, she really inhales it and faints.

191
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:02,473
Rumi waits for all the others to come.

192
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:06,973
Who would ever think that the one who went to check on the victim

193
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:11,073
would in such a short time disguise herself as the dead body?

194
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:12,673
You're wrong!

195
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,673
I didn't do that!

196
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,273
Besides, I went to the living room

197
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:19,373
only because I got a call from Kenya.

198
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:21,673
But you said that you were going to look for

199
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:23,473
the thing that Mr. Settsu forgot in the living room

200
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:25,873
even if you didn't get a call from him, right?

201
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,073
Yes.

202
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:30,773
Well, even if you didn't have the spare key that Mr. Settsu gave you,

203
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,673
you would've probably said you were planning to return the key

204
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,173
that you had since the time you were room sharing with Waka

205
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:38,573
and use it anyway.

206
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,973
If you hired me as a detective

207
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:45,773
to make me witness you being the corpse in disguise,

208
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,773
everything falls into place.

209
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:52,173
Well, I had Ran substitute for me this time though.

210
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:54,573
You could've

211
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:57,373
let your younger sister who was supposed to come to lunch with you today

212
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:59,373
play this role too,

213
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,473
but since you probably figured that your younger sister

214
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:03,373
would see through this trick,

215
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:06,273
you decided to have someone else do it for you.

216
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,673
No. I...

217
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:10,773
Inspector!

218
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,073
Fingerprints have been detected from the chloroform bottle.

219
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:18,873
Hey, don't tell me it's the fingerprints of Rumi Kitao?

220
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:19,873
Yes, sir!

221
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,773
Great deduction!

222
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:25,273
You're pretty good, young one!

223
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:26,473
Yeah.

224
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:27,873
That deduction...

225
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:32,273
doesn't feel right, does it?

226
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,344
Doesn't feel right?

227
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,244
What're you talking about?

228
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,444
It's wasn't me.

229
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:47,544
Shinichi who heard about the case from Conan

230
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:49,944
told me to tell you, so...

231
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:52,144
I'll put my phone on speaker phone.

232
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:54,244
Shinichi Kudo...

233
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:56,444
I don't know where you come from or who you are,

234
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:57,444
but outsiders should keep their noses out of this.

235
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,144
What concerns me are the following three points.

236
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:03,844
Although it was explained

237
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:07,444
that the victim was made to sleep in the living room like she once did,

238
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:11,644
but back then, that just happened by chance.

239
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,744
Even if you were able to lead somebody conveniently to the living room,

240
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:18,144
I don't think you could also make that person go to sleep.

241
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:21,144
Let's say that luckily that person fell asleep,

242
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:22,944
it's doubtful whether that person would keep on sleeping

243
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:26,044
until somebody comes to get her.

244
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:29,344
There's also the risk that she may awake with the ringing of the doorbell.

245
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:34,144
Then, what if Rumi had put Waka to sleep using chloroform

246
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:37,644
way before we came here?

247
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:40,544
If so, the doorbell wouldn't wake her, would it?

248
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,844
That's the second problem.

249
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:46,144
If it was so,

250
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:49,444
why did Rumi lock the front door?

251
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:55,144
"Shinichi" -If Mr. Settsu didn't coincidentally give her the spare key?

252
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:58,944
If she had to use the key that she had forgotten to return to Waka?

253
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:02,944
She would end up being the primary suspect, wouldn't she?

254
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:06,544
Besides, if she had put Waka to sleep beforehand,

255
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:11,844
it'd been safer to make Waka play the role of the dead body herself.

256
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:14,644
She wouldn't have had to go out of her way to hold her breath

257
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:17,244
in order to play the role of the dead body herself.

258
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:21,544
And the third point is that

259
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:23,044
the dead body was lying on its stomach

260
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:26,044
with only a bath towel wrapped around its body.

261
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:31,244
People are never really aware how they look from behind.

262
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:36,044
They may have moles and marks they themselves don't even know about.

263
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:37,744
If Ran sees that and finds out that

264
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,244
the body is not who it's supposed to be, everything goes down the drain.

265
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:44,844
It's the worst style and position that an imposter would want to be in.

266
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:48,444
But the facial pack covered her face

267
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:51,244
and steam obstructed visibility.

268
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:52,744
No matter how you look at it...

269
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:54,544
That's just it.

270
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,544
If the face of the corpse was hidden

271
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:58,944
and the visibility was bad,

272
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:02,244
there would be suspicion that the body would've been another person.

273
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:06,144
That was indeed what the perp had in mind to begin with!

274
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:09,744
The body was wrapped in a bath towel and placed on its stomach

275
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,344
because the perp wanted whoever discovered the corpse

276
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,244
to think that the face of the corpse was hidden,

277
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:17,644
as well as to immediately tell at first glance that it was a woman.

278
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:18,944
If so,

279
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:21,644
the one who was acting as the corpse would've had to be a woman therefore,

280
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,844
you'd be jotted off the list of suspects,

281
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:27,344
as well as successfully frame Rumi up as being the perp.

282
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,044
Isn't that right?

283
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:31,044
You came here and left

284
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:34,044
to use the restroom 30 minutes before the scheduled time,

285
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:35,944
slugged Waka to death

286
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:38,144
and set up the trick I just mentioned.

287
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:39,944
Her ex-boyfriend...

288
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:43,544
Mr. Kenya Settsu?

289
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:48,744
-What the? -Right.

290
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:51,744
You came here

291
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,144
and when Waka was off guard,

292
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:56,044
you made her sniff chloroform and put her to sleep.

293
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:58,344
After carrying Waka to the bathroom,

294
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:01,244
you removed her clothes and wrapped her in a bath towel.

295
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:03,044
You covered her face with facial pack,

296
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,044
and after wrapping her head with a towel,

297
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:07,144
you slugged her to death with a golf club.

298
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:10,244
Then you finished off

299
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,644
by washing the red paint down the drain of the bathroom

300
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:16,344
and filled the room up with chloroform.

301
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:19,444
You called Rumi who went to get Waka,

302
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:21,644
led her to the living room

303
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:25,644
and made time for her to disguise herself as the corpse.

304
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:29,444
After the incident, if Rumi's fingerprints are detected from

305
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:32,744
the bottle of chloroform that was hidden,

306
00:16:32,744 --> 00:16:36,544
you figured that you could deceive the police.

307
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:40,044
By the way, the bottle with the fingerprints on it

308
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:43,244
is probably something that Mr. Settsu made Rumi touch beforehand.

309
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:45,144
If the two were going together,

310
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:47,444
all he had to do was line it up on the seasoning shelf or something,

311
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:49,544
to make her touch it.

312
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,944
Hey, I don't know who you are,

313
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:57,344
but if it's the trick you just mentioned, even Kaga could've...

314
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:59,844
That's why I had Conan try it out.

315
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:03,044
You had him try it out?

316
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:06,944
Remember? When I had you two pick up the coins for me?

317
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,244
Back then, I showed you the palm of my hand

318
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:11,044
and told you to give them to me, right?

319
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:15,144
You put the coins on the palm of my hand for me, Mr. Kaga.

320
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:18,644
But Mr. Settsu, you stuck your palm out to me

321
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:21,544
and told me to take it myself, right?

322
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,544
That's how I found out, Mr. Settsu,

323
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,144
that you couldn't measure the distance.

324
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:30,044
That's why you couldn't put the coins on my hand.

325
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:33,144
Despite me holding the palm of my hand out,

326
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:37,344
you went out of your way to make me take the coins from your hand.

327
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:41,544
Well, you dropped the spare key for the same reason

328
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:44,244
when you gave it to Rumi,

329
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:46,744
so it's understandable that it was the only thing you could do.

330
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:49,144
Just what're you talking about?

331
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:51,044
Contact lens.

332
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:55,044
One of the contact lens of Mr. Settsu's eyes wasn't on.

333
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:57,444
It probably came off when

334
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,344
Waka struggled to pull free of him

335
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,444
when he tried to make her sniff chloroform.

336
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:06,344
He hurriedly looked for his lens on the floor but couldn't find it.

337
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:08,544
Why, because,

338
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:11,944
Waka who was made to sniff the drug,

339
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:15,244
even as she was going faint, picked it up and hid it.

340
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,644
Hid it, where?

341
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:20,244
The victim's clothes was totally removed after that, you know.

342
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:22,544
Like you were saying too, Inspector, remember?

343
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:25,044
Something's strange about the corpse.

344
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,444
I see, the wink!

345
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:32,244
The victim hid it in her own eyes!

346
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,944
-Check the corpse out on the double! -Yes, sir!

347
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:39,344
Even if the contact lens were to be found in the room later,

348
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:43,344
he was probably going to say he lost it when he was going with her

349
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:46,444
but couldn't find it then, and play dumb.

350
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:49,044
If the lens is in her eye

351
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,544
and if none is found in yours,

352
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,544
that's concrete evidence.

353
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:57,544
Your fingerprints should be on the contact lens too.

354
00:18:57,544 --> 00:19:00,144
Hey, it's not true, is it, Settsu?

355
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:02,744
Why on earth would you do something like that to Waka?

356
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:05,544
Didn't you guys break up?

357
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,144
Yeah. In order to start going with the daughter of the chairman.

358
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:12,444
The daughter of the chairman, you mean that freshman?

359
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,344
I had no choice.

360
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:16,044
Waka's father is senior executive managing director.

361
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:20,044
The other is the chairman of all the affiliate companies, you know.

362
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:22,044
If I get to successfully marry her,

363
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,944
I'd be super rich.

364
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:25,944
I was also already unofficially promised a post in the company too,

365
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:29,244
and insured a promotion.

366
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:30,744
But, if you guys split up,

367
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:33,544
you didn't have to kill her, did you?

368
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:36,344
Waka was threatening me.

369
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,244
She said that she would disclose

370
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:41,644
all the evil things I did till now the moment I made the new girl my own.

371
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:43,044
I did bring a lot of tears

372
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:46,244
to a countless number of girls till I met Waka, you see.

373
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:48,244
Then, what was I to you?

374
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:51,744
Why did you start going with me?

375
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:54,544
If the chick that I was going with is killed right after we split,

376
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:57,044
I'd be suspected, right?

377
00:19:58,144 --> 00:19:59,644
If rumor goes around

378
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:02,844
that I'm going with you but still haven't really split up with Waka,

379
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:06,444
you'd have a motive to kill Waka out of jealously.

380
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:09,944
Well, at least you got to go with me for half a year.

381
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:11,944
Just make good memories out of it, okay?

382
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:21,944
Sorry.

383
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:25,944
My head gets itchy when I hear stupid stories

384
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:28,144
that my elbow jabs unconsciously.

385
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,444
If you go on telling stupid stories,

386
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:33,644
next my buttocks are going to get itchy

387
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:35,844
and my knees may just jab into you.

388
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:38,044
Would you like that?

389
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,344
No.

390
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,144
But, how amazing!

391
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:50,744
To see right through that deception, fantastic!

392
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:53,944
It's not me, but Shinichi who did it.

393
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:59,444
No joke. Shinichi hung up.

394
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:01,944
Come to think of it, Shinichi said,

395
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:04,644
that he figured out the deception after hearing that mascara

396
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,644
was dripping from the corner of Waka's eye.

397
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:07,744
It seems that the perp realized

398
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,844
that if facial pack was going to be put on the face,

399
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:13,644
first make-up had to be removed, so the lipstick was wiped off.

400
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:15,544
If the perp were a woman,

401
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:18,144
she would never have overlooked the mascara.

402
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:22,244
He said that Masumi probably never used mascara,

403
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:24,544
so she overlooked it.

404
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,144
I see.

405
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,744
"Incoming calls: Shinichi"

406
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:34,644
I don't think Shinichi ever used mascara either.

407
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:00,644
You were messed up in a murder case?

408
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:03,644
Why didn't you tell me about it?

409
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:06,844
Well, Masumi the detective was there too.

410
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,544
Shinichi actually solved the case, though.

411
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:13,444
Bye. See you.

412
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:14,844
Oh, she's...

413
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:17,744
Huh? Do you know Masumi?

414
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:22,544
Yes. Just before noon, I came down to this lobby

415
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:24,344
in order to let you know that my work

416
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:26,744
was going to take more time than expected.

417
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:29,644
But you two weren't here yet

418
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:32,144
and that girl was on the phone.

419
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,344
The phone? With who?

420
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:35,444
I wonder.

421
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:38,744
But she was saying something like "big brother" after a person's name.

422
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:41,044
It could've been her big brother.

423
00:23:43,744 --> 00:23:49,244
"Next Episode"

424
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:53,144
Are you here with your girlfriend today to watch the soccer game?

425
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:55,444
That's why player Sanada...

426
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:58,244
aimed for the upper left corner of the same goal.

427
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:00,344
A strong straight ball.

428
00:24:01,444 --> 00:24:03,644
Mr. Sanada, No big deal, no big deal!

429
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,144
That man...

430
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,144
Looks suspicious.

431
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:09,844
Next Conan,

432
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:13,844
"Promise with the J-Leaguer".

433
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:31,444
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:31,444 --> 00:24:33,944
"Sanada Takahiro".

435
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:35,744
Kudo, the genius of make-up.

436
00:24:35,744 --> 00:24:37,144
It's deduction based knowledge.

437
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,744
Somehow I feel more upset.
