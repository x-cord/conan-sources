1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,539
Younger brother!

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,839
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,139
Disclose the surprising secret hidden in the red light

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,139
that brings back memories even after ten years!

5
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:10,539
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,939
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,839
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,159
Ms. Kobayashi finds a leather wallet in the library.

9
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,359
In the wallet was a message that Ran wrote when she was in first grade.

10
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,359
"Thank you, Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

11
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,259
Ten years ago,

12
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,359
we were given a code in the school library from a man

13
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:13,359
who claimed to be "Shinichi's younger brother",

14
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:15,559
and end up going on a treasure hunt.

15
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,059
-"Erase..." -"Erase..."

16
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:22,259
"The mark of Okuho."

17
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,259
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

18
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,659
"The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 2)"

19
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,759
"Erase the mark of Okuho."

20
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,159
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

21
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,159
"Okuho" is the name of a town and may be referring to Okuho-cho,

22
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,859
but the word after that is Greek to me.

23
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:45,059
Maybe it's a dentist?

24
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,659
It says, "Clench your teeth"...

25
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,159
No, that's too simple.

26
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,859
Then, what was it?

27
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:52,859
Quick, tell us Conan!

28
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:53,959
Hold your horses.

29
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,759
Try figuring out "Erase the mark of Okuho" first.

30
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,959
I get it.

31
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,559
That's a supermarket!

32
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,259
Huh? A supermarket?

33
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,859
You mean the leaflet that comes with the newspaper?

34
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:05,859
Why?

35
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,759
Pa often says,

36
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,859
"It's ma's job and up to her to do away with the reds."

37
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,059
That's why ma is always in a fix when shopping.

38
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,859
Wrong!

39
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,659
It's not "akaji" (Means red words), but "akashi" (Means mark).

40
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,759
It means something that certifies

41
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,459
or a seal for something.

42
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,459
If it means looking for a seal

43
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,759
it probably means scratching the silver off a lottery ticket with a coin.

44
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,559
But, it says erase the seal.

45
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,959
A postmark?

46
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,559
Don't tell me that the place is?

47
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:37,559
Yeah, Ran was saying that.

48
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:41,359
Ten years ago, the young boy called Shinichi realized that too...

49
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,459
"Ten years ago" -What? Okuho Post Office?

50
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,759
Then, did you decipher the code, Shinichi?

51
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,159
Yeah, half of it.

52
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,259
That word proof means mark, right?

53
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,159
And it's saying to erase that so...

54
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,359
I see! Postmark.

55
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,959
A postmark is stamped as proof that stamps

56
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,359
and postcards have been used

57
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,259
So, it's the post office!

58
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,359
But...

59
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:07,259
The people at the post office don't have strange voices.

60
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,359
No, they don't.

61
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:11,459
I don't know about the part after that yet

62
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,859
but if it's the post office, there's no harm going there.

63
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,559
Huh, why?

64
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,859
Because up to now, we figured out the place,

65
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,959
went there and looked for something red

66
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,959
then we found the next code.

67
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,259
It was a repetition of that, right?

68
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,159
The first red was a fire hydrant.

69
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,959
The next was a red alarm!

70
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,259
And if this third code is a post office...

71
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,459
I love red things.

72
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,159
I got it! It's the post box, a bright red one!

73
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,559
Right!

74
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:47,359
What? He took Ran with him again?

75
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,859
Shinichi?

76
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:52,259
Yes, they went out together with Mr. Agasa, our next door neighbor.

77
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,559
I'm sure they said they were going to Haido Harbor...

78
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,759
Haido Harbor?

79
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,359
That's where a murder was committed last night!

80
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,459
Well, there's nothing to worry about.

81
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,959
I hear that the case was solved this morning.

82
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,559
It's a holiday too.

83
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,559
It's better than staying inside and watching TV and playing games.

84
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:17,759
I think they should be able to go beyond the doors on a grand adventure.

85
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:23,659
Well, our bookworm son was indoors reading book after book.

86
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,859
So I'd like to thank your daughter for taking him out!

87
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,959
I just said that Shinichi is the one who took her out!

88
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,059
Come... Don't worry!

89
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,259
Geez...

90
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:36,459
I mean Yuki, you're always so easygoing and happy-go-lucky.

91
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:37,759
Oh, that's right.

92
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,559
There was a call from the metropolitan police for Yusaku.

93
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:43,859
They said to tell you, "Thank you for your cooperation."

94
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:46,859
"Thanks to you the jewelry was protected."

95
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,859
Oh, that case the other day.

96
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:50,159
That case about that thief, whatever his name was,

97
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,559
that Yusaku brushed away.

98
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,059
No... About that...

99
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,759
It's more like the thief made a perfect escape.

100
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,659
But, why did they call you, Eri?

101
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:07,459
Because they tried to call you a lot of times but they couldn't reach you.

102
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,959
Oh, I get it, Yuu.

103
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,559
You pulled out the telephone line again, didn't you?

104
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,659
Oh, well, I wanted to concentrate on my manuscript

105
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,259
because it's almost deadline.

106
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,959
At any rate, tell those children to come home right away

107
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,459
when you see them!

108
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:22,659
Are you leaving already?

109
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:24,859
I really don't have that much time.

110
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:27,059
I've got a court hearing coming up next week,

111
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,859
so I've got arrangements to make.

112
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:32,159
I see. It's your first court hearing.

113
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,159
Good luck!

114
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,259
Thank you.

115
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,559
Well, I may be beaten to a pulp because it's my first time.

116
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:39,759
If that happens please comfort me...

117
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,359
All right!

118
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:47,759
Didn't you have to make arrangements with somebody yourself too?

119
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,659
Remember, with the magician that you said you became a disciple of,

120
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,159
in order to act out your role.

121
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:56,359
I'd completely forgotten.

122
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:58,959
I promised to meet him in order to write my essay!

123
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,259
Was that today?

124
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,559
"Okuho Post Office" -Hey, Shinichi, the post box is here.

125
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,659
But there's nothing on it.

126
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,959
Strange, I was sure this is the place.

127
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,859
It seems that we have to decipher the phrase,

128
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:15,759
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice" first.

129
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,759
Hello! Here's the evening newspaper!

130
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,059
How're you doing?

131
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:23,259
As you can see, it's "kanko dori" (Means virtually no business).

132
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,559
"Kanko dori"?

133
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,459
What's "Kanko dori"?

134
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,359
It's "kakko" (Means cuckoo).

135
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,059
It's referring to the "gakko" (Means school)!

136
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,359
Let's go, Mouri!

137
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,159
What? Mouri?

138
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,459
Okay.

139
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,359
Hey, Shinichi!

140
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,959
Shinichi!

141
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,359
Geez. I told you before,

142
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,459
not to call me by my first name at school!

143
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,259
It's so embarrassing.

144
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,259
But, Shinichi's your name and you're Shinichi, right?

145
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,159
Call me Kudo!

146
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,559
I'll call you Mouri.

147
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,759
Well, we're not little kids anymore,

148
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,359
so please, okay, Mouri?

149
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:09,159
This is the only red thing near the school.

150
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,459
No, it doesn't seem like anything is pasted on anywhere.

151
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,459
Look carefully because there's got to be something.

152
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,559
It's just not up here.

153
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,759
There's something pasted over here!

154
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,259
I see, this is a code made for children to decipher.

155
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,459
That's why it's pasted on where we can reach it.

156
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,559
What's this?

157
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,159
It's all kanji characters.

158
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,359
You mean you can't read it either, Doc?

159
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,459
No, from everything we've seen so far,

160
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,959
I think that Beika at the top refers to Beika-cho, but...

161
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,559
I wonder if it's Chinese?

162
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,559
The word next to Beika is read as "Chuugoku" (Means China), right?

163
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,159
True, but we can't say for sure that it's Chinese just yet.

164
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,459
"Beikachu"

165
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,959
Beika Middle School...

166
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,159
Was there any Beika Middle School?

167
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,659
No, they have a university and high school

168
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,359
but no Beika Middle School.

169
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:09,359
Besides, why is only the last word enclosed in a square?

170
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,359
True...

171
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,959
"East"

172
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,759
This looks familiar.

173
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,159
Ran!

174
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,059
Dad?

175
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,659
What're you doing here?

176
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:29,059
Oh, well, you see, there's a reason for this...

177
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:34,359
We're playing a game trying to decipher the code that Doc made.

178
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,959
Right, Doc?

179
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,359
Yeah, well, sort of.

180
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,459
-A code? -What brings you here, dad?

181
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,359
Well, it seems that the culprit we arrested this morning

182
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:47,859
used to work at the post office over there,

183
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,759
so I'm here to conduct interrogations with Inspector Megure!

184
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,559
Codes sure sound nostalgic, though!

185
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,259
I used to play spy games with my friends when I was a child too!

186
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,059
But, it's so hard that we can't figure it out.

187
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,059
Let's see, let me take a look!

188
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,659
Okay, but it's really difficult.

189
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:06,959
Gosh! What're you talking about?

190
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,959
We're police officers, you know?

191
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,259
A child's code like this is duck soup. One look and...

192
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,759
Hey, Mouri, can you figure it out?

193
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,759
No, I have no idea.

194
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,959
Well, at any rate,

195
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,859
it's a very well made code.

196
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,259
So you can't solve it after all.

197
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,059
Oh, Inspector!

198
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,459
Since it's been a while, how about playing a game of mahjong tonight?

199
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,659
Oh! I was thinking the same thing!

200
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:44,459
I don't know why but after looking at that code,

201
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,659
I suddenly felt this urge to play mahjong.

202
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:49,259
Oh, you too?

203
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,359
"East" -Mahjong?

204
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,759
Okay then, Ran, make sure you're home before dinner.

205
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,059
Okay!

206
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,861
Shinichi,

207
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:07,661
this is a game called mahjong that was introduced to Japan from China.

208
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,861
Like in the card game seven bridge,

209
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,761
you have to draw the tile you need yourself,

210
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:14,361
or wait for someone to throw the tile you need to win a game.

211
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:16,561
Only, unlike seven bridge,

212
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,661
in mahjong, like poker, you can have a complete hand.

213
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:20,961
This, which is either "Tonba" (Means east wind)

214
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,261
or "Nanba" (Means south wind),

215
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:26,161
is the rule that call "ba" (Means wind) to control the game.

216
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:28,761
What? Mahjong?

217
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:31,961
Are you saying that this code is related to mahjong?

218
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:35,461
Yes, try thinking of it applying mahjong to it.

219
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:39,061
It's true that the third character "Chu" (Means center)

220
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:43,261
and the last character "East" are written on mahjong tiles,

221
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,761
but the other characters are not.

222
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,561
The first two characters "kome" and "hana" (Same sound as Beika)

223
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:49,761
indicate the names of towns,

224
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,761
therefore, Beika-cho is correct.

225
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,161
The last character "East" that is drawn inside a square

226
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:56,361
refers to the prevailing "ba" (Means wind) being played in mahjong.

227
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:57,961
It's called "nanba" (Means south wind), "tonba" (Means east wind)

228
00:11:57,961 --> 00:11:59,461
and so forth, right?

229
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:02,061
The above that "Kuni" and "Shi" refers to "Kokushi".

230
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,361
In other words, it is the name of a special winning hand,

231
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:04,661
"Kokushimuso" which consists of the number 1 and 9 of all the suits

232
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,761
plus all the honor and flower tiles.

233
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:09,661
Then, what about the character "Chu" (Means center) that's above it?

234
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,861
Since "Chu" (Means center) is one of the mahjong tiles,

235
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,361
so it could be "dora" but rather, if you have a "kokushi" hand,

236
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:16,761
you'd be "machi" for the tile of your choice...

237
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,161
"Machi" (Means waiting)?

238
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:21,361
So, if you put all three characters together?

239
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:24,561
"Machi" (Means city), "yaku" (Means role),

240
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:25,561
"ba" (Means place).

241
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:27,461
I see, it's City hall!

242
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:33,661
I see, but there is no city hall in Beika-cho,

243
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:36,361
it would be the ward office or the branch office!

244
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:38,661
Okay, let's go there next then!

245
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:42,261
"Beika Branch Office" -Nothing...

246
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,561
Strange.

247
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:47,561
There's no red thing anywhere, Shinichi.

248
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,461
Well, it's already sunset.

249
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:53,161
Shinichi, why don't we go home today for now

250
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:54,661
and continue again tomorrow?

251
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:57,461
After all, tomorrow's also observed holiday.

252
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:58,761
Observed holiday?

253
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:01,261
I see! Today's a public holiday!

254
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:04,861
What? What do you mean?

255
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:07,661
There should be one standing on the roof of any government office.

256
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,661
"End" -The end?

257
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:22,361
Is this English?

258
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:26,061
It's just the alphabets W and S.

259
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:29,661
But, I don't understand the meaning of this arrow at all.

260
00:13:29,661 --> 00:13:33,461
Since "the end", is written on it, could this be the last code?

261
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:37,861
Hey, could the alphabets W and S have some sort of meaning as is?

262
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:39,661
W and S...

263
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:42,361
I see! It's direction!

264
00:13:42,361 --> 00:13:45,161
S stands for south

265
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,961
and W stands for west!

266
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,961
Then does this arrow mean to go from south to west?

267
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:58,361
Maybe it means to "look that way too" or simply, "look that way"?

268
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:00,961
If so, south is this way.

269
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,261
So, west is...

270
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:03,361
This way.

271
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:11,461
How beautiful!

272
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:16,161
I see. That's what it is.

273
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:18,161
-What? -I know now.

274
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,561
I've figured out who thought up this code.

275
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:22,361
Who did?

276
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,061
My Dad.

277
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,461
Dad asked one of his friends and used the code

278
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,561
to bring us all the way here!

279
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:33,361
Just to show us this sunset!

280
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:34,761
I guess he did this

281
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,361
because I've been cooped up at home recently

282
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:39,261
doing nothing but reading books.

283
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:42,661
But, wasn't it just a coincidence that

284
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:46,561
you met the man who gave you that code?

285
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:51,361
Sonoko said that she heard that a ghost appears in the library at school

286
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:53,761
from a man who came to deliver new books.

287
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:57,361
It's most likely that the man Sonoko was referring to was the man we saw.

288
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:58,461
I see.

289
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,761
Telling Ran's friend about it

290
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,861
would guarantee that you would hear about it too.

291
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,161
And since you can't resist mystery stories,

292
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,261
you would be lured to go to school.

293
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:08,761
Exactly!

294
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:13,761
In other words, dad manipulated us just the way he wanted to!

295
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,261
But it's nice

296
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,961
that we got to see this beautiful sunset too.

297
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,061
Oh, I hate to admit it,

298
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:23,361
but I totally agree, Ran.

299
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,561
Oh, sorry, Mouri.

300
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,361
Come off it! Ran's okay!

301
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:29,161
I prefer you calling me Ran!

302
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,961
Is it no good?

303
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:38,661
If...

304
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:41,361
if that's the way you want it then...

305
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,061
I guess it's okay with me.

306
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:44,261
Really?

307
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:46,261
All right, Shinichi!

308
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,061
Hey!

309
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,661
Cut it out!

310
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:53,961
I've got to thank your father!

311
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,861
Oh, come on, if you're going to thank anybody,

312
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,661
thank the man who gave us this code,

313
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:00,161
that's still hanging around nearby.

314
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:01,861
-What? -What?

315
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,461
Is that guy somewhere nearby?

316
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:07,661
Yeah. In order to make sure that we get to see this beautiful sunset,

317
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:10,761
he's got to be glued to us, right?

318
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,461
Because he would have no idea how long it would take us to solve the code!

319
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:17,861
I see! He would have to watch us right through,

320
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:21,161
then make it to the next place before us and get the next code ready,

321
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:22,661
adjusting the time and all.

322
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:25,061
In other words, so long as he got us to come here,

323
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:27,961
the codes that were found in between could've been anything!

324
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:31,861
But, maybe he's your father.

325
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:34,761
No, dad would already have appeared saying something like,

326
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,861
"What took you so long?"

327
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:40,461
Hey, Mr. Yesterday Night!

328
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:42,561
I know you're somewhere listening!

329
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:45,361
I'll leave my opinion in this wallet that you gave me last night

330
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:47,561
so come and get it!

331
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:51,861
I'll hide it behind the book "Gentleman Burglar" that you were reading!

332
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:53,961
Come for sure!

333
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:00,761
That's why the message,

334
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:04,361
"Thank you, 1st grade, class A, Ran Mouri"

335
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:06,061
is written on the paper inside the wallet!

336
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,661
What a nice story.

337
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,461
But the book that the wallet was found behind...

338
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:15,061
Wasn't "Gentleman Burglar", was it?

339
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:16,961
It can't be helped.

340
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:18,861
Ten years have already gone by.

341
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:21,661
So, even the location of the book's been changed several times.

342
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:26,061
I guess the man never came to get the book, though.

343
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,261
I would think that he'd know where the original place the book was

344
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:31,361
even if its location were to be changed, right?

345
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,861
I guess so too.

346
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:35,161
But, the man who thought up the code,

347
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:37,261
seems to have run out of everything at the end.

348
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:38,861
Huh, why do you think so?

349
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:42,361
Because although the riddles were interesting till part way,

350
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,761
towards the end, all it had were the codes "S" and "W"

351
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:46,761
and "look to the west."

352
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,361
It kind of fizzled out at the end.

353
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:52,661
No.

354
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,461
My deduction is wrong!

355
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:56,761
If he wanted us to see the setting sun,

356
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,461
"W" would've sufficed.

357
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:01,461
The "S" and arrow wouldn't be necessary.

358
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:03,061
Then, why the arrow?

359
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,061
What are the "S", "W" and "arrow" supposed to be then?

360
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:10,761
And why only at the end, there are symbols that indicate directions?

361
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:13,361
Direction?

362
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:14,561
Conan?

363
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,861
I'm sure the first was...

364
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:17,961
Harbor.

365
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,661
"Toriya Castle Ruins" -Next, is the castle ruins...

366
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,761
The "flood gate" with the same name.

367
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:29,361
A post office.

368
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:30,761
A middle school.

369
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,061
"Beika Branch Office"

370
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:38,361
City hall.

371
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,461
They're symbols used on maps.

372
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,961
Come to think of it, the symbol for post office

373
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:46,461
is the character "proof" inside a circle.

374
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,861
So, "erase this" means...

375
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,361
This?

376
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:54,961
Only the symbol of the ward office was drawn vertically,

377
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:59,361
so it must mean to change the position of this symbol like this...

378
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:01,661
and as for the "S", "arrow" and "W",

379
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:03,161
means from south to west.

380
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:05,761
So, if this is placed this way.

381
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:13,261
Oxhide?

382
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,361
Leather?

383
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:16,761
It's this wallet!

384
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,461
We were wrong!

385
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,561
I mistakenly thought that the one who made the code was nearby...

386
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:30,261
I'll hide it behind the book "Gentleman Burglar" that you were reading!

387
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,661
Come for sure!

388
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:34,561
-Conan? -Hey?

389
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:35,961
What's going on?

390
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:38,361
I see. I get it.

391
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:41,261
No kid could figure out a code like this.

392
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:42,761
It was for dad.

393
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,861
This code was made for dad to figure out to begin with.

394
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:47,261
If I couldn't figure it out,

395
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:50,461
the man figured I would beg dad to help me decipher it.

396
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:53,461
That means, ten years ago...

397
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:55,361
But, if so, how would what happened?

398
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:59,361
"Ten years ago"

399
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:03,161
Thank you so much for today.

400
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,161
Oh, did you catch cold?

401
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:09,661
No, maybe somebody's talking stink about me.

402
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:11,961
Because after all, we magicians thrive on deceiving people,

403
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,461
in other words, we're swindlers.

404
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:18,361
No way! You're not a swindler.

405
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:22,461
But it's too bad Mr. Kudo couldn't come here.

406
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:26,361
Rather, it would probably be more accurate to say I was relieved.

407
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:30,561
To Kudo, magic is like constructing a building on sand.

408
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,161
He would see through the trick in an instant.

409
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,761
My, how modest.

410
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:38,261
You're the "seventh knight" that I have encountered,

411
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,261
Toichi Kuroba of all people.

412
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:43,561
I read that essay every time.

413
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:44,961
My wife is a great fan.

414
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,161
I'll give you this,

415
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:49,461
because middle-aged lady is beautiful!

416
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:52,161
Huh?

417
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:54,861
Hey, Kaito! Stay still.

418
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:57,661
My, what a peppy young lad!

419
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:59,561
But, sonny,

420
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:03,961
the words beautiful and middle-aged lady don't match!

421
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,761
Since I won't get to see Kudo,

422
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,461
could you tell him to mail his reply to the friend of mine

423
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:13,761
that I mentioned the other day, whose letter that will be delivered here,

424
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:14,961
to this address.

425
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:18,061
Oh, about the letter from a fan of Yusaku, right?

426
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:19,461
When I told him about it,

427
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:23,561
he said he already wrote an answer for me to take it to that person.

428
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:27,161
But, his answer was not one you would call a letter or anything like that.

429
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,761
Wait!

430
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:32,861
Could it have been just one exclamation point?

431
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:34,061
Am I right?

432
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,361
What?

433
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,061
Yes.

434
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:39,061
But, how did you know?

435
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:42,461
Just as would be expected of the one who gave me my name.

436
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,561
Huh?

437
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:46,861
That certain friend that I'm referring to

438
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:50,861
also wrote a similar letter consisting of just one symbol.

439
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:56,661
"Dear Yusaku Kudo".

440
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:59,761
"Kaito No. 1412".

441
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:01,661
Come to think of it, the other day...

442
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:04,661
Did you know that Yusaku is the one who gave Thief Kid his name?

443
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:06,361
He misread the scribble of the notes of a reporter

444
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:10,761
and thought that the number 1412 that was written was "K-I-D."

445
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:14,561
I'm your sibling.

446
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:17,461
Rather, I should say, your younger brother.

447
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,561
That's why back then, he...

448
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:22,761
Are you gonna be able to stop me next time?

449
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:25,661
Yeah. Of course.

450
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:27,761
But, what's the meaning of this?

451
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:29,361
This question mark.

452
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:01,361
"Next Episode" -I wonder who's the man in the picture with mom.

453
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:05,161
Come to think of it, she wasn't wearing her ring.

454
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:07,661
Which means that maybe...

455
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:10,261
She's having an affair?

456
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:12,261
Let's go after her, Conan!

457
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:15,161
It's full of scratches.

458
00:24:15,161 --> 00:24:18,761
The words that came out with tears.

459
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:21,061
I see. So that's what it was.

460
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:22,961
Next Conan,

461
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:27,061
"Attorney Eri Kisaki Falls in Love"

462
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,261
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:47,061
"Baby talk"

464
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:48,661
I'm dating in the next episode!

465
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:50,861
-With who? -Attorney Kisaki.

466
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:51,961
-What? -What?
