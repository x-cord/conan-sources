1
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:03,561
Conan, here goes!

2
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:05,061
"Naoko Kokubo"

3
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:07,361
Nice pass, Mitsuhiko!

4
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:09,061
Over here, this way!

5
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,561
Genta!

6
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:13,361
I got it!

7
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:22,061
Call the police!

8
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:38,761
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

9
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,161
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

10
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:42,961
The foul-mouthed myna bird

11
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:45,161
lets slip something unexpected.

12
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,961
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,261
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,761
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,320
"The Foul-Mouthed Myna Bird"

16
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,375
Did the victim have a pet bird?

17
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,675
Yes.

18
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:37,475
A myna bird.

19
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:41,475
From the looks of this bird cage...

20
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:44,375
Yes. And since that window was opened...

21
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,175
It must've fled outside.

22
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:48,575
Hello.

23
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,875
Is this the Kokubo residence?

24
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,475
This is the Midoridai Ekimae Police Station calling.

25
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:58,075
Your pet Myna bird, Nine, is here at the station.

26
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,575
I see.

27
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,475
So your name's Nine?

28
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:04,275
Your name's Santaro the Great Dunce, right?

29
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,875
What?

30
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,775
I'm Kogoro Mouri!

31
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:10,675
Come on, don't pick a fight with a myna bird.

32
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:13,375
What? She was killed?

33
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,575
Mrs. Kokubo?

34
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:18,475
You fool, idiot, imbecile, stu...

35
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:19,975
It flew away.

36
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:27,175
Mr. Mouri, are you the one who caught the myna bird?

37
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,375
We were just looking for it.

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,275
Will you bring it over?

39
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:33,675
What? You let it go?

40
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:36,275
You idiot! You don't have to come!

41
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,275
Even the Inspector called me an idiot.

42
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:45,875
What seems to be the matter?

43
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,875
He sprained his ankle while drinking

44
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,175
and today we were on the way to the hospital.

45
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:55,075
I told you, I don't need to go to the hospital...

46
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:58,775
See?

47
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,675
Excuse me.

48
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,975
Apparently, that young man is Mrs. Kokubo's nephew.

49
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:08,075
She was always angry

50
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,875
because he always asked for allowance.

51
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,375
But she used to always smile

52
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,675
and watch us even when we were noisy.

53
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:16,975
How sad that she passed away.

54
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:25,275
"Mamoru Kokubo (30)"

55
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:28,475
The man who came to visit the victim

56
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:31,175
is the person who discovered the corpse.

57
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:34,275
Yes. The ones who were living in this house

58
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:39,275
were the victim and the live-in house maid, Emi Yahagi.

59
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:42,875
And where is that house maid right now?

60
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,675
According to a housewife living in the neighborhood,

61
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,775
she always goes shopping at this time

62
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:49,575
because it's the victim's afternoon nap.

63
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:53,475
It's a daily routine that is repeated every day.

64
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:56,075
But it's way past 2:00 already.

65
00:04:57,175 --> 00:05:00,075
How was the relationship between the victim and Ms. Emi Yahagi?

66
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,575
There are no bad rumor about them.

67
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:05,475
But it seems that Ms. Emi Yahagi's mother

68
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,775
was sick for a long time,

69
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,775
so Emi was asking for a raise in pay.

70
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:16,575
There are no traces of intrusion from the outside?

71
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:21,175
The kitchen door is a semi-auto lock

72
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,275
and that door was locked.

73
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,975
There are two keys.

74
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:28,275
The victim and Ms. Emi Yahagi had one each.

75
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,875
It seems like the keys cannot be duplicated.

76
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,075
So the only place to go in and out of here is the front entrance.

77
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:37,075
Is her nephew, Mamoru Kokubo, a student?

78
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:40,775
No, he's studying juvenile literature or something.

79
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,375
In other words, he's still unemployed.

80
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,175
What time was the victim found?

81
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:47,275
13:55.

82
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:49,975
What? That's rather accurate.

83
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,675
Did he say so?

84
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:54,875
No, the elementary school students said so.

85
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,275
Elementary school students?

86
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:57,575
Are you sure they're reliable?

87
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:59,175
Yes, we are!

88
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:03,075
Don't underestimate kids!

89
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:08,075
See, Inspector.

90
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:09,575
I see.

91
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:13,075
Nine escaped.

92
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,975
You know that myna bird, too?

93
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:16,975
Yes.

94
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,575
Because rude Nine was notorious.

95
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:26,175
No! It's my fault that the window is opened.

96
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,175
I'm sorry!

97
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:40,375
I see. The myna bird flew away from there.

98
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:44,575
We were playing at the park in front of the entrance.

99
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:46,775
Nobody seems to have gone in or out of the house

100
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:50,075
after Ms. Emi Yahagi left the house.

101
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,075
Yes.

102
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,175
"Emi Yahagi (18)" -Gosh.

103
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,275
Madam...

104
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:04,875
You ran into an abandoned baby

105
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,075
and went looking for the baby's mother?

106
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,075
Yes, the baby was asleep in the stroller.

107
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:11,975
And what happened to the mother?

108
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:15,475
Two girls that passed by found her for me.

109
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:18,475
It seems like she was going after her hat that flew away.

110
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:22,875
You were late because you were watching the baby in the stroller?

111
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,375
I was worried that madam would scold me, though.

112
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,975
I didn't expect this to happen.

113
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:32,975
The problem is whether you can prove your story or not.

114
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:33,975
What?

115
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,675
You are the only one besides the victim

116
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:38,575
who has the key to the kitchen door.

117
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:40,975
You could've secretly returned to the house and killed her

118
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:44,375
and gone back to shopping afterwards.

119
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,975
I didn't do it!

120
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:48,675
What is the name of the baby's mother?

121
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:50,975
Well, I don't know because I didn't ask.

122
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,675
Then what about the girls?

123
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:53,975
I didn't...

124
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,875
You didn't get their names?

125
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,075
If I knew, I would've told you!

126
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:02,075
Inspector Megure!

127
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,675
Pops Kogoro!

128
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:06,975
Conan?

129
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:10,375
What are you kids doing here?

130
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,775
Mr. Sayama?

131
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,275
Well, hello.

132
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,075
What a terrible thing to have happened.

133
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:18,975
Madam was enraged that you sold her a forgery.

134
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,575
Who is he?

135
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:24,675
"Yotaro Sayama (60)" -He's Mr. Sayama, the owner of an antique shop.

136
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,475
I met him at the hospital.

137
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:29,575
Please don't push yourself too far.

138
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,675
I'll give you a prescription right away.

139
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:34,375
Doctor.

140
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,575
What seems to be the matter, Mr. Sayama?

141
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:39,775
Isn't there anything you can do so I can drive?

142
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:42,375
I can't work like this.

143
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,575
No way. You'll have to wait at least three more days.

144
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,875
"Haido Hospital"

145
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,575
Is that the one we just saw a while ago?

146
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:56,475
That's a crow, not a myna bird.

147
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:58,175
Myna bird?

148
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:01,875
You mean the one that's flying around pulling the red yarn along?

149
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:06,575
I just thought it was Mrs. Kokubo's myna bird.

150
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,875
What is it?

151
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,675
I see. Of course, you haven't heard.

152
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:14,975
What?

153
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:19,675
I brought him because he seemed to know the victim.

154
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:20,975
Despite what he says,

155
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:23,475
he just wants to stick his nose in the case.

156
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,875
But I think he was right

157
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,575
to have brought that person here.

158
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:28,775
What?

159
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:32,375
Madam used to collect rare old books.

160
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,475
But the book that she bought from Mr. Sayama...

161
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,775
No. As to that, I was also deceived.

162
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:41,575
That's why I immediately told her the truth.

163
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:44,975
But you didn't pay her back yet, did you?

164
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:49,175
I heard just before I left the house.

165
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:53,675
Madam, would you like me to put the potted flower plant outside

166
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,675
back into the kitchen?

167
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:56,875
"Naoko Kokubo (70)"

00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,975
You can do that later.

169
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:01,575
Enough of your excuses already, Mr. Sayama!

170
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:04,275
It's this late already.

171
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:07,375
Come here immediately and give me back my money!

172
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,175
I feel sorry for him.

173
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:14,675
I can't raise money with this kind of injury.

174
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:16,675
Enough of your excuses.

175
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:19,775
In other words, are you saying that you can't pay her back?

176
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,575
You get angry just like Madam, little Emi.

177
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:26,075
Don't call me little!

178
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,975
Inspector! We got a report from forensics.

179
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:33,075
There is an apparent strangulation mark on the neck of the victim.

180
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,975
The murder weapon was the white shawl

181
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,575
that the victim was wearing around her neck.

182
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:45,175
The estimated time of murder is between 12:55 and 13:55.

183
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:51,075
No, the actual time of murder is between 13:35 to 13:55.

184
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,275
I have to go to the restroom.

185
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,475
Come right back, okay?

186
00:10:56,475 --> 00:10:57,475
Sure thing.

187
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,075
Excuse me.

188
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,675
What is the function of this room?

189
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:06,775
Yes. This was my aunt's office.

190
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,975
She used to write children stories.

191
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:11,375
It was a long time ago, though.

192
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:20,275
All these books are written by Mrs. Naoko Kokubo?

193
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:26,475
I knew that her name sounded familiar.

194
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:29,675
If I remember correctly, she stopped writing because of a scandal.

195
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,675
I see. Thank you.

196
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,075
Mr. Sayama was seen talking on his cell phone

197
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:40,975
in front of Midoridai Station at 12:55.

198
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:43,375
It matches Ms. Yahagi's testimony.

199
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,775
How long does it take from the station to here?

200
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:47,475
Since there is no evidence that a cab was used,

201
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:50,075
I'm sure it took at least 45 minutes on foot.

202
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,075
Excuse me.

203
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:55,275
Yes?

204
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,675
What?

205
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,475
Gosh. What's this party for?

206
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:01,575
You're the children I met a while ago!

207
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:04,375
Wait. You work as a maid here?

208
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,675
Yes!

209
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:07,975
Nine is with you, too?

210
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:10,375
We knew he belonged here because he's so famous.

211
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,775
Thank you!

212
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:17,375
Conan and his friends can be the witnesses for Mamoru Kokubo,

213
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,575
but what about Mr. Sayama's?

214
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:22,375
We've got the victim's incoming call history

215
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,975
from 12:50 to 13:35.

216
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,775
It sure is a long conversation.

217
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:31,475
So he went to the hospital after that.

218
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:33,375
I wonder if he could've committed the crime?

219
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:37,275
The hospital is about halfway between here and the station.

220
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,775
After Mr. Sayama called from the station,

221
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:45,175
he headed for Mrs. Kokubo's residence and killed her.

222
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:47,375
And if he were to head for the hospital after that,

223
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:52,275
the time of murder and Mr. Mouri's testimony don't match.

224
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,775
The answer is clear.

225
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:59,475
The only one without a witness for her alibi is Ms. Emi Yahagi.

226
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,575
This time,

227
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:04,875
I guess the Sleeping Kogoro won't be needed.

228
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:15,287
They all have alibis?

229
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:19,187
Yes! I'll be witness to testimony anytime!

230
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:21,687
Was that an inconvenience?

231
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,587
Why don't you go hang yourself with spaghetti?

232
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:32,787
Go bash your head against the corner of a block of tofu and die!

233
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,687
Rude bird!

234
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:44,587
I wonder why Nine has such a foul mouth?

235
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:47,687
Nine let us catch him without putting up a fight a while ago.

236
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:49,787
He's domesticated and clever,

237
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,787
but all the words he's been taught are foul.

238
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,387
He could've been influenced by Madam.

239
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:59,187
She was betrayed by the Sensei that she trusted

240
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:02,087
and ended up not being able to trust anybody.

241
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:04,887
That's why she figured all compliments were lies.

242
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:10,087
To her, bad mouthing was more trustable.

243
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:11,287
You mean the scandal of

244
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:14,187
when Mrs. Kokubo plagiarized the work of her Sensei.

245
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:18,787
But according to insiders, it was the other way around.

246
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:21,387
Madam isn't the one who plagiarized.

247
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:24,287
It was Sensei who couldn't come up with an idea.

248
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:27,787
But the media favored the great writer

249
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,187
and wouldn't listen to Madam's story.

250
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:34,187
They're all blind.

251
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:37,187
Well, it's the usual.

252
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:42,187
Who of the three murdered Naoko?

253
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:47,987
That's why she told me to stop being a writer.

254
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,387
But Mamoru, she used to always tell me

255
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:56,887
that one day, you would become successful.

256
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:04,387
I see.

257
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,887
What? That potted plant...

258
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:12,987
This...

259
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:15,887
Did you put this inside for me, Mamoru?

260
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:17,987
No, I didn't.

261
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,987
I see.

262
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:23,587
Hey, how bad were granny's legs?

263
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:27,087
She told me that she could barely ride the wheelchair.

264
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,887
I can't stand the stench. It stinks.

265
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,887
Stink?

266
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,387
Is it about the perp?

267
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,787
Who knows?

268
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:37,687
Nine's only a bird.

269
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,987
I want eels over rice.

270
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:44,387
I'm hungry.

271
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,387
He's mimicking me.

272
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:52,687
Come to think of it, what is this yarn for?

273
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,887
Madam put it on this morning

274
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,787
so that he would be easily visible even if he flew off again.

275
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:59,687
It sure does stand out.

276
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:04,187
Because Mr. Sayama also said the bird is pulling the red yarn.

277
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:09,287
Hey. Is there anything that smells in this house?

278
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:12,287
If you're referring to pickled vegetables, there are all kinds.

279
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,487
Because it was aunt's hobby.

280
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:17,887
I don't smell anything, though.

281
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:19,887
It's because it's being made in the basement.

282
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,587
Where is that?

283
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,687
Over here.

284
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,087
Did you find something?

285
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:34,687
I can't stand the stench. It stinks.

286
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:38,587
So that's the story after all!

287
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:44,187
Rude bird!

288
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:46,487
He doesn't look like he's going to sleep.

289
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,287
Excuse me.

290
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,487
Inspector! Mr. Mouri is...

291
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,287
We've been waiting for this.

292
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:00,887
Everyone, thanks for waiting.

293
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,887
This case was indeed a difficult one.

294
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:09,187
Because all three suspects have an alibi.

295
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:13,887
But there's just one person whose alibi cannot be established.

296
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:16,287
Alibi that cannot be established?

297
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,587
Whose alibi is that?

298
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:22,087
The owner of Sayama Bookshop,

299
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:24,687
Mr. Yotaro Sayama.

300
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,687
What do you think you're saying?

301
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:30,987
You're the one who established my alibi.

302
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:33,387
Then let me ask you.

303
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,087
It seems that you saw the myna bird

304
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:37,887
with the red yarn attached to it.

305
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,187
I did. So?

306
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,587
Nine left the leg ring with the red yarn on it

307
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:44,587
back at the police station when he flew away.

308
00:17:44,587 --> 00:17:46,287
When did you see the myna bird

309
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:49,387
with the red yarn attached to it?

310
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:52,387
That's right. Dad, you're fantastic.

311
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,987
I saw it on the way to the hospital!

312
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:58,287
The myna bird was flying with a red yarn attached to it!

313
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:02,287
I see. But how could you tell

314
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:06,487
that it was a red yarn and not a red string?

315
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,087
It seems that the victim

316
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,287
had attached the yarn to Nine just this morning.

317
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:15,087
I guess... I just happened to misuse the word.

318
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:16,987
But Mr. Mouri,

319
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:21,987
Mr. Sayama was witnessed at 12:55 at Midoridai Station.

320
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:26,387
If he came here after he talked to Naoko at 13:55

321
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:29,287
as we can see on his incoming call history and killed her,

322
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:31,887
it would've been impossible for him

323
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,987
to meet Mr. Mouri at the hospital.

324
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:38,887
What if Mr. Sayama took the call he got from the victim

325
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:42,887
and talked to her while moving along?

326
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:47,087
The victim told him to come immediately on the phone.

327
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:49,987
He did as he was told. That's all there is to it.

328
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:51,587
I see.

329
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:53,087
By the time he finished talking on the phone,

330
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:55,887
he was already at this house.

331
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:59,687
But he couldn't have used the front door,

332
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:02,587
based on Conan and his friends' testimonies.

333
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:05,987
If so, how on earth did he get into house?

334
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:08,087
The kitchen door.

335
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:10,187
It should've been locked, though?

336
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:13,487
The one who opened the door was the victim,

337
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,687
Mrs. Naoko Kokubo herself.

338
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,687
What?

339
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:20,287
The potted flower plant is the proof.

340
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:23,187
That's why it was moved over.

341
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,587
The victim who called you to come through the kitchen door

342
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:29,587
told you to move the potted flower plant at the back door inside

343
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,387
since you were there, anyway.

344
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:34,087
I see.

345
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:36,487
After committing the crime, going out was easy

346
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:39,187
because the door is semi-automatic.

347
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:42,287
All you had to do was push the button to lock the door,

348
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:43,987
Mr. Sayama.

349
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:46,187
But look at me!

350
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:49,087
I can't use my right hand!

351
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,787
Right?

352
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,687
I couldn't have done it.

353
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:55,687
You heard what the doctor told me, didn't you?

354
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:57,787
I did.

355
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:00,387
That was your last resort.

356
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:04,587
Then let me ask you again.

357
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:09,787
You're the one that said this room stinks, right?

358
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:14,687
Clever Nine mimicked even your tone of voice.

359
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:18,587
Then what on earth smelled so bad?

360
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:20,487
Conan, are you there?

361
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:21,487
I'm here!

362
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:26,987
I got it. I'll try.

363
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:37,087
All done!

364
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:41,887
In other words,

365
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:44,887
this is how you choked and killed her using one hand.

366
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:21,387
She was crazy.

367
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:24,787
"But paying me back isn't enough."

368
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:27,387
"Post a notice of apology on the door of you shop."

369
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,187
"Publish an apology in the papers."

370
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:33,287
"Go the basement and stir the pickled vegetables."

371
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:36,987
I couldn't take it anymore!

372
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:42,787
We'll hear you out at the station.

373
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:18,487
She wrote such beautiful stories and yet...

374
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:20,887
I couldn't imagine

375
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:24,887
that she had such a frightening side to her.

376
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,087
In other words,

377
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:28,387
women are not what they look on the outside, right?

378
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:33,987
Conan.

379
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:44,187
"Next Episode"

380
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:45,987
Traitors...

381
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:56,587
shall be punished.

382
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:05,287
So you came too,

383
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:06,987
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

384
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:12,887
Next Conan, "The Traitor's Stage (Part 1)"
