1
00:00:01,352 --> 00:00:03,452
Eisuke Hondo, searches for his older sister

2
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,552
who looks exactly like Kir of the Black Organization,

3
00:00:05,552 --> 00:00:08,252
more commonly know as Rena Mizunashi.

4
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:10,952
We find out that his father had been an informant for the CIA,

5
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:15,152
who seems to have been killed by Rena Mizunashi four years ago.

6
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:19,652
After Eisuke had visited the hospital

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,552
where Rena Mizunashi was lying in a coma,

8
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:24,952
no one had been able to get a hold of him.

9
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:26,952
Moreover, we find out that

10
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:30,152
a member of the Organization is hiding in the hospital.

11
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:33,252
There's no reason why they would leave a boy

12
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:34,952
who knows the boss' address,

13
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,452
and is trying to approach them, doing as he pleases.

14
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:41,852
Well, if you're worrying about what's become of NOC's kid,

15
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:43,852
it's no use.

16
00:00:58,052 --> 00:00:59,652
Sizzling hot suspense.

17
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:02,452
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

18
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:04,252
A member of the Organization hides in the hospital.

19
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:06,352
The dangerous risk of disclosing their identity!

20
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:07,952
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,752
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:12,052
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,260
"Red and Black Crash: Raid."

24
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,178
"Haido Central Hospital."

25
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,019
Oh, wait, sonny!

26
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,719
I finally found you!

27
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,019
I've been looking for you.

28
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,519
Looking for me?

29
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,419
Did you recall something about the man we talked about a while ago?

30
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:06,119
No, I just remembered something about the boy wearing glasses!

31
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,819
His name was Eisuke, wasn't it?

32
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,419
Yes, right.

33
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,719
Just as I thought!

34
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,919
He's the boy who went through surgery back then!

35
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,419
Huh?

36
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,419
I knew he looked familiar.

37
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,119
If I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure that

38
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:24,019
he's the boy who underwent surgery at the hospital I worked for before.

39
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,919
Then, was that a hospital in Osaka?

40
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,519
Because I heard from Eisuke that right after his mother died,

41
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,619
he moved to Osaka and got into an accident.

42
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:36,319
No. He underwent surgery at a hospital in Tokyo.

43
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,619
Of course not here, but at another hospital.

44
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,519
His mother accompanied him then,

45
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,719
so I think it was before he moved?

46
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,619
Huh, his mother?

47
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:48,219
And? What kind of surgery did he go through?

48
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:51,119
Well, he... Eisuke...

49
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,519
had leukemia.

50
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:57,019
Gee, but after going through such a big surgery,

51
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,219
if he got in an accident again,

52
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,519
talk about haunted with bad luck, that boy.

53
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,519
Good news!

54
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
The people who have been admitted to the hospital

55
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,819
between the 18th and 21st

56
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,719
for illnesses or wounds that are not very serious

57
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,819
and are men, have been narrowed down to three.

58
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,419
The first one is Mr. Chotaro Shinki,

59
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,219
who was admitted on the 18th for a broken right leg.

60
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,919
Pardon the unclear image

61
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,019
because I rushed to film him in secret.

62
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,019
The 2nd one is Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda

63
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,319
who was admitted on the 19th for a sprained neck.

64
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,619
And the third is Mr. Chugo Nishiya

65
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:42,419
who was admitted on the 21st for acute hip pains.

66
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,519
All three men requested private rooms,

67
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,419
and no one seems to have come to visit them.

68
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:52,219
Which means that they don't know yet that Rena Mizunashi is here,

69
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:55,219
or that we're sheltering her.

70
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:56,419
I guess not.

71
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,419
If they already know,

72
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,119
they would have sent in several members

73
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,019
disguised as friends and visitors

74
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,319
to check on the number of FBI agents and our positions.

75
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,019
At any rate, inform the agents

76
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,019
who are guarding Rena Mizunashi's room about this.

77
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,719
Tell them to make sure they know exactly

78
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,319
what the three men look like.

79
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,619
Yes, sir.

80
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:26,519
How's she doing?

81
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,819
She's still unconscious.

82
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,219
I want you to look at something.

83
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:34,019
A picture?

84
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,219
Huh? Members of the Organization are in this hospital?

85
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,519
Yes, the suspicious ones are these three.

86
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,519
If one of these men approaches this room,

87
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,019
ward him off somehow.

88
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,019
Don't ever make the mistake of letting him inside

89
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:53,019
this room of Sleeping Beauty, okay?

90
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,919
"Haido Central Hospital."

91
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,519
If you push the nails of the feet strongly, like so,

92
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,219
and apply painful stimulation.

93
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:07,919
If the patient is conscious,

94
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,719
she should awaken or frown.

95
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:16,919
It seems to be that she is still in a coma.

96
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,119
I see.

97
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:20,419
Well, if we perform the brainwave test

98
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,919
that is scheduled three days later now,

99
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,219
we can find out for sure, I think.

100
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,619
No, that's enough, doctor.

101
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,219
I'm sorry to have called you out here.

102
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:32,419
I wanted to confirm her condition above all.

103
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,219
I would really like to hear why you're so anxious about it but won't,

104
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:41,219
because you saved me in LA when I was attacked by a mugger,

105
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:46,019
and I believe that you would never do anything evil.

106
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,719
You haven't told him about anything, I see.

107
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:54,419
No, the only thing he knows is that we're FBI agents,

108
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,819
and that she is a major witness to a certain case.

109
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,219
I just couldn't come out and say that

110
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,719
the famous announcer Rena Mizunashi

111
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:06,719
is a member of the dangerous Organization we're pursuing

112
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,919
and that her comrade may come in search of her to this hospital

113
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,819
disguised as a patient.

114
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:16,219
All the more, for his own safety in the future.

115
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,919
How lucky we are that she's still asleep in a coma,

116
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,819
when things could've been worse.

117
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,419
Even if they were to track down this hospital,

118
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,319
it would be too risky trying to take a person

119
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,519
who is unconscious out of here.

120
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,919
No, we've got to make 100% sure that they won't find her,

121
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,819
for the sake of the Hospital Head who offered to cooperate with us too.

122
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,619
Yes, even if he were to know nothing about it,

123
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,919
cooperating to shelter her,

124
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,019
would make him a target of the Organization.

125
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,219
The problem is how do we find out which of the three men

126
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:56,719
is the one from the Organization that's hiding here.

127
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,819
If I were to do things my way, I would take all three of them

128
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,019
to another hospital and torture them to death.

129
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,919
This is Japan.

130
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,019
Besides, we couldn't possibly do something like that

131
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,519
when we've snuck in here ourselves

132
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,319
without informing the Japanese police force.

133
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,819
Moreover, two of the three are innocent ordinary patients.

134
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,019
If we approach the suspects carelessly,

135
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,219
the Organization will surely figure out that we're FBI agents

136
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,419
and there's a danger of them finding out that she is in this hospital.

137
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,519
Then!

138
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,319
Why don't we try using the good method that I thought up?

139
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,519
Huh? A good method?

140
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,019
I'll tell you about it

141
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,319
after we leave this room and go to another room.

142
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:40,519
With two foreign looking people and a man with evil looking eyes

143
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,419
going out of this room at once,

144
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,819
because you all stand out, if someone sees you,

145
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:46,919
rumor will spread fast!

146
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,219
There's no one in the corridor now.

147
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,819
Okay.

148
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:52,619
Let's change rooms!

149
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,419
Oh, please come too.

150
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,119
Huh, me too?

151
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,119
I want you to hear about it too.

152
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,119
It'll only take a minute!

153
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,719
Come, quick,

154
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,319
quick.

155
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,919
Huh?

156
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,019
I forgot something!

157
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,519
Wait here, I'll go get it!

158
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,719
And, did you get what you forgot?

159
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,819
Oh, no.

160
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,219
I seem to have made a mistake!

161
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,819
I'm sorry!

162
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,619
Will you go back to the room after all, sir?

163
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:45,819
Huh?

164
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,919
Because we'll be in big trouble

165
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,919
if that announcer suddenly gets up, you see.

166
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:59,294
You're going to listen to what the three men have to say?

167
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:00,294
Alone?

168
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:02,994
Unless I'm alone, they'll figure things out right away.

169
00:10:02,994 --> 00:10:05,494
Being a child, I'm pretty sure the man

170
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,694
that's a member of the evil Organization will be off his guard!

171
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:11,294
It may be true, that even they wouldn't expect you

172
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:13,494
to be as sharp as you are but,

173
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:16,494
I wonder about whether we can all trust you alone,

174
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:19,394
to judge which of the men are from the Organization.

175
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:20,994
It's not going to be only me.

176
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,994
I'm going to have all the FBI members think with me!

177
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:25,594
I'm going to have you all check

178
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,794
the image and sound on the video camera

179
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,194
that I'll secretly set up on myself.

180
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,494
I think it would be better to hear them out

181
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:34,794
while you give me instructions, but...

182
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:39,094
You don't want waves that will be harmful to medical devices.

183
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:40,394
Hey, sonny.

184
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:42,794
I hope you're ready for what you're jumping into.

185
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:44,994
Doing what you're planning to do,

186
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:48,094
the guys are going to know what you look like whether you like it or not.

187
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:51,394
They'll see you as our dog who cooperated with us.

188
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,694
If that happens, the sparks of fire

189
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:57,394
will not only shower on you.

190
00:10:57,394 --> 00:11:01,194
I'm in the same boat as the head of the hospital we saw a while ago.

191
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:05,494
I have trust in you FBI agents!

192
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:08,294
I know that you'll catch the bad guys

193
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:11,194
and never let them get away!

194
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:17,894
Okay, are you ready?

195
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:22,594
I set the mic and camera in the right collar of your jacket.

196
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:24,894
If they should ever find out...

197
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:28,794
Shout aloud and you will come and rescue me, right?

198
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:29,994
Yes.

199
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:33,894
Then, let's start with Mr. Chugo Nishiya.

200
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:43,294
Hey, you're the boy staying at Mr. Mouri's place?

201
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:45,994
Just what're you doing here?

202
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,794
Nakamichi of the soccer club?

203
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,494
Huh? Do you know them?

204
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:51,194
No!

205
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:53,294
I came to visit my friend and got lost,

206
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:55,394
so I was just asking them for directions!

207
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:58,594
What happened to your head, Nakamichi?

208
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,594
Oh, this?

209
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:04,094
I got hit on the head and passed out during club practice.

210
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:06,594
I thought I was fine,

211
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,394
but the doctor said that he wanted to give me a detailed examination

212
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,894
so I'm being hospitalized for a few days.

213
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:14,794
It's because you try to act cool and do overhead shots!

214
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:18,994
Hey, how do you know something like that?

215
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:22,494
Oh, well, Shinichi used to always tell me about it.

216
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:24,194
I mean, is there anything else that could happen to you

217
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,094
when you hit your head?

218
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:29,194
By the way, did you see Eisuke anywhere?

219
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:31,894
He seems to have come to this hospital.

220
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:35,194
No, I haven't seen him.

221
00:12:35,194 --> 00:12:37,994
I was admitted to the hospital four days ago.

222
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:40,294
Eisuke Aizawa of the soccer club

223
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,294
came to see me as soon as I was admitted here, though.

224
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,194
I see.

225
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:54,394
It seems he somehow finished taking images of all three men.

226
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:55,994
Good work, Conan.

227
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:57,194
Yep!

228
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,694
Okay, let's take a look at it then.

229
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:01,794
First, let's start with Mr. Nishiya

230
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:04,194
who was hospitalized for acute hip pains.

231
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:07,694
Hey, kid.

232
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:09,194
What do you think you're doing in my room?

233
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:12,294
Oh, I'm sorry, wrong room!

234
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,994
You fell?

235
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:18,994
Well, just watch!

236
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:20,694
Hey, kid?

237
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:25,294
Oh, can you pick my cell phone up for me?

238
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:28,594
Oh, boy.

239
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:40,094
Here! It's a little sticky but sorry!

240
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:41,594
I've got greasy skin.

241
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:43,094
Thank you!

242
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:47,294
Sir, do you know how to make calls on the cell phone?

243
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,594
Come to think of it,

244
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:53,294
the guy of the Organization was e-mailing the boss.

245
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:57,294
I'm sorry, but I'm not a digital person,

246
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,094
so I don't know a thing about it.

247
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:01,994
Oh, I see, maybe...

248
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:03,594
What're you doing?

249
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,994
Maybe it's because the curtains are closed.

250
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:08,594
That's why if I go like this,

251
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:10,494
I can put some electric waves in here!

252
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:14,494
Idiot, all you're doing is causing dust to fly all over the place.

253
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:18,494
Oops, sorry!

254
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:21,594
So, if you're done with your business, get on out of here!

255
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,794
Hurry before I lose my temper.

256
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,194
Okay.

257
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:27,594
Next is Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda

258
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:30,694
who was hospitalized for a sprained neck.

259
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:42,694
Ouch.

260
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:46,594
What's with you dashing in like that and then falling over nothing?

261
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,494
-Who're you? -I'm sorry.

262
00:14:49,494 --> 00:14:52,294
I came into the wrong room.

263
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:54,894
I'm sorry, but will you pick that up for me?

264
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,694
Give me a break.

265
00:14:57,694 --> 00:14:59,494
You mean this cell phone?

266
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:01,094
Used the same method to get in?

267
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,594
I couldn't think of any other way.

268
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:06,494
Darn, I have a sore neck, you know!

269
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,494
Here.

270
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:12,994
Huh? What's with you snooping around here and there?

271
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:17,994
I'm sorry! Your profile looks familiar!

272
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,094
Oh, right!

273
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:21,594
Do you know how to use the cell phone?

274
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:24,194
I can't get through no matter how many times I try.

275
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:26,094
Yeah, I do.

276
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,794
You don't know how to use it?

277
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,794
You can't use the cell phone in the hospital...

278
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:33,494
I mean this phone doesn't even have a battery in it!

279
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:36,694
Oh, I see. I dropped the cell phone before coming here,

280
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:39,394
so it may have come out then.

281
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:42,294
Well, you like canned coffee, don't you?

282
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:46,394
Yeah. I already drank one today too.

283
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:48,794
Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?

284
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:52,494
I'm sorry, I was trying to see what kind there are but my hand got stuck.

285
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,894
I'll put them back right away!

286
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:03,794
Last, there's Mr. Chotaro Shinki who broke his right leg.

287
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,794
Huh? Pick that up?

288
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:08,094
Darn, I can't see how you can ask an old man like me

289
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,694
who has a broken leg to do something like that.

290
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:12,694
Huh? This is a cell phone!

291
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:14,394
Pick it up yourself then!

292
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:16,294
Huh, why?

293
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:19,994
I hate insects and cell phones!

294
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:22,294
Talking of insects...

295
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:26,894
There's something by your left collar!

296
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:28,794
Isn't that a spider?

297
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:30,494
Spider?

298
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:31,994
What?

299
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:34,094
Where is it?

300
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:39,894
Brat, I get it.

301
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:42,994
You were asked to come here and check on me, right?

302
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:45,594
He stood up.

303
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:50,794
Tell the doctor that sent you here that my legs aren't cured yet,

304
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:54,094
and don't plan on being X-rayed because it's bad for my body.

305
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:57,294
Tell him that all I want is a medical certificate!

306
00:16:57,294 --> 00:17:00,894
Now that you know, get out of here right this minute!

307
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:06,994
It looks as though all three of them are feigning it pretty well.

308
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:11,594
Yeah. We're probably going to have to watch them for a while.

309
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:15,894
No. All we need to do is watch one of them.

310
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:18,894
Right, sonny?

311
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:19,894
Yep!

312
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:26,594
Hey, Shu.

313
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:28,494
Are you sure that there's only one

314
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,894
suspect that we need to watch?

315
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:32,394
Yeah.

316
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:34,894
This boy here found him for us.

317
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:37,994
He pointed out exactly who the guy is for us.

318
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:40,094
What do you mean he found the suspect?

319
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,694
I don't mean to offend Conan but,

320
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,294
he fell in front of all three of them

321
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,294
and made them pick up his cell phone.

322
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,694
After checking if the suspects could use the cell phone,

323
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,994
he ran around the room messed it up

324
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:52,394
and got them angry!

325
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:56,994
Just how could you specify who the guy is with just that?

326
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:00,494
It's true that there was only one man

327
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:04,294
who said he knew how to use the cell phone.

328
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,194
If the guy is a member of the Organization,

329
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:09,194
wouldn't it be more probable for him to say, "I can't use the cell phone."

330
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:13,094
Just like Mr. Nishiya who said he was not a digital person.

331
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:15,394
No, the guy who was admitted to the hospital

332
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,594
because of acute hip pains is not the one.

333
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:24,294
A guy whose purpose is to look for Rena Mizunashi and hiding,

334
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:28,094
can't possibly be hospitalized suffering from hip pains all this time.

335
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:32,694
Moreover, when the boy opened and closed the curtains

336
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,494
and produced dust,

337
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:38,594
he pinched his nose and tried to hold back sneezing,

338
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:39,894
but couldn't.

339
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,694
In other words, he was afraid that

340
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,794
sneezing would cause pain to run through his body,

341
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:47,894
so he tried to sneeze by letting air out through his mouth.

342
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,194
Because if he were to sneeze in the normal way,

343
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:52,394
pain is sure to flash through his hips.

344
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:56,494
Yes, I usually do so when I feel like sneezing in public,

345
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:59,494
but maybe he's just trying to make it look that way.

346
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,194
The only one in that room back then,

347
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:03,594
was this boy that he didn't know at all.

348
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:06,994
He had no reason to hold back on sneezing.

349
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:10,394
If he suspected the boy, he would've chased him out of the room

350
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:15,094
before picking up the cell phone and putting his fingerprints on it.

351
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:17,494
I see, so the member of the Organization

352
00:19:17,494 --> 00:19:18,894
is pretending to be hurt, in order to stay hospitalized

353
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:20,894
for an extended period of time.

354
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,094
Yes, I don't know what his condition was upon hospitalization,

355
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:26,494
but I'm sure he's fully recovered by now.

356
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:28,694
Come to think of it, Mr. Shinki,

357
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:31,394
he stood up on his injured right leg.

358
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:35,594
Yeah. The leg of that old man is already cured.

359
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:38,294
Mr. Kusuda who is being hospitalized for a sprained neck

360
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:40,494
is also cured already, isn't he?

361
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:43,594
In order to look for Conan who kept disappearing from his sight,

362
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:45,094
he had to look all over the room.

363
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:46,394
But he did so with ease.

364
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,594
If his neck isn't cured yet,

365
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:51,794
he'd have to move his entire body around to do what he did.

366
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:55,394
He also drank up his canned coffee.

367
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,894
Canned coffee?

368
00:19:57,894 --> 00:20:00,894
Well, when drinking out of a can,

369
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,494
you have to lurch your neck backwards and look up

370
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,994
or you can't drink all of what's inside, right?

371
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,194
But, when I knocked the cans of coffee

372
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,794
that he drank out of on the floor,

373
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:10,394
nothing spilled out!

374
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,894
They were all empty!

375
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:15,394
That means he drank it all, right?

376
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:19,394
He said that he also drank some just a while ago,

377
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:21,594
so it's not that the contents dried out, right?

378
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:24,094
Which means that two of them are pretending to be hurt.

379
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:26,694
Then what's the other man who seems to have nothing to do

380
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:29,194
with the Organization after?

381
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:33,294
He's probably after "Hospitalization Insurance", that old man.

382
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:34,494
What?

383
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:39,194
There is an insurance bonus for being hospitalized more than 20 days.

384
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:40,994
That's why he's refusing to get an X-Ray

385
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:44,294
and wants to hide the fact that he is already recovered.

386
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:49,094
In other words, his purpose is insurance money.

387
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:52,894
But, he could just be making it look that way on purpose, right?

388
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:58,394
Right, that old man did think that the doctor sent Conan to him.

389
00:20:58,394 --> 00:21:00,494
And if the fact that he's recovered comes to light,

390
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:01,794
he's probably going to make it look like

391
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,694
he was after the insurance money.

392
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:06,594
Right, and that old man

393
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:09,494
was the only one who didn't even bother to touch the cell phone.

394
00:21:09,494 --> 00:21:13,194
I hate insects and cell phones!

395
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:14,294
Isn't he suspicious?

396
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:16,894
It's only natural that he couldn't touch it.

397
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:21,794
He was wearing a pace maker, the thing to help his heart work!

398
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,894
Going near a cell phone that emits waves

399
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:26,994
can be life threatening to him.

400
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,594
Well, I didn't have any battery in that cell phone

401
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:31,094
to begin with, though.

402
00:21:31,094 --> 00:21:35,394
But, how did you know that the old man had a pace maker on him?

403
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,894
Remember, below the left collar bone of that old man,

404
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:41,994
there was a protruded area with a trace of a wound, right?

405
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,894
That's the trace of the wound that he had surgery for

406
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:45,494
when implanting the pace maker!

407
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:48,494
Then, you lied telling him that there was an insect by his collar,

408
00:21:48,494 --> 00:21:50,894
not to make him stand up but...

409
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,994
to confirm whether he had a pace maker on him!

410
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:55,394
Yep.

411
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:57,994
I see.

412
00:21:57,994 --> 00:21:59,894
So that old man who wouldn't be able

413
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:02,394
to e-mail the boss of the Organization

414
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:05,194
with his cell phone is marked off.

415
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,094
Yes. The only one left is probably

416
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,194
the man with the sprained neck

417
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:13,394
who's pretending to have faint spells and nausea from the wound

418
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:16,894
and is extending his duration of hospitalization,

419
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:19,194
Rikumichi Kusuda.

420
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:20,894
There's only him.

421
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:53,794
We finally found out about

422
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:56,094
the members of the Black Organization.

423
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:59,994
We set a trap and grabbed their tails.

424
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:04,394
However, Gin found out about it.

425
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:08,494
Will Rena Mizunashi be taken away by them again?

426
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:14,194
The unexpected past of the Organization and Akai is revealed.

427
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:17,994
Next on Detective Conan,

428
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:21,594
"Red and Black Crash: Awakening."

429
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:39,394
Next Conan's Hint:

430
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,694
Akemi Miyano.

431
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:44,194
You people, go on and disclose the identity of the Organization!

432
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,694
Oh, right-on, right-on.
