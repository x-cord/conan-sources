1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:04,553
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:05,953
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:08,453
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:11,853
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,453
This time, we're taking repeated sink or swim risks

6
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:16,753
involving Rena Mizunashi.

7
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:21,653
The Black Organization that found out where she was hospitalized...

8
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:23,653
caused three different incidents to occur at the same time

9
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:26,553
in the vicinity of the hospital.

10
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:30,653
They also sent a bomb addressed to FBI agent James.

11
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:32,053
Furthermore, they went on to send bombs

12
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:33,253
under the pretense of get-well gifts

13
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:36,253
to a great number of patients at the hospital.

14
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:41,453
This plastic bomb alone is only capable of blowing up one room,

15
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:44,353
but if several of these go off together...

16
00:00:45,953 --> 00:00:49,753
This hospital will unmistakably collapse.

17
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:06,253
Sizzling hot suspense.

18
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,953
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

19
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:10,953
Serious tactics of outsmarting and counterplotting.

20
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:12,653
The hospital is in complete chaos.

21
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:14,053
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:15,753
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:17,853
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,539
"Red and Black Crash: Camouflage."

25
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:53,048
What's fortunate is that the bomb is set to go off at 5pm,

26
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,948
giving us four more hours to go,

27
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:57,948
and that if we remove the fuse that is poked into the bomb,

28
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:01,248
it won't function, thus, won't go off.

29
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,048
In addition, almost all the packages have been delivered to hospital

30
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:09,048
and the total number amounted to almost 60.

31
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:10,848
That's why the Organization over capacitated the hospital

32
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:13,748
with wounded and sick people?

33
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:16,948
If only one courier service delivered a whole lot of packages,

34
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,448
they would be suspected.

35
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,148
But if the packages are delivered by different couriers

36
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:23,248
in this state of panic at the hospital,

37
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:24,348
nobody would really even bother to worry

38
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:27,648
whether the deliveries are suspicious or not.

39
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:28,948
But, how did those guys at the Organization

40
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:31,348
get the name of the patients?

41
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:32,848
From Kusuda.

42
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:33,848
He was taking pictures of the board

43
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:36,048
that indicated the names of the patients

44
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,848
and the corresponding room numbers in the nurse station,

45
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:41,348
so it's most likely that they wrote names of the people

46
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:43,148
that the gifts were addressed by using the picture that he sent them.

47
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:46,548
Yes. At any rate, we've got four hours to go.

48
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:49,548
Dispatch all the agents, go to all the rooms

49
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:51,148
and retrieve the bombs.

50
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,348
Yes, sir...

51
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:56,648
But, this is turning out way more difficult than we first figured.

52
00:03:56,648 --> 00:04:01,048
I thought they were only coming to retrieve Rena Mizunashi.

53
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,548
Yes.

54
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:05,348
I didn't think that they were going to go after her life

55
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:09,448
and try to shut her up on the spot to begin with.

56
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,748
Agree, sonny?

57
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:15,048
Right.

58
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:40,848
I'm the security officer, may I come in?

59
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,148
I'm checking for suspicious items.

60
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:44,148
May I please ask for your cooperation?

61
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:53,048
I wonder who this Mr. Kusuda is.

62
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,848
Excuse me.

63
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:59,848
May I check the delivery that you received?

64
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:03,948
It's this stuffed bear.

65
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:05,248
May I?

66
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,448
Yes.

67
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:07,748
I'm sorry, sonny,

68
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:09,948
will you show me that bear, please?

69
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:11,648
Yeah, okay.

70
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,248
Thank you.

71
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:14,448
I'll be done right away.

72
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,448
Okay.

73
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:20,648
That...

74
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:22,748
Oh, it's the lady that comes on TV!

75
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,148
Rena Mizunashi?

76
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:37,448
It... it can't be? Why?

77
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:41,248
I'm perfectly in good health now.

78
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:45,048
To all you viewers out there,

79
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:48,648
I'm really sorry to have worried you.

80
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,148
I thought she wasn't on TV recently.

81
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:55,148
Isn't that this hospital?

82
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,848
No way.

83
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:59,448
Nice being back.

84
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:03,748
What? Rena Mizunashi is on TV?

85
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:05,048
Is that true?

86
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,548
Yes, sir!

87
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:09,548
She's aired on the TVs in the hospital rooms and the lobby!

88
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,048
It's being aired from her room in the hospital

89
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,248
with her wearing a hospital gown,

90
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,748
saying my wounds have healed completely.

91
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:18,448
Haven't you had any word from her room?

92
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:19,848
No.

93
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:22,348
There are three agents guarding her room,

94
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,348
and one of them is to come out every five minutes

95
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:28,248
to report the circumstances to me.

96
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:30,948
You can't contact the room from your side, can you?

97
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:33,548
No. The blood transfusion pump IV

98
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:35,948
has a tendency to malfunction from radio waves,

99
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:37,448
so I've ordered everyone to make sure

100
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:41,248
to switch off their cell phones and wireless.

101
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,448
At any rate, go to her room

102
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:45,348
and find out what's happening, will you?

103
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:47,248
Yes, sir! Everyone feels the same

104
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,948
and is headed for her room already.

105
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,748
I see.

106
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:55,548
So, that's what the Organization is after.

107
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,848
Notify the agents of all the blocks!

108
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:59,948
Tell them not to go to Rena Mizunashi's room!

109
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:01,048
What...

110
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,648
It may be too late already, though.

111
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,248
Too late...

112
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:09,248
Don't tell me that the Organization already...

113
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:20,748
Is something wrong?

114
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:22,048
I came to check things out

115
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:24,548
because Rena Mizunashi was on TV.

116
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:25,948
Didn't you see it?

117
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:29,148
No, all the patients of the rooms that I went to,

118
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:32,248
didn't have their TVs on.

119
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,648
Besides, all the members that were added to the group this time

120
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:38,748
are still not informed of what room she's in.

121
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:41,148
Would you like me to go too?

122
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:44,448
No, you go ahead and continue retrieving the bombs.

123
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:47,148
There should be about ten minutes more left.

124
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:49,448
Do your job right, okay?

125
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:50,448
Roger.

126
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:55,348
What... what on earth is going on?

127
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,948
Hey! You!

128
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:00,348
What on earth is going on?

129
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:07,248
What the... she's here.

130
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:10,548
Then, what was that TV thing a while ago?

131
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:13,048
We were their puppets made to dance

132
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:17,648
on the palm of their hands just as they pleased.

133
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:20,148
Puppets?

134
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,248
The TV image we saw a while ago was taken previously,

135
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:25,948
after she got involved in the explosion accident and got hurt,

136
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:28,448
and commented that she would be returning to the program.

137
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:29,948
To all you viewers out there,

138
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:32,448
I'm sorry to have worried you.

139
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:35,448
And after they doctored the clothing and background...

140
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,648
As you can see, my wounds have healed completely.

141
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:41,948
I saw the original video of it

142
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:45,248
at the house of her biggest fan.

143
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:48,148
But, why would the organization go out of their way

144
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:51,048
to hijack radio waves and air that image?

145
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:54,348
To gather the members of the FBI here.

146
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:55,848
They saw through that nobody would be using cell phones

147
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:58,348
or wireless in the hospital.

148
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:02,048
So, what now since they have us all gathered here?

149
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:04,748
We were looking for them till just a while ago, right?

150
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:06,348
What?

151
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:09,648
The toys that they delivered everywhere in this hospital.

152
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,148
Where are they now?

153
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:13,448
Oh, the bombs are in our pockets.

154
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:15,548
With the fuse detached.

155
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,348
Because we have to hurry to the next room

156
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,748
after retrieving the bomb.

157
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:24,448
Don't tell me that...

158
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,548
Yeah, it was attached to that toy.

159
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:32,648
A troublesome freebie.

160
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:42,148
They're like flies that gather around trash.

161
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,548
They're coming one after the other, aren't they, boss?

162
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,948
That's room 307 on the forth floor, isn't it?

163
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:55,948
Yeah.

164
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,648
Now that we have the room,

165
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:00,848
it's our turn, Boss.

166
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:02,848
From the beginning, the location of Kir's cage

167
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:05,048
never interested me.

168
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:10,748
Our point is to let them believe that we know where she is

169
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:14,748
and drive a wedge of terror into their brains.

170
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:22,948
All we have to do now is wait

171
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:25,148
and see how the FBI that panics will fly.

172
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:26,648
Communicator.

173
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:29,648
A communicator was rigged to the bombs.

174
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:30,648
Yeah.

175
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:34,248
In other words, everything that they did up to now

176
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:39,848
was done to figure out which room Rena Mizunashi was in.

177
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,448
They made it look as if they were going to attack us

178
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:44,448
with the first bomb they sent us.

179
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:47,148
They figured that we would panic at seeing the great number of bombs

180
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,248
that were being delivered and run around to retrieve them,

181
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,048
finally landing up here

182
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:54,348
where the image of Rena Mizunashi was being aired.

183
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:56,148
Then, you mean the Organization already...

184
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:59,048
They're probably working out their next move,

185
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:01,448
watching us with grins on their faces.

186
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:03,748
So... what now?

187
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,848
Now that we know, we'd better get out of here fast.

188
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:18,248
We will take the last resort that we talked of this morning.

189
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:20,148
We're splitting up in three different cars

190
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:21,848
and going to confuse the Organization

191
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,948
while we make it out of this hospital.

192
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:26,148
The mission of the decoy car

193
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:29,448
is the bait will draw them as far away as possible.

194
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:33,748
Ask Jodie as to who will be riding which car.

195
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:35,548
Hey.

196
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:39,148
Why don't we take her on the Beetle of a man that I know?

197
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,348
Huh...

198
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:42,548
She can be placed lying down in the backseat.

199
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,048
And those bad people are probably thinking

200
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:46,848
that she's going to be moved out on a car

201
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:49,148
that's big enough to load a stretcher.

202
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:51,248
This way, they'll never be able to tell that she's in the car.

203
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:53,748
That may be true but...

204
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,948
I'll go outside and call him.

205
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:58,948
I'm sure he'll come right over.

206
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:02,348
I can't let you do that, sonny,

207
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,148
not even for you.

208
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:07,848
This is a job for the FBI.

209
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:12,448
We can't get any more ordinary citizens involved,

210
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,048
not more than we already have.

211
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:15,948
Oh, but...

212
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:20,248
Leave the rest to us.

213
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:21,648
Then first of all,

214
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:24,648
find the communicator that is attached to all the bombs

215
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:26,048
and smash it.

216
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:28,548
No.

217
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,448
I'd like you to smash it after you hear me out.

218
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:34,648
What is it, Akai?

219
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:36,148
It just dawned on me

220
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:37,948
after hearing what the boy had to say.

221
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:40,748
An excellent plan to deceive them

222
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:43,848
and get Rena Mizunashi out of here.

223
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:45,048
What...

224
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:46,148
What is it?

225
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:55,978
That's true...

226
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:59,078
we may be able to deceive them that way.

227
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,978
Well, I hope so.

228
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:05,778
Thank you, Conan for your great hints.

229
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:06,878
Yep.

230
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:09,778
The problem is who's going to drive the car

231
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,978
that Rena Mizunashi is riding.

232
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:14,478
Right.

233
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:16,578
Assuming that if the Organization finds out,

234
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,378
the driver may have to face a predicament

235
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:21,178
in which he would have to shake them off.

236
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,078
The driver would have to be able to play off the cuff,

237
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:25,178
know this area quite well,

238
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:29,378
and last but not least posses above average driving technique.

239
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:33,378
That person would be none other than you, Akai.

240
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:36,778
No. I don't think I'm a good pick.

241
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:39,178
The first thing they'll check

242
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:42,978
is to see which car I'm in.

243
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,578
In that case...

244
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:48,878
If so, I'll go.

245
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:52,578
I guess there's no one else but me who can handle this situation?

246
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:56,878
Oh, you're Camel that did a good job getting rid of the bomb.

247
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:02,978
I think he's the right one as well.

248
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:15,978
Fear of death is worse than death itself...

249
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:17,178
As the saying goes, no fear.

250
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:20,778
I won't. Death is what I am always prepared for.

251
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,578
After all, I've got no family that will cry of sadness for me

252
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,478
even if I were to die in the first place.

253
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:28,478
Then please get ready on the double.

254
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:29,778
Roger.

255
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:34,378
I'm Andre Camel.

256
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:36,778
I just got a call from my wife.

257
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,578
Oh, excuse me...

258
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:42,578
Huh? What is it?

259
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:46,178
Oh nothing. Good luck.

260
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,678
Thank you.

261
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:57,378
What's with that look on your face?

262
00:14:57,378 --> 00:15:00,478
It's inevitable that this plan will succeed.

263
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:04,978
Or is my guarantee not enough for you?

264
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:08,178
No. It's more than enough.

265
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:10,878
Okay, Camel.

266
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,178
We're counting on you.

267
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,078
Whether we succeed or not is on your shoulders.

268
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:17,178
Yes, I understand, sir.

269
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:18,678
In the event that you succeed,

270
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,678
let me buy you a drink.

271
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:23,078
Yes. I'll be looking forward to it.

272
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:26,478
Wait!

273
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:28,878
Well...

274
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:33,078
I don't think we can leave it all up to you.

275
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:34,478
Let me go instead, will you?

276
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,278
I've got the route in mind.

277
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:42,578
It doesn't matter to me,

278
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:44,778
but don't blame me if you're bawled out later.

279
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:49,678
Never mind that. I'd like you to answer two or three questions...

280
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,478
Car number one, all set to go.

281
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,178
Car number two, all set to go.

282
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:25,878
Car number three, all set to go.

283
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:28,678
Car number one, two, and three,

284
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:30,678
are all set to go!

285
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:34,178
Okay. Carry on as planned.

286
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:36,478
Keep all communication circuits open

287
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:39,378
and let me know immediately if something comes up.

288
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:40,378
Roger...

289
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:48,778
By the way, Camel.

290
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:49,778
Yes?

291
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:52,778
Would you happen to know where Jodie is?

292
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,678
It seems she left saying that she was going to see you.

293
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:59,378
Yes, she came about ten minutes ago.

294
00:16:59,378 --> 00:17:01,378
Something about she thought up a good plan

295
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,378
to back up my car.

296
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:04,978
She left with her car

297
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:07,378
after telling me not to worry.

298
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:10,278
Hey... she did so without telling me?

299
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,978
I'm sure she's worried too.

300
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:14,778
Because after all, I'm the target car

301
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:18,778
that Rena Mizunashi is riding in.

302
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:21,878
It's come...

303
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:24,178
A dark blue wagon.

304
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,978
A second one.

305
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,878
A third one.

306
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,778
It seems there are three all together.

307
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:35,078
Okay, Chianti, you keep your eyes on the first car.

308
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:36,178
Okay.

309
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:37,878
Korn, on the second.

310
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:39,478
Okay.

311
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:42,978
Vodka, you take care of the third.

312
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,078
Roger.

313
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,878
I'll stick around the vicinity of the hospital

314
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:48,978
and keep an eye on the FBI agents here.

315
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:52,278
It could be that all three are decoys too.

316
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:55,578
When you each get hold of your cars in target,

317
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:59,278
use that method and find out what's going on inside.

318
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:03,078
I'll decide which car we'll narrow it down to.

319
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:06,378
By the way, Boss, did you get contact?

320
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:10,778
No, I got nothing from them.

321
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:15,078
Well, it's a strategy to ensure that person's life.

322
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:18,878
I'm not counting on it, to begin with.

323
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:30,978
Camel, report your situation.

324
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:36,278
Yes, sir. There is no suspicious moves of this car being pursued.

325
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,478
No, not even one.

326
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:45,578
Gin, I'm pursuing the first car.

327
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:47,378
How does it look?

328
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:48,978
The side windows are smoke

329
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,878
and I can't see inside.

330
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:52,278
Strip them naked.

331
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:53,378
Okay.

332
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,778
Projection completed.

333
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:02,278
I'll send it over to you.

334
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:10,678
The figures confirmable by thermograph are...

335
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:12,578
Nine.

336
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:14,778
It more or less matches the position

337
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,978
of the communicators set on the bombs.

338
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:20,878
Can you see the figure of the person lying down in the backseat?

339
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:23,078
Isn't that Rena Mizunashi?

340
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,178
She's the only one that's not showing response

341
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:26,378
from the communicator, right?

342
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:29,178
I've taken the image too.

343
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:30,278
I'll send it over.

344
00:19:33,978 --> 00:19:37,278
The second car that Korn is pursuing also shows nine silhouettes,

345
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:39,278
but there are no signs of communicators.

346
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,878
I took an image here too.

347
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:48,178
The silhouette of people in the car that Vodka's pursuing is just two.

348
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:51,778
It seems that the two have communicators too.

349
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:54,078
Come on, hurry up and make up your mind, Gin.

350
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:55,678
If you keep me in suspense too long,

351
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:57,778
the rifle on my back is going to get impatient

352
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,278
and go off on its own.

353
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:00,678
Well, either way...

354
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:04,178
I guess you can forget about the car that I'm pursuing.

355
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:06,378
Judging from the position of the communicator

356
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:08,378
and number of silhouetted figures, they're only two FBI agents.

357
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:09,878
Moreover, if they go on as is,

358
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:12,478
it'll take them right back to the hospital they came from.

359
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,078
This car's unmistakably a decoy.

360
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:16,478
Thanks for waiting, Gin.

361
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:22,378
I finally found him.

362
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:25,578
Shuichi Akai's...

363
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:29,178
Chevy.

364
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:32,078
It must've been tough, Bellmot.

365
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,878
It was an order directly from that person, wasn't it?

366
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:37,278
Well, sorry.

367
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,878
He foresaw beforehand that this would happen

368
00:20:38,878 --> 00:20:43,078
and had his car parked in a parking lot one kilometer away.

369
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:45,678
And? What's Akai's position?

370
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:49,178
Right through Haido Park leading into Beika-cho.

371
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:53,178
The car nearest here is the second car that Korn is pursuing.

372
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,678
It's about 200 meters behind.

373
00:20:57,678 --> 00:20:59,878
Then, it's the car that Korn's pursuing!

374
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:01,678
Because Akai's guarding it!

375
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:06,878
Platinum Blonde long hair.

376
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:11,878
It's Bellmot.

377
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:15,678
They've finally appeared.

378
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:27,878
Talk about burning the tires.

379
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:29,478
At that rate, he'll catch up with the second car

380
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:31,378
in less than a minute.

381
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:34,878
He's probably realized that Korn is pursuing him.

382
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,378
The second car's bingo.

383
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,378
I'm changing course and joining Korn.

384
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:42,078
I'll go over to Korn too.

385
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:45,178
Pursuing the decoy's not going to get me anywhere.

386
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,078
I'm going to shoot him when he comes.

387
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:50,678
Hold it, Korn.

388
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:52,578
Go into a side street and change course.

389
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,378
Why? You mean you're scared of Akai,

390
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:56,978
so you're going to give Kir up?

391
00:21:56,978 --> 00:22:00,678
No, the one that we've got to go after is...

392
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:03,878
The third car that Vodka is pursuing.

393
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:05,278
Kir is in there.

394
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:51,978
"Next Episode."

395
00:23:51,978 --> 00:23:55,578
The diversion tactics of moving Rena Mizunashi out of the hospital

396
00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:58,678
is seen through by Gin.

397
00:23:58,678 --> 00:24:02,178
But the strategy isn't over yet.

398
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:04,678
The entire picture of the plan that I set up is...

399
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:08,278
And finally, the connection between Rena Mizunashi, Eisuke Hondo

400
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,278
and Ethern of the Company is disclosed.

401
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:17,178
Next on Detective Conan,

402
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:20,778
"Red and Black Crash: Last Words."

403
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,878
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,878
Kir.

405
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,978
In the next episode, Kir's secret is revealed.

406
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:44,478
-What's it about? -Well...

407
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:45,878
Find out next week.
