1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,900
We all went to eat sushi on Dr. Agasa's treat.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,700
And we landed up in a rotating sushi shop.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,200
Although Genta and the others didn't look all that satisfied,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
they were soon all taken in by the attractiveness of rotating sushi

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,700
and started eating their favorite dish.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,500
But a customer named Mr. Agatsuma sitting next to us

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,900
started saying next nasty things to us

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,100
as well as the customers who were there,

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,400
and ended up picking on the shop manager, too.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,800
Upset over what had happened, just as we were about to leave,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Mr. Agatsuma suddenly started to suffer and collapsed.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,200
There was a slight smell of almond from his mouth.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,800
This is poisoning.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,600
The three people who were on bad terms

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,000
with Mr. Agatsuma are the suspects.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,300
Mr. Aizono, who in the past got into trouble with Mr. Agatsuma.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,200
Ms. Sakiko Takemura, whose shop was driven to bankruptcy

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,200
because of food writer Mr. Agatsuma's article.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,900
And Mr. Danji Namiki, a former sushi-maker who hurt his arm

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,800
after getting involved in a fight caused by Mr. Agatsuma.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,400
However, as a result of their body check,

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,700
none of them had any poison on them.

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,000
Where on earth did the poison disappear to?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,700
And, how did the killer target only Mr. Agatsuma

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,400
and make him pick up the poisoned plate?

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,700
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

"Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 2)"

34
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,233
But I wonder. Is there a way

35
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:29,233
to make only Mr. Agatsuma pick up the poisoned plate?

36
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,833
That's right, he ordered it!

37
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,433
If he placed the order for the sushi,

38
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,433
he would pick it up for sure!

39
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,833
-Place an order? -Yes.

40
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,833
If you place an order using this touch panel,

41
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,233
the sushi comes in a bowl with the sign "ordered" on it,

42
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:47,533
and when it comes in front of you, there is beeping sound.

43
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,033
I see!

44
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,733
So, Ms. Takemura who was seated to the right of the victim

45
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,633
could've done it!

46
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,533
No way.

47
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,633
Even if an ordered plate were to come around,

48
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,633
I couldn't have smeared poison on it!

49
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:04,033
Because beyond him, there was a man who was wearing a cap,

50
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,433
I had no way of knowing which one of them had placed the order!

51
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,133
Besides, I can't even see the touch panel from my seat,

52
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,633
so I wasn't able to tell what he ordered.

53
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,433
The only one who could see it

54
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:20,333
was Mr. Aizono who was sitting next to him.

55
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,833
Hey, hold it, will you?

56
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,533
I mentioned it a while ago too,

57
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,933
but I was sitting to the left of Mr. Agatsuma,

58
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,333
and the sushi was rotating from right to left!

59
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,733
Even if I were to be able to see

60
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:35,033
what Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel,

61
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:39,033
the plate would be picked up by him before it reaches me!

62
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,633
True.

63
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:45,133
Besides, I'm not the only one who can see the touch panel.

64
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,633
The manager can too!

65
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,133
Because after arguing with Mr. Agatsuma

66
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,033
and up to the time Mr. Agatsuma collapsed,

67
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,333
he was standing behind him!

68
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,533
Is that true?

69
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,933
Yes.

70
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,733
Since Mr. Agatsuma was making such a racket,

71
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,833
I told him, "You don't have to pay, so please leave."

72
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,733
Then he said, "If it's free, I'll eat and leave."

73
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,733
So, I stood behind him

74
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,933
to watch that he wouldn't make further trouble.

75
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,733
Well, but as far as I saw,

76
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,633
he didn't seem to have been ordering anything.

77
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:20,833
We can tell for sure if I check the computer though.

78
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,333
-Check it. -Yes, sir.

79
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,033
Officer.

80
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:30,233
Haven't you forgotten?

81
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,833
You did a body check on us a while ago,

82
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,233
but no container with poison inside,

83
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,733
nor any handkerchief soaked with poison was found!

84
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:41,733
Despite of this, I question why you keep on suspecting us.

85
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,233
I'm sure that the killer

86
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,933
was among the customers that already left the shop.

87
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:49,233
Maybe that's why the container with poison inside wasn't found.

88
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:52,833
Which means unless we capture that killer,

89
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:57,633
we'll never find out how just Mr. Agatsuma was targeted.

90
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,733
Back off.

91
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:01,733
Inspector!

92
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,733
I checked the computer of the shop,

93
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,433
there was no order by Mr. Agatsuma.

94
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,233
Left.

95
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,433
Left?

96
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:16,933
I think that the man who died was left handed!

97
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:20,433
Because it was on the fingertip of the man's left hand!

98
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:23,033
The place where 2 or 3 rice grains were stuck on!

99
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:27,033
Come to think of it, I saw the man eating with his left hand!

100
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,633
Yes, yes, he picked up the sushi with his left hand!

101
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,233
I saw him, too!

102
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:35,033
I see. If he was left handed...

103
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:38,833
If most of the poison is smeared on to the left side facing the plate,

104
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,333
it seems possible to make only him touch the poison.

105
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,333
Yes.

106
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:49,033
Okay. Check all the plates on the conveyer belt

107
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,933
to see if there are any other plates with poison on them!

108
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:52,933
Yes, sir!

109
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,733
We're counting on you, forensics!

110
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,233
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

111
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:04,433
But I wonder if we're really right about it?

112
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:05,633
If it were really true,

113
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,433
the killer would've had to smear the poison on after verifying that.

114
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:11,833
Mr. Agatsuma is the only left-handed customer in this lane.

115
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,733
But if after that, a left-handed customer suddenly comes in, then what?

116
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:20,533
Besides, if it were to be a child instead of a left-handed customer.

117
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,933
Moreover, it's likely that the plate

118
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,833
would be picked up with both hands, too.

119
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:27,533
Where on earth did the poison disappear to in the first place?

120
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,333
This crime isn't possible unless a container with poison

121
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,633
or a cloth-like thing soaked with poison is found.

122
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,233
There's something by the tea cup of the seat

123
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,433
where Mr. Agatsuma was seated.

124
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:43,033
A piece of a vinyl wrapper.

125
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:45,833
Huh? If I'm not mistaken, this is...

126
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,533
Huh?

127
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,733
-Nothing was found? -Yeah.

128
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:56,533
Although there were many plates going around at the same time

129
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:00,333
that Mr. Agatsuma picked up the poisoned plate...

130
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,233
Weren't there any other plates with poison on them?

131
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,933
Not even one.

132
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:07,533
If so, the victim would've had to pick up

133
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,233
the only poisoned plate there was

134
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:14,033
as if he were under hypnosis or something.

135
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:18,033
Maybe there was a message or something on the plate?

136
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:21,233
Like, this is a present for you or something.

137
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:24,433
I would never pick up such a plate

138
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,133
because it's kind of creepy.

139
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,233
Well, a card's not thinkable.

140
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,633
Oh?

141
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,133
Because if it were so,

142
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,833
the man would've had a card on him.

143
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,233
I could care less, though.

144
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,933
I'm hungry!

145
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:43,033
You just ate a while ago!

146
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,833
That sushi...

147
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,033
Can't I eat it?

148
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,933
Of course not!

149
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:53,233
But you're going to throw it away anyway, right?

150
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,733
Don't you think it's a waste?

151
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:59,533
Yeah! That's it!

152
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:03,033
Ai, will you lend me your handkerchief?

153
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,933
I want to wipe my glasses.

154
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,633
Then, use the disposal hand wipes of this shop!

155
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,333
There were some by the entrance.

156
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,133
Wait a sec. That's...

157
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,333
I see.

158
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,633
It had to be sushi to carry this trick out!

159
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,633
Which means that the killer is that person.

160
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,733
The killer poisoned only Mr. Agatsuma

161
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,133
and set up a trick to get rid of the evidence

162
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:35,233
using this special system of rotating sushi.

163
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,533
A very clever trick!

164
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,633
Officer.

165
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,333
Are you still suspecting us?

166
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,933
I can understand you wanting to suspect us,

167
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,133
who had reasons for hating him.

168
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,033
But if the only plate that had poison on it

169
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:58,033
was the one that Mr. Agatsuma picked up,

170
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,433
I think it would've been impossible to target just him.

171
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,633
But it's true that you all

172
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:06,633
had a chance to smear poison on the plate, too.

173
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:09,433
Explain it to us, then!

174
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,833
How would you make that man

175
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,833
pick up the only poisoned plate there is?

176
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:19,133
Or? Are you saying that we look like some super ruthless killer

177
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:23,133
that would randomly kill anybody?

178
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,833
No, that's not it.

179
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,533
And even if we wanted to smear the plate with poison,

180
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:31,533
we didn't have any container with poison in it on us.

181
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,733
If we are the killer, we should have it on us, right?

182
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,233
From the time that man collapsed

183
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,033
to the time the police came and body checked us,

184
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:42,033
we didn't move from here at all!

185
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,033
Like I said a while ago,

186
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:48,533
I think the killer is one of the customers who already left the shop.

187
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:54,933
If so, it's understandable why no container with poison was found.

188
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:58,733
It seems that someone who just randomly wanted to kill,

189
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,933
left the poisoned plate behind

190
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:04,433
and Mr. Agatsuma unluckily happened to pick it up.

191
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:08,033
-That's... -He seems to have indeed been unlucky.

192
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,833
Using my voice without permission again.

193
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:16,033
But that's not about Mr. Agatsuma who was killed.

194
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:18,233
I'm talking about the killer that's in front of me

195
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,733
snickering that everything seems to have turned out well!

196
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:24,333
And I will show you how the killer put poison on Mr. Agatsuma's plate

197
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:30,033
as well as how the container with the poison disappeared.

198
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,633
I will disclose all this by a simple deduction

199
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,933
made by me, who just happened to be here.

200
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:38,533
So, the killer is among the people here after all?

201
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:42,233
Yes! Just as you, the police pointed out,

202
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,433
the killer is among the three here

203
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,833
who have a grudge against Mr. Agatsuma!

204
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:59,972
Hey, what's with you, anyway?

205
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:01,736
Suddenly butting in and blabbering!

206
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:04,272
Just because you're a bit stout,

207
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:06,572
acting like a big shot, like some detective or something!

208
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,472
Oh, well...

209
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:10,872
Size doesn't matter, anyway.

210
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:12,672
Did you see us do it or what?

211
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:16,072
Us smearing poison on that man's plate!

212
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:17,972
No, I didn't.

213
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,272
Then...

214
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,672
Well, of course I didn't

215
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:23,572
because the one who smeared poison on his plate

216
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:25,772
was Mr. Agatsuma himself.

217
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,172
What?

218
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:30,072
Doc, talk with confidence like a detective would.

219
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,072
But, Mr. Agasa.

220
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,672
If the one who smeared poison on the plate

221
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,872
was the one who was killed by the poison,

222
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:37,672
wouldn't that be suicide?

223
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:41,672
No. What I'm saying is the poison was not on the plate

224
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:45,772
but on something else that he touched before touching the plate!

225
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:49,972
That's why the poison was only on Mr. Agatsuma's plate!

226
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:53,272
But, just what is that something else?

227
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,572
What is it?

228
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,772
Hey, you guys!

229
00:12:56,772 --> 00:13:00,772
Before the plate with what you want to eat comes around in front of you,

230
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,872
what do you touch before you pick up the plate?

231
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:05,572
Well...

232
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:07,572
First, I guess I'd take a pair of chopsticks.

233
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:09,672
Drink tea from the tea cup.

234
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,172
And pour soy sauce into my dish.

235
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:15,472
No, not what you touch before picking up the first plate,

236
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:18,472
but what you touch after eating several plates!

237
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:20,472
I'm pretty sure you touched it, Genta.

238
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:21,872
Huh? Me?

239
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,272
Conan.

240
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:26,672
We checked everything by Mr. Agatsuma's seat,

241
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,272
but there was no poison smeared anywhere.

242
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:32,172
So, even if Mr. Agatsuma were to have touched

243
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:33,272
before picked up his plate...

244
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,972
Then, what is there at Mitsuhiko's seat but not at Genta's?

245
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:38,772
He's not listening to me.

246
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:40,472
Uh...

247
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:41,772
Oh, chopsticks!

248
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:44,472
There are no chopsticks at Genta's seat!

249
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:47,872
Genta was eating picking up the sushi with his hands, that's why.

250
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,672
Dad used to tell me

251
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,172
people who's originally from the downtown district of Tokyo

252
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:53,072
should eat sushi with their hands!

253
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:55,672
If you were eating using your hands,

254
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:57,572
isn't there something that you'd want to touch?

255
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:59,672
Something I want to touch?

256
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,472
I licked my fingers.

257
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,772
Then, what did you do after licking your fingers?

258
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:06,572
After that, I...

259
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:09,372
I see. Hand wipes!

260
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:12,872
Because after touching the sushi and fish directly with the hands,

261
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:18,172
you would want to wipe of the oil of the fish, the water

262
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:21,272
and sticky vinegar rice from the hands.

263
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:24,972
Are you saying that the poison was on the hand wipe?

264
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:27,072
Right, Doc?

265
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:28,172
Yeah.

266
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:32,072
But there were no hand wipes at Mr. Agatsuma's seat.

267
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,372
But there are traces that there was, wasn't there?

268
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:39,572
This!

269
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:43,972
Right. Anybody can freely take it at the entrance of the shop.

270
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:48,372
It's the torn off piece of vinyl that the disposable was in!

271
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:49,772
This is it.

272
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,972
It's likely that the killer put poison

273
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:56,872
inside the vinyl package of the hand wipe

274
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:58,972
using a syringe or something.

275
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:00,572
I get it!

276
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:03,972
After he touched the poisoned hand wipe, he took the plate,

277
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:07,972
he picked up the sushi with his fingers, ate it and died.

278
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:11,572
That's why poison was found only on that plate!

279
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:13,772
Yeah, exactly!

280
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:19,372
But Mr. Agatsuma's been quite a lot before he was poisoned to death!

281
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:20,772
It's difficult to understand

282
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:23,972
why he didn't touch the poisoned hand wipe at all until then.

283
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:26,772
No, it was switched part way.

284
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:30,572
Most probably when the store manager was arguing with Mr. Agatsuma!

285
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:34,472
But, if somebody else were to stretch their hand over

286
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:35,772
and touch the hand wipe,

287
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:38,572
I'm sure that he would've noticed,

288
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:40,972
and say, "Just what do you think you're doing?"

289
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:42,972
What if the killer knew that.

290
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:47,272
Mr. Agatsuma would put the hand wipe near him?

291
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:49,772
But where a person places the hand wipe depends on each and every person,

292
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:50,872
in other words, it could be anywhere.

293
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:53,672
No, Mr. Agatsuma is left-handed.

294
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:57,272
If he'd been using the hand wipe each time he ate sushi,

295
00:15:57,272 --> 00:16:00,472
it's only natural that he would put it on his left side, right?

296
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:04,672
Yes, it's the seat to the left of Mr. Agatsuma where you were seated...

297
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,372
Mr. Aizono!

298
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:08,972
He would put the hand wipe where you were seated!

299
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:13,372
If you put the hand wipe that you pretended

300
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,472
to be using right next to Mr. Agatsuma's,

301
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:20,472
it would be a cinch to switch it!

302
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,872
Just what do you think you're saying?

303
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:25,372
If so, where did it disappear to?

304
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,972
The hand wipe with the poison on it!

305
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:30,872
Did I have something like that on me, officer?

306
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:34,072
No. Although I did do a body check,

307
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:35,472
no such thing was found.

308
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,072
See!

309
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:39,572
If you're going to insist that I'm the killer,

310
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:43,172
first prove how the poisoned hand wipe disappeared.

311
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:47,272
It didn't disappear! It was naturally gotten rid of

312
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,672
by this rotating sushi system that gets rid of everything

313
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:53,472
when the time comes!

314
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,872
I get it! When the time comes at this rotating sushi shop,

315
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:57,272
the sushi that has been going around for some time

316
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:59,472
is automatically disposed of!

317
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:01,772
This system was taken advantage of!

318
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,772
Right! He probably did what he did

319
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:10,572
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed and everybody's attention was on him.

320
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,772
If the killer put the hand wipe that Mr. Agatsuma was originally using

321
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:16,872
inside the vinyl bag that had the poisoned hand wipe inside it,

322
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:18,372
wrapped it up and put it on the plate,

323
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,172
it would be difficult to make out from a distance

324
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,672
whether it is sushi on the plate or the hand wipe because both are white.

325
00:17:23,672 --> 00:17:27,172
It's true that if you put the plate back on the belt conveyer,

326
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,872
it would automatically be disposed of,

327
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:31,772
but if you do something that is ill mannered

328
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:33,572
such as to return the plate that you once took,

329
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:36,172
someone is bound to have noticed and remembered.

330
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,972
Remember, no joke! Everybody was doing so!

331
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:41,072
Everybody?

332
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:42,972
Saying things like, "food poisoning"!

333
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:44,772
"Don't eat it."

334
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,072
"Put the plate back!"

335
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:48,372
Everybody was putting the plates back,

336
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:50,072
so no one said anything about it!

337
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:52,872
But the conveyer belt of this lane

338
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:56,672
-was stopped immediately, wasn't it? -Yes.

339
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:59,872
2 or 3 minutes after Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

340
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,172
It's unnatural that the sushi would so conveniently be disposed of

341
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:04,972
in such a short time, right?

342
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:07,772
It's true that if the plate were just picked up some time

343
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:10,672
would've had to pass before the plate would be disposed of,

344
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,872
but if the plate were switched with the first plate

345
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,872
that was taken after coming to the shop...

346
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:19,672
The device that read this mark

347
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:23,772
would mistakenly determine that the plate has been around for some time

348
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:26,072
and dispose of it right away, wouldn't it?

349
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,872
Where do the disposed sushi go?

350
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:34,072
Yes, sir. It goes to the garbage disposal.

351
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,072
Okay, check that garbage disposal!

352
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:40,172
The poisoned hand wipe and vinyl should be there!

353
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:41,672
Yes, sir!

354
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:46,872
Mr. Aizono. If your prints are found on that vinyl bag,

355
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:49,472
it would serve as conclusive evidence.

356
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:54,772
If you turn out to be the killer,

357
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,272
your motive is probably

358
00:18:56,272 --> 00:19:00,972
the argument you had with Mr. Agatsuma before at this shop?

359
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:03,672
Yes.

360
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:06,672
If I remember correctly, he pointed out

361
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:10,272
you mistaking sea bass for flatfish in front of your wife.

362
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:13,572
Yes. Well, I happened to have a cold that day,

363
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:15,172
and couldn't really taste the fish.

364
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:18,772
It's only naturally that I made a mistake too

365
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:21,772
because just before that sea bass came to my seat,

366
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:25,072
it was switched and placed on a plate that had expensive flatfish on it.

367
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,672
Huh? It was switched?

368
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:30,172
That Agatsuma...

369
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:33,272
He got nasty with me who was explaining to my wife

370
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,472
and deliberately took the plate with the sea bass

371
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,472
and flatfish on it and switched them.

372
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:41,972
Even after that incident,

373
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:47,272
he wrote in nasty comments on my "gourmet walk" blog.

374
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:49,972
My wife used to tell me not to let him bother me,

375
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,972
but I couldn't forgive him!

376
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:53,972
I couldn't bear the fact that a rotten guy like him

377
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:56,672
was making a living as a food writer writing about food!

378
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:59,572
That's why you poisoned him to death?

379
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:04,872
Yes. Since then, I could never enjoy anything I ate.

380
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:08,372
I eventually divorced my wife, too.

381
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:12,072
All I liked to do was eat.

382
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:15,772
I was just happy watching my wife

383
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:19,172
enjoy eating at the shop that I recommended.

384
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:22,072
But that guy spoiled it all!

385
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:29,672
But, sir, do you know?

386
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:34,972
That you yourself, tarnished what you liked to do best.

387
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,372
With a deadly poison called murder

388
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,172
that cannot be wiped off no matter how hard you try.

389
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:50,472
After this, the vinyl bag in question

390
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:53,472
was found from the garbage disposal,

391
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:55,772
and the case was solved.

392
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:59,572
The sushi that stopped rotating would probably start rotating again.

393
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:02,372
But no more for a while.

394
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:06,372
I can't stand rotating sushi that reminds me of this sick incident.

395
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:30,072
Well, I really felt that

396
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:32,672
I wouldn't care for rotating sushi for a while, but...

397
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:34,572
It's delicious!

398
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:37,472
-This place is pretty good too, isn't it? -Yes!

399
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:39,072
We're addicted already!

400
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,972
Two eel plates for me!

401
00:22:40,972 --> 00:22:42,472
Sushi is a cultural cuisine that Japan created

402
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:44,572
that can be boasted of worldwide!

403
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,972
Being Japanese, I can't help but wanting to eat it.

404
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:53,272
It seems that a rotating sushi shop is also going to open soon

405
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,472
in front of the station.

406
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:56,472
What? Really?

407
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:59,672
Let's have Doc take us there again too, then!

408
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:01,872
All right, sounds good!

409
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:03,172
Let's go! Let's go!

410
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:10,872
It'll be 12,500 yen.

411
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:12,072
Huh?

412
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:15,172
You sure it's not a mistake?

413
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:18,272
That fruit parfait was good!

414
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,372
My pudding a-la-mode was good, too.

415
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:24,172
I ate all the dessert there were, but they were all good!

416
00:23:24,172 --> 00:23:26,472
You parfaits and pudding too?

417
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:30,372
Yes, although they're a bit more expensive than the sushi.

418
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:33,672
Oh, right! I thought of something good!

419
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:37,872
Why don't we make Saturday sushi day?

420
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:41,072
-Sounds good! -I agree!

421
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:44,972
Okay, the Youth Detective Squad

422
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:47,472
will go around on Saturdays to sushi shops!

423
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:49,072
-Yeah! -Yeah!

424
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:51,272
Hey...

425
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:53,872
My head's spinning round!

426
00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:56,272
It's because you got stingy to start with.

427
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:00,472
"Next Episode" -A contest of Kojimas nationwide?

428
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,272
That's 10,000,000!

429
00:24:03,272 --> 00:24:05,572
You made it to the three finalists?

430
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:07,472
What on earth happened?

431
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,672
Hey... Don't tell me that the three finalists include...

432
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,172
Don't tell me that Genta's father

433
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:21,972
is also considered one of the suspects too?

434
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:30,472
Next Conan, "The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 1)"

435
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,298
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:46,398
"Mr. Kojima."

437
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:48,498
Genta's father makes an appearance in the next episode!

438
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:51,498
-Dad's not the culprit... -Let's find out next week about that.
