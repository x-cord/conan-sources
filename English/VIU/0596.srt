1
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:11,288
Oh, it stopped raining.

2
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:13,588
Yeah.

3
00:00:13,588 --> 00:00:16,988
That's Orion Planning where Mr. Higashiyama

4
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:18,788
that we're going to be meeting now is working.

5
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:22,688
What does the company Orion Planning do?

6
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:26,688
They do commercials, plan events and produce TV programs.

7
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:32,688
It seems that the Kamen Yaiba show that kids love

8
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:34,888
is also what this company handles.

9
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:37,288
I went to watch it last week too

10
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:39,888
because Genta and the others wanted to go.

11
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:00,588
Brooding over passing seasons

12
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:02,388
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

13
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:04,188
Someone falls to death in front of your eyes.

14
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,388
The mystery of an alibi with a blind spot.

15
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:08,088
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:09,988
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,188
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:44,256
"Alibi of a Fall"

19
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,236
We have an appointment with

20
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,936
Mr. Higashiyama of the publishing planning division.

21
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,536
You're Mr. Mouri.

22
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:58,636
I've heard of you from Mr. Higashiyama.

23
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,636
I'll put him through on the extension right now.

24
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:01,636
Mr. Higashiyama told me

25
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:05,336
to call him on the extension phone from here.

26
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:08,036
It's extension 423, isn't it?

27
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,736
Yes, that's right.

28
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:11,736
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:20,336
Uh... 4, 2, 3.

30
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,636
Yes, hello.

31
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:29,736
Mr. Higashiyama? Mouri here.

32
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,236
Mr. Mouri!

33
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:34,236
Thank you for coming at this hour of the day.

34
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:37,036
Don't worry about it!

35
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:38,636
I'll come for you right away.

36
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:42,436
My office is located in an annex behind that office, you see.

37
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,236
What?

38
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:48,236
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

39
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:53,036
Well... A person just went falling outside the window.

40
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,836
What was that?

41
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:10,436
The person who died was the event planner

42
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:14,236
who works here named Mr. Fujihiko Takahata.

43
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,936
He fell to his death.

44
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:17,636
It seems that Mr. Takahata's office

45
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:19,736
is right above here on the 6th floor,

46
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:23,036
and he most likely fell from that window.

47
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:24,636
I see.

48
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:27,436
And, what brings you here?

49
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:30,936
I was asked to come here by Mr. Higashiyama who works here.

50
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,036
Yes, that's right.

51
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:36,536
I wanted to hear what Mr. Mouri had to say about

52
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:39,836
a book on mystery quizzes that I'm planning to publish.

53
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:41,836
The only two that are left in the company tonight

54
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:45,836
seem to be Mr. Higashiyama and Ms. Sunakawa.

55
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,336
I guess we should start by going to look at

56
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,836
Mr. Takahata's office on the 6th floor.

57
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:51,936
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,936
The back of the corpse is wet,

59
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:59,936
despite the rain having stopped. Why?

60
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:11,036
The elevator... Are you checking it?

61
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:14,936
No, we've already finished so you can use it.

62
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:18,736
-Did anything happen? -Yes, sort of.

63
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,636
We may have to ask you some questions later,

64
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:23,936
so please wait around, all right?

65
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,136
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

66
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:36,236
Mr. Takahata's office is the one at the very end?

67
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,536
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:41,036
You sure perspire a lot, don't you?

69
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,236
You're soaked with sweat

70
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:44,436
all the way to the collar of your dress shirt.

71
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,636
What? Is that so?

72
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:49,636
There's a band aid wrapped around Ms. Sunakawa's finger.

73
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:52,536
She didn't have it when we got here.

74
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:54,436
I wonder when she got hurt?

75
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:59,136
It's locked.

76
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:02,236
If his office is locked, it could mean that

77
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,736
it's highly probable that he committed suicide.

78
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:06,636
Suicide?

79
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:09,236
Mr. Takahata? No way!

80
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,936
What do you mean?

81
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:13,036
It's hard to believe that a person as arrogant

82
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:16,036
and overly confident like him would commit suicide.

83
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:31,136
There seems to be no mistake that he fell from here.

84
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:34,536
Inspector, this...

85
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:35,736
What's that?

86
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:36,836
"My talent has reached its limits."

87
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:37,936
"Embarrassing myself further is not something I want."

88
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:39,536
"I shall thus end my life. -Takahata Fujihiko" -This is...

89
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:41,736
Is it Mr. Takahata's will?

90
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:45,036
Oh no! I can't believe it!

91
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,736
Huh?

92
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:49,436
Conan!

93
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:50,736
Just what do you think you're doing?

94
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:52,736
It's wet over there!

95
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:53,936
What?

96
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:55,436
True.

97
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:58,736
When did tonight's rain stop?

98
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:01,936
If I remember correctly, it started raining at around 7:30

99
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:03,936
and stopped about 8:00.

100
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:09,536
We arrived at this building at around 8:20, right?

101
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:10,636
Yeah.

102
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:15,136
Hold it. Which means, that the window was left open

103
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:18,236
for more 20 minutes before Mr. Takahata fell from it?

104
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:21,736
Mr. Takahata's back was also wet, right?

105
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:24,336
I wonder if Mr. Takahata was standing by this open window

106
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:28,336
with his back against it way before he fell?

107
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,736
That's strange.

108
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,236
Inspector!

109
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:36,736
This was found stuck to Mr. Takahata's suit top!

110
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:39,536
What's that?

111
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:43,036
It looks familiar.

112
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:46,136
That's something that's used during the Kamen Yaiba Show.

113
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:47,836
Yes, that's right.

114
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:51,336
I think it's the scale that's on the monster suit.

115
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:54,536
Why would something like that be here?

116
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:58,636
The other day, I went to watch the Kamen Yaiba Show.

117
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:00,836
The Laser Police that's friends with Kamen Yaiba

118
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:02,336
fired his laser gun,

119
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:05,436
then the monster went "pssss" and deflated!

120
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:07,236
Huh, what's going on?

121
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,536
Hey! Just what do you think you're talking about?

122
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,736
Why? Why?

123
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:13,836
That monster is made of balloon.

124
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:17,036
The gun that the laser police has gives off infrared rays

125
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,336
just like that of a TV remote control

126
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,736
and when this hits the sensor of the monster,

127
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:24,236
it's made so that air escapes and the monster deflates.

128
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,936
That's something!

129
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:31,736
Air escapes from the balloon and it deflates?

130
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:34,536
Wait a minute.

131
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:38,736
The eaves is not wet.

132
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:40,636
Just as I thought.

133
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:48,136
What's the matter?

134
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,036
No... nothing!

135
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:53,736
Inspector! This is homicide made to look like suicide.

136
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,936
What?

137
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,636
First, he put the inflated monster balloon

138
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:01,636
on top of the eaves outside.

139
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,136
Then, Mr. Takahata who was put to sleep

140
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:05,336
with a sleeping drug or something,

141
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,936
was placed on the balloon by pushing him

142
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,336
forward out of the window.

143
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,836
Then, the culprit leaves the room!

144
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:14,736
But the door was locked from the inside, you know?

145
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,036
As for that,

146
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:18,436
if the window of the room next door is left open beforehand,

147
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:21,036
it's possible to move over using the window and get out!

148
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,336
I see.

149
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,836
And if he fires the gun at the monster from another room

150
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,736
using a remote controller,

151
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:30,136
Mr. Takahata's body bumps into the eaves and goes falling

152
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,436
without leaving any unexplained wounds on his body!

153
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:35,336
There were no traces of the eaves

154
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:38,036
under this window being wet by rain.

155
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,336
That's evidence that the monster balloon

156
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:42,036
was set in place before it rained!

157
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:44,836
I see. So, he retrieved the deflated balloon

158
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,236
by pulling on the rope or something

159
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,736
he had tied on to the balloon beforehand.

160
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,736
Wow, that's super deduction, Pops!

161
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,636
Of course it is!

162
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:55,536
The culprit after setting all this up left the room,

163
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:58,236
but it began to rain before he carried out his plan,

164
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:01,336
so the back of the corpse and floor got wet.

165
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:04,636
So, the culprit made this will up too!

166
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:08,236
Where is that balloon usually stored?

167
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:10,336
Inside the 1st floor warehouse.

168
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:12,736
All employees can access it at all times.

169
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:15,436
The culprit is an employee of this company.

170
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:19,436
Chiba! The monster balloon and gun that is moved by a remote controller

171
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,936
should be somewhere in this building.

172
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:23,436
Search every nook and cranny and find it!

173
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:24,736
Yes, sir!

174
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:31,436
How far does the infrared laser reach?

175
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:35,036
The farthest it goes at most is 56 meters.

176
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:38,036
Which means, it won't be difficult

177
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,036
to find which room the culprit used.

178
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:44,036
True. The conference room next door and...

179
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:46,736
The office rooms right below here on the 5th and 4th floor,

180
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:49,636
and the conference room next to those rooms.

181
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:52,236
A total of 5 rooms.

182
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:56,036
But only the user of those offices have the key,

183
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:59,136
so other people do not have free access to them.

184
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:03,436
In other words, it's any one of the conference rooms

185
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:05,136
on the 4th, 5th or 6th floor.

186
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:11,336
Are the conference rooms all made the same way?

187
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,836
Yes.

188
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:14,636
Inspector. If it's this distance,

189
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:16,636
it's possible to move from window to window.

190
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:19,536
Okay, Takagi. Go to the security guard room

191
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:22,236
and check who went in and out of here this evening.

192
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:23,936
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:27,936
I'd like to start by asking you some questions, then.

194
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,236
I was on the phone talking to a client in this office

195
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:37,136
on the 2nd floor right through from a little before it started raining.

196
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,836
By the time I finished talking on the phone,

197
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:40,336
the rain had stopped.

198
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,036
When did you hear that

199
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,936
I would coming here from Mr. Higashiyama?

200
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:46,636
About 7:00.

201
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,236
Before I received the call from my client,

202
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:52,736
I got a call on the extension phone from Mr. Higashiyama's office.

203
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:56,736
How did you know that it was from Mr. Higashiyama's office?

204
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,136
Because the extension number is displayed,

205
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,536
there's no mistake.

206
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:04,236
-Mr. Mouri and the others came after that. -Yes, sir.

207
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:07,936
While Mr. Mouri was talking on the extension phone with Mr. Higashiyama,

208
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,936
I went to the reference room to return some documents.

209
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,736
This way.

210
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,236
I was organizing some papers here,

211
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:21,836
so I didn't notice all the noise

212
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:23,636
Mr. Mouri and the others were making here.

213
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,436
Didn't you just make it look that way,

214
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:28,136
when you actually ran right away up to the 4th floor,

215
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:30,636
and pushed Mr. Takahata out the window from the conference room?

216
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:34,136
But the stairs is right beside the elevator,

217
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:36,736
so the maintenance men working on the elevator would've seen her.

218
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,536
True.

219
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:44,236
You were organizing some papers and?

220
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,236
I cut my finger with the paper,

221
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:49,336
so I went back to the office to get myself a band aid.

222
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,736
That's when I first noticed

223
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,536
the voices of Mr. Mouri and the others outside the window,

224
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,836
and tried to go outside, too.

225
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,636
Just then I saw Mr. Higashiyama

226
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:59,336
coming along from the connecting corridor.

227
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:05,436
Did you pick up the call on the extension phone

228
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:07,136
from Mr. Mouri in this room?

229
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:11,136
Yes. Since I was working here all evening.

230
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:14,536
There's no doubt that Mr. Higashiyama was here.

231
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:17,136
I dialed the extension myself besides.

232
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:20,336
The phone over there is hooked on to the wall

233
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:22,336
and cannot be moved.

234
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,536
In order to go to Mr. Takahata's office

235
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:29,136
that's in the main building from this room in the annex,

236
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:32,536
I'd have to cross the connecting corridor.

237
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:34,036
To go from there to the stairs,

238
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:35,936
I'd have to pass in front of the elevator.

239
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:39,336
So if you ask the maintenance men who were checking the elevator,

240
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:43,136
I'm sure that they will testify that I didn't go pass there.

241
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,736
Can you go from outside to the main building?

242
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:48,336
If so, you'll have to go pass the entrance

243
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:49,436
where the security guard is.

244
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:53,836
Either way, the culprit would have to go pass someone.

245
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,536
Can you change the extension number?

246
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,836
Not with this telephone.

247
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:00,236
There is what is like a concentrated switchboard

248
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,636
on the 2nd floor of the main building,

249
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,236
and that's the only place any changes can be made.

250
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:07,636
Is that right?

251
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:10,236
Do you do Japanese archery, sir?

252
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:11,836
Yeah.

253
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:14,536
When I was a student, I did a bit.

254
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:17,636
Mr. Higashiyama is a really good archery shooter

255
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:19,636
who won the city tournament.

256
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:21,936
That's really something!

257
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:25,536
No, I'm not that great of a shooter.

258
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,536
According to the testimony of the security guard,

259
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:32,736
Mr. Takahata who had been out, returned at 7:10.

260
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:35,236
After that, the only people who went in or out of the building

261
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:37,936
were Mr. Mouri and his party.

262
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:39,436
The elevator maintenance workers

263
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:41,736
started checking the elevator about 7:00

264
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:45,536
and saw Mr. Takahata go climbing up the stairs.

265
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:50,136
Didn't the workers see Ms Sunakawa or Mr. Higashiyama?

266
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:52,236
No. They say that nobody

267
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,236
other than Mr. Takahata went by.

268
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:55,236
Inspector!

269
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:59,036
We found the monster balloon and remote controlled gun!

270
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:00,336
Where were they found?

271
00:15:00,336 --> 00:15:02,236
There is a dust chute on the landing of every stairs on every floor

272
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,136
where people can throw trash away.

273
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:07,436
It was stuck in there.

274
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:10,636
Around the 3rd and 4th floor.

275
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:13,136
So the culprit use this and...

276
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:16,336
And one other thing.

277
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,536
This was found on the eaves of the window

278
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:21,736
of the conference room on the 4th floor.

279
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,636
A fountain pen...

280
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,036
According to the forensic officers,

281
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,636
it's not something that was dropped there today or yesterday.

282
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,236
I don't think it has anything to do with the incident,

283
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:32,436
but just in case...

284
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:35,836
No, wrong! That fountain pen

285
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,436
is in fact the vital key to solving the incident!

286
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,736
I see, I got it!

287
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:44,736
The one who killed Mr. Takahata is that person!

288
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,310
What is it, Mr. Mouri?

289
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,310
Huh? He's gone.

290
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,310
"Extension 423"

291
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,110
What the?

292
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,310
It's me, Inspector.

293
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,610
Mr. Mouri, where are you?

294
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,810
This is the phone number to Mr. Higashiyama's office.

295
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,310
Inspector.

296
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,310
Could you please switch the phone over to speaker phone?

297
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,710
All right.

298
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,610
Mr. Mouri, are you in my office?

299
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,210
I'm sorry to have entered without permission.

300
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,710
But it's necessary to solve this case.

301
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,410
Have you come to the truth of the case?

302
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,210
Yes, I've figured everything out.

303
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,910
Mr. Takahata returned at 7:10 tonight.

304
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,710
It began to rain at around 7:30.

305
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,510
In other words, the culprit went to

306
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,610
Mr. Takahata's office during this time

307
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,210
and put him to sleep.

308
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,010
Then, he set up the trick using the Yaiba Show balloon

309
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,610
and left the office.

310
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,410
But, since it began to rain,

311
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,310
before the culprit could carry out his scheme,

312
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,110
the corpse and the floor got wet,

313
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,510
his trick was given away.

314
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,710
Why didn't the culprit push Mr. Takahata out the window

315
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,610
as soon as it started raining?

316
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,710
It sure is weird.

317
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,810
That's because the culprit wanted to be

318
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,410
as far as possible from the place that Mr. Takahata fell from,

319
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,410
since then it would serve as an unfaltering alibi.

320
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,010
Isn't that right, Mr. Higashiyama?

321
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,110
The one who killed Mr. Takahata...

322
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,510
is you, Mr. Higashiyama!

323
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,310
What?

324
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,310
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

325
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,510
I took your call from the annex

326
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,810
in another building when you called,

327
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,910
so how could I have killed Mr. Takahata?

328
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,610
Mr. Higashiyama.

329
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,110
Where do you think I'm calling you from just now?

330
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,310
Where from...

331
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,110
Don't tell me?

332
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,510
Mr. Mouri!

333
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,710
Why are you there?

334
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,710
Are you really calling from that conference room?

335
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,710
Yes.

336
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,710
But the extension number is 423.

337
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,710
Extension numbers are not something

338
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,210
that is attached to the telephone itself,

339
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,910
but rather, to the telephone line.

340
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,910
In short, it is something connected to the modular cable

341
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,210
that is attached to the phone.

342
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,110
Mr. Higashiyama removed the cable from the phone at his office,

343
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,310
and used the extension cable

344
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,010
and connected it to the phone in the conference room.

345
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,710
That way, the extension phone number of this conference room

346
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,010
is changed to 423,

347
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,010
which is the extension number to Mr. Higashiyama's office.

348
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,110
How did he cross the cable between the main building and annex?

349
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,010
Mr. Higashiyama is an expert at Japanese archery.

350
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,510
He probably tied the extension cable and arrow with a long string

351
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,410
and shot that arrow from his office in the annex

352
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,810
to the window of the corridor of the main building.

353
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,110
Then if he pulls that string from the main building,

354
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,610
he can cross the extension cable from the annex to the main building.

355
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,010
Mr. Higashiyama.

356
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,810
This is how you connected the cable of your office

357
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,310
to the telephone in the conference room.

358
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,210
You then waited until elevator maintenance began at 7:00

359
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,210
and called Ms. Sunakawa,

360
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,310
in order to make it look like you were in your office in the annex.

361
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,610
And when you got my call on your extension phone,

362
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,810
while picking up my call, you used the monster balloon trick,

363
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,310
and pushed Mr. Takahata out of the window.

364
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,810
After that you re-connected

365
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,710
the telephone cable the way it should be,

366
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,410
then hid the gun and balloon

367
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,910
that you retrieved into the dust chute.

368
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,310
You hurried back to your office

369
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,610
and retrieved the extension cable,

370
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,510
joined Ms. Sunakawa as if nothing had happened

371
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,510
and appeared before us.

372
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,310
Please wait!

373
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,310
How did I get back to the annex?

374
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,710
Yes. In order to get back to the annex,

375
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,510
he would've have to go pass

376
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,710
in front of the elevator that was being checked.

377
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,910
He went out the 3rd floor window

378
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,610
and crossed above the connecting corridor.

379
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,410
This way, he wouldn't have to be seen by the maintenance workers.

380
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,210
Your statement is based only on assumption!

381
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,310
Do you have proof? Proof!

382
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,010
The extension cable that I am using now

383
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,610
is what I found in your office.

384
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,810
I know of... no such thing!

385
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,510
Mr. Higashiyama, it looks so clear to me.

386
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,010
You're perspiration prone

387
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,910
so you have to keep wiping off sweat.

388
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,410
So much to the point

389
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,110
that the collar of your sky blue dress shirt had turned dark blue.

390
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,610
Yeah.

391
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,810
Is that really perspiration?

392
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,810
A fountain pen was found

393
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,310
on top of the eaves of the window of this conference room.

394
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,110
When it rains the ink that leaks out from there,

395
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,110
comes dripping mixed in the rain.

396
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,510
When you leaned forward out of the window

397
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,910
to fire at the balloon monster,

398
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,810
the ink dropped on your collar.

399
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,010
Mr. Higashiyama.

400
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,610
You did it, didn't you?

401
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,410
Right, I did it.

402
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,510
The fact is, a small factory that my older brother ran,

403
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,710
fell into financial difficulties,

404
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,310
so I introduced this company to him.

405
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,610
A lot of goods to be used at events were ordered,

406
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,810
so he was very happy.

407
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,510
However, Takahata picked on my older brother's weakness

408
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,510
and demanded illegal kick back,

409
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,410
but my brother who had a strong sense of justice refused.

410
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,410
Then, the company refused to pay for the items.

411
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,310
You could've sued them for breeching of contract.

412
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,510
Takahata had seen through that and schemed it

413
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,610
so that he could get away with it.

414
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,110
My older brother ended up with a large amount of debt

415
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,010
and he committed suicide.

416
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,610
Oh, no...

417
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,110
That's why I killed him!

418
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,510
With the things that he used to carry out his plan for events!

419
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,910
I was sure it was going to work out well!

420
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,010
I figured that if the renown detective Kogoro Mouri was my witness,

421
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,410
I could surely succeed assured!

422
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,410
Only if... Only if it didn't rain!

423
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,710
I'm upside down!

424
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,210
I guess Pops is wide awake now?

425
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,010
"Next Episode" -What's this Blood Smoke Hit Man about?

426
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,010
It's a movie about a killer.

427
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,110
For some reason, he is asked to do jobs at hot spring towns,

428
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,610
and smoky steam is dyed in blood.

429
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,610
That seems to be how he got his name.

430
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,210
Would you like to try the specialty of this hot spring inn...

431
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,410
an open-air bath on the lake?

432
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,810
It's been three days since I've last taken a bath!

433
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:33,110
Next Conan, "Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 1)"

434
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,010
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,110
"Outdoor spa on the lake"

436
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,910
This place is full of open air baths. It looks like fun!

437
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,910
Pops, you're going to stay back home.

438
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,110
What? No way! I'm going no matter what!
