1
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:04,830
What?

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:06,030
What did you just say?

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:08,831
Are you serious, Shinichi?

4
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,130
Yeah. No doubt about it!

5
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:14,730
I found a member of the Black Organization

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,331
after a chain of unusually coincidental events!

7
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:22,630
This is bad. The movement of the transmitter's becoming faster!

8
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,630
She's using a car.

9
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,730
Dr. Agasa! Rush over here!

10
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,430
Come pick me up with your Beetle!

11
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,430
Make sure that Haibara doesn't find out about this.

12
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,330
What?

13
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:34,131
Okay...

14
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,730
And Shinichi.

15
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:42,031
Yeah. I'm at Haido-cho's...

16
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:57,731
You're not getting away!

17
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:01,930
Conan?

18
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,831
Did you find what you were looking for?

19
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:08,030
What? What's up?

20
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,430
Conan says that he coincidentally ran into Dr. Agasa

21
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:13,630
and they're heading off to Tropical Land from now.

22
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:16,830
Come off it... It's raining.

23
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:18,631
What's with those two?

24
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,730
I'll call you again when I'm ready to go home!

25
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:22,831
Hey, wait...

26
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,230
I see...

27
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:41,430
You coincidentally became acquainted with an announcer,

28
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:44,730
who asked you to take on a job and went to her condominium,

29
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,330
where for investigation purposes,

30
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:50,830
you used chewing gum to stick on a transmitter and wiretap to the wall.

31
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,530
But the chewing gum came off and stuck to the sole of her shoe.

32
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,630
And that woman, again for some reason,

33
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:58,430
coincidentally turns out to be one of them.

34
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:00,730
Is that right?

35
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:02,530
Hey, Dr. Agasa?

36
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,230
I thought I told you not to bring her along!

37
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:07,931
Well, but you see...

38
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,530
So? Are you sure that

39
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:16,030
the announcer called Rena Mizunashi is one of them?

40
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:20,130
Yeah. She was sending mail to the mail address of their boss.

41
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:24,530
She also addressed the one who called her after that as...

42
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:25,630
Gin!

43
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,731
So, you see!

44
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:31,030
But you're sure lucky.

45
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:34,330
You got a clue to who they are thanks to a string of coincidences.

46
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:36,030
Rather, it's just the opposite.

47
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,130
It's the opposite. Really bad.

48
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:39,630
Think about it carefully.

49
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:43,030
If the transmitter and wiretap are found by them,

50
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:46,130
they'll naturally try to figure out who set it up.

51
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,530
And, the first person to be suspected would be the one

52
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:52,230
who was at that announcer's place until just a while ago,

53
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:54,330
Detective Kogoro Mouri!

54
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,230
Hey, don't tell me that...

55
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:57,330
Yeah.

56
00:02:57,331 --> 00:03:00,730
Even if Pops were to have set them up

57
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:04,630
to investigate the case she asked him to take on.

58
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:09,330
The chance that he may have heard their conversation cannot be denied.

59
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:11,830
If this happens, those guys would most likely...

60
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,630
Get to work trying to shut him up.

61
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:16,530
Not only Kogoro Mouri.

62
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:21,930
But if need be, every single person around him.

63
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:23,330
No way...

64
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:27,730
In other words, the more information comes through the transmitter,

65
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:32,930
the more the necks of both Pops and I are being choked.

66
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:35,730
Then, we have to retrieve them

67
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,930
as soon as possible before those guys find them.

68
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,330
But I just don't get it.

69
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,130
That announcer asked Detective Mouri

70
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:47,030
to nab the one who was ringing her doorbell and running away, right?

71
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:49,730
Moreover, the culprit turned out to be a kid.

72
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,530
If she were one of them, she would never...

73
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:53,630
Yeah.

74
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:55,831
That's the part that bugs me too.

75
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:00,031
The movement of the transmitter has slowed down.

76
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:12,730
Besides the sound of the engine is echoing.

77
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,930
Which means...

78
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:17,231
She went into an indoor parking lot somewhere.

79
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:21,931
Which means that she'll be meeting those guys in that building somewhere.

80
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,130
She's approaching something...

81
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,231
Is it a car?

82
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:36,031
This unique uneven sound of idling...

83
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,030
And...

84
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:45,630
The sound of the engine revving is that of a horizontally opposed engine.

85
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:47,030
Hey, don't tell me that...

86
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:48,330
Yeah...

87
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,330
The only cars equipped with this engine

88
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,730
are either Volkswagens, Subaru or...

89
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:54,331
that guy's beloved vehicle.

90
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,431
Porsche. That's all.

91
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,330
What's up, Kir?

92
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,130
You promised to be here at 10 am.

93
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,430
Gin!

94
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:23,930
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:26,230
A car seems to have been tailing me

96
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,430
so I was trying to throw it off track, just in case.

97
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,731
Don't tell me that she's referring to our car?

98
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:37,130
No, because we kept more than 600 m away from her car.

99
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:38,731
It couldn't be us.

100
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:42,930
Are you sure you're not in trouble?

101
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,430
Yes. I was just being too overly concerned.

102
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:49,230
So, will you put that Beretta that you're aiming out the window

103
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:51,930
back into it's case?

104
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,630
If you shoot me because you don't trust me...

105
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:57,031
You won't be able to kill DJ, right?

106
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,430
DJ...

107
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:02,430
What does that mean?

108
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:04,230
Okay.

109
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:09,130
We have 500 m of all the four directions of this building covered.

110
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:11,430
If an unwanted car approaches,

111
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:13,731
we'll know right of the bat.

112
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:16,830
Dr. Agasa.

113
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,930
Will you pull the car over slowly to the shoulder of the road.

114
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:19,931
What?

115
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:22,630
After stopping wear your hood and go outside.

116
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,630
Then, pretend that you're checking the car.

117
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,130
Quick!

118
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:27,231
Okay.

119
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,530
Here goes the final confirmation.

120
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,130
Go ahead.

121
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,530
Time is 13:00.

122
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,330
Place is Edie P...

123
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:53,630
I, as the interviewer, will guide DJ to the designated place.

124
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:54,830
Yes...

125
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,530
We'll be waiting for you, Kir.

126
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,630
Shove the prey right into the center of my scope

127
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:04,730
and excite me.

128
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,230
My, Chianti...

129
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:08,931
Korn's with you too, isn't he?

130
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,130
How encouraging.

131
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,930
Kir, Chianti, Korn.

132
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,430
How many of them are they, anyway?

133
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:19,830
I'm counting on you all.

134
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:23,231
Our achievements will never see the light.

135
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:27,331
But when we fail, the word goes around really quickly.

136
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:33,230
Whether we succeed or not, nobody will know about it.

137
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:35,730
That's how the organization works.

138
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:38,330
Yeah. That's right.

139
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,930
Okay. It's almost time.

140
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:42,731
Hurry and finish what you have to.

141
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,830
Will you work it out

142
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:48,830
so that I don't have to do anything?

143
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:50,930
Vermouth!

144
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,130
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

145
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,430
How come?

146
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,330
Why is this lady here?

147
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:56,830
Nobody told me!

148
00:07:56,831 --> 00:08:00,230
How come this lady who took Calvados out on his own and left him to die

149
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,430
is included in this project!

150
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:05,231
Go back to the car, Chianti.

151
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:09,131
We're keeping her here just in case.

152
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,130
But...

153
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:16,031
This is his order too, you know?

154
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:25,931
The place is Edie P.

155
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:31,730
I guess there's no better place for hunting?

156
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,731
What?

157
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:34,531
What do you mean by that?

158
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:40,630
You should at study a bit of their history too, Vodka.

159
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,630
Yeah.

160
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:46,030
What's more of a problem is the rain.

161
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,630
Don't worry.

162
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,731
It'll clear up before noon. The weather forecast...

163
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,230
Darn it! It's raining so hard

164
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,830
that the sound's...

165
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,430
Haibara, do you know?

166
00:08:58,431 --> 00:08:59,931
Who's DJ?

167
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:03,130
Where's this Edie P that they're talking about?

168
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:04,730
They mention about that just now!

169
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:06,530
It's a code or something, right?

170
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:08,430
Well...

171
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,430
I don't know who is DJ

172
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:12,230
but if Edie P is a place,

173
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:15,230
P probably stands for a parking lot or a park.

174
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:18,630
Then, do you know who Kir, Chianti and Korn are?

175
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,930
I don't remember Kir.

176
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:23,630
But I've heard of Chianti and Korn.

177
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:26,430
They're supposed to be competent snipers.

178
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,430
Which means that they're going to assassinate somebody after all.

179
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,130
Hey, what's going on?

180
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:33,330
Don't tell me that the two are there too?

181
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:35,630
Darn it, I don't have enough information.

182
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,330
I've to get closer!

183
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:41,531
The transmitter is 580 m northeast from here.

184
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:49,731
Probably at the basement parking of that building over there.

185
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:53,630
Haibara, wait here together with the Dr. Agasa!

186
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:55,130
Hey, just where do you think you're going?

187
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:56,231
Never mind that! Just wait here!

188
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,531
That's as far as you go.

189
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,306
Kudo!

190
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:28,507
Shinichi?

191
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:35,707
Hi!

192
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,707
Cool Kid.

193
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,807
Ms. Jodie?

194
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:53,407
Hi!

195
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:57,506
What brings you here?

196
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:01,806
We, FBI agents, have been tailing her.

197
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:05,706
Ever since Vermouth disguised as Dr. Araide,

198
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,106
that announcer, Rena Mizunashi,

199
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:11,806
has been frequenting his clinic.

200
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,506
But it really shocked me,

201
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,507
when we were staking her out and...

202
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:21,007
Detective Mouri went into her place.

203
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,107
Then...

204
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:29,507
Just now, I feel like I was being watched by someone.

205
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,306
That was...

206
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:36,006
Yes! That was me!

207
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:38,806
And I found out that she had asked Kogoro

208
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:40,706
to investigate the prank that was being played by the child.

209
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:42,306
Just when I thought she was innocent

210
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:45,007
and about to quit staking her out...

211
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:50,206
I saw you running with a dreadfully serious look on your face.

212
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,307
Cool kid?

213
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:56,007
I figured there had to be something going on.

214
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:00,107
So, I continued to pursue her.

215
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:07,106
I knew she was trying to throw me off track,

216
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:10,906
so I didn't gone all the way and dropped pursuing her altogether.

217
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:12,106
I see.

218
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,906
So the car she was referring to was...

219
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,506
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,806
A car seems to have been tailing me

221
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,606
so I was trying to throw it off track, just in case.

222
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:23,607
The car she was talking about was Ms. Jodie's car.

223
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:28,206
You people lost track of her car too, didn't you?

224
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:31,906
Leave the rest to the F.B.I and go on home!

225
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:35,006
"You", you said? Do you mean you have a clue?

226
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:37,206
I can't give you the details,

227
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:41,106
but it seems she going to be interviewing three people today.

228
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:44,006
I'm thinking that maybe there is a person among the three,

229
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:46,606
who's being manipulated by them

230
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,106
and that some sort of transaction

231
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:50,906
or information exchange will be carried out.

232
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:53,006
No, it's no transaction!

233
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,306
Those guys are planning to kill one of the three

234
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,806
at 1 pm in the afternoon today!

235
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:59,206
What?

236
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,806
How do you know?

237
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:04,706
The transmitter coincidentally got stuck to the sole of her shoe.

238
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:08,206
So I've been pursuing her with my pursuit glasses...

239
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,606
This is bad! It's coming closer!

240
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,506
-Get in! -What?

241
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:13,706
Dr. Agasa, you too! Get in quickly!

242
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,207
Yeah.

243
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:23,606
Jodie here.

244
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:26,506
Our target is heading southward on Toriyakaido!

245
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:27,707
Please pursue.

246
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:32,006
Gin's car is taking a different route...

247
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,306
Are we pursuing them too?

248
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:39,206
No. All we'll end up doing just pursuing them blindly is go in circles.

249
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:42,206
Besides, we're finished if they find out that we're tailing them.

250
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:47,006
But we have to do something or someone's going to be killed, right?

251
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:50,006
In other words, we have no choice

252
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:51,606
but to figure out who DJ is

253
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:52,906
and figure out the place called Edie P

254
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:55,806
and get to both before they do.

255
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,106
Yeah.

256
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,806
So, will you tell me in detail

257
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,306
about the three people

258
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,106
that the announcer is scheduled to interview today?

259
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:06,206
The three people she'll be interviewing are

260
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:08,306
the candidates who are running for the House of Representatives

261
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,106
for the first time.

262
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:11,906
The first person is a professor

263
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:13,306
of the pharmaceutical department of Teito University,

264
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:18,206
who has researched and developed many new drugs, Eisaku Tokiwa.

265
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,706
The second person is a famous actor from a distinguished family.

266
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:24,306
Moreover, if he wins, he will be a second generation Dietman.

267
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:26,006
Junji Sendou.

268
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:29,806
The third person is the son of the former official of the Defense Agency,

269
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,106
who he himself served as a higher up in the Self Defense Force,

270
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:33,806
Yasuteru Domon.

271
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,006
But we weren't able to get information on what time,

272
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:40,306
where and who she would be interviewing.

273
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:43,906
We were told that it was all up to her and the TV crew.

274
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:47,206
Maybe she's going to be holding a no appointment interview.

275
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:52,206
If so, high chances that the TV crew is also one of them.

276
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:57,106
But all three of them do not have the initials DJ.

277
00:14:57,107 --> 00:15:00,306
Eisaku Tokiwa is ET.

278
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:03,806
Junji Sendou is JS.

279
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:07,606
Yasuteru Domon is YD.

280
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,706
If we can at least figure out the place.

281
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:14,206
There are so many parking lots and parks.

282
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:18,506
DJ usually stands for Disc Jockey, doesn't it?

283
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:20,306
The etymology is disc...

284
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:22,806
In other words, records are changed one after the other

285
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,706
to play a variety of songs.

286
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,406
This was deemed analogous to one riding records,

287
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:30,806
that is, to a jockey who rides horses.

288
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,306
We have no information that any of the three

289
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:36,907
is into music or hooked on gambling either.

290
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:40,006
Gambling?

291
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,306
What's on your mind?

292
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,906
It's about time that...

293
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,507
Gambling.

294
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:47,806
It's about time that we go after her

295
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:51,106
or we'll really lose track of her...

296
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:54,406
No. We're not pursuing her.

297
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:57,906
Let's call the election offices.

298
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:01,006
And ask what the candidate is scheduled to do around 13:00.

299
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,606
Don't tell me that you figured something out?

300
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:10,206
Yeah. One of the three is their target DJ!

301
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,706
The clue is the Jack of Diamonds.

302
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:14,507
The Jack of Diamonds?

303
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,906
Are you saying that's what DJ stands for?

304
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:20,907
Yeah.

305
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:28,006
They always referred to their targets using playing cards!

306
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:32,106
If so, diamonds symbolize material possessions and financial wealth.

307
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,806
DJ is comes from a rich, distinguished family

308
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,806
and will become a second generation Dietman if elected...

309
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,706
He's Junji Sendou.

310
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,906
Wrong.

311
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:41,606
In playing cards, The Jack of Diamonds symbolizes

312
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:43,006
the one who serves the Court,

313
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,806
either a retainer or a soldier who has be appointed as an official.

314
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:48,206
It doesn't have the meaning of Prince or son.

315
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,207
What?

316
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,406
But...

317
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:53,006
He's the only rich one around.

318
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:55,606
It's true that diamonds symbolize money,

319
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:59,206
But in astrology it symbolizes other qualities.

320
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:02,506
In other words, a former self defense executive,

321
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:05,506
with a name that describes the character Earth in his name, which means.

322
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,806
Yasuteru Domon.

323
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,907
He's their target!

324
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:13,006
Yasuteru Domon.

325
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:15,206
He has a strong sense of justice

326
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,706
and made repeated radical comments regarding violence

327
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:20,006
and crimes on TV and in the papers.

328
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,206
He also has a great number of supporters.

329
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,306
Therefore, he had snipers being sent out after him

330
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:27,406
by crime related organizations,

331
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:31,206
but he's a super tough guy who beat them all up instead.

332
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:35,806
It seems that he doesn't need us to protect him though.

333
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:39,506
No. The one who is after him is The Black Organization.

334
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:41,207
They can't be taken lightly.

335
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:44,106
I got it.

336
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:46,906
The telephone number to his election campaign office.

337
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:51,306
It says on the website that he is scheduled to play golf this afternoon

338
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:53,906
but it doesn't say where.

339
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,306
So, the parking lot of the golf range

340
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:59,206
is where Mr. Domon is going to be shot.

341
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:03,207
At any rate, I think it's fastest to call this office and ask.

342
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:05,606
Here.

343
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:08,406
Ms. Jodie, here's the number.

344
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:09,607
Okay!

345
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,807
There. Okay.

346
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:19,906
What?

347
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:23,906
No. I just thought you changed.

348
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:25,006
What?

349
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,606
Because when any of them were involved before,

350
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,806
"Stop it!"

351
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:29,807
"It's dangerous!"

352
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,606
"You'd better run!"

353
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:34,006
That's all you used to say!

354
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:35,506
Most naturally.

355
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:39,606
This time the transmitter and wiretap that you carelessly set up

356
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:44,306
is stuck on the sole of the shoe of one of the members.

357
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:45,906
If they find the devices,

358
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,106
not only you, but all the people around you,

359
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:51,206
in other words, all of us as well may be dunked into hot water.

360
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:53,606
That's true, but...

361
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:56,006
Besides...

362
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:57,207
I...

363
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:02,006
I'll go see him after all.

364
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,106
If I see the culprit close by, I may be able to recognize him.

365
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,606
No! I already explained to you that

366
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,706
if the culprit is not caught,

367
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:12,406
there's a possibility that you'll get into big trouble.

368
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:14,506
But...

369
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:16,406
Not only you,

370
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,906
but there is a possibility that all the people who helped you

371
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,707
will end up being their target.

372
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:25,906
I understand your feeling of wanting to punish evil.

373
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:27,806
But to hold yourself back,

374
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:31,106
endure and back off is also a type of courage.

375
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:33,106
But...

376
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,806
But I...

377
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,507
I don't want to run!

378
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:40,006
I can never win if I keep on running away!

379
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,507
Never!

380
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:47,207
Besides... What?
