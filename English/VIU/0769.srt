1
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:03,705
Ai, would you like to come over to my house today?

2
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:06,575
Mom baked some cookies yesterday.

3
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:08,845
Sorry, I don't think so.

4
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:12,375
I'll go have some then! Those cookies!

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,705
You like eels over rice, don't you, Genta?

6
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:16,845
I'll go and have them, the cookies!

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:19,845
I wonder if there are "eels over rice" cookies.

8
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,155
It sounds good.

9
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:24,535
I wouldn't dare eat them even if there were.

10
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:26,605
Hold it! Freeze!

11
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:33,195
Stay away. Stay away, I said.

12
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:34,825
Cool it!

13
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:37,143
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

14
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:38,278
Darn!

15
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:45,165
-I'm really sorry. -What?

16
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,345
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:56,555
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

18
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:58,475
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

19
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:00,395
Who's the strange one?

20
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:02,265
The inconspicuous relationship between doctor and patient.

21
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:03,812
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,665
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:08,185
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:50,867
"A Troublesome Emergency Patient."

25
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:57,547
"Beika Emergency Medical Center."

26
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,827
You can't identify him?

27
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:29,077
No, all he has on him is a knife and wallet.

28
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:31,827
He has no sort of identification on him.

29
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:34,617
We got word that there is no data matching his prints

30
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:37,197
on the ex-con list either.

31
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,967
And, why was he being pursued by the police to begin with?

32
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:42,447
Interrogation.

33
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,353
He was being interrogated about 100m from where Conan and the others were

34
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:47,597
because he looked suspicious.

35
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:50,097
Then he suddenly fled.

36
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:53,017
Judging from the fact that he had a knife on him,

37
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,717
maybe he was intending to commit robbery or something?

38
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:01,477
Did he have it out with the police officer back then?

39
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:02,607
Have it out?

40
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:06,487
That man had a wound on his head, didn't he?

41
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,597
About that...

42
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:13,897
It seems he was already staggering when he was being interrogated.

43
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:15,507
Since that made him look suspicious,

44
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,167
the officer stopped him to question him.

45
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:19,377
Just what's going on?

46
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:25,737
I'm from MPD. How's the patient doing?

47
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:27,607
He's suffering from cerebral hemorrhage

48
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:29,767
due to a strong blow to the back of his head.

49
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:31,207
"Tatsuhiko Kido (40)" -He is in critical condition

50
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:33,917
and I can't very well tell whether he'll make it or not.

51
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:36,297
Could he have been struck or something?

52
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,767
Or, did he fall on his own?

53
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:43,067
-I wonder. I can't really tell. -I see.

54
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,407
His identity and whether we've got a case or not are both unknown.

55
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,177
This is a tough one.

56
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:50,787
What about his dental records or traces of past surgery?

57
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:54,197
Can't you figure something out from medical records?

58
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:56,547
You sure know a lot, sonny.

59
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:02,127
Pops Kogoro told me about this some time ago.

60
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:04,317
Pops Kogoro?

61
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:09,477
The Sleeping Kogoro, in other words, the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri!

62
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:13,277
And, we're members of the Youth Detective Squad!

63
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:18,057
I wonder if that man'll make it.

64
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:20,957
Ayumi, don't tell me you're on his side?

65
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:22,397
Right.

66
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:26,247
He's a bad guy that held a knife up against you, Ayumi!

67
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:30,577
It's true that I was surprised and scared but...

68
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,387
I just couldn't think he was such a bad person.

69
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,637
-And... -He had no traces of previous surgery.

70
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:44,097
As to his dental records, our dentistry department is looking into it now.

71
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:47,927
I'm sure they'll be getting back to us. If you will excuse me.

72
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:02,587
-Inspector! -Mouri.

73
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,367
I see.

74
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,797
-No clue. -No.

75
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:17,707
I guess we'll just have to wait for the man to regain consciousness.

76
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:25,207
What's this sticking out of his wallet?

77
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:26,517
"Haido Construction Suspected of Bribery."

78
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,557
It's a clipping from a magazine. See.

79
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:33,807
Isn't that the article that's the talk of the town

80
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,237
regarding the scandal of the political and business circles?

81
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:38,827
Don't tell me this has something to do with that?

82
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:40,977
And somebody's after his life...

83
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:45,147
Which means they could be coming after him again?

84
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,067
Post police officers throughout the hospital on the double!

85
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:49,847
Ask for back up from the Second Investigation Division!

86
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,666
As for cooperation from the District Public Prosecutors Office too.

87
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,027
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

88
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,477
What a way to go!

89
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:01,497
I don't get it, but it sure is exciting!

90
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,877
-What do you think? -Well...

91
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,417
Ayumi.

92
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:10,517
Just before he collapsed, did he say anything to you, Ayumi?

93
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:11,667
What?

94
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:13,637
Well...

95
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:15,677
-Come to think of it. -What?

96
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:19,467
I'm sorry, just because Daddy's such a coward.

97
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:21,637
I'm really sorry.

98
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,617
Daddy? Was he your father?

99
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:31,547
No, Genta.

100
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:37,157
He was probably so dazed out that he mistook Ayumi for his own child.

101
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,107
The question is whether that has anything to do

102
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,407
with happened this time or not.

103
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:43,626
Right.

104
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:47,117
-Conan, let's investigate too! -What?

105
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:52,037
I just can't make myself think that the man is a bad person.

106
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:54,507
So, I'd like to help him somehow!

107
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:57,157
OK, let's give it a try.

108
00:07:57,627 --> 00:08:00,267
All right! The Youth Detective Squad!

109
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,857
This is a hospital, you know, Genta.

110
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,767
-Off we go. -Aye!

111
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:13,277
If I'm not mistaken, he came from that side, right, that man?

112
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:17,747
He was being interrogated about 100m away from here...

113
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,787
And then he fled.

114
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,977
Let's go check!

115
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:47,097
Oh, I remember him.

116
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,187
See, right over there.

117
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,447
He got off the cab right over there but...

118
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,927
Hurry up, will you! Move out of the way!

119
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,737
The one who got on next was rough, you see.

120
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:07,037
Maybe he got hurt back then? You know, the wound on his head.

121
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:08,427
I wonder.

122
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,797
Granny, do you know what taxi company it was?

123
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:15,467
No. My eyes are bad recently.

124
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:18,757
But I know the rough guy well.

125
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,137
-What? -Really, granny?

126
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:24,517
Oh, we get the perpetrator already?

127
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,387
That kid used to shop at my shop since he was a little child.

128
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:32,027
At this time of day, I'm sure that he's...

129
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:41,703
-Who are you guys? -Hi, there.

130
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:42,987
-Hello. -Hello.

131
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:47,927
What the heck? You're distracting me so go away!

132
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:51,587
Uh, what were in such a rush for?

133
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:54,597
I mean you knocked a person over to get onto the cab.

134
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:57,677
That man's unconscious now, you know.

135
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:01,467
-No joke? -What a terrible thing to do.

136
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:06,230
-Go apologize to him. -Hold it. I was just in a rush and...

137
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:07,937
We're asking you why?

138
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:10,997
Really?

139
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:12,697
He said he was in a rush because he was late for his part-time work

140
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:16,107
and was told that he'd be fired if he was late again.

141
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:19,237
Do you believe what a guy like that says?

142
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:21,987
That's what we're going to check on from now, right?

143
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:24,487
Besides, according to granny,

144
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:28,497
he seems to have looked ill even before he was knocked down.

145
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:30,247
At the very least...

146
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:33,627
-He's not the perpetrator. -Right.

147
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:39,647
Yeah, he was blabbering that he'd be late for work so to hurry it up.

148
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,637
Do you remember the person who was riding the cab before him?

149
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:44,807
The customer before him?

150
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:49,517
Yeah. He looked sick already at the time he got on the cab.

151
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:53,427
Where'd he go? What did he say, sir?

152
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:57,737
Nothing. Only, he did say, "Go after the car in front."

153
00:10:58,047 --> 00:10:59,607
The car in front?

154
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:03,417
But there was no such car in sight.

155
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,867
Then he says, "Never mind already, I'm getting off."

156
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:08,367
So, that's the place we saw him.

157
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:11,367
He got off the cab there but...

158
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,497
Where did you pick that man up to begin with?

159
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:16,417
Let's see.

160
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:17,907
Oh, here it is.

161
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,177
Haido-cho Sanchome.

162
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:22,627
Haido-cho Sanchome?

163
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:25,507
It's quite a distance from here.

164
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:28,377
What now? Shall we go there?

165
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:30,177
Yeah, of course.

166
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:32,347
Will you take us there?

167
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,477
Yeah, okay. Don't tell anyone, though.

168
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:41,507
A great spot that only a few people know about.

169
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,537
It's a place that we haven't told our company about.

170
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:46,807
I see. A great secret spot for taking a nap.

171
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,117
A secret place to slack off, I guess you could say.

172
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:52,157
Did that man get on from here?

173
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:54,957
Yeah. I was resting like usual you see.

174
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:04,637
Isn't Haido-cho Sanchome...

175
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:08,697
-Yeah. I was thinking the same thing. -What?

176
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:11,227
It's true this town is right next door

177
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:15,727
but the fact is, it's back to back with that place.

178
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:18,747
-That place? -That.

179
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:26,226
"Beika Emergency Medical Center."

180
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:32,177
"Beika Emergency Medical Center."

181
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:36,351
The answer to the mystery is at the hospital! Right?

182
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:37,691
All right, let's go!

183
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,291
This is a trace of sudden acceleration.

184
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:56,791
He said, "Go after the car in front."

185
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,711
Was he talking about this car, maybe?

186
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:03,861
If so, why is this car parked here again?

187
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:06,801
Whose car is it, anyway?

188
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,311
"Kido."

189
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:12,501
Kido.

190
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,441
This is...

191
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,571
There seems to be no doubt about it.

192
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,161
Yeah.

193
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:25,951
Look, there's something that looks like evidence here too.

194
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:29,042
There are fibers from different clothes stuck

195
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:30,831
on two spots of the bench.

196
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:35,061
All that's left to do now is to find out about the personal belongings.

197
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:43,261
What is this?

198
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,361
It really exists, eels over rice cookies!

199
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:50,311
Genta, we've got no time for that now.

200
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:54,401
Talk about stingy, I mean thrifty.

201
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:57,351
Using the back of a flyer like this.

202
00:13:58,741 --> 00:13:59,961
Maybe.

203
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,461
"Haido Construction Suspected of Bribery."

204
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,531
Last week's magazine article, right?

205
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:07,151
Yeah, the problem is what's written on the back.

206
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:11,001
Just as I thought!

207
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:15,661
Inspector, what do you want calling me out to a place like this?

208
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:18,131
No... That's...

209
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:19,751
Inspector!

210
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:23,021
Just what is the meaning of this, Mouri?

211
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:26,131
How'd the bribery case go?

212
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:28,421
What? You're the one who told me to come here

213
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,891
because you'd be disclosing the truth of the case.

214
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:44,031
It's come! The Sleeping Kogoro!

215
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,411
Sleeping Kogoro?

216
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:51,651
Excuse me. Please let me explain.

217
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:55,931
First of all, that's your car, isn't it, Dr. Kido?

218
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:59,881
Yes, that's right. Just what do you want with me?

219
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,431
I'll get right to the point

220
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:07,011
and tell you why that unidentified man ended up the way he is.

221
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:11,951
You're the one who put him in that state, Dr. Kido.

222
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,141
What?

223
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:17,141
-Conan! -Yes, sir!

224
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:24,591
Ayumi, when you were caught by that man, you noticed something, didn't you?

225
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:27,531
Yep. Back then...

226
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:31,271
I'm sorry, just because Daddy's such a coward.

227
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:33,331
I'm really sorry.

228
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:37,451
-What else? -Well...

229
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:39,161
I smelled something.

230
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,911
Smelled? What kind of smell?

231
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:44,551
-Eels over rice? -Genta!

232
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:47,671
The same smell that I smelled at the hospital.

233
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:52,331
In other words, that's the smell

234
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,431
that both the victim and the perpetrator shared in common.

235
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:57,061
Don't be ridiculous.

236
00:15:57,181 --> 00:16:00,801
Hospital smell, if it's the smell of antiseptics

237
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:05,441
it could be that the patient went to some other hospital.

238
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:09,031
Connecting me with something like that...

239
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,631
You're distorting things a bit too far, Detective.

240
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:14,701
That's true, Mouri.

241
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:17,621
It wasn't the smell of antiseptics, but of paint!

242
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:19,081
Paint?

243
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:25,021
Right. And that adhered to the perpetrator and victim as well

244
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,021
because right here.

245
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:32,201
The two fought and the wet paint from the newly painted bench rubbed off.

246
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:33,931
The perpetrator who desperately fled

247
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,081
knocked the victim away trying to pull free.

248
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:43,021
And his button came off.

249
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:48,601
He was knocked away and hit the back of his head.

250
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:55,141
He then went down the stairs to the vacant lot below to catch a cab.

251
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,331
Inspector Megure!

252
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,991
Where were you two?

253
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,838
Mr. Mouri instructed us

254
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:06,378
to check on the fingerprints on the window frame of this car

255
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:08,721
so we had forensics check on it.

256
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,341
The prints matched those of that patient!

257
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:14,781
Moreover, the button that Conan picked up here

258
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,971
also turned out to be for the clothes he was wearing.

259
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:23,981
I'm sorry but I asked them to go on my own discretion.

260
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:29,191
That's okay but why did you do something like this?

261
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,951
His motive is the magazine clipping.

262
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:37,431
What? Then this had something to do with the bribery case after all.

263
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:41,651
No, rather behind it. Correct, Doctor?

264
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,178
-Behind it? -This is it.

265
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:48,461
The advertisement of the book that Dr. Kido wrote.

266
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:50,381
Doctor!

267
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,181
It was a month ago.

268
00:17:57,581 --> 00:17:59,861
We have person who suddenly fell ill.

269
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:03,291
Is there a doctor here? I repeat.

270
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,172
Excuse me, are you a doctor?

271
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,422
What?

272
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:10,211
Oh, because you seem to be reading a medical book.

273
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:14,841
Please! My child, my daughter, has a fever.

274
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,571
Will you please examine her?

275
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:23,161
I'm sorry. I'm not a doctor.

276
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,201
But...

277
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:28,601
Since I'm a married man,

278
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:31,441
I didn't want to risk danger of having my relationship

279
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:34,041
with the woman that I was with exposed.

280
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,251
That was supposed to have ended there.

281
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:40,472
Unless that man didn't appear before me this morning

282
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:43,431
after my night shift.

283
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:46,711
You were a doctor after all!

284
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,691
You lied!

285
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,441
He got suspicious of me back then

286
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:56,671
and said he traced me from the book that I was reading.

287
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,131
You're not going to tell me you forgot!

288
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:03,451
After that, my daughter was carried into the hospital at the next station!

289
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:06,201
But, she didn't make it.

290
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:09,331
Apologize to my daughter.

291
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:14,020
According to his story,

292
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,648
her cause of death seems to have been

293
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:17,748
the worsening of a chronic disease that she had.

294
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:21,273
It wasn't a problem of her life having been saved

295
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,187
if I examined her right away or not.

296
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:28,231
He told me that he couldn't forgive me

297
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,601
the fact that I lied to him.

298
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:34,111
I agree.

299
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:37,331
Therefore, I thought that it was neither a coincidence nor an irony,

300
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,251
but rather divine punishment,

301
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:44,144
that he was brought to this hospital and ended up being my patient.

302
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:50,191
Although I feel that you can't believe me, I wanted to save him.

303
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:55,131
As a doctor if I had done the same back then for his daughter, maybe...

304
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,721
I...

305
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,431
I regret it.

306
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,571
What is this? Something's still not right.

307
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:10,271
What about the jacket that was soiled with paint?

308
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:13,401
Over there. In the trunk of the car.

309
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:17,401
It's not in here.

310
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:21,451
No way. I'm sure that...

311
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:24,351
I see. That's the story!

312
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:29,001
What's the matter, Conan?

313
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,071
That's murder, you know!

314
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:46,141
Weren't you riding together?

315
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,391
"Natsumi Morita (25), Nurse" -On Dr. Kido's car?

316
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:56,651
When you told him that you'd get rid of the jacket with the paint on it,

317
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,561
I'll bet the Doctor told you not to.

318
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,191
Yes.

319
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,331
I thought that maybe he was going to turn himself in

320
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:08,111
to the police if this man was saved.

321
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,831
If he does that,

322
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:14,711
the fact that I was having an affair with him would come to light.

323
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,461
That's why. That's why...

324
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:28,531
The man's awake!

325
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:33,921
I'm glad.

"Beika Emergency Medical Center"

327
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:03,321
I'm sorry to have gotten you mixed up in something like this.

328
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:06,441
No problem. I'm glad you're okay.

329
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:10,101
By the way, what's your name, sir?

330
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:14,041
I forgot to introduce myself.

331
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,951
Forgot?

332
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:21,211
Come to think of it. I had a feeling I had forgotten something.

333
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:26,341
It's cold.

334
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:30,591
Why am I here? I guess I'll get going home.

335
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:34,025
What?

336
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:36,021
"Fresh Paint"

337
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:39,701
I can't move! Somebody help me.

338
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:46,411
"Next Episode" -Eri...

339
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:48,941
Get out of here! You goofy detective!

340
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,951
You're really something.

341
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:56,161
You can be sure that it's a stranger just by the name.

342
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,331
I wonder if the teabags that I bought

343
00:23:58,351 --> 00:23:59,881
when coming to visit today are okay?

344
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,961
As to that. There are so many here already.

345
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:11,461

Next Conan's Hint:

347
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:32,410
"Herb tea."

348
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:34,471
What's the point of the next case?

349
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:37,361
-Madam, I'm Adam... -Palindromes?
