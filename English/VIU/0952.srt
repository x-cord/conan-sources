1
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,739
You let your guard down, Shuichi Akai.

2
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:38,139
I could say the same thing to you.

3
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:44,939
Bourbon.

4
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:49,538
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

5
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,538
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

6
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,138
An unbelievable pair run into each other.

7
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:55,438
A surprising case lies at the end of the muzzle.

8
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,838
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,638
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,839
His name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,038
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 1)"

12
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:51,394
"Nine hours earlier."

13
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,849
Huh?

14
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,349
"Mouri Detective Agency" -You were just on your way out?

15
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,350
Yeah.

16
00:02:57,351 --> 00:03:01,449
Oh, but I brought sandwiches.

17
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,449
Thank you as usual.

18
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,749
I'll have them as a late night snack.

19
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,449
You can leave them here.

20
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,849
Got it.

21
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,749
I'm sure they're just leftovers from Cafe Poirot.

22
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,249
Dad!

23
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,450
Is it that obvious?

24
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,549
So, are you going out for a case?

25
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,249
Why do you think that?

26
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,250
Huh?

27
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:27,049
We could be going out to eat together.

28
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,149
Mr. Mouri just said he'd eat the sandwiches

29
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,749
as a late night snack.

30
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,749
I thought it'd be strange if you were going out to eat.

31
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,049
Well, Mr. Mouri?

32
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,449
Well, you're half right.

33
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,649
Some rich guy is freaking out

34
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,549
because he received a threatening letter.

35
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,349
I'm on my way to take these two

36
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,149
to talk over dinner with said rich guy.

37
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,549
I see.

38
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,749
I still have a lot to learn.

39
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,349
Oh, right.

40
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,549
Speaking of cases, I heard a series of murders

41
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,549
happened during your school trip, Ran.

42
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,249
Oh, yeah.

43
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,949
But, well...

44
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,549
It seems your classmate, Shinichi Kudo,

45
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,349
helped solved the case.

46
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,549
I guess...

47
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,549
So, where did he go afterward?

48
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,949
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,749
Our teachers told us

50
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,149
-not to talk about Shinichi. -I knew he'd ask

51
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,849
-I see. -about me.

52
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,649
But I heard from Sonoko that you often go to his house to clean.

53
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,949
Yes, sometimes.

54
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,849
Hey...

55
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,449
You should come with us to talk about the case.

56
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,149
Aren't you Pops' apprentice?

57
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,249
What? Me too?

58
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,349
Sure, you can come.

59
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,249
These sandwiches will cover the cost of your detective lesson.

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,850
Well, my shift for today is over.

61
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,150
And if you insist...

62
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,850
Huh?

63
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:08,550
Oh, no.

64
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,849
It seems I forgot my phone.

65
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,749
What? Where?

66
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,849
I think I left it by the sandwiches I brought earlier.

67
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,849
Amuro, did you have your phone out?

68
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,649
I received a call from an acquaintance

69
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,949
while I was delivering the sandwiches.

70
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,249
Then I'll go get it.

71
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,849
Thank you, Ran.

72
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,949
Geez. You're surprisingly scatterbrained.

73
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,150
I'm not a very good detective.

74
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,149
I found it, Amuro.

75
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,349
Thanks.

76
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,049
Thank you for getting this.

77
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,650
"Cafe Poirot" -Let's go, then.

78
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,649
So, where are we going?

79
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,349
It's called the Black Bunny Restaurant.

80
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,749
It's probably a trendy little restaurant.

81
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,849
Maybe it's a well-established Western restaurant.

82
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,949
Aren't you excited, Conan?

83
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,150
Yeah.

84
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,849
Hey, wait...

85
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,350
This isn't a normal restaurant.

86
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,350
"Black Bunnys Club."

87
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,750
It's a bunny girl club!

88
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,349
True to its name.

89
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,349
There are black bunnies everywhere.

90
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,449
Unbelievable.

91
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,449
I wouldn't have brought Conan

92
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,149
if I'd known it was this kind of place.

93
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,649
I'm fine.

94
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,749
Look. They've got rolled omelets and curry

95
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,150
and everything looks good.

96
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,349
Thank you for waiting.

97
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,549
You must be the great detective Kogoro Mouri.

98
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,749
"Gunzo Morooka (50)" -Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,649
I'm the man who contacted you, Gunzo Morooka.

100
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,749
Hello.

101
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,049
So, about this threatening letter...

102
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,349
I brought it, of course.

103
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,849
Fukamachi, the letter.

104
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,849
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,249
"Atsufumi Fukamachi (72), Morooka's Butler."

106
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,649
This is the threatening letter my master received the other day.

107
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,950
Let me take a look.

108
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,349
A threatening letter made from clippings in this day and age?

109
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,949
"If you want to live,"

110
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,749
"stay away from the Black Bunny Restaurant."

111
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,949
Wait! Isn't this the Black Bunny Restaurant?

112
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,149
Yes, so I invited a detective

113
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,349
to find the scoundrel trying to kill me

114
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,649
who is surely at this restaurant.

115
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,749
That's insane.

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,849
But there's no guarantee you'll be attacked inside the restaurant.

117
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,049
Yeah. I have a few bodyguards with me at all times.

118
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,449
If I'm going to be attacked,

119
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,549
it'll be inside this restaurant.

120
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,049
Why aren't your bodyguards with you right now?

121
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,049
Well, obviously...

122
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,649
If I brought a bunch of stern-looking men in here,

123
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,149
I'd ruin the atmosphere of the restaurant.

124
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,749
Absolutely.

125
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,349
Oh, Mr. Morooka!

126
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,149
Welcome!

127
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,749
"Yuri Asakura (25), Employee" -Thanks for coming back.

128
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,149
Ah, Yuri. I'm here for a special reason today.

129
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,249
Oh? You brought a girl with you?

130
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,049
And a little boy.

131
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,349
So cute.

132
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,350
Actually, these kids are...

133
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,049
Oh, sorry...

134
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,349
I couldn't help myself.

135
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,549
Mr. Mouri, this isn't that kind of place.

136
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,949
Excuse me.

137
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,849
Who gropes a bunny girl in front of his own daughter?

138
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,349
You'll be accused of sexual harassment.

139
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,849
I won't do it again.

140
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,549
Geez.

141
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,449
Come on, order something.

142
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,849
Yuri, order whatever you'd like.

143
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,949
Could I get some food, then?

144
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,949
I missed lunch, so I'm starving.

145
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,349
Of course.

146
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,849
Let's see...

147
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,849
In that case, I'd like a fruit plate, rolled omelets,

148
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,549
and sandwiches.

149
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,650
You've got quite the appetite.

150
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,949
You can touch them, but I can't?

151
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,549
All right. Dinner's on me tonight.

152
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,350
Girls, you're all welcome to order whatever you'd like.

153
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,249
Fukamachi, you too.

154
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,449
Let's not stand on ceremony.

155
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,549
Have a seat and drink with us.

156
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,849
Yes, sir.

157
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,249
I'm not sure where to look in this type of establishment.

158
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,549
He's wiping his glasses so he can stare right at them.

159
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,749
Thank you for waiting.

160
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,849
These rolled omelets look delicious.

161
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,249
Let's eat.

162
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,249
Let's see...

163
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,049
Fukamachi, could you pass the sauce?

164
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,049
Huh? What?

165
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,150
Fine, I'll get it.

166
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,149
Glasses?

167
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,749
Are these yours?

168
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,149
Yes, sir.

169
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,249
I thought I left them on the table.

170
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,249
In any case, I have a spare pair in the car.

171
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,549
I'll go get them.

172
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,949
Hold it.

173
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,149
It's too dangerous to get them without your glasses.

174
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,949
I'll get them for you.

175
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,449
Thank you.

176
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,449
They're in the glove box.

177
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,849
Got it.

178
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,449
I'll go with you.

179
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,450
Excuse me, coming through.

180
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,849
Yuri, thanks for the drink.

181
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,249
I didn't pay for it.

182
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,449
But everyone's drinks count as your sales

183
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,449
since Mr. Morooka ordered them.

184
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,549
Maybe you'll be first today.

185
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,949
Yeah, right.

186
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,350
"Sana Murakami (28), Employee."

187
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,050
No way.

188
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:21,550
An earthquake?

189
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,849
I'm sorry...

190
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,749
It suddenly starting ringing

191
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,349
while I was checking my messages.

192
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,650
Let me see that.

193
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,949
Please be careful.

194
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,649
That type of phone sounds an alarm

195
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,549
if you press the power and increase volume buttons simultaneously.

196
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,949
I see.

197
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,549
What a surprise.

198
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,049
I'm glad it wasn't an earthquake.

199
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,949
I'm really sorry.

200
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,249
It's fine.

201
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,749
All the bunny girls keep their phones in the backs of their outfits.

202
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,750
Yeah.

203
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,649
Customers call us all the time

204
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,549
to ask if the restaurant's crowded.

205
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,249
And sometimes we call them

206
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,150
to invite them to the restaurant.

207
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,149
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,649
There are spare cuffs in the changing room.

209
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,149
Why don't you go change yours?

210
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,750
Okay.

211
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,449
Hello, Mr. Adachi?

212
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,349
Hello again.

213
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,249
I'm sorry, but we're full right now.

214
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,250
A table should open up in about an hour.

215
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,350
Found them.

216
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,149
I found the spare glasses.

217
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,049
Thank you for coming with me, Mr. Mouri.

218
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,849
Your butler sure is clumsy.

219
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,649
He can be old-fashioned and stiff

220
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,949
but he's a very hard-working butler.

221
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,049
He's been employed by my recently deceased wife's family

222
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,849
for a long time.

223
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,549
I see.

224
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,849
Anyway, that employee...

225
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,749
Ms. Yuri, was it?

226
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,549
The two of you seem quite close.

227
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,449
Really?

228
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,249
Well, I do always ask for her.

229
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,649
Do you come here often?

230
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,650
No...

231
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:37,249
Actually, there's a clothing store next to this one.

232
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,949
I'll stop by to see the girls

233
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,149
while getting a new suit made there.

234
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,649
That's about it.

235
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,249
I see.

236
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,949
Here, Fukamachi.

237
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,549
Thank you, sir.

238
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,749
Huh? Where's Yuri?

239
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,249
She hurried off to the changing room a moment ago.

240
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,749
Oh.

241
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,150
But almost all the food she ordered is here.

242
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,149
And my deduction was exactly correct.

243
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,849
Amazing!

244
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,949
Are you drinking, Fukamachi?

245
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,950
Yes, some.

246
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,649
It's my fruit plate.

247
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,149
That looks good.

248
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,150
Come on.

249
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:25,949
Everyone's been waiting for you since you ordered.

250
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,249
Really?

251
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,949
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,849
Now eat.

253
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,950
Okay. Thanks for the food.

254
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,449
It's so good!

255
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,249
Is it? Let me try.

256
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,049
Let's see. My glass is...

257
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,049
This one.

258
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,649
Well? Seen anyone suspicious?

259
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,249
Not in particular.

260
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,849
What about you, Amuro?

261
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,950
I don't detect any murderous intentions.

262
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,650
-What? -What?

263
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,091
Yuri...

264
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,591
Yuri!

265
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:32,491
Are you okay, Yuri?

266
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:33,791
Hey!

267
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:34,991
Yuri!

268
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,192
Don't touch her!

269
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,690
Ran, call an ambulance and the police!

270
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,791
Okay.

271
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,890
But why?

272
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,190
Perhaps she got food poisoning

273
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:51,490
from the fruit she ate.

274
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,290
Food poisoning?

275
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,590
No way.

276
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,290
That's not it.

277
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,790
Mr. Morooka had some of that fruit too.

278
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,990
It's hard to believe only Ms. Yuri got food poisoning.

279
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:08,690
Ms. Yuri said she was starving since she missed lunch.

280
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,490
And food poisoning symptoms manifest

281
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:14,691
30 minutes after eating at the earliest.

282
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:20,290
I saw it in an experiment on a TV show.

283
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,590
Sounds like a crazy TV show.

284
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:27,990
Which means she happened to eat some fruit

285
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:31,990
that had been poisoned by someone

286
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:36,390
or someone poisoned this glass

287
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:39,790
she was just drinking from.

288
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,290
Is that right, detective?

289
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,290
Why are you asking me?

290
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,491
Why don't you ask Pops?

291
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,190
Yes, it's called the Black Bunny Restaurant.

292
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,790
Please come immediately.

293
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,791
Thank you.

294
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:58,590
Huh?

295
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:00,390
My wallet's missing.

296
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:02,791
What does it look like?

297
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,890
It has ginkgo leaves on it.

298
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,590
There's not much cash in it,

299
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:10,990
but my house key...

300
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:14,190
Is this it?

301
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:16,691
Yes, that's it.

302
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,990
Oh, good.

303
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,090
Thank you.

304
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,290
Where did you find it?

305
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,690
He said it was by the washroom.

306
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:32,390
That dark and handsome man over there.

307
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:34,690
What? Amuro?

308
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:36,590
Too bad, though.

309
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:37,990
If that were Yuri's,

310
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,290
I would've investigated its contents

311
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,590
to figure out where she's been secretly meeting Mr. Morooka.

312
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:47,190
What? Mr. Morooka and Ms. Yuri?

313
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,290
I know those two are together.

314
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,090
Mr. Morooka normally calls her Yuri,

315
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:56,790
but he called her informally just now.

316
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,890
I don't know what your relationship is with Mr. Morooka,

317
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:02,490
but you should be careful.

318
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,291
Okay.

319
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:15,490
Arsenic?

320
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:19,590
You found arsenic in Ms. Yuri's drink?

321
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:20,790
Yeah.

322
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,390
No way...

323
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:26,990
So, how's Ms. Yuri?

324
00:18:26,991 --> 00:18:30,390
They've finished treating her at the hospital,

325
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:33,091
but she hasn't regained consciousness yet.

326
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,090
So do you have any idea

327
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:41,490
who might've tried to kill the victim?

328
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:44,090
No idea...

329
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,390
It was me.

330
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:50,190
Someone was trying to poison me

331
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:53,390
but Yuri drank it instead.

332
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:55,490
-What? -What do you mean?

333
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:58,890
I'm the one who was being threatened.

334
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:01,190
-Threatened? -What? Threatened?

335
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:02,490
"If you want to live, stay away from the Black Bunny Restaurant"

336
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,790
I see.

337
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,090
So you received this letter.

338
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:11,990
Yeah, but Yuri was poisoned instead of me.

339
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:19,090
But your glasses were totally different shapes.

340
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,190
What?

341
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,490
Ms. Yuri's glass was a skinny champagne glass,

342
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:26,390
and yours was a standard highball glass.

343
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:28,990
I don't think they'd mix them up.

344
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:33,091
Then Ms. Yuri really was the culprit's intended victim.

345
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,090
We can't say that for certain yet.

346
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:40,590
Ms. Yuri collapsed after returning to the table

347
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:44,290
and drinking from her glass.

348
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,990
She covered her glass with a coaster

349
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:51,190
before leaving the table.

350
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,390
It could only have been poisoned by Mr. Morooka,

351
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,690
who passed by Ms. Yuri as she held her glass

352
00:19:55,691 --> 00:20:00,090
before she left the table.

353
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:02,890
I'll get them for you.

354
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:04,290
Thank you.

355
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:08,490
They're in the glove box.

356
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:09,990
Got it.

357
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,190
I'll go with you.

358
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,291
Excuse me, coming through.

359
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:20,690
Or Mr. Fukamachi, who was sitting next to her

360
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:23,690
when she placed her glass on the table

361
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:27,091
when she was startled by the phone alarm.

362
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,191
No way.

363
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,691
An earthquake?

364
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,990
I'm sorry...

365
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,990
It suddenly starting ringing

366
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,590
while I was checking my messages.

367
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:44,890
Let me see that.

368
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:49,490
Or Ms. Murakami,

369
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:52,790
who spilled red wine on her white cuffs

370
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,490
and created a reason for her to leave the table.

371
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:58,190
And sometimes we call them

372
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,991
to invite them to the restaurant.

373
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:04,090
Oh, I'm sorry.

374
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,590
There are spare cuffs in the changing room.

375
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:08,090
Why don't you go change yours?

376
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:09,391
Okay.

377
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:13,190
As far as I can recall,

378
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:19,390
only those three could've poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass.

379
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,590
Right, Mr. Mouri?

380
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:24,490
Yeah, you're right.

381
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,290
He's been watching closely.

382
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,090
The three he just named...

383
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,790
Mr. Morooka,

384
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,490
Mr. Fukamachi,

385
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:39,390
and restaurant employee, Ms. Murakami.

386
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:44,091
We'll be asking you in greater detail about what happened.

387
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:47,790
Like Amuro said,

388
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,990
one of those three must be the culprit.

389
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:59,191
But who poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass and how?

390
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:45,490
"Next Episode."

391
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,690
He said he needed to talk to Yuri

392
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,490
and they headed out back together.

393
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:52,690
How far apart in age do you think we are?

394
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:55,790
I really was at a different table!

395
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,190
An injury?

396
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,890
Amuro, what's wrong?

397
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:00,790
You've been acting strange.

398
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,190
Oh, sorry.

399
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,190
It's bye-bye time,

400
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:06,391
Rei...

401
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:13,191
