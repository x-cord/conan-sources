1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,436
A strange letter was delivered to Heiji Hattori.

2
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:09,236
It was from the culprit who had killed

3
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:12,636
the design company president Mr. Kansuke Wakamatsu,

4
00:00:12,636 --> 00:00:15,136
a month ago at his villa in Karuizawa.

5
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:18,336
Kazuha goes to Wakamatsu's main house in Osaka

6
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:21,736
as indicated in place of Heiji who had caught a cold,

7
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:25,236
and encounters an eerie figure with long hair there.

8
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:30,836
That figure had vanished during a moment's black-out,

9
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:34,036
but what's weirder is that the characters "EYE"

10
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:37,736
that was carved on the wall had also vanished.

11
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,136
The fact is, even at the incident in Karuizawa,

12
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,836
the victim had written a dying message

13
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:43,436
with his own blood on the tile floor,

14
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:45,236
but that had also vanished.

15
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:46,936
We visited the Wakamatsu residence in Tokyo

16
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:51,036
to check out the truth of the matter, when in front of us,

17
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:53,836
his son Ikuro was poisoned to death!

18
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:57,936
Kazuha, get on the phone!

19
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:00,636
-And call the police? -Yeah!

20
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:03,736
Tell them that the idiot who had the nerve to kill a person

21
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:05,636
right in front of a detective is here!

22
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:26,336
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,036
all hidden mysteries are women.

24
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:29,936
What does the alphabet "S",

25
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,636
the dying message that the president leave behind mean?

26
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:33,236
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:35,136
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,536
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:08,948
"Design of Poison and Illusion (S)"

30
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,506
The one about the case last month where the president was killed

31
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:13,906
and found in the bath room of his villa in Karuizawa.

32
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:17,606
You were the first one to find him, weren't you?

33
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:18,706
Yes.

34
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:21,606
Back then, there should've been a dying message

35
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:24,206
that the president wrote with his own blood.

36
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:27,506
But when the police got there, it was gone, right?

37
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:30,106
If I remember correctly,

38
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,506
you said that you remember that word that disappeared.

39
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,806
I remember you said something about it being an alphabet.

40
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:37,906
Don't tell me that the alphabets were...

41
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:42,406
E-Y-E?

42
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:44,706
It's probably referring to "eyes"!

43
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,206
I saw it, too!

44
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,606
I was contacted by the culprit who said he killed the president,

45
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:51,206
who told me to come to the president's residence in Osaka.

46
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:54,006
That's when I saw the eerie three letters that disappeared!

47
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,806
My... At that house in Osaka?

48
00:03:56,806 --> 00:04:00,506
That's why we came all the way out here to hear more about it.

49
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,906
But, what I saw was...

50
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:06,206
the alphabet "S"!

51
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,106
There seemed to be continuation of something else

52
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:10,406
but it covered by his hand and I couldn't see it.

53
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:12,506
"S", was it?

54
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,206
Hey! Hold it!

55
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,806
The managing director Mr. Masashige Shiina

56
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:19,706
as well as Chief designer Mr. Masuo Fujinami,

57
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:22,006
the secretary Ms. Yoshiimi Satake,

58
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:25,006
and the president's wife Mrs. Serika Wakanatsu,

59
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:28,406
all have either names or last names

60
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:31,706
starting with the letter "S"!

61
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:37,106
My name is Sakurako, so it also starts with "S".

62
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,306
What?

63
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,606
Which means

64
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:41,806
the person who doesn't the initial "S" in his name

65
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:45,106
is Ikuro who was killed this time?

66
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:49,106
And? What did you do after you found the corpse?

67
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:53,306
I went to the living room of the villa to get Mrs. Wakamatsu.

68
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:54,706
Yes.

69
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:57,606
I confirmed the corpse of my husband together with her.

70
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:01,806
Call the ambulance immediately!

71
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:02,906
Yes, ma'am!

72
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:04,906
Use the telephone in the study!

73
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:05,906
Because there are times

74
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,906
when the connection is not good on the cell phone in this area.

75
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:12,706
And I go tell Ikuro about this

76
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:15,806
because I think he's still asleep in his room.

77
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:18,606
Please make sure that no one sees you

78
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:22,106
because I don't want anyone to see my husband like this.

79
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:24,106
Yes, ma'am!

80
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,806
And when the police arrived,

81
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:28,806
the dying message was gone?

82
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,206
Yes.

83
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:33,306
After making the call, I returned immediately to the bath room,

84
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:37,506
to find Ikuro clinging to his father and crying.

85
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:40,706
But it seems that the letters were already gone then.

86
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:44,406
-Mrs. Wakamatsu, didn't you see the letters? -No.

87
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:47,206
Because I was distracted right through looking at my husband's body.

88
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:49,106
Then, is it true that the same tiles

89
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,106
were used in the bath room of the villa

90
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:53,806
and the bath room of the house in Osaka?

91
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,106
Yes.

92
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:58,606
They were both made with tiles that my husband had special ordered.

93
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,306
But the rebuilding construction of

94
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:03,606
the main house in Osaka has already begun,

95
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:05,306
and as for the villa in Karuizawa,

96
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:08,406
as soon as the no trespassing cordon is taken away,

97
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:10,406
it is scheduled to be demolished.

98
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:13,406
We may not be able to see it ever again.

99
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:19,406
Then, where were you all when the president was killed?

100
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:21,806
We were in the living room together with the vice-president.

101
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,406
Actually there were a lot more people

102
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:26,706
who came to the vice-president's birthday party.

103
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:30,406
I was about to go home after the party with all the others

104
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:33,006
when the president called me.

105
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,706
He said he had something important to talk about.

106
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:38,706
Since the president told us to wait

107
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,806
until he finished sticking all the tiles of the bath room on.

108
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:44,506
All four of us were waiting in the living room

109
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:47,006
while playing poker for about two hours.

110
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:51,406
In other words, we've got a perfect alibi!

111
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:54,306
Because of the letter "S" that the housekeeper found,

112
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:57,006
we were the first to be suspected.

113
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:00,006
So we were persistently questioned by the police.

114
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:03,406
But because the president's wallet was gone,

115
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,906
and the murder weapon not being found.

116
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:08,806
Because there were traces of someone having broken in,

117
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:10,406
it was concluded that

118
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:13,306
what the housekeeper saw was probably a mistake.

119
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:15,006
It seems that the Nagano Prefectural Police

120
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:17,906
is now investigating case as a break-in by an intruder.

121
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,906
Mr. Mouri, may I have a word with you?

122
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:23,206
Huh?

123
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:30,006
What? No poison was detected?

124
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:32,406
There was none from the other pieces of baumkuchen?

125
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,206
No.

126
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:35,406
Toxic reaction was detected

127
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:39,406
only from the capsule that was found at the bottom of the teacup.

128
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:44,106
But the toxic reaction found in the teacup was also very slight,

129
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:46,206
so it could've been put there just to hide the evidence

130
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:49,706
after having finished using the poison,

131
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:52,506
or like you said, there is a high probability of foul play

132
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,006
being used to throw the investigation off.

133
00:07:55,006 --> 00:08:00,106
Which means that only the piece of baumkuchen

134
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,906
that Ikuro ate was poisoned.

135
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:03,706
How strange.

136
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:06,306
Back then, Ikuro ate one of the two pieces

137
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:08,906
that were left on the tray.

138
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,406
How did the culprit make Ikuro pick up

139
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,606
the poisoned piece of baumkuchen?

140
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:16,206
Maybe the piece was a little larger after all?

141
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,706
Right, right!

142
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,306
It seems that he was pretty greedy when it came to food.

143
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:23,106
Actually we thought so, too.

144
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,206
So we went to the same store,

145
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:27,306
bought baumkuchen of the same size

146
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,606
and placed it on the tray back at the scene of the crime

147
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:30,206
together with the 7 pieces that were left behind.

148
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,506
It was perfectly divided into 8 even pieces.

149
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:33,906
What?

150
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:37,506
Then what? You mean the culprit sprinkled poison

151
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:39,706
on the baumkuchen after Ikuro picked up the piece,

152
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:42,506
yet no one realized what happened?

153
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,106
Of course not.

154
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,206
I mean, we're not dealing with an invisible man, you know.

155
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:50,006
It sure resembles the letter that was sent to you, no?

156
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:52,206
Yeah.

157
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:54,406
I'm a warped entity

158
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:57,106
that was created at the liberty of you humans.

159
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,806
You can't see him with the naked eye.

160
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,906
You mean he's an illusion?

161
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:06,706
Really?

162
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:09,106
Is it true that only the piece of baumkuchen

163
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,106
that Ikuro ate was poisoned?

164
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:12,406
Yes.

165
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:14,206
Moreover, when we put the 7 pieces of baumkuchen

166
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:16,406
that were left back at the scene of the crime,

167
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:19,606
on top of a baumkuchen before it was cut,

168
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,806
including the piece that Ikuro ate,

169
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:25,006
we found the pieces to be evenly divided into 8 pieces.

170
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:27,206
Well, it would be a different story

171
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,506
if the sizes of the pieces were the same,

172
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,606
but the poisoned piece was placed in the foreground

173
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:32,206
making it easy to take, though.

174
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,906
It wasn't the one in the foreground!

175
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,006
Ikuro stretched over to pick up a piece that was farther back!

176
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:40,106
-Right? Ms. Satake? -Yes.

177
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:42,306
It looked like that to me.

178
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:46,006
But you two are the ones who cut the bamkuchen

179
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,506
and put the pieces on the plates.

180
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:48,906
Having you two who were in a position where you could

181
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,906
most easily poison the baumkuchen saying that isn't very convincing.

182
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,506
-I saw it, too! -What?

183
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,906
Ikuro reaching over for the baumkuchen beyond.

184
00:09:56,906 --> 00:10:00,206
Right! I saw him, too!

185
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:02,506
I was curious why he reached all the way

186
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:04,106
over for the piece beyond, you see!

187
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,706
So back then, Ikuro must've received a lot of attention from everyone?

188
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:11,906
He was saying something attention getting like

189
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:14,006
"I'm going to be the next president", too.

190
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:16,906
That's why I decided to follow him with my eyes.

191
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:21,906
Maybe the culprit bet on a 50/50 chance.

192
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,106
Hey, hey.

193
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:27,606
Then if Ikuro didn't pick the poisoned piece...

194
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:30,406
If so, the culprit may have been thinking

195
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:33,506
to drop the poisoned piece on the floor

196
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:37,906
by making it look like it slipped, rendering it inedible.

197
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:40,306
Moreover, on top of being greedy with food,

198
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,506
it was obvious that Ikuro was starving

199
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:44,606
so he would be the first to pick up a piece, too!

200
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:46,106
I see.

201
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:48,406
Or, maybe the culprit meant for Ikuro

202
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:51,506
to eat the piece in the foreground that wasn't poisoned,

203
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:54,506
and was planning to poison to death managing director Shiina

204
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:58,006
who was supposed to be eating the piece that remained!

205
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:05,806
So if the culprit who killed the president in Karuizawa last month

206
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:08,106
and this time killed his son,

207
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:13,406
or rather, maybe managing director is the same person.

208
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:17,706
The cause may be in this house, or in the company.

209
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:20,206
Doesn't anything ring a bell?

210
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:22,906
No, there's nothing like that.

211
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,306
Now that you mentioned it...

212
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:30,106
I saw Mr. Wakamatsu arguing with Ikuro!

213
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,806
"You're the one who's using company money, aren't you?"

214
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:34,706
"Come on, spit it out!" He said.

215
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:39,806
Ikuro shouted back, "Can't you trust your own son?"

216
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:41,906
Was that a usual occurrence?

217
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:44,006
I think it was about a week

218
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:46,106
before the president died in Karuizawa.

219
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:49,006
Then, the thing he was planning to talk about at the villa that day

220
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:51,706
making us sleep over there was...

221
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:55,706
About the embezzlement of company money?

222
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:59,206
If that's the case, it's solved already.

223
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:02,706
I found that it was the entry mistake I made in the account book.

224
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:06,306
I was scolded severely by my husband later, though.

225
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:10,206
Well, regardless of what the motive of the murder was,

226
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,506
or who the target was,

227
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:16,006
we'll have to have you replay the situation

228
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:19,806
when Ikuro ate the baumkuchen and fell to the floor!

229
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,206
While it's still fresh in your mind.

230
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:25,106
We'll call you as soon as everything is ready.

231
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,906
So, please wait in this room for a while more.

232
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:33,206
Shoots. How do they expect us to replay the scene?

233
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:36,206
Well, it's useless just waiting, so...

234
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:39,206
Ms. Satake, will show me the design of the letters

235
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,206
you said you sent to this computer?

236
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,906
Yes, ma'am!

237
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:45,806
And, Ms. Yonehara.

238
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,806
Yes.

239
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:48,806
Will you make more tea for us again?

240
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:50,806
Yes, ma'am!

241
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:53,306
Hey.

242
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,706
If Karuizawa is under the jurisdiction

243
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:57,706
of the Nagano Prefectural Police,

244
00:12:57,706 --> 00:13:00,006
isn't the officer with the wounded eye that we met

245
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:02,606
during the Fuurinkazan incident there?

246
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:05,506
Oh, you mean Inspector Kansuke Yamato.

247
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,806
Why don't we call him then?

248
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:10,506
He may tell us something about the incident.

249
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:13,506
But I don't know his phone number.

250
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,306
If it's Yui's phone number,

251
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:19,206
the officer that got along well with him, I have it!

252
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,706
Then, maybe we can ask him something about the incident!

253
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:24,006
Yui had gone back to being an officer, besides!

254
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:26,506
-Really? -Yep.

255
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,106
But, how come you know her phone number?

256
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:32,406
I begged her to give it to me later!

257
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,406
On the day that the case was solved,

258
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:37,906
it seems that Yui was confessing how she felt to Inspector Yamato,

259
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:41,206
so I was concerned how it turned out, you see.

260
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:43,706
I mean, it's hard to think that nothing would happen

261
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:47,006
after she gave her heart out to him, right?

262
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:50,506
And? Did something happen between the two?

263
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:53,306
It seems that she ended up not confessing her feelings after all.

264
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,606
They haven't been phoning or mailing each other since then, I hear.

265
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:57,306
It could be that the two are doing their thing

266
00:13:57,306 --> 00:14:00,706
without telling you about it then.

267
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,806
You idiot!

268
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,806
She told me that she would contact me

269
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:05,006
if she confessed her feelings to him.

270
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:08,306
She's not such a cold person besides!

271
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,006
Kazuha.

272
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:13,206
I have something I have to tell you.

273
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:15,006
Huh? What?

274
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:17,406
Not here, though.

275
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:21,106
Hey, hey. Let's call Yui quickly!

276
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:23,106
Maybe she'll tell us

277
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:26,906
what the tiles in the bath room

278
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:29,306
of where the president was killed were like.

279
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,506
It seems that the tile

280
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,806
is only left at the villa in Karuizawa already.

281
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:42,661
What? A family member of the president

282
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:44,861
who was killed at his villa in Karuizawa

283
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:47,561
was killed tonight in Tokyo?

284
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:50,461
-Is that true, Kazuha? -Yep!

285
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:52,561
I just happened to be at the site of the crime

286
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:54,661
and is really in a fix.

287
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,561
Heiji says that maybe the murderer of the incident over there

288
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,761
are one and the same with the one here.

289
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,961
That's why we want you to show us

290
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:05,561
the tile of the bath room where the president was killed!

291
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,761
That's the voice of

292
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:10,461
the dark-skinned detective boy I met back then, right?

293
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:12,761
Are Conan and Kogoro there, too?

294
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:14,561
Yes, they are!

295
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:15,861
We're telling you that we want some clue

296
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,561
if this is a case of serial killings!

297
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:21,661
He could still be after somebody, besides.

298
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:24,261
We just happen to be at that villa right now,

299
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:27,561
and it's the first time I'm seeing the site of the crime too.

300
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,961
You understand that I'm not usually supposed

301
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,361
to be giving out information like that to outsiders, right?

302
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:33,961
Hey, Uehara.

303
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:36,061
If that's a personal call, do it later!

304
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,661
We're going on!

305
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:38,961
Yes, sir!

306
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:43,061
But the detective boys and you have been a lot of help to me,

307
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:44,561
and the circumstance being what it is,

308
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,661
I'll try asking Kan-chan...

309
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,561
Rather, Inspector Yamato about it.

310
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,261
"Alcohol for the Young"

311
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,961
Maybe this is good?

312
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,761
It meets the demand of the client too.

313
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:02,461
But, don't you think it's a bit subdued?

314
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,461
I like the one three before this.

315
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:08,061
You mean this?

316
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:10,061
This is too flashy, don't you think?

317
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:12,561
What about the one two before it, then?

318
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:14,861
Vice-president, are you all right?

319
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:16,061
If your eyes are tired,

320
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:17,861
would you like to use my eye drops?

321
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:20,961
I just bought it, so it's not even open yet.

322
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:22,261
Thank you.

323
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,961
I guess I'll use it then.

324
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:27,761
I'm sure you're exhausted.

325
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:29,861
So many things happened today too.

326
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:31,461
I guess so.

327
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:35,661
Preparations have been completed.

328
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,661
Then, everyone,

329
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,461
let's go over to the living room that is the site of the crime.

330
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:43,261
The vice-president doesn't have to participate in this, does she?

331
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:46,861
It looks like she's really tired.

332
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:48,861
-But... -Besides, Mrs. Wakamatsu was

333
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,261
sitting right through back then and besides,

334
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,461
she didn't go close even once

335
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:56,361
to the baumkuchen that Ikuro ate either.

336
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:57,661
Right.

337
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:59,861
Maybe it's meaningless for her to come with us?

338
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:04,061
If so, would it be alright for me to stay back here?

339
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:05,261
Since so much has happened,

340
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:08,361
I'd like to be left alone for a while, too!

341
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,261
If you say so...

342
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:12,661
Well then, while you're waiting,

343
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:15,861
it would be a great help if you sign and stamp the contract

344
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:18,861
that is in the drawer of that desk.

345
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:22,061
Oh, that...

346
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:26,361
But the ink of the pen that is on this desk is out of ink.

347
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,561
Let me give you a fountain pen then.

348
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:31,761
It's what the president gave me a long time ago.

349
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,861
Thank you, you're a great help.

350
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:35,461
Shall we start going then?

351
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:37,861
Guess we got no choice.

352
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:49,261
There are two officers standing guard in front of the door.

353
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:50,961
So if anything should happen, call them.

354
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:52,561
Yes.

355
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,861
Excuse me.

356
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:19,961
Is anything the matter?

357
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:24,161
Mrs. Wakamatsu mentioned that we not be able to see the bath room tile

358
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:28,561
at the villa in Karuizawa, but actually...

359
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:33,761
What?

360
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:34,861
The tiles of the bath room in this house

361
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:37,661
are also the same type of tiles?

362
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,261
Why didn't you tell us about it a while ago?

363
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,761
Well, because Mrs. Wakamatsu didn't seem to like

364
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:44,661
having me talk about it.

365
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:47,361
Take us to that bath room, will you?

366
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:48,361
Okay.

367
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,861
So, we're borrowing the housekeeper for a while!

368
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:54,861
You all go on to the living room ahead of us, okay?

369
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:56,561
Hey.

370
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:59,761
Precisely speaking, the color of the tiles

371
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:02,361
are a bit different from those at the villa though.

372
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:04,561
The shapes of the tiles and the color

373
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,761
are more or less the same.

374
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:13,961
This is...

375
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:18,261
Hey, Uehara.

376
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,761
I didn't hear anything about the tiles

377
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,661
being this way at the scene of the crime.

378
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,861
But, just like it's been reported,

379
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:27,061
the color of the tiles gradually gets a little paler

380
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:29,261
as you go from top to bottom.

381
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:30,461
No.

382
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,961
It generally gets that way

383
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:33,561
because an optical illusion occurs!

384
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,361
If I remember correctly, this is...

385
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:38,561
An optical illusionary diamond with shading...

386
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:42,361
better known also as Crazy Diamond.

387
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:45,561
Crazy Diamond?

388
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,461
Each and every diamond shaped tile

389
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:50,861
measures an angle of 30 to 40 degrees from top to bottom.

390
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:54,061
Although there is only a slight gradation.

391
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,661
The eyes of people grasp the light

392
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,161
and dark parts of the border line of the adjoining diagonal shaped tiles

393
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:01,861
as each and every dot,

394
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:03,961
and only focus their attention on that certain part,

395
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,161
that optical illusion reacts to make it

396
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,861
looks as though it is being viewed in entirety.

397
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:07,861
As a result, the diagonal shape on the top

398
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,361
and the diagonal shape on the bottom

399
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:12,261
look to be of totally different colors.

400
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:16,561
In other words, the brain miscalculates what it sees.

401
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:18,261
As proof of this...

402
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,061
This tile here and the tile at the top

403
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:28,061
are the same color, aren't they?

404
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,161
True, amazing!

405
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:35,161
Komei! What did you come here for?

406
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,161
This case is one handled by the headquarters!

407
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:40,661
You guys of the jurisdiction have no place in this!

408
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:42,361
Haven't you heard?

409
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:45,761
I returned to prefectural headquarters as of today.

410
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,561
Through my own efforts.

411
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:52,761
At any rate, we've got to report this to Mr. Mouri and the others

412
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,861
who are at the residence of the president who was killed here!

413
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:56,661
They say that there's been a murder there too

414
00:20:56,661 --> 00:20:59,061
and that it may be the same killer.

415
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:00,061
No.

416
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:03,761
Contact them after forensics examine the site.

417
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,961
-What? -Yeah.

418
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,561
If I remember correctly,

419
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:10,361
the dying message that the president who was killed here,

420
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,061
left behind had for some reason vanished.

421
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:16,061
If so, it is highly likely that the killer used illusion

422
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:19,261
to his advantage and switched the tiles with another!

423
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:20,361
If we're going to contact them,

424
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:23,761
let's do so after we revive the message.

425
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:25,261
If the letters were written with blood,

426
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:29,161
even if it were erased, it can be revived by a luminol reagent.

427
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:32,061
What's this crazy diamond about?

428
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:33,561
What is it, anyway?

429
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:37,261
So, it's a type of optical illusion, you see.

430
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:40,061
Kazuha's cell phone is ringing!

431
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,361
Hello?

432
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:47,461
Hey, detective boy from Osaka.

433
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:50,061
That voice! You're Inspector Yamato, aren't you?

434
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:54,861
We just found the dying message of the president in question!

435
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:56,361
Really?

436
00:21:56,361 --> 00:22:01,361
Three letters of the alphabet were written, "S-O-N"!

437
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,561
Huh? "S-O-N"?

438
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:06,461
S-O-N...

439
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,661
Son.

440
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,961
His son?

441
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,061
Yeah! If the killer of the case over here,

442
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:13,861
and over there are the same,

443
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:15,761
nab his son!

444
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:18,861
Then, this case is closed!

445
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,861
-That's impossible. -What?

446
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:24,861
The one who was murdered here tonight

447
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:26,961
is that son, that's why.

448
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:29,361
What?

449
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:32,761
In other words, the one who murdered the president

450
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:36,361
and the one who murdered his son are...

451
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:38,961
Are two different people?

452
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:04,161
"Next Episode" -It... It's not something

453
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:07,161
I should be talking about at a time like this, but the thing is...

454
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:10,761
What? From Shinichi?

455
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:14,161
What a thing to be talking about at a murder site.

456
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,461
Ikuro didn't pick up the baumkuchen

457
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:19,461
with the poison on it by accident.

458
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,861
We checked your slipper

459
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:24,161
and found that you're the culprit!

460
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:27,961
Next Conan,

461
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:31,961
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Poison)"

462
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:49,761
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:51,761
"Slipper"

464
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:53,761
During Golden Week, I'm watching the movie "The 11th Striker"

465
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,761
and drinking beer at the soccer stadium.

466
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,161
So, you're drinking after all.
