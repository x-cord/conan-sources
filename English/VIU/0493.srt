1
00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:03,713
In our search to find out whether Eisuke Hondo's older sister

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:06,313
and Rena Mizunashi, were one and the same person,

3
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:10,313
we found out that Rena Mizunashi's blood type was AB.

4
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:13,213
I'm blood type AB!

5
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,713
On the other hand, Eisuke tells us that he is blood type O,

6
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:18,813
and from the mansion where his mother used to work as a housekeeper.

7
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:21,413
A mother-child booklet that was found, confirmed Eisuke's blood type too.

8
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,713
It's written here, see?

9
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:27,113
Eisuke Hondo, blood type O!

10
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:29,013
True.

11
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:31,413
So, now everyone knows that I'm blood type O!

12
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:32,613
I see.

13
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:34,213
So, all that's left now is to verify the story about

14
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:37,413
whether his older sister really gave him blood for transfusion.

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,813
The son of the Okudaira's

16
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:44,413
had been killed by someone a year ago.

17
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:49,513
And this is the print out of the video we were watching back then.

18
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:52,413
Both his legs are tied and his mouth is covered with masking tape.

19
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:54,613
Talk about terrible.

20
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,513
Do you have any idea of anyone

21
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:58,913
who could've had a grudge against your son?

22
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:01,113
An idea of anyone,

23
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:04,013
not outside, but rather inside this house.

24
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:11,313
This is what I think, Detective Mouri.

25
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:13,813
My son Tango

26
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:17,813
was killed by a sly and clever someone...

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,913
who lives in this mansion.

28
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,513
Sizzling hot suspense.

29
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:51,413
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

30
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:53,713
A surprising truth that is revealed through blood type!

31
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,113
Echoing through the mansion are screams and shrieks!

32
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:57,613
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:57,613 --> 00:01:59,413
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:01,813
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,360
"Red and Black Crash: A Shriek."

36
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,236
Your son was killed by someone in this house?

37
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:39,955
But, didn't you say that

38
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:43,055
while everyone in the house

39
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,055
was watching the video in the living room,

40
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:48,155
your son was drowned and killed in the pool

41
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:50,455
outside your house by someone!

42
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:53,955
"Kakuzo Okudaira (63), Head of Okudaira Family."

43
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:58,155
If I remember correctly, the estimated time of death of your son

44
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,055
was between 9:00 to 10:00 at night.

45
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:02,355
All the way before and after that time span,

46
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:05,655
that is, from 7:00 pm to 12:00 pm,

47
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:08,355
all of you were watching video, is that right?

48
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,055
That's true.

49
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,655
But, I'm sure that Tango was killed by someone in this house.

50
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:22,455
I can't help thinking so!

51
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:27,155
Do you have a hidden door or something in the living room?

52
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:29,555
And do you think that someone slipped out from there?

53
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:31,855
No, there is no such door.

54
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,155
But, there was someone who stood up to go to the restroom

55
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:36,255
-while we were watching the video. -I see!

56
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,055
So, someone snuck outside during that time.

57
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:39,855
Not possible either.

58
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:41,855
The restroom is connected to the living room,

59
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,755
and the window of the restroom is too small

60
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:47,255
for an adult to go through.

61
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:48,855
Then, it would be impossible for anyone inside

62
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,755
to have committed the crime.

63
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,655
But, take a good look!

64
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:55,255
Over here in the picture!

65
00:04:55,255 --> 00:05:00,055
See, Tango's right hand. He's wearing a white glove.

66
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,755
Yes.

67
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:06,355
That's the glove that the steward that used to work here before

68
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:10,255
used to always wear when he drove!

69
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:16,355
But he died two years ago today, when his car fell over a cliff.

70
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,055
Today, you mean

71
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:28,555
on the same day a year ago, when your son was murdered?

72
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:31,155
Right, today.

73
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:33,855
And three days after my son's death,

74
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:36,455
the left side of the glove that belonged to the steward

75
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:38,955
was found in my study.

76
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:41,755
I see! You mean the glove that the killer

77
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:45,555
tried to put on your son's hand, for some reason came off.

78
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,455
No! Wrong!

79
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:51,355
Somebody has a grudge against the death of the previous steward!

80
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,955
A grudge?

81
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:55,955
Didn't the steward die of an accident?

82
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,255
No...

83
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:00,055
You mean someone thought that

84
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:03,455
you and your son were responsible for the death of the steward?

85
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:07,555
The killer made your son wear the steward's glove

86
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:10,155
then later put the glove of this other hand in this room

87
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:14,455
to warned you that you were next in line to be killed.

88
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:17,355
That's what you wanted to say, right, sir?

89
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,355
Yeah.

90
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,355
What's with you guys?

91
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:23,255
Coming in without permission!

92
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:26,055
Conan suggested that we come to hear about the case,

93
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:28,855
since we finished what we had to do.

94
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,855
Cut out that stupid chuckle of yours!

95
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,655
If you're done with what you have to do, go on home!

96
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:47,955
It's been a long time, Uncle Kakuzo.

97
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:50,955
Oh, it's you, Eisuke!

98
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:54,055
I hear that your mother's belongings were found.

99
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:57,955
Yes! I got them all thanks to everyone.

100
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:02,255
Your mother was a fantastic housekeeper.

101
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,155
She was very thoughtful and always smiling.

102
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:08,255
I'm so sorry that

103
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:12,155
I'm not thoughtful and not amiable on top of that.

104
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,455
Oh, no, I didn't mean it to sound that way.

105
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,855
By the way, I heard that Tango passed away.

106
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:25,555
Yeah, I'm having Detective Mouri check on it for me now.

107
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:28,555
-Mr. Segawa. -Yes, sir.

108
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:31,555
Please show Detective Mouri to the living room.

109
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:33,955
Yes, sir, Mr. Okudaira.

110
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:37,355
And, Kikuyo, could you get us another serving of coffee?

111
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:39,155
-Yes, sir. -And, could you also

112
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:41,555
go get Mrs. Okudaira while you're at it?

113
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:45,055
I want her to help me organize this study.

114
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:46,955
Will you all come and help me too,

115
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:48,555
once you've finished doing what you have to?

116
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:51,455
I've got something I'd like to talk to you about too.

117
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:53,855
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,055
Oh, and Segawa.

119
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,455
Yes?

120
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:00,655
I've told you time and again

121
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:03,755
to knock before coming into my room!

122
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:07,555
Haven't you informed the guests, you blockhead?

123
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:10,055
I'm very sorry.

124
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:18,255
What? Help organize the study?

125
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,755
No way!

126
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:24,755
He's so detailed and so hung up complaining about petty things.

127
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,955
But, Mrs. Okudaira...

128
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,655
Even just a while ago, when I tried to open

129
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:32,255
the cardboard box with a set of large books inside that arrived today,

130
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,855
he bawled me out,

131
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:36,555
telling me not to touch it until he opened it!

132
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,755
He changed the shelf of the bookshelf

133
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,355
in order to fit the large books in.

134
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,555
We consequently ended up moving almost all the books,

135
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:49,055
and now he wants help organizing it again?

136
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:51,355
But...

137
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,555
Let's do this, then!

138
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:57,055
I'll show Detective Mouri to the living room,

139
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:58,755
so you go ahead and help my husband.

140
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:03,955
But, I've got to clean Tango's car too.

141
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:07,855
No one has been using that car for the past two years,

142
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:10,155
so why not just leave it as is?

143
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:12,055
But, Mrs. Okudaira...

144
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:14,655
Come along, this way.

145
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,655
Since you can wash the car later,

146
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,355
-do so for me, okay? -Yes, ma'am.

147
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:22,655
Please come this way.

148
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:25,055
Is this the living room in question?

149
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,555
Yes.

150
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:30,255
Back then, my husband, the steward, the housekeeper and I

151
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:33,055
were all here watching the video.

152
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,855
We watched the video of my husband and I taking a trip abroad

153
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:38,155
for approximately five hours straight.

154
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:41,555
Why didn't your son watch the video together?

155
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:45,755
Most probably because he was trying to avoid me.

156
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:49,455
I'm not his real mother.

157
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,555
Is that so?

158
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:54,655
No, Tango is the son of my husband's previous wife.

159
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:56,755
Haven't I told you?

160
00:09:56,755 --> 00:10:00,155
But, is my husband really suspecting us?

161
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:01,555
Yes.

162
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:06,055
How dare he suspect us just because the killer can't be found?

163
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:08,655
My husband sure is a pain in the neck.

164
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:13,855
The living room restroom.

165
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:18,555
Sure has a window that adults could never go through.

166
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:19,955
Moreover, there is no secret hole

167
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:23,755
where someone cannot go in and out of in this living room.

168
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,955
If so, the four that were watching the video here,

169
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,755
would have a perfect alibi.

170
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,955
It really came as a surprise to me, though,

171
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,255
that you, Eisuke who used to be such a cry baby

172
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:37,255
has come here with such a cute girlfriend.

173
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:40,155
Oh no, we're not.

174
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:43,355
Not lovers or anything like that!

175
00:10:45,555 --> 00:10:50,155
We came here to find out what Eisuke's blood type is,

176
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:54,555
since we were told that his mother-child booklet was found!

177
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:57,755
Right, Eisuke?

178
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,455
Yep.

179
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,955
Why the blood type?

180
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:04,355
Well, when I showed Mr. Mouri the picture of my older sister,

181
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:08,155
he said that it may be Rena Mizunashi,

182
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:10,755
so I came to clear the fact that she isn't.

183
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:13,555
This announcer, Rena Mizunashi is blood type AB,

184
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:15,155
but my blood type is O.

185
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:18,355
I once receive blood transfusion from my older sister so,

186
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:21,555
I know that she and the announcer are two different people!

187
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:25,155
Eisuke knew about it.

188
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:28,355
Come to think of it, I remember that there was something like that.

189
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,655
If I remember correctly, soon after your mother passed away

190
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:35,255
and you went to live with your father in Osaka,

191
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:38,455
you got into an accident.

192
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,755
After hearing what happened, I rushed over

193
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:45,955
and saw your older sister lying exhausted beside you.

194
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:54,155
I asked the nurse, and found out

195
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:57,855
that you had a large amount of blood transfusion from your sister.

196
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,855
I heard that she said, she didn't mind

197
00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:01,855
if they took all the blood they could get from her,

198
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,555
and give it to you.

199
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:07,555
I see.

200
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:10,355
So, this does it.

201
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,755
His older sister and Rena Mizunashi

202
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:16,055
are two different people.

203
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:22,346
I don't watch much TV but, do they resemble each other that much,

204
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,846
his older sister and that woman?

205
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:27,546
Yes, from the picture, they look exactly alike.

206
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,146
But, don't you think it's strange?

207
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,746
I mean it's not like this is a doppelganger phenomenon or something.

208
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:34,146
It's unbelievable to think that there's someone

209
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:35,646
who looks so much alike in this world.

210
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:38,246
I wonder if it has anything to do with the disappearance of my sister?

211
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:40,446
-What do you think? -Beats me.

212
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:42,146
I see.

213
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:44,646
He's going to get her suspicious enough

214
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:48,546
and lead uncle to check things out, then disclose her crime.

215
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,346
After that, he plans to meet Rena Mizunashi

216
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:52,546
and ask her about his older sister.

217
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,446
He doesn't want to risk her fleeing,

218
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:57,646
so he wants to take it slow.

219
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,846
Would you like to go see her, then? In fact, I know where her...

220
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,546
Please show me the pool while we're at it.

221
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:07,146
We may find something out about Tango.

222
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:09,146
I guess so.

223
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:12,946
Oh, but... it's raining outside.

224
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:15,946
Oh, Kikuyo,

225
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:17,746
have you been out somewhere?

226
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:21,446
Yes, I ran out of milk for the coffe,

227
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,446
so I went shopping nearby.

228
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:26,046
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

229
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:29,046
Would you show everyone to the pool?

230
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:30,846
I'll serve the coffee.

231
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,946
Yeah, I don't mind.

232
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,746
Take care of them, okay?

233
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:36,046
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,946
Talk about dirty.

235
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:48,246
Yes. It's been left the way it's been

236
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,846
since the incident that occurred last year.

237
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:53,146
But, how nostalgic.

238
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,546
I used to swim in this pool a lot too.

239
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,846
Hey, Eisuke?

240
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:06,746
Oh, boy. I mean talk about being a klutz.

241
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:15,146
My, it's just right.

242
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,446
I'm sorry. The only clothes of the same size

243
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:20,146
that I could find were that of my late son.

244
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,246
No problem.

245
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:24,546
Which means that your son was of small build too?

246
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:26,546
It's a little too big for me.

247
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,346
Yes.

248
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:30,846
Tango used to do body building.

249
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,246
I put your clothes in the washing machine just now,

250
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,746
so please wait a while.

251
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:36,146
Oh, Kikuyo,

252
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:38,446
there was no coffee in the kitchen.

253
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,146
Oh?

254
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:44,046
I left it on the coffee maker and went shopping.

255
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,546
Oh, Mr. Segawa.

256
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:46,546
Yes?

257
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:48,646
Do you know where the coffee in the kitchen is?

258
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:49,646
No.

259
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:53,646
Maybe Mr. Okudaira couldn't wait and came to get it himself.

260
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:57,446
What was that sound?

261
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,946
I wonder if it came from Mr. Okudaira's study?

262
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,246
I'll go check.

263
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:02,546
Yes, please.

264
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:05,346
Maybe it's that huge vase that we saw a while ago.

265
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:08,146
No way. That vase is something Mr. Okudaira

266
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:11,546
had valued since long ago, and it's worth 50,000,000 yen,

267
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,446
A black out?

268
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:19,246
Don't open the door!

269
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:22,446
What was that?

270
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:41,946
Dear!

271
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:44,746
-It can't be! -What happened to him?

272
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,146
-Dear! -Mrs. Okudaira,

273
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,646
shattered pieces of the vase are still on the floor!

274
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,346
Are you all right?

275
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,446
Yes.

276
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,546
Dear.

277
00:15:57,546 --> 00:15:59,446
Let's get him down right away!

278
00:15:59,446 --> 00:16:00,546
-Yes, sir! -Ran!

279
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:03,146
Contact the police and call an ambulance!

280
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:04,946
Okay, right away!

281
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:11,446
Darn, what's with this rope? It won't come off.

282
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:30,746
The mouth of the vase...

283
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,646
is wet?

284
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:40,146
I'm sorry to say that

285
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:45,346
your husband was already dead when he arrived at the hospital.

286
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:47,346
Oh no!

287
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,646
Mrs. Okudaira.

288
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,746
Mrs. Okudaira. Here, take this.

289
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:58,946
Thank you.

290
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:04,246
I'd like to ask you a few questions, ma'am.

291
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:08,946
Who was the first to find him?

292
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:11,846
Oh, yes. The first two who found my husband

293
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:15,046
were Kikuyo and Mr. Segawa, right?

294
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:19,746
Yes, we heard something crack from the study,

295
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:22,446
so we rushed over and knocked

296
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:24,046
but there was no answer.

297
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,646
Since he didn't answer,

298
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,746
I tried turning the door knob.

299
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:31,346
But then, I heard him shout, "Don't open the door!"

300
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:34,146
Oh, and did you open the door?

301
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:35,846
Of course I did,

302
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,546
because I couldn't make out what was happening.

303
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:39,746
Then, when we opened the door,

304
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:42,846
we found Mr. Okudaira's body suspended in the air.

305
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:47,246
Which means that the man hung himself just before you opened the door?

306
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:52,146
Yes, his body was still swaying.

307
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:54,446
The window is locked tightly

308
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:56,246
so it looks to be he committed suicide but...

309
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:59,446
But, I wonder why he shouted, "Don't open the door?"

310
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:04,046
I'm sure he didn't want anybody to witness him die.

311
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:07,646
It seems that Mr. Okudaira got sick and tired of this world

312
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:10,446
and decided to take his life.

313
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,746
You again.

314
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:14,146
Please take a look, Inspector,

315
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:17,446
at the shattered pieces of the vase on the floor!

316
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:21,446
This was indeed the sound of something cracking that everyone heard!

317
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,546
Moreover, this is the vase that he treasured most,

318
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:25,846
worth 50,000,000 yen!

319
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:28,446
50,000,000 yen! Is that true?

320
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:29,546
Yes.

321
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:31,346
My husband used to boast that

322
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:34,646
it is valued at over 200,000,000 yen now.

323
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,346
The fact that he used the vase as a stepping stool to hang himself

324
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:41,046
is just proof that he got sick and tired of everything.

325
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:44,046
However, the result of the autopsy showed that

326
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:48,146
coffee as well as a sleeping drug were found inside his stomach.

327
00:18:48,146 --> 00:18:49,346
Coffee?

328
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,546
Huh? You mean that?

329
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:53,246
There are two cups there!

330
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:54,846
One is mine.

331
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:56,846
But, would a person who is ready to hang himself

332
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:59,346
drink coffee with sleeping pills in it?

333
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,646
Maybe he planned to kill himself

334
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:04,246
taking an overdose of sleeping pills at first,

335
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:08,446
but found that he couldn't die, so he switched methods.

336
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:11,646
He glued the rope on together carefully the second time around,

337
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,146
so that it wouldn't come off.

338
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:14,446
Glue?

339
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,846
Yes, I was wondering why the rope wouldn't come off right away

340
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:19,146
when I tried to bring Mr. Okudaira down,

341
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:22,446
and found that glue was on the connecting parts of the rope.

342
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:25,646
What was his motive for committing suicide?

343
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:28,746
Do you have any idea?

344
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:29,946
No.

345
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:33,046
Come to think of it, he said to come to his study later

346
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,846
because he wanted to talk something over,

347
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:40,046
so maybe he had something that was bothering him.

348
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:44,146
Then, why would he hang himself before he talked to all of you about it?

349
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:47,346
Maybe he thought it was useless even if talked to us about it?

350
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:49,346
I hate to say this,

351
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:53,946
but I don't think Mr. Okudaira trusted any of you.

352
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:57,646
Your husband was probably bleeding from the mouth

353
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:00,946
because he bit his lip in vexation.

354
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:03,546
I'll bet he didn't like the idea of his favourite vase,

355
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:06,046
being owned by someone else after his death.

356
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:09,646
That's why he used it as a step and cracked the vase by stepping on it.

357
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:14,746
-So, that man was really greedy after all. -What?

358
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,246
Because if the man stepped on the vase to hang himself

359
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:18,346
and the sound of the vase cracking was heard,

360
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:21,646
that means the man was already choking at that time, right?

361
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:24,046
He must've been really greedy because he was able to shout,

362
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:28,146
"Don't give the vase to anyone" despite being choked.

363
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,446
Wrong, Conan.

364
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:35,346
He didn't shout don't give the vase away, he said don't open the door.

365
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:37,146
Oh, did he?

366
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:39,446
Come to think of it, isn't it strange?

367
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,646
How could he have shouted when he was being choked?

368
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:47,846
Which means that when the vase cracked he hadn't hung himself yet.

369
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,746
Which means that he hung himself from the shock of the vase cracking?

370
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:54,246
No, if they heard the sound of the crack and ran over,

371
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:56,346
he wouldn't have had enough time to hang himself with the rope.

372
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:59,746
Oh, maybe it's because of this?

373
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:02,646
See, this book is stained with blood.

374
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:06,546
I'll bet he was disappointed because it was a book he treasured.

375
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:09,146
"Murderer from the Land of the Dead?"

376
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:14,046
It's located right below Mr. Okudaira's feet.

377
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:15,046
Huh?

378
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:23,046
Could this by chance be a dying message?

379
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:25,046
Don't be ridiculous.

380
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:26,846
Are you saying that the killer is a ghost

381
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:28,846
who came from the Land of the Dead?

382
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:33,346
Oh, no, I think that the message is

383
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:36,046
where the word Land of the Dead is, because there's a lot of blood there,

384
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,546
and because of the hiragana "ko"

385
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:41,646
that seems to have been written by dripping blood.

386
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:43,746
Land of the Dead, (pronounced "yomiko")

387
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:44,946
Ko... Koyomi?

388
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:46,946
Does it have anything to do with a date?

389
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:50,346
No, I'm not really sure yet if this is the letter "ko".

390
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,346
If you change the angle of the letter by turning it sideways,

391
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:55,446
it looks like the hiragana "i" or even "ri".

392
00:21:55,446 --> 00:22:00,146
If this is a dying message,

393
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:05,546
Mr. Kakuzo Okudaira was killed by one of you.

394
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:08,346
Here in this house.

395
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:54,946
What is the meaning of the "Murderer from the Land of the Dead

396
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:59,046
and the dying message written in blood that are left behind?

397
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:02,346
If the murderer is someone who is in the house right now,

398
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:04,446
is the murderer also connected to the murder of Tango,

399
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:07,246
who was killed a year ago?

400
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:10,946
The ruthless trick is common in both incidents...

401
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:14,046
It is the key to solving everything.

402
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:18,246
Next on Detective Conan,

403
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:21,846
"Red and Black Crash: Hades."

404
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:39,446
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,646
Stepstool.

406
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,346
Officer Takagi, may I use you as a stepstool?

407
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:44,346
-Yeah, sure. -Me too, then.

408
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:46,946
-Oh, same here! -Too heavy...
