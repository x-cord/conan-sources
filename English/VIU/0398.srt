1
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:05,912
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,612
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:09,212
A secret-filled cell phone.

4
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:11,012
There are tricks everywhere in the mails as well as the conversations.

5
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:12,812
An entangled baffling case!

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,312
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:16,012
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:18,513
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,029
I know that I shouldn't send this.

10
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,829
Maybe I should just take my time and see what happens?

11
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,730
I know I may have a chance to come in touch with their boss eventually.

12
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,630
That chance will come. I'm sure.

13
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,529
Conan!

14
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,729
You're still in your pyjamas.

15
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,229
I told you to hurry and get changed because we're going out, didn't I?

16
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,229
Come on, never mind the cell phone.

17
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,630
Okay.

18
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,529
Gosh.

19
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,029
Oh, right.

20
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,229
I guess I'll send Shinichi a mail before going out.

21
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,829
Because he may show up out of the blue while we're out.

22
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,229
We're going to accompany Dad today to cover a case.

23
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,630
If it turns out to be a tough one, I may be asking you for advice.

24
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,430
Conan's cell phone is ringing.

25
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,229
He just got mail.

26
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,829
Don't tell me it's the mail I just sent?

27
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,829
It can't be because I sent mine to Shinichi's address.

28
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,530
But the timing is too good for it to be a coincidence.

29
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,030
"Request from a Queer Family (Part 1)"

30
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,729
Did you look at the contents?

31
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,429
No, I didn't.

32
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,729
It sounded like you got incoming mail,

33
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,229
so I just wondered who it was from.

34
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,529
I'm sure it's from Doc!

35
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,329
Just as I thought.

36
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,830
He's repairing the Youth Detective Squad badge. I asked him to do so.

37
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,829
It's from Ran!

38
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,229
Then, don't tell me...

39
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,529
Don't tell me that...

40
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,230
Oh, no.

41
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,529
Give me a break.

42
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,429
Do you guys have to tag along like this each and every time?

43
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,029
But your client requested that you come along with family, right?

44
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,729
Besides, we may come up with some idea that may help you out again, too.

45
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,529
Right, Ran?

46
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,129
True.

47
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,529
With a fantastic deduction that is just as good as some great detective

48
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,530
that is usually God knows where.

49
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,229
Going all out like that.

50
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,730
There's something fishy about that mail that you got a while ago.

51
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,629
He's probably taking measures so that the mails that I sent him

52
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,229
won't be seen by someone he doesn't want them to be seen by.

53
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,229
He told me that he couldn't give me his phone number because he's busy

54
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,629
and can't answer the phone,

55
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,429
but he gave it to Conan after all.

56
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,929
If he had been contacting Conan all the time,

57
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,729
Conan's fantastic deductions

58
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,929
and for some strange reason, knowing things about me,

59
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,029
all fall into place.

60
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,629
That Shinichi is taking advantage of a child.

61
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,130
I'll never forgive him.

62
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,629
Cell phone?

63
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,929
Yes, I'd like you to find it for me.

64
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,029
If possible, by today.

65
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,129
If not, I may end up.

66
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,530
"Tomoko Kariya (39)" -not being able to stay here anymore.

67
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,929
Why would that be?

68
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,930
Well, the thing is...

69
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,930
What?

70
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:15,230
You'll be getting a mail from your lover tonight?

71
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,029
You're the one who needs to hush up.

72
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,829
I'm worried that the mail may be seen by my jealous husband,

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,429
my strait-laced father-in-law or talkative younger brothers.

74
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,629
Then why don't you contact your partner immediately

75
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,929
and tell him not to send you mail?

76
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,429
Well, he's the one who calls me from his side all the time,

77
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,929
and his number is an unlisted number.

78
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,829
He always sends me mail over the weekends,

79
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,229
but he rarely looks at the mails that I send him from my side.

80
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,529
I have no way of contacting him from my side.

81
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,329
He sounds pretty selfish.

82
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,229
But there are egotistical people like that around.

83
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,129
Right, Conan?

84
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,829
Really?

85
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,729
And where and when did you lose it?

86
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,329
I don't know.

87
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,129
I just realized it two days ago.

88
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,029
But I'm pretty sure that someone in this house has it.

89
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,629
What do you mean?

90
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,629
I called my cell phone as soon as I lost it.

91
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,429
After about 10 rings or so, somebody answered the phone

92
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,629
but said nothing and hung up right away.

93
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,929
But I heard it on the other side of the line,

94
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,630
the sound of my father-in-law blowing his unskilled bamboo flute.

95
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,829
Listen to this.

96
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,229
He sure sounds terrible.

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,429
Moreover, he only plays the flute in his room.

98
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,929
So the fact that this sound was heard on the phone

99
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,329
means that the cell phone is somewhere in this house.

100
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,029
But no matter how many times I called after that, I get no answer.

101
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,129
Then why not get everyone in the house together and...

102
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,629
Yes. Of course I already asked everyone.

103
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,729
But they've all told me that they don't know.

104
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,729
I'm sure that they're waiting for me to goof.

105
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,429
Somebody probably doesn't like me and wants to chase me out of this house.

106
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,529
If divorce comes up, God knows how much alimony will be demanded of me.

107
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,829
Why don't you call the phone company

108
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,129
and have them stops your phone service?

109
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,729
Even so, I wouldn't be able to erase the mails

110
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,329
that he had sent me from the memory.

111
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,329
I do have it locked just in case, so no one gets to look at them.

112
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,229
If I stop the phone, it would probably breed more suspicion

113
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,330
and the lock may be undone.

114
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,230
But how should I go about looking for it?

115
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,729
You're her friend from your junior high school days.

116
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,829
Yes, sir! I'm Mouri.

117
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,629
Rather, Goro Mori.

118
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,829
Mr. Mori will be building a house soon,

119
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,529
so he wanted to see this house that you designed for reference.

120
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,329
"Daisaku Kariya (68)" -Oh, I see.

121
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,929
Please help yourself and look around to your heart's content.

122
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,129
I see.

123
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,129
That's why she asked him to bring the family with him.

124
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,929
I'll let you listen to my flute.

125
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,929
I really don't think...

126
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,529
Can you tell if you hear your cell phone ring?

127
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,829
Yes, but it could be on manner mode.

128
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,830
Okay, ring it.

129
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,029
At this age,

130
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,230
you need to go to the restroom so often that it's a bother.

131
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,330
Excuse me for a moment.

132
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,629
Don't tell me that father...

133
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,329
I don't think so.

134
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,229
Because whoever answered the phone just now

135
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,130
hung up right away.

136
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,729
He sure doesn't look to be such a strait-laced person.

137
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,229
He looks that way, but he is actually a very scary man.

138
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,029
Even the incident that happened 12 years ago.

139
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,129
It was because of father to begin with.

140
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,330
12 years ago?

141
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,929
Oh, well. Never mind.

142
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,229
Shall we look elsewhere then?

143
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,329
Your classmate?

144
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,629
You mean your ex-boyfriend or something?

145
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,230
Of course not.

146
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,729
So you write novels?

147
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,929
Yes.

148
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,029
I'm still an unknown writer.

149
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,030
But in three months,

150
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:22,029
you may be hearing my name whether you like it or not.

151
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,429
Shigehide Kariya.

152
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,929
You mean you're the one who writes those pure love novels?

153
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,730
So the rumour about your novel being aired on TV is true.

154
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,029
But I expected you to be much older.

155
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,829
Your novel's going to be dramatized. How wonderful.

156
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,430
Hey, Ran. Make the call.

157
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,329
Oh, it's from the publisher.

158
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,329
Yes, hello.

159
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,629
How about it?

160
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,829
No, he isn't the one. Because that person hung up right away again.

161
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,929
Huh? A meeting?

162
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,629
I see.

163
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,429
I'll meet you at the family restaurant in front of the station then.

164
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,429
What timing though. A while ago and even now,

165
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,029
talk about a string of coincidences.

166
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,829
Right, coincidences happen a lot.

167
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,629
Things that seem to happen by chance are called coincidences

168
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,529
because they don't usually happen.

169
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,329
I guess you're right.

170
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,529
But Mrs. Kariya, if it's this type of investigation,

171
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,829
you may as well get yourself another cell phone and try calling yourself.

172
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,929
Are you saying that I go out and get myself another cell phone?

173
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,129
I don't have much money that I can use freely.

174
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,329
I decided to hire a professional

175
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,630
instead of relying on my friends to protect my privacy, too.

176
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,929
So your husband is an illustrator.

177
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,630
He doesn't seem to be around though.

178
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,930
If he's not around, this is our chance.

179
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,629
See. Coincidences don't keep on happening.

180
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,229
This picture sure looks familiar.

181
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,329
Oh, that's it.

182
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,829
The painting of Tsugutaka Kariya that was popular some time ago.

183
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,029
Oh, so you're familiar with my painting?

184
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,229
Just who are you all?

185
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,529
Dear, he is...

186
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,929
So you're Tsugutaka Kariya.

187
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,030
I expected you to be a lot younger.

188
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,829
I guess you could say the paintings of the young people are like e-mails

189
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,529
whereas my paintings are letters.

190
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,530
The depth of colour differs.

191
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,529
A guest?

192
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,829
Leave it be.

193
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,129
I'm sure it's the publisher

194
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,130
that's come to pressure me to hand in my work.

195
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,730
It's been ringing for quite a long time.

196
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,329
Wasn't it a guest?

197
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,930
Well, I went to answer the door but there was no one there.

198
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,129
Do things like this happen often?

199
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,029
Sometimes.

200
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,629
Mrs. Kariya says it's some child playing a prank.

201
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,429
What're we going to do?

202
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,429
There no place to look for it anymore.

203
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,729
Mr. Mouri, no need to worry.

204
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,529
As you can see, I've found my cell phone.

205
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,829
-Huh? -What?

206
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,229
Thank you very much.

207
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,529
I'll make sure I deposit the payment to you.

208
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,929
Talk about a stupid case.

209
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,929
Right. There are people deceiving people behind their back, too.

210
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,530
Talk about stupid.

211
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,429
May I stay over at Doc's house tonight?

212
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,229
You're going to play games again with Doc?

213
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,529
No, you can't.

214
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,429
Because I have a lot of things I want to talk over with you tonight, Conan.

215
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,129
Okay, then. Can we just stop by for a little while?

216
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,729
Because my badge is repaired.

217
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,130
Shinichi, what's up at this time of day?

218
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,029
Bummers, I'm in a fix.

219
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,729
It's seems that Ran called my cell phone.

220
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,729
Tonight at around 7:00,

221
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,129
a woman's body was found in a car parked along the Teimusu River.

222
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,029
The woman has been identified from her belongings

223
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,229
as Mrs. Tomoko Kariya, 32 years old, a housewife residing in Haidocho.

224
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,129
The police have concluded this to be a murder case.

225
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,130
There seems to be strange things found at the scene so...

226
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,630
What?

227
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,598
The victim is Mrs. Tomoko Kariya.

228
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,198
According to the medical examiner,

229
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,298
she was stabbed in the stomach

230
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,498
then later hit on the head with a blunt instrument.

231
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,298
She was stabbed then later assaulted?

232
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,298
Yes, sir. There's a possibility that there could be more than one culprit,

233
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,198
because it's unnatural to think that the culprit wound stab someone

234
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,099
then use another weapon to attack her again.

235
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:34,099
Wait a second.

236
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,598
I think there was similar case like this in the past.

237
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:42,498
Her bag and cash are nowhere in sight, so it may be a robber.

238
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:45,898
We can't be too sure, Officer Takagi.

239
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,598
Oh, Mr. Mouri?

240
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:50,698
Hey, hey. This is work for the police to handle.

241
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,798
I wish you passersby outsiders keep out of this.

242
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,798
No, no, Inspector.

243
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,498
I am no outsider to this case.

244
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:01,199
Actually, that woman asked me to do work for her.

245
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,998
What? Mrs. Kariya was having an extra-marital affair?

246
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,098
No way.

247
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:09,298
Unfortunately, it seems to have been so.

248
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,998
Then, did her partner killed her?

249
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,098
No, we don't know for sure yet.

250
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:16,398
Would you have any idea who it could've been?

251
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,698
Come to think of it,

252
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:20,698
a guy with a moustache accompanied by a child came around.

253
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:24,198
Right, I think his name was Goro Mori or something like that.

254
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,898
Goro Mori?

255
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,598
Well, that's...

256
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,898
It's him!

257
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,699
How dare you!

258
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,398
You've got me wrong.

259
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,398
Kogoro Mouri, that renown detective.

260
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,198
Yes, sir. When I came this afternoon,

261
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,798
I couldn't reveal my name because of certain reasons.

262
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,098
Does that mean that you already arrested the one who killed Tomoko?

263
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,598
No, not just yet.

264
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:54,298
Excuse me, but where were you last night at around 7:30 in the evening?

265
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,098
Me?

266
00:14:56,099 --> 00:15:00,098
I was here all the while. Isn't it right, Mr. Nakamura?

267
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,099
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,498
He was blowing his flute from a little before 7:00 when everyone came,

269
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:07,098
all the way to about 8:00.

270
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:12,198
He stopped blowing for a little while around 7:30 when I served him dinner.

271
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,998
Did you actually see him then?

272
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,298
No. When he's blowing his flute,

273
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,898
I am told to leave his dinner outside his room

274
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,299
so that I won't interrupt him.

275
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,498
But maybe he smelled the aroma of curry outside the sliding paper door?

276
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:30,198
It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner.

277
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:32,298
Around 7:30?

278
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,898
I was here.

279
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,798
I came back after the meeting ended at 6:00,

280
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,498
and was confined in this room working right through.

281
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:41,698
I think the two over there can testify to that?

282
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,098
Is that right?

283
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,798
Yes, that's correct.

284
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,598
Ever since the lights of the room was turned on around 6:30,

285
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,099
Shigehide's silhouette was in view from the sliding paper door.

286
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,698
Even when I brought him his dinner.

287
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:58,198
Which means you didn't actually see him in person.

288
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,198
No, because I'm told not to enter when he is working.

289
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,398
Is it really true that Tomoko was killed?

290
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,398
Yes. That's why we're investigating the case.

291
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,898
Then hurry on with it and get going.

292
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,898
Since you all came and keep going back and forth the corridor,

293
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:19,698
I can't seem to concentrate on my work.

294
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,199
He talks like that even though someone was murdered?

295
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,998
Which means...

296
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,998
the only people left in this house that we haven't questioned yet

297
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,698
is Tomoko's husband.

298
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:30,998
Yes, sir.

299
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:32,198
Huh?

300
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,499
His dinner is still left outside.

301
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:38,598
Mr. Tsugutaka Kariya, please answer us!

302
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,798
What's up?

303
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,698
Well, he won't say anything.

304
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:45,198
You asked me if I have any idea about it.

305
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,198
I don't know anything so I can't possibly answer that question.

306
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,898
It wasn't me to usually talk to her anyway.

307
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:53,498
It seems that you haven't touched your dinner, too.

308
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:55,798
Are you feeling sick or something?

309
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,898
No, I was absorbed in work that I simply forgot.

310
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:02,098
When you brought dinner to him, did you talk to him?

311
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,998
No. Well...

312
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,798
But I'm sure he was in his room

313
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,599
because I could smell the sweet aroma of his pipe.

314
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,998
Okay. Now that you're done, get going already.

315
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,399
His wife's been killed and he's still going to work.

316
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:21,598
Those three have an alibi.

317
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,599
Yes, sir.

318
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,698
It would take 20 minutes

319
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,098
even if you went full speed from here to the murder site.

320
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,998
They couldn't have committed the crime.

321
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:31,998
Which makes the man she was having an affair with the most suspicious.

322
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,498
But we have no idea of who, or where he is.

323
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:37,399
Shall we try tracing him starting with Mrs. Kariya's friends?

324
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,498
Hello?

325
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,399
Yes, this is the Kariya residence.

326
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:49,098
There's a phone call for Mrs. Kariya.

327
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:52,398
Hey, hurry and put Tomoko on the line.

328
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,799
Tell her to answer my mail.

329
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:57,798
This is the police.

330
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,698
What is your relationship with Mrs. Tomoko Kariya?

331
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:04,399
Yes...

332
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:07,098
He's innocent.

333
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,198
Huh?

334
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:11,898
He seems to have been at a pub in Hokkaido.

335
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:15,798
He says he called in rage because she didn't answer his mails

336
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,598
nor answer her cell phone today.

337
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,098
Then he didn't know about the incident?

338
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:23,798
But, Inspector,

339
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,698
it only takes one or two hours to Hokkaido by plane,

340
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,798
so if he flies straight to Hokkaido after committing the crime...

341
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,698
No, there were several of his colleagues

342
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:34,898
who said that they began drinking about at 8:00.

343
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:37,098
So he couldn't have committed the crime.

344
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,898
If so, who could've killed her?

345
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:41,598
How strange though.

346
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,898
All three people eat their meals in a different room.

347
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:45,899
Yes.

348
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,598
But everyone used to eat together until 12 years ago.

349
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,198
12 years ago?

350
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:57,198
Yes. When the third son, Eisuke was here, everyone always ate together.

351
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,798
Right.

352
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,698
Eisuke?

353
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:02,798
Eisuke Kariya.

354
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,098
I get it! Now I remember.

355
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:06,898
It's that case that happened 12 years ago!

356
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:08,298
Inspector?

357
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:13,398
There was an incident 12 years ago that seemed very similar to this case.

358
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:18,798
The one who was killed was Eisuke's fiance, Ms. Motoka Aida.

359
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,998
Like Tomoko, she was stabbed then later struck to death.

360
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:27,498
Back then, Eisuke who had disappeared was also thought to be a suspect,

361
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,798
but a large amount of his blood was also found near the phone booth.

362
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,498
Moreover, after the incident,

363
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:36,898
all the cash from Eisuke's account had been withdrawn.

364
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:38,598
So we thought that Eisuke had been kidnapped

365
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,599
and killed after the money was taken from him.

366
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,498
The murder site was a lonely place and there were no witnesses.

367
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,398
Investigation was at a deadlock.

368
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:53,099
Come to think of it, there was a call from Eisuke's friend last night.

369
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,898
For Eisuke?

370
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:58,299
-No. -For Mrs. Kariya.

371
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:03,398
Something about the caller, Eisuke and Tomoko

372
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,998
used to belong to the same drama club of the university they went to.

373
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,698
Back then, she seemed to be very annoyed.

374
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:14,499
I didn't call you. Cut out your stupid talk.

375
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,398
Something sure smells fishy.

376
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:21,699
Do you know the phone number of that person?

377
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:25,299
Is that so?

378
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:29,799
Okay, if something comes up I may get back to you. Thank you.

379
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,498
How was it?

380
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,998
He's innocent. He has a perfect alibi.

381
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,398
He seems to have received silent phone call last night,

382
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,498
so he checked the history of his incoming calls

383
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:42,298
and found that it was Tomoko's cell phone number.

384
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,398
He tried calling her back many times, but couldn't connect

385
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:47,898
so he decided to call her home phone.

386
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:49,498
Strange.

387
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,598
Mrs. Kariya's cell phone disappeared the night before yesterday

388
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,598
and it was supposed to have been locked.

389
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:57,698
Don't tell me that the person who had the cell phone

390
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:00,398
unlocked the phone and made the call?

391
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:03,398
If so, could that have been the motive of the culprit?

392
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:07,098
Several calls from her lover were found saved in her cell phone, too.

393
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,398
In other words, that person is the killer.

394
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:12,898
But you found her cell phone right away, didn't you?

395
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:13,998
No.

396
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,798
Mrs. Kariya is the one who found it

397
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,898
and I don't even know where she found it either.

398
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:19,799
I didn't bother asking her.

399
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:26,498
Okay, Conan. We got all the information we need.

400
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:28,798
You're going to call Shinichi, aren't you?

401
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,398
Go on and call him!

402
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,498
Right. Once you call him, that's it.

403
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,998
I'm taking that cell phone from you

404
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,198
and talk to him directly myself.

405
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:40,198
You can't possibly do something like that.

406
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,198
What can't you do?

407
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:46,198
Because to lock the cell phone, you need to enter four digits.

408
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:50,898
There are 10,000 possibilities from "0000" to "9999".

409
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,898
I couldn't possibly try all those numbers out.

410
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,798
Well, maybe if I were so bored and had nothing to do

411
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,198
and moreover, was an invisible man unseen by anybody, then maybe...

412
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,798
An invisible man?

413
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,298
It's true that if it were to take three seconds to try it once,

414
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,698
that would add up to 30,000 seconds.

415
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:07,898
8 hours.

416
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:10,498
I'd give up at that point.

417
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,998
Which means the one who unlocked the phone would be someone

418
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,898
who can stay without being bothered by anyone for a long period of time.

419
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:20,299
In other words, the three who are usually confined to their rooms.

420
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:01,998
"Next Episode" -I'm going to send that mail once more.

421
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:03,398
And this time for sure...

422
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:05,298
Then who was smoking the pipe?

423
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,098
Are you saying that there was Ninja or something around?

424
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:08,498
A Ninja?

425
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:11,998
Thanks to you police people, I haven't been able concentrate,

426
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:14,199
and haven't made any progress in my work!

427
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,798
If so, there is only one thing I can think of.

428
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,298
Conan himself...

429
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,898
is Shinichi.

430
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:28,899
Next Conan, "Request from a Queer Family (Part 2)"

431
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,798
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,898
"The case of 12 years ago."

433
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:49,998
The ending theme is "June Bride".

434
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,298
It's our song, for sure!

435
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,799
-Officer Sato isn't here. -I know that!
