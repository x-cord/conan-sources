1
00:00:04,164 --> 00:00:05,763
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:07,463
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:09,263
Today's story's stage is set on a village shrine.

4
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:10,663
Another meaning to the letters we've been seeing

5
00:00:10,664 --> 00:00:12,363
is hiding an unexpected secret!

6
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:13,963
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,563
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:18,064
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,318
"Stag beetles..."

10
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,019
"Hercules beetles..."

11
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,619
It must be around here.

12
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:19,019
Why do I have to look for insects...

13
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,818
on a hot day like this?

14
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,719
Hey. Mitsuhiko, are you sure they're around here?

15
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,519
Wait a second.

16
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,718
Moreover, there's garbage everywhere in this mountain.

17
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,318
It can't help it.

18
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,818
The people from the village usually take turns cleaning up,

19
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,818
but yesterday there was a festival

20
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,519
and a lot of people seem to have come here.

21
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,518
A festival?

22
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,618
It's called the Tento Festival

23
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,118
where people walk through town

24
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,618
with a float decorated with eight million Gods.

25
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:02,618
Look, that's the shrine over there.

26
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:06,018
That shrine gate is the starting point.

27
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,118
Behind the float that is lit up with colourful lights,

28
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,618
and fireworks are shot up in the air.

29
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:13,019
It is indeed a magnificent sight!

30
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,618
Doc, you were here last night?

31
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,819
Well, that's...

32
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,719
What...

33
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,818
Why didn't you bring us with you?

34
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,718
That's not fair!

35
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,119
We wanted to see the fireworks, too!

36
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,219
"Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 1)"

37
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,918
We had our reasons, too.

38
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,918
Isn't it right, Ai?

39
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,018
Right, I'm sleepy because of it.

40
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,918
You're always sleepy.

41
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,118
What were the two of you doing here?

42
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,418
Did you two came here to catch insects?

43
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,018
Well, something like that.

44
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,818
What?

45
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:10,818
But we didn't see any unicorn beetles or stag beetles.

46
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,618
You can't find any of it just by groping around here and there.

47
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:17,018
I'm not just groping around!

48
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,618
I'm selecting trees like saw tooth oak that the unicorn beetles like.

49
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:26,318
Mitsuhiko, touch the ground of the root.

50
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,618
Hard, isn't it?

51
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:29,218
Yes.

52
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:33,118
And there's garbage, but no fallen leaves.

53
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,618
And we don't see any withered trees either, right?

54
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,418
The larva of the unicorn beetle

55
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,718
grows where fallen leaves have rot and the ground is soft.

56
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:43,918
The stag beetle grows by withered trees.

57
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,718
So there aren't much of them in groves like these where the ground is hard

58
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,818
and routine cleaning is carried out.

59
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,118
You sure know a lot.

60
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,018
If we were to look,

61
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,018
it would be in the woods on the other side of our tents.

62
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:00,518
And I think dawn would be best time to start.

63
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,718
Then let's eat dinner and hit the sack!

64
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:06,018
But don't expect too much.

65
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:10,018
The collecting season is from after June until around the middle of August.

66
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,918
These days the nights are a bit chilly

67
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,819
so there's not much tree sap around that the insects favour.

68
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,718
Don't be too disappointed.

69
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:23,818
I have a little treasure for you instead.

70
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,818
A treasure...

71
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,418
Yes. Something you will like!

72
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,619
Where is it?

73
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,719
To find it, you must...

74
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,818
You will have to solve this code.

75
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:44,718
Marumushi (pill bug)?

76
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,719
Ni (and)?

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,019
Tent?

78
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,418
What is that?

79
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,118
Pill bug is the insect that curls up into a round ball

80
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,618
when it's poked at like a roly-poly, right?

81
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:57,718
Are we going to set a tent up over him?

82
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,419
Or maybe it's the ladybug?

83
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,018
I don't get it.

84
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,218
At times like this...

85
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,218
It's...

86
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:09,318
-That's right. -Right.

87
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,618
It's up to Conan.

88
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,318
What?

89
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,218
No. Don't depend on Edogawa's wits.

90
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,518
Why not, Haibara?

91
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,918
I'm just saying it's not good to depend on others so easily.

92
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,718
You might be able to figure it out if you lie down and think carefully.

93
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,218
And if you still don't get it,

94
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,418
wash your face and start anew.

95
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:31,518
Start anew.

96
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,618
It's easy to say but...

97
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,919
Doc and Ai are so mean!

98
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,718
-What makes you say that, Ai? -Shinichi.

99
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,218
I have something I want to discuss with you.

100
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:45,819
Can you go to the place of the code and secretly check things out?

101
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:48,219
Okay.

102
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,818
If Ai or I go,

103
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,919
they'll probably find out where the coded location is through us.

104
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:04,618
Don't tell me that you can't decipher my code?

105
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:05,918
Leave me alone.

106
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
Is that right?

107
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:15,018
This is all because Ai thought it through real hard!

108
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,818
Don't let him get you, Doc.

109
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,118
Huh?

110
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:23,718
He's just trying to make you happy by making you think you beat him.

111
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:24,919
Is that right?

112
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:32,018
It's unthinkable that he can't solve a super simple code like this.

113
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,719
Isn't it right, Mr. Holmes of the age of Heisei?

114
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:39,218
She's really making me mad.

115
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:42,118
Conan, you don't get it, too?

116
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,218
Hey, you're just like us!

117
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:45,718
I'm really glad.

118
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:48,918
You're just an ordinary first grader after all!

119
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,018
No.

120
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,418
I almost have the answer.

121
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,818
The pill bug is not an insect.

122
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,718
Like the crab and shrimp, it has a hard shell.

123
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:03,918
Just like a person who protects himself with hard frame work or cloth

124
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,018
when sleeping in a tent in the mountains, so does the pill bug.

125
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,419
They can both curl up into a ball.

126
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,119
And...

127
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,418
And so...

128
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:18,618
And so...

129
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:26,319
Even if I run the common points together, I still can't solve it.

130
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,018
I've got mail.

131
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:34,019
Let's talk about the code later.

132
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,619
Conan.

133
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,218
It's from Sonoko.

134
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,619
It's a picture.

135
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:49,318
What's this?

136
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,819
What on earth is this?

137
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,118
This time it's a phone call.

138
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,118
It's from Ran.

139
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,019
Voice changer, voice changer.

140
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,518
What's he doing?

141
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,118
I don't know.

142
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,818
Ran? What's up?

143
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,018
Sorry, Shinichi.

144
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,018
Sonoko just sent you a picture, right?

145
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,119
Erase it right now!

146
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:16,618
Don't erase it!

147
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:21,118
I took Ran's special sexy shot.

148
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:24,418
Hey, Sonoko! What are you saying?

149
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:27,118
Special sexy shot?

150
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,219
Then this is...

151
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:33,419
Ran's...

152
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,619
It's bleeding.

153
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,418
Right, Ran and Sonoko were saying they were going to the beach.

154
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:47,118
Hey. Who are you talking to, Conan?

155
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,318
What? Conan?

156
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:51,519
-Is Conan nearby? -Oh, no!

157
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:55,518
Kona coffee.

158
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,019
It's the kona coffee I'm drinking right now.

159
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,118
Don't drink too much.

160
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,218
Okay.

161
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,519
I'm going to hang up if that's all you have to say.

162
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,818
The picture...

163
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,518
I know! I'll erase it.

164
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,519
See you!

165
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,719
Save, save.

166
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:24,119
She'll find out sooner or later.

167
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:29,318
Hey! I've found the pill bug!

168
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,218
Where did you find it?

169
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,918
I bet you just turned over a rock or something, right?

170
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,618
No! No!

171
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:40,118
I found it! On the other side of the woods.

172
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,419
You found it?

173
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:47,218
Is it true, Genta?

174
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:49,118
See, we're here.

175
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:51,118
There, over there.

176
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,719
Look there!

177
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,418
It's "marumushi", right?

178
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:58,018
Marumushi Hot Spring?

179
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,818
I've heard of a Asamushi Hot Spring, but...

180
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:04,818
It's such a lonely hot spring inn.

181
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:07,018
The sign is coming off.

182
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,918
There's probably a tent inside that inn, right?

183
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,418
There must be a key to the code in that tent!

184
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:16,219
Then, let's go!

185
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,719
Let's go!

186
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:25,919
I don't see the point...

187
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:30,219
of saying that so enthusiastically.

188
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:38,435
How strange.

189
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:43,231
I thought there was something at Marumushi Hot Spring.

190
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:46,531
That inn is closed down, and there is no tent in there.

191
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,832
Yes. There was no one there, too.

192
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,532
So what do you say? Give up?

193
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:56,231
I guess so.

194
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,631
Unfortunately...

195
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,631
So show us the treasure.

196
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:02,732
Actually this code is...

197
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,432
Doc, wait!

198
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:11,332
There's one person who still hasn't given up.

199
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,731
Hey.

200
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,331
Conan?

201
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:24,031
Why don't you just give up?

202
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:27,731
There are times like this.

203
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:29,331
But it's so odd.

204
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,331
Conan love codes so much and are able to solve them easily.

205
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:35,632
Maybe you're suffering from the summer heat?

206
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,632
Shut up.

207
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:42,431
It's just that I can't really get into it.

208
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,632
Especially when it's not connected to a case.

209
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,432
A phone call.

210
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:54,532
It's Ran again.

211
00:12:58,232 --> 00:13:00,732
What can it be this time?

212
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:04,831
Yes, hello?

213
00:13:04,832 --> 00:13:07,432
Shinichi? Please help me!

214
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:09,931
Someone's been killed.

215
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:13,031
Sonoko and I were also attacked and we're in trouble!

216
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:17,531
What? Are you in the middle of running away from the killer?

217
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,831
No, we're alright now.

218
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,131
We're not hurt.

219
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:24,031
We're with the police right now.

220
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:25,331
And? Who was killed?

221
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:29,231
A man called Miyama who was staying in the same hotel as us!

222
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:32,431
Then were you attacked because you saw the killer?

223
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,031
No, we didn't see him.

224
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:38,931
We found out that the man was killed only after the police informed us.

225
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:42,031
What? You were attacked despite the police being there?

226
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:47,031
No, we were attacked on our way back from the police!

227
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:49,431
It was too dark to see who it was though.

228
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,331
Is the one who attacked you is the killer?

229
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,531
I don't know.

230
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,631
That person ran off with Sonoko's bag,

231
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,531
-so maybe it was just a purse-snatcher. -Hey!

232
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:58,031
What are you doing?

233
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,331
Give it back!

234
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:02,731
Why did you go to the police at night?

235
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:07,131
Sonoko remembered that there was something written on the window

236
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:10,531
of the hotel room where the man was killed.

237
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:13,831
So we went to the police to tell them about it.

238
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:14,832
What kind of writing?

239
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,431
Something like a code.

240
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:19,432
A code?

241
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,131
What are you so happy about?

242
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:23,231
Someone died, you know.

243
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:25,032
Sorry.

244
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,232
And what was written?

245
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:30,531
According to Sonoko,

246
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:34,031
it was written in red by something similar to lipstick.

247
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:37,231
There were four alphabets written in small letters,

248
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:40,331
"t, e, i, u".

249
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:42,331
"Teiu?"

250
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:47,631
Yes. So Sonoko thinks the victim probably left a message.

251
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:49,031
It's not probably!

252
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:51,831
That is definitely a dying message!

253
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:56,132
The victim probably wanted to say "teiuka".

254
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,532
Sonoko.

255
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:03,332
It is so-called...

256
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:10,632
"The Teiuka Homicide."

257
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:16,931
What? The teiuka homicide?

258
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:19,031
Sonoko, quit fooling around.

259
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:21,131
I'm not fooling around!

260
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:23,931
A man called Miyama was killed

261
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:27,931
and on his window were the letters "teiu"!

262
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:30,531
"T, e, i, u".

263
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:33,431
With the letters "teiu", then it must be "teiuka"

264
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,431
that he wanted to leave as a message, right?

265
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:40,431
When we met Mr. Miyama on the beach,

266
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:43,131
he kept using the word "teiuka".

267
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:48,231
So whatever you say, it's the teiuka homicide.

268
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:54,731
Was the "I" in "teiu" is the alphabet "L"?

269
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:59,631
"L"? Well, maybe.

270
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:02,131
So what if it is?

271
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:03,931
And the fourth letter "u",

272
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:07,031
wasn't the length of the right side is a little shorter than the left?

273
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,032
What?

274
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,332
So I'm asking if it is the "shi" character in hiragana!

275
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:13,931
Now that you mentioned it,

276
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,231
it might have been that.

277
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:21,432
Think of the "shi" coming right after the alphabets "tel".

278
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:25,531
Tel... tel shi?

279
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:26,631
I get it!

280
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,931
"Please tel" it means "please call",

281
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:31,331
and he was trying to call for help.

282
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:34,131
I knew you could do it, Shinichi!

283
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,331
Yes, yes.

284
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:38,431
Your hubby is great. Very great.

285
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,031
He's not my hubby!

286
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,631
What are you saying, Sonoko?

287
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:44,531
Ran, your face are red!

288
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,331
In what situation was the man killed?

289
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:48,831
Oh, right.

290
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:50,931
According to the police,

291
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:53,131
he was lying on the floor bleeding from his head

292
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:55,931
near the window of the hotel.

293
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,332
He was hit by something hard from the back.

294
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:04,431
If he was trying to write "tel shite",

295
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:08,231
that guy probably wrote it with his own blood.

296
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:09,731
What?

297
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:11,531
The letters written in red, right?

298
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,431
And who found the body?

299
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:17,732
The three friends of Mr. Miyama who was killed.

300
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:23,331
If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Kano the classmate of Mr. Miyama,

301
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:26,431
Ms. Yanuma, Mr. Miyama's girlfriend,

302
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:30,032
and Mr. Bito, a colleague at a part-time job they both worked for.

303
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,731
Mr. Miyama and the three of them were planning to have dinner together.

304
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:36,231
So they went to his room to get him because he didn't come.

305
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:42,231
They found the door was unlocked and the window was broken.

306
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:45,331
Mr. Miyama was found on the floor near the window.

307
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,132
This is what they testified to the police.

308
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:49,832
The window was broken?

309
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:56,931
That's why the police say that the killer broke in from the window.

310
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:59,331
When Sonoko went to the police

311
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:02,131
to tell them about the letters that were written on the window,

312
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:06,731
they didn't find anything of that sort among the broken pieces of glass.

313
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:12,231
The letters "teiu" were not understandable so wouldn't believe us either.

314
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:15,131
So I told the police

315
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,831
that I'd bring the evidence to them!

316
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,831
Hey, Sonoko.

317
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,931
Do you really have the evidence?

318
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:24,231
Don't you remember that I sent it to you, Kudo?

319
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:25,831
What?

320
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:30,231
The special sexy shot of Ran that I took with my cell phone!

321
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:33,331
I noticed the red letters before I took the picture,

322
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:35,531
so it should be in the background of Ran's picture!

323
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,931
What do you mean by "should be"?

324
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:39,031
You haven't checked?

325
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:43,731
No. I thought I left my cell phone back at the hotel,

326
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:46,931
so we headed back from the police station to go get it.

327
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:50,731
But half way back, I realize that it was in my bag.

328
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,531
So we were heading back to the police station again

329
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,231
when I was unfortunately mugged

330
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:57,331
and my bag was taken.

331
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:59,831
I didn't want to be called a liar

332
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:05,531
so I told Ran to call you and ask you to send me back that picture!

333
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:06,731
Huh?

334
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,731
I told her that you probably erased it,

335
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,431
and that it would be no use to call you.

336
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:12,931
You erased it, right?

337
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:15,931
Yes, of course.

338
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,331
You see!

339
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:19,031
Really?

340
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,431
Anyway,

341
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:22,631
you know the meaning of the letters now,

342
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:24,631
so go tell the police about it.

343
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:28,231
Okay! I'll call if something comes up.

344
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:30,131
Okay.

345
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,931
That sexy shot... Did he really erased it?

346
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:37,931
Picture, picture.

347
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:38,932
Found it.

348
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,032
There's the red letters.

349
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,631
There's something written on the window just like Sonoko said.

350
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:50,631
The curtain is closed so it's not possible to look inside the room.

351
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:53,332
Only the letter "t" which is hidden behind Ran's hips is in view.

352
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:59,231
There's something written in red besides the "t".

353
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,231
Could it be a comma or a slip of the pen?

354
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:04,931
What a weird killer

355
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:07,831
if the dying message were to be "tel shite".

356
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,631
Some time after committing the murder,

357
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:11,131
he must've noticed the writing

358
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:14,931
and broke the window to retrieve the pieces with writings on them.

359
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,531
Even if it were to be an attempt to delay the discovery of the body,

360
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:19,731
breaking the window would risk attracting more attention

361
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:22,731
and hastening the discovery.

362
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:26,531
What are you looking at, Conan?

363
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,131
What?

364
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,831
What is it?

365
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:33,632
Hey! That's... It's a woman's nude, isn't it?

366
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:39,031
Conan, it might be against the law

367
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:41,731
if a grade schooler looks at a picture like that!

368
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:43,132
It's not.

369
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,631
It's just a spam mail.

370
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:50,731
When I accessed the site to the mail,

371
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,631
I just happened to get this picture.

372
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:56,931
By the way, were you guys able to decipher Doc's code?

373
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:59,331
No. Not at all.

374
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:01,531
No way!

375
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:03,931
If even you can't, how could we?

376
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:10,331
We borrowed the paper with the code "pill bug and a tent".

377
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:11,831
Pill bug...

378
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:13,631
I wonder if we'll really be able to find the site of the treasure

379
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:16,031
after deciphering this code?

380
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:17,831
If I were to choose,

381
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:22,231
I would rather have come here for the festival Dr. Agasa went to.

382
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,231
Festival?

383
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:28,931
Wasn't that festival called the Tento Festival?

384
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:29,932
What?

385
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,731
What did you just say?

386
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:35,531
You can see the shrine gate that lit up, right?

387
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:39,532
Doc said that it's a village festival and the float starts from there.

388
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:45,631
Then, is the "tent" in the code points to the Tento festival?

389
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:49,631
Even so, I still don't understand the pill bug part.

390
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:54,331
I still think it has something to do with the Marumushi Hot Spring.

391
00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:56,832
But that place was closed down.

392
00:21:57,832 --> 00:21:59,831
The entrance was closed

393
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:02,532
and no one answered our calls.

394
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:05,031
What is it?

395
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:09,131
Hey, look! Something's getting bright.

396
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:11,231
That's where...

397
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:13,632
Marumushi Hot Spring is located.

398
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,831
"Pill bug and tent..."

399
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,731
Does that mean to light it up?

400
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:21,831
That's it! That must be it!

401
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,631
I'm getting it.

402
00:22:23,632 --> 00:22:25,031
Okay!

403
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:26,932
Let's go!

404
00:23:57,532 --> 00:23:59,531
"Next Episode" -We give up, right?

405
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:02,931
You guys give up too easily.

406
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:06,031
First, all these codes are written only in Katakana.

407
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:10,231
Secondly, if you look closely, the letters are not balanced.

408
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:12,231
And thirdly,

409
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:14,432
the hint Dr and Haibara was talking about.

410
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:16,731
Wait a minute.

411
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:18,631
This is...

412
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,531
Darn it! I should've realized this earlier.

413
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:27,532
Next Conan, "Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 2)"

414
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:45,931
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:45,932 --> 00:24:47,631
"Back and front."

416
00:24:47,632 --> 00:24:49,331
Words that can be read from right to left!

417
00:24:49,332 --> 00:24:50,332
Deed.

418
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,332
-Great! -Ear.
