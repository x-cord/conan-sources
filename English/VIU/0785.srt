1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,708
"Tokiwa Hotel."

2
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:18,875
Come in.

3
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,774
Taiko Meijin, you'd better get going.

4
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,274
Please don't call me that.

5
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:29,274
I'm going to win that title today, you see.

6
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:32,874
But everybody already knows you as Taiko Meijin.

7
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:36,674
You've already won the Sextuple Crown!

8
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:39,474
You can't be too careful.

9
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:44,774
I've taken this Meijin match to a 3-3 tie,

10
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:50,874
but I barely beat the Meijin in yesterday's final game.

11
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:51,974
But last night,

12
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:53,974
the commentator was saying that you,

13
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:57,074
who won the Sextuple Crown, had the advantage because you beat his attack!

14
00:00:57,075 --> 00:01:00,974
That Meijin seemed to be thinking really hard over his sealed move!

15
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:02,175
Really?

16
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:05,974
Oh, a photo.

17
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,474
Your girlfriend?

18
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:09,575
Yes, sort of.

19
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,775
Yumi.

20
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,574
That shabby envelope?

21
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:18,974
"Two days ago" -I don't know where it is.

22
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,174
What?

23
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:24,574
Because you never called me at all after that, Chukichi.

24
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:28,074
I told you when I gave you that envelope, didn't I?

25
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:31,174
To please don't open it until I get a hold of all seven.

26
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,574
Yes, so I disposed of it without opening it.

27
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:36,274
Disposed of it?

28
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:39,675
I meant you to keep it with you till the time came and yet!

29
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:45,974
And so, what was so important that you called beautiful police officer Yumi

30
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:47,974
out on her day off?

31
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,874
What?

32
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:53,174
Well, I'm about to get a hold of all seven,

33
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:57,774
so I wanted to confirm if you had the envelope on you.

34
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:59,774
Is that it?

35
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:03,075
Yes. Well, for now.

36
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,774
-I'm leaving! -Yumi!

37
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:09,174
Hey, wait!

38
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:11,974
Taiko Meijin?

39
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:13,474
I thought so!

40
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:16,074
I'm a huge fan of yours!

41
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:18,174
If you don't mind, I'd like your autograph.

42
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:20,174
Thank you very much.

43
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:22,274
Huh?

44
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,675
Yumi?

45
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:28,475
Yumi!

46
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:33,374
Okay, game start.

47
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,075
Shukichi Haneda.

48
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,474
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

49
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:43,874
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

50
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,574
A ruthless blackmail declaring abduction.

51
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,574
There is a lapse in both Shogi and the case.

52
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,074
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:50,874
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,175
His name is Detective Conan!

55
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:37,700
"Taiko's Meijin Match of Love (Part 1)"

56
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:43,123
It's about time.

57
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,723
About time?

58
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:46,023
For what?

59
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:49,023
Well, you saw him once before too, didn't you?

60
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:53,423
Time for Taiko Meijin's, Shukichi Haneda's Meijin match to start.

61
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:54,623
It seems that currently,

62
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:57,423
the only title he doesn't have is Meijin, though.

63
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:00,423
So he's the winner of the Sextuple Crown.

64
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:03,923
Is that like the Triple Crown in baseball?

65
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:06,923
Yeah. If he regains the Meijin title today,

66
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,323
he'll be the winner of the Septuple Crown!

67
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:10,923
He'll be the second person to achieve it in the history of mankind.

68
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:15,223
Then, maybe the seven that Yumi was referring to before is...

69
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:16,923
About that?

70
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:18,823
Yeah, most likely.

71
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:21,123
Now that he'll have all seven,

72
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:24,323
she gets to look inside the envelope!

73
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,123
I wonder what's inside.

74
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:31,923
Well, the most likely would be a marriage certificate.

75
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:34,723
Which means Yumi's getting married?

76
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:37,723
That's amazing!

77
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:40,624
But we don't know that for sure yet.

78
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:45,223
Yes, hello?

79
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:48,023
Hey, Conan, howzit?

80
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:50,323
Sera... I mean, Masumi?

81
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,023
What's up?

82
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:55,623
I moved to a new hotel, you see.

83
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:58,623
I was wondering if you wanted to come visit.

84
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,423
I'm at Hotel Hyde Pride!

85
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:03,123
It's pretty close from the detective agency, you know.

86
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:06,524
I can't. Because I'm on the move by car now.

87
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:10,523
Another case or something?

88
00:06:10,524 --> 00:06:14,023
No, we're going around visiting power spots.

89
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:17,223
Taiko Meijin! Taiko Meijin!

90
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,323
Taiko Meijin!

91
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:21,823
Haven't I told you? I'm not a Meijin yet,

92
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:24,223
and I'll have to go because the match will start already.

93
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:26,923
But I was told to give you this just before the match

94
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:29,023
is about to re-start on the second day.

95
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:31,623
A letter?

96
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,323
A strange man brought this yesterday morning.

97
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:37,123
He said that you'd take it

98
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:39,323
if I showed you the name of the sender.

99
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:41,124
"Yumi Miyamoto" -From Yumi?

100
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,524
But why would she send me a letter?

101
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,724
I shall reveal the sealed move.

102
00:06:57,024 --> 00:07:00,624
The sealed move is 5-6 silver.

103
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:16,824
I need to think.

104
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:24,724
Sextuple Crown Haneda!

105
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:28,723
Where are you going?

106
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:30,524
Sextuple Crown Haneda!

107
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:34,023
-Tokyo, please. -Huh?

108
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:36,024
What?

109
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:44,523
I have your girlfriend.

110
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:48,023
If you want to save her, read my game record and decipher it.

111
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:51,023
I will wait until your clock time runs out.

112
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:54,523
Tell no one, and of course, not the police.

113
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,624
Signed, the Headless Shogi Player.

114
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,123
First game.

115
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:03,323
One of the seven shrines is attacked by thieves

116
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:05,523
and the sanctuary is emptied on the second day.

117
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:06,923
The priest's daughter who is hiding in the well

118
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:09,823
is kidnapped as well.

119
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,124
Photo enclosed.

120
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:19,024
Yu... Yumi.

121
00:08:22,624 --> 00:08:24,623
I used 4 hours and 2 minutes

122
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:27,223
in the final game of the first day.

123
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,623
Even with the hour I took for lunch,

124
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:32,623
I have less than 6 hours!

125
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:35,423
I'm sorry that all I do is make you wait all the time.

126
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,623
But I promise...

127
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:41,624
I promise I'll go to get you. So hang on, okay?

128
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:54,523
I'm sure this is the place.

129
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:57,524
But where is it? The well in question?

130
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:00,823
There's only 4 hours and 10 minutes to go.

131
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:04,123
I've got to find the well in question by then or...

132
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:06,623
Taiko Meijin?

133
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,523
You... you're...

134
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:12,123
What's the matter? Today's your Meijin match, isn't it?

135
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:15,023
Oh, well, the thing is...

136
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:17,523
"Tell no one."

137
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,823
I just thought I'd get some fresh air.

138
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:23,623
But your match

139
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:26,723
is supposed to be at a hotel in Yamanashi Prefecture, right?

140
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:31,523
Yes, so I used 2 hours to get here to ask God for help.

141
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:34,123
Wow! It's Taiko Meijin!

142
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,623
Can I have your autograph?

143
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:39,423
-What... Hey... -Autograph, please!

144
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:42,623
Isn't that Taiko Meijin?

145
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,223
No joke? I'm a huge fan of his.

146
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,923
It can't be him.

147
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:49,223
The Meijin match is today, you know.

148
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:53,123
Oh, just a look alike.

149
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:56,023
See? This way, no matter who's watching you,

150
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,523
he'll just think that a fan called out to you.

151
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,023
And because there's no way

152
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,223
you'd be in a place like this on the day of your match,

153
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:05,323
everybody would just take you as being a look alike, right?

154
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:07,723
True.

155
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,623
Then, will you please tell me what's going on

156
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:10,923
while pretending to give me your autograph?

157
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:14,123
What did you really come here for?

158
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:15,523
Okay.

159
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:18,223
-No way! -Yumi was kidnapped?

160
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,024
No joke?

161
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:24,723
I tell you, these guys...

162
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,723
And did you find anything at the well?

163
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:31,523
No. See, I can't find the well.

164
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:35,023
I mean, do you know where this well is?

165
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:39,423
Yes. In this shrine, that's the only well there is.

166
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:43,223
We just went there, you see.

167
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:48,423
It's said to be a power spot that brings you good luck.

168
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:52,724
"3 hours and 58 minutes left for Shukichi Haneda."

169
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:00,023
The famous well in this shrine

170
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,923
is this well that is said to have been dug by Kiyomasa Kato,

171
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:05,423
Kiyomasa's well.

172
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:08,823
Kiyomasa served Hideyoshi!

173
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:11,523
He was a valorous warrior

174
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:14,623
and also a master castle builder who built the Kumamoto Castle!

175
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:17,823
I heard he even beat a tiger!

176
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,223
And a TV star who used that photo of Kiyomasa's well

177
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:24,023
as the stand by screen for her cell phone,

178
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,723
suddenly became popular,

179
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:29,423
so now it's known as a power spot for good luck.

180
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:33,323
But Taiko refers to Hideyoshi Toyotomi, right?

181
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:35,123
How come you're called Taiko Meijin

182
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:37,623
and yet know anything about it?

183
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:39,423
How come you don't know?

184
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:42,523
Well, Taiko is my nickname, you see.

185
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:45,623
But I don't get it.

186
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:49,923
How do you know that this sentence indicates this shrine?

187
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:53,623
One of the shrines was attacked by thieves,

188
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:56,423
and the sanctuary is emptied on the second day.

189
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,423
The priest's daughter who hid in the well

190
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:01,423
is kidnapped as well.

191
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:05,523
Seven refers to the seven major shogi titles.

192
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:13,523
Meijin, Ryuo, Kio, Osho, Oza, Kisei and Oui.

193
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,423
In the first letter,

194
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:18,623
the perp called himself the Headless Shogi Player,

195
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:22,023
and said to decipher his game record.

196
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:24,323
Shogi was originally not about sogyoku,

197
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:27,323
capturing your opponent's king but rather, about gyoku,

198
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:30,723
stealing his treasure.

199
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:34,123
Which means, since the sanctuary was emptied,

200
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,923
the treasure, in other words the king disappeared.

201
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,523
Of the seven major titles,

202
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,223
the ones without the character "ou" (king)

203
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,623
are the Meijin and Kisei Match.

204
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:45,623
If it took two days for the treasure to disappear,

205
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:47,323
then it must be one of the matches played across two days.

206
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:52,923
The Meijin Match, Ryuo Match, Oui Match, or Osho Match.

207
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:54,423
The only one without the character "ou" (king) in it

208
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:57,523
that is played across two days is the Meijin Match!

209
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:01,123
In other words, it points to the shrine with the name "Meijin" in it.

210
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:03,923
So, it's the Meiji Shrine.

211
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:06,023
That's why you slipped away from the match

212
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:09,923
and rushed over here, right? Taiko Meijin?

213
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:11,123
Yeah.

214
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,023
Since the priest's daughter who was hiding in the well was kidnapped,

215
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,323
I figured that I could find a clue to Yumi's abduction

216
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:21,023
near the well of this shrine too.

217
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:26,023
It says here that the perp will wait till your time's up,

218
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:28,123
but how much longer is that?

219
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:31,023
About 3 hours and 50 minutes.

220
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:34,823
So, the time limit's about 3:00 in the afternoon.

221
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:37,723
There's no time to lose.

222
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:40,223
Let's go back to Kiyomasa's well!

223
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:43,123
-Okay! -Okay!

224
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:45,123
But if there's a long line,

225
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,623
I'd better go there alone.

226
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:51,223
Don't worry. It was popular some time ago.

227
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:54,923
Kiyomasa and Taiko both loved festivals and shogi.

228
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:58,023
If we go together, we may get lucky.

229
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:00,623
It seems that the real Taiko

230
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:05,023
wasn't as strong as you are, though.

231
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:08,923
What? Sextuple Crown Haneda went on a cab to Tokyo?

232
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,923
Is... is that true?

233
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:12,523
And? Where in Tokyo?

234
00:14:12,524 --> 00:14:15,923
I don't know. I've been calling his cell phone repeatedly

235
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,123
but I'm getting no response what so ever.

236
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,723
He doesn't have it.

237
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:23,223
There's an unspoken rule

238
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:27,523
forbidding the usage of cell phones during a match.

239
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:30,923
The cell phone is like a mini computer.

240
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:32,123
In this day and age,

241
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:34,823
you can look up various moves, you see.

242
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:37,523
I don't know what came upon him,

243
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:41,823
but he left saying, "I need to think".

244
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:47,524
So, he hasn't thrown in the towel to me, Meijin Chikara Katsumasa yet.

245
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:51,823
Let's wait for the man attempting to defeat me,

246
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,824
take all seven titles and become a living god.

247
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:59,223
The line's pretty long!

248
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:01,423
There are more people there than there was a while ago.

249
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:05,023
It seems we have to wait a while before getting to the well.

250
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:08,823
I'm sorry, you guys. For getting you involved.

251
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,023
I'm really hopeless.

252
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:12,623
There's no waiting in shogi

253
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:15,023
and yet all I do is make her wait.

254
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:18,123
It was that way from the first time I met Yumi.

255
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:19,723
What're you talking about?

256
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:22,623
Is it about how you got to know Yumi?

257
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,323
Tell us, tell us!

258
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:29,123
You guys, Yumi's been kidnapped, you know.

259
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:32,623
Maybe it's a good way to kill time while waiting, though.

260
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:34,423
Will you tell us about it?

261
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:38,523
Yeah. It was about ten years ago.

262
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:40,223
I'd just finished my ranking match

263
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:43,623
and was riding the Tohto Loop Line.

264
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:46,423
The match left such a bad aftertaste

265
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:48,923
that I was mentally totally exhausted.

266
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:50,223
When I got up...

267
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:53,424
Hey, mister. Hey, you.

268
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:58,923
I... I'm sorry! Did I fall asleep?

269
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,723
Yes. Drooling on my shoulder, too.

270
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,823
Drooled...

271
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:06,923
-Never mind that. -Huh?

272
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,323
Hurry and get off!

273
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,623
You're getting off here, aren't you?

274
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:14,023
Yes. But how did you know?

275
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:16,024
You're holding a ticket, aren't you?

276
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:24,123
See you, since I'm going this way.

277
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,424
Thank you so very much!

278
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,723
Inner loop?

279
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:33,124
The train she just got on was outer loop, wasn't it?

280
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:36,923
Miwako?

281
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:40,123
-I'm sorry, I dozed off in the train, -It... it can't be.

282
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,523
so I over rode five or six stations.

283
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:45,423
I'm going to go back on the inner loop train now.

284
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:47,423
So go on ahead to the karaoke box.

285
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,923
-You waited for me? -What?

286
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:54,523
You stayed on the train and didn't get off at your station.

287
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:58,623
You mean you waited for me to get up?

288
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:03,923
Yes. Because you looked so cute sleeping.

289
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:07,823
Well, I guess it sounds just like a mere sappy story to you.

290
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:11,123
For me, who lives in the shogi world of no waiting,

291
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:14,524
her smile back then was...

292
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:17,523
Yumi...

293
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19,123
She's a nice person.

294
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,723
I was touched.

295
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:24,323
You've got to rescue Yumi no matter what!

296
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:26,523
In the name of your Meijin title!

297
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:29,523
A Meijin is not supposed to lose!

298
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:33,524
So like I was saying, I... I'm not a Meijin.

299
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:38,324
We're next.

300
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:43,423
Keep your hands out of the well.

301
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:45,223
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

302
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:48,724
Which means it's somewhere around the well.

303
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:52,824
There's something among the pebbles.

304
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:56,423
This is...

305
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:58,123
the lance!

306
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:02,023
Is that the clue that the perp left behind?

307
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,223
Yeah.

308
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:06,923
Because "Second game" is carved on the bottom of the piece.

309
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:10,123
Does the word lancer ring a bell?

310
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,324
No, not really.

311
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:15,223
Look! On the back of the piece,

312
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,823
there's a weird looking diagram.

313
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:17,924
Diagram?

314
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:22,724
This is...

315
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:29,323
So, it's check. Shukichi Haneda.

316
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:32,623
You've got no choice but to take my promoted pawn.

317
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:37,223
If you do, my captured rook

318
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:38,623
will shatter your offense

319
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:41,123
and your tactical formation will totally collapse.

320
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:44,623
My victory is definite.

321
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,224
This was determined to begin with...

322
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:52,624
since ten years ago.

323
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:59,423
Doesn't this sort of look like a face?

324
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:01,923
A... a face ace?

325
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:04,523
See! Like this.

326
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,323
Maybe.

327
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:09,523
Right? Maybe it's the face of the perp?

328
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,123
It can't be!

329
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:12,623
It seems the meaning of the figures

330
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:15,623
inside the circles have to be deciphered first.

331
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:17,523
Seven and three.

332
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,323
The seven maybe stands for the seven titles,

333
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,324
but what about the three?

334
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,723
The only thing that comes to mind

335
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:25,323
is the third level professional league.

336
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:27,023
It's from Officer Sato.

337
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:29,623
Officer?

338
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:31,223
Hello, Conan?

339
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:34,923
Sato here. Do you have any idea where Yumi is?

340
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,123
She missed work two days in a row without calling in,

341
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:38,723
and hasn't been home either.

342
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:40,623
She's not answering her cell phone too.

343
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:41,923
You wouldn't know, would you?

344
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,423
"Don't contact the police."

345
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:45,423
Hello, Conan?

346
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:48,923
I know! We're looking for her too now.

347
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,323
What?

348
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,423
Yumi says that the night before yesterday,

349
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,523
she got drunk and caught a cab,

350
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:56,523
then was dropped off in an unfamiliar town.

351
00:19:56,524 --> 00:20:00,423
She lost her cell phone and wallet too,

352
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:02,323
so she called me from a pay phone

353
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:05,723
with the coins she had in her pocket.

354
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:09,223
But she seems to have run out of coins part way through the call.

355
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:12,523
You mean she's wandering around in some town for two days?

356
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:17,723
Well, I'm sure that Yumi will find a way to contact us, though.

357
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:19,723
I think you should have

358
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:22,623
the mini patrol car on standby for when that time comes.

359
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:25,523
I guess so! Okay!

360
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,523
So, do you think you can do that?

361
00:20:27,524 --> 00:20:30,823
Oh, yes, ma'am. I'll go talk to my superiors.

362
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:32,323
I'm counting on you, then.

363
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:33,523
Sure thing!

364
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,723
That Yumi...

365
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:39,223
Yumi should just go to a police box.

366
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:43,123
So, dispatching the police car's all done.

367
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:46,023
All we need to do now is decipher this code.

368
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:49,223
I don't understand what the seven and three stands for.

369
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:52,523
Isn't there another meaning to lance?

370
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:56,123
It's supposed to be a sort of lucky blessing for safe births.

371
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,323
I hear that in the past that's what they used

372
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,123
to call the whiz of the red-light districts.

373
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,023
What's a red-light district?

374
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:03,323
A fun place?

375
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:06,823
It sounds kind of morally questionable.

376
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:08,523
Oh, well...

377
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:12,823
And why is the lance the whiz of the red-light district?

378
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:15,123
I... I'm not all that sure,

379
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:18,523
the lance is sometimes referred to as the spear too.

380
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:20,823
You mean the one that's used as a weapon?

381
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:23,723
The spear and lance that are used in games.

382
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:25,723
But why are they called that?

383
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:29,823
That's because the lance moves straight all the way.

384
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:32,224
Just like a spear.

385
00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:38,623
Wait a sec. Wasn't Kiyomasa Kato...

386
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:41,324
If so, the seven and three are...

387
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:45,923
I see.

388
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:48,423
I see the picture now!

389
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:52,123
Oh, you both look like you've figured it out.

390
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:56,324
But I hope you're telling us what the answer is too.

391
00:21:57,224 --> 00:22:00,523
Doc, bring the car to the entrance, will you?

392
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:01,924
Okay.

393
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:07,223
We'll tell when we get there if you want to know.

394
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:11,623
It's in the middle of a hill with a terrifying name though.

395
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:13,724
Are you sure you guys want to come too?

396
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:23,424
"3 hours and 4 minutes left for Shukichi Haneda."

397
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:45,623
"Next Episode."

398
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,223
Yuureizaka? (Ghost Hill)

399
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,223
This move will fork his king and silver general.

400
00:23:51,224 --> 00:23:53,323
Yes...

401
00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:55,023
The victorious 4-8 rook!

402
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:57,123
The pieces on this board...

403
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:59,123
Indicate the seven!

404
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:01,923
Judging from the position of this rook...

405
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:05,723
The place that Yumi is being confined is probably...

406
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,224
To the car. Hurry!

407
00:24:08,224 --> 00:24:09,523
Next Conan,

408
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:13,424
"Taiko Meijin's Match of Love (Part 2)"
