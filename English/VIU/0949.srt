if this doesn't get picked up first.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,319
I hope they decide to use it.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,420
Just kidding.

Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

13

Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,019
It all begins with a letter with dancing characters!

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,219
A suspicious contribution makes huge waves!

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,719
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,519
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

His name is Detective Conan!

"The Radio Questions and Concerns Show (Challenge Arc)"

20
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,948
I've visited Nichiuri TV several times,

21
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:54,648
but this is the first invitation I've received from Nichiuri Radio.

22
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:58,048
I'm Manda, the world's greatest producer.

23
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:01,448
What? The best in the world?

24
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,748
"Teruomi Manda (40), Nichiuri TV and Radio Production Unit Producer."

25
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,648
Oh, please. I can't believe you took me seriously, Mr. Mouri.

26
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:07,548
It's a joke.

27
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:08,549
I'm actually only the second greatest

28
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,948
-in the world. -What's with this guy?

29
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:15,548
And this is the world's greatest director, Kujirai.

"Kaede Yashiro (32)" -I'm broadcast writer, Kaede Yashiro.

Thank you for coming today.

39
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,348
No, thank you.

40
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,348
So, Mr. Mouri, you got any alcohol in your system?

41
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,748
Alcohol?

42
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,948
No, of course not.

43
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,448
What?

44
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:52,148
World's greatest AD, Abe,

45
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,548

47
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,948
-Got it. -Hold on. Are you sure?

48
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,048
We're about to start.

49
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,648
What? But isn't it true?

50
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,948
They said Mr. Mouri performs better

51
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:06,749
when he's had a drink or two.

52
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,748
I suppose they're not wrong.

53
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,548
Then it's decided.

54
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,748
Mr. Mouri, we'll be heading into the studio now.

55
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:20,348
We'll see you later.

56
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:21,549
All right.

57
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,448
Is that producer guy, Mr. Manda, always like that?

58
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,348
I guess so.

59
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,748
Really?

60
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:33,848
Anyway, what would you like to drink?

61
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,749
"On Air."

62
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:44,248
Today's concern comes from TM of Tokyo.

63
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:46,648
"I don't know what to do about the crazy woman"

64
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,148
"who is living in the apartment directly above mine."

65
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:52,048
"She's definitely noisy and she throws cigarette butts"

66
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,248
"and empty cans onto my balcony."

67
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:57,548
"I have no idea what to do."

68
00:04:57,549 --> 00:05:01,548
I see. This is a truly pressing concern.

69
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:03,348
Today's guest, Mr. Mouri,

70
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:06,148
what advice do you have as a detective?

71
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,748
It makes you angry because you think of her as human.

72
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:13,248
That obnoxious woman is nothing more than trash!

73
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:14,349
What?

74
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,648
I don't think it's right to treat people like garbage...

75
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:24,348
TM, you should give her a taste of her own medicine!

76
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,248
Throw trash back onto her balcony!

77
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,448
Burnable trash, non-burnable trash!

78
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,748
Even your food scraps!

79
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,348
Mr. Mouri really is the best.

80
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,148
I told you this would happen!

81
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:38,748
What are we supposed to do now?

82
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,748
"Mr. Mouri, you're the best!" -Throw your extra large trash!

83
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,248
Play the jingle!

84
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:43,249
"Jingle."

85
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,949
He's still going!

86
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,449
"Detective Mouri's comments is truly nice."

87
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,749
"The curtains are now rising on my plan."

88
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,348
"Several hours later."

89
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:03,648
Answer the door, you witch!

90
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:05,648
What's all this about?

91
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,648
I could ask you the same thing!

92
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,548
"Kumi Kijima (38)" -You're the one who picked a fight with me!

93
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:12,048
You trash talked me on the radio!

94
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:14,948
"Towako Manda (31)" -What? I don't know what you're talking about.

95
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:16,648
It must've been someone else.

96
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,448
Don't play dumb!

97
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,348
Hey, stop!

98
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,248
I can't believe you used the radio!

99
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,648
That hurts!

100
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,448
They don't even know they're being manipulated.

101
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,049
It's all going exactly according to plan.

102
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,848
You'll pay for this!

103
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,948
Don't think you'll get way with it!

104
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:37,549
Move out of here already, you nuisance!

105
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,148
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Yes, Inspector.

106
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:52,248
I did appear on a radio show yesterday.

107
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:53,748
What about it?

108
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:57,048
I told you, I've got nothing to do with it!

109
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,948
Just come to Nichiuri TV.

110
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,548
You're a witness.

111
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:03,348
A witness?

112
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:04,748
Witness to what?

113
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:06,848
A murder case!

114
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,949
What? A murder case?

115
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:12,549
Hurry.

116
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,348
The victim is Towako Manda, 31 years old,

117
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:27,948
a resident of a nearby apartment building.

118
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:34,148
She was killed late last night around 12 am.

119
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,948
She must've been struck with this metal pipe.

120
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,048
It hurts!

121
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:40,848
We didn't find any fingerprints on the weapon,

122
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,848
and there wasn't any blood at the crime scene.

123
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:45,248
I see.

124
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:48,048
So, why am I a witness?

125
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:49,848
Because the murderer's motive

126
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:53,548
may have had something to do with the radio show you appeared on.

127
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:57,648
What? How is that radio show the motive?

128
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:02,048
Yesterday evening, the victim and Mrs. Kumi Kijima,

129
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:07,448
who lives above her, argued about the show.

130
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,848
The listener's concern was about

131
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:12,148
the obnoxious behavior of the woman

132
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,148
who lived above her.

133
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:18,448
I believe the listener's name was TM.

134
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:19,548
TM?

135
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:24,348
Those are the same initials as the victim, Towako Manda's.

136
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,449
I see. Then the obnoxious woman must be...

137
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,048
Of course I'm angry!

138
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,348
When I came home from work yesterday,

139
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,848
I found a note in my mailbox.

140
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,949
"Nuisance" -and a recording of the radio show.

141
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,848
It makes you angry because you think of her as human.

142
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:48,249
That obnoxious woman is nothing more than trash!

143
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,848
So I went to yell at her!

144
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,548
Pops, you said those cruel things?

145
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:56,749
Well, you know...

146
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:03,148
Well... I have no excuse.

147
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:06,648
I had a little too much of the drink I was offered.

148
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,348
I'm sorry!

149
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:12,149
No... It's not your fault.

150
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:18,648
Anyway, the building manager intervened

151
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,948
and was able to calm things down.

152
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:22,548
You'll pay for this!

153
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:24,648
Don't think you'll get way with it!

154
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,448
Move out of here already, you nuisance!

155
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:33,248
What? Then you did invite the victim out later that night...

156
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,448
I told you, I didn't do it.

157
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,949
Now...

158
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:42,948
But immediately after the victim wrote in about her concern.

159
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,348
It's not that simple, Mouri.

160
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:48,648
Ms. Yashiro.

161
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,848
Yes.

162
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:56,048
The listener, TM, isn't the victim, Towako Manda.

163
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,348
What?

164
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:01,049
It's someone completely different named Tsugumi Mourikawa.

165
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:05,148
But you received a CD recording of the show

166
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,248
in your mailbox, right?

167
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:09,748
That's it.

168
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:13,448
Towako Manda, who happened to share the same concern,

169
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:16,048
heard the show on the radio

170
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,848
and recorded it onto a CD.

171
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:23,048
She put it in Mrs. Kijima's mailbox out of spite.

172
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,048
When Mrs. Kijima heard it,

173
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,748
she thought it was about her.

174
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:29,248
I told you...

175
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:30,648
But, Mouri,

176
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:35,248
it wasn't the victim who put the CD in her mailbox.

177
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:37,748
-What? -What?

178
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:41,549
I'm having Takagi look into it right now.

179
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:47,748
Isn't this case a little too convenient for someone?

180
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:51,948
It may be a coincidence but the victim is the victim.

181
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:53,248
What do you mean?

182
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,348
We learned this when we arrived,

183
00:10:55,349 --> 00:11:01,048
but the victim Towako Manda is the wife of Producer Manda.

184
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:02,348
They're currently separated.

185
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:03,548
Your wife?

186
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:07,048
Oh, but don't worry about it, Mr. Mouri.

187
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,149
I was going to divorce that thing.

188
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:16,348
But your wife was firmly against divorce, wasn't she?

189
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:18,148
What does that have to do with this case?

190
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,448
But since your wife is gone,

191
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,648
that means your wish came true, right?

192
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,748
Oh, please.

193
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:28,648
Don't say such strange things, Kujirai and Nino.

194
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,948
The conversation's gone in a strange direction.

195
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:35,548
Yeah. It sounds like he's grateful for what the culprit did.

196
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,848
I told you, it wasn't me!

197
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,748
I did harass her a little.

198
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:44,548
She kept boasting about being a rising artist.

199
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:47,948
She was a rising artist?

200
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,948
It seems that way.

201
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,748
But that has nothing to do with this case.

202
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:57,748
Yes, but if the divorce proceedings weren't going well...

203
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,448
Mr. Mouri, you too?

204
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:02,448
You're making it sound like

205
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,848
I'm somehow involved in her murder.

206
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:06,949
Right?

207
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:10,548
Oh, please.

208
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,248
Yes?

209
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:13,748
Thank you.

210
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:17,448
I see. Right away.

211
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:21,648
Excuse me. There's a meeting scheduled in this room.

212
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:24,349
Understood. We'll move.

213
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:32,048
Inspector, there's a job I have to check on.

214
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,548
That should be fine.

215
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:34,748
Excuse me.

216
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:36,248
Thanks for doing this.

217
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:37,449
Sure thing.

218
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:41,348
Inspector Megure.

219
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:43,348
How did it go, Takagi?

220
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:45,849
Yes, sir. About that...

221
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,048
I knew it.

222
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:52,948
Mr. Manda, this is the CD we were just discussing.

223
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:54,548
You're the one who put this

224
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,648
in Mrs. Kijima's mailbox, weren't you?

225
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:58,749
What?

226
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:07,949
"Just as planned."

227
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,757
Our investigation revealed that

228
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:19,957
this CD wasn't a recording of the broadcast

229
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,357
but copied directly from the source.

230
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:27,757
Some of the station staff claim that yesterday afternoon.

231
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:33,357
Mr. Manda asked them to create a copy.

232
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:37,157
Naturally, he told them not to tell anyone.

233
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:38,657
I wonder why.

234
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:40,957
Then you disappeared from the station

235
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,257
for about two hours.

236
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:45,357
During that time, are you sure you didn't go to the apartment

237
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:50,258
and put the CD in Mrs. Kijima's mailbox?

238
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:53,357
It certainly seems that way.

239
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:55,957
I knew it was you!

240
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,557
Mr. Manda.

241
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:59,157
During the review meeting

242
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:01,957
after yesterday's broadcast,

243
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,757
someone said they wished

244
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:06,757
the woman living above my wife

245
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:09,957
to listen to today's show.

246
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,757
I'd told everyone that she was frustrated

247
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:15,157
with the obnoxious woman living above her.

248
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:18,257
That's when I realized something interesting might happen

249
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:22,958
if I made it seem like she'd complained about her.

250
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,758
You've gotta strike when the iron's hot.

251
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:34,657
"Now the whole world's laughing at you."

252
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:35,658
"Nuisance."

253
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:41,157
And just as you planned, your wife was killed.

254
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:42,257
What?

255
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:45,557
That's how he made someone else do the killing.

256
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:48,457
Manipulating another so he wouldn't get his own hands dirty!

257
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,757
No!

258
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:53,157
I just wanted her to suffer a little.

259
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,557
I never thought she'd be killed for it.

260
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,457
I'm...

261
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,858
I'm sorry!

262
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,857
Even if it wasn't deliberate,

263
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:09,557
you're still responsible for causing a murder.

264
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:13,157
All I did was go and yell at her!

265
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:15,657
Mr. Mouri, I have a request.

266
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:19,857
Please prove Mrs. Kumi Kijima's innocence.

267
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,357
What?

268
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:22,657
-Yashiro. -Yashiro.

269
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:25,857
You believe me?

270
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,958
It's for Mr. Manda, actually.

271
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:33,057
If he caused the murder,

272
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:36,057
then Mr. Manda will be held responsible too.

273
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:37,957
I can't let that happen.

274
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,957
He's very important to me.

275
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,057
I owe him everything.

276
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:45,057
You owe Mr. Manda everything?

277
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:50,857
I debuted as a broadcast writer with a radio drama.

278
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:55,858
He looked through the script I brought in as a total amateur.

279
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,958
Yashiro, you're lucky you got to deal with me.

280
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:08,657
Mr. Manda, who was a director at the time,

281
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:11,557
took it upon myself to put my show on the radio.

282
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:14,458
So you owe him for helping you debut.

283
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:19,657
We never worked together after that,

284
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:20,957
but one month ago,

285
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,757
he returned as the producer of "The Until Noon Show",

286
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:27,657
and we were finally reunited.

287
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:28,957
I see.

288
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,057
You want to save the man who helped you.

289
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,557
It's true that if she's innocent,

290
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:37,457
then Mr. Manda won't be held responsible.

291
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:41,857
You gotta save me, Mr. Mouri!

292
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:43,757
Mr. Mouri, please! Save me!

293
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:48,257
Inspector, does Mrs. Kumi Kijima have an alibi?

294
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,157
Every Friday she goes bar-hopping.

295
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:52,957
She said that's what she was doing last night.

296
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,257
It's true!

297
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:56,658
I see.

298
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,357
Hello, this is Megure.

299
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:02,757
Yes.

300
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,658
What? You found someone?

301
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,257
Got it.

302
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:11,258
Thank you.

303
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:15,457
Mrs. Kijima's alibi has been verified.

304
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,957
See?

305
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:21,257
An employee said she was drinking there last night

306
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,858
from around 11 pm until past midnight.

307
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:26,758
Which means...

308
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:32,557
I told you I didn't kill her from the start!

309
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,857
In other words, what I did

310
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:41,158
had absolutely nothing at all to do with her murder.

311
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:44,857
That's great news, Mr. Manda.

312
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:48,058
I've got the God of Radio on my side.

313
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:52,157
But then who's the culprit?

314
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,958
Who knows?

315
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,757
In any case, now that we know our program

316
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:00,857
had nothing to do with the case,

317
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,757
we can get out of here.

318
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:05,557
Before that, Mr. Manda.

319
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:08,257
Where were you last night?

320
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:09,657
Me?

321
00:18:09,658 --> 00:18:12,257
I went drinking with these guys.

322
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,557
But I suddenly felt tired,

323
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,658
so I went home and went to bed.

324
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:20,657
In other words, you were home alone?

325
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:23,157
What about it?

326
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:25,857
It's ironic,

327
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,457
but now that our prime suspect, Mrs. Kumi Kijima,

328
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,357
has been proven innocent...

329
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:33,757
We're forced to consider who stands

330
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:36,357
to benefit the most

331
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:40,157
from the death of Towako Manda.

332
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:43,357
It's the end of the line, Mr. Manda.

333
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,857
You killed your wife

334
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,557
and put that CD in Mrs. Kumi Kijima's mailbox

335
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,157
so it would look like she did it.

336
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:56,657
You made the police believe she had a motive.

337
00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:59,557
What are you talking about, Nino?

338
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:01,157
Mr. Inuyama.

339
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:04,257
We're also considering the possibility.

340
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:06,657
Mr. Inuyama just mentioned.

341
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:08,357
But if that's true,

342
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:11,857
then wouldn't he have done something to disprove Mrs. Kijima's alibi?

343
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:15,057
Normally, yes, but...

344
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:17,757
It happened in the middle of the night.

345
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,157
He probably assumed she'd be unable

346
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,857
to prove her alibi

347
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:25,457
even if he didn't do anything.

348
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,057
After all, Mr. Manda's all talk.

349
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:30,357
Mr. Kujirai, why?

350
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,157
I've been wondering.

351
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:35,357
Do Mr. Inuyama and Mr. Kujirai

352
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,957
not get along with Mr. Manda?

353
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,957
I'm sure there's a lot going on between them.

354
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,057
I know all about you, Mr. Manda.

355
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,757
You're secretly scheming to prevent me

356
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:48,957
from becoming independent.

357
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,657
Well, you know, the station has its reasons.

358
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,957
You don't love radio!

359
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,657
You never have.

360
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,757
You only think of your programs as tools

361
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:00,257
to make yourself rich.

362
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:02,258
You misappropriate them for your personal use!

363
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:06,257
That has nothing to do with this.

364
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,657
You're right.

365
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:08,957
Why don't you tell us all about it

366
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,857
at the station

367
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:12,457
where there won't be any outsiders?

368
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,458
The station?

369
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:20,157
I've told you last night I was sound asleep at my home!

370
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:21,957
You gotta believe me!

371
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,457
"He's been sent to hell!"

372
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,757
"That darn man!"

373
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:30,957
He has motive and no alibi,

374
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,657
and it's true that he tried to have the obnoxious woman

375
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:36,357
living above her wife attack her.

376
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:38,857
Yeah, but...

377
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:41,557
Isn't this a premeditated murder?

378
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:43,557
Could Mr. Manda really have come up with this

379
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:46,057
if he's all talk?

380
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:50,357
He was just that desperate to divorce his wife.

381
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:51,557
Mr. Okada.

382
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:54,157
Thank you for the other day.

383
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:57,957
Hey, Abe. How did it go?

384
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,057
Hey, Ms. Yashiro.

385
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,557
Those two seem to really hate Mr. Manda.

386
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,957
-What? -Are you saying one of them did it

387
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,757
and is trying to frame Mr. Manda?

388
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:15,557
I just thought it might be a possibility.

389
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,058
You're right.

390
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,757
That's not possible.

391
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:31,057
It's true that they don't get along with Mr. Manda,

392
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,057
but I can't believe they'd kill his wife

393
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,357
just to get at him.

394
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:36,957
Right?

395
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,657
See, you brat?

396
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:42,057
But they hate him so much.

397
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:44,057
I'm kind of hungry.

398
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:45,657
I should get something to eat.

399
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:48,458
Listen to me!

400
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:57,458
-Man, I'm hungry. -Pops!

401
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:05,458
"Even if the boy suspects something, it's too late."

402
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:11,558
"Everything has gone according to plan."

403
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:16,458
It has ended in my victory!

404
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,458
"To be continued."

405
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:45,657
"Next Episode."

406
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,857
Isn't this...

407
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,457
"Radio drama" "He Disappeared Without Saying Goodbye."

408
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:53,557
Inspector, about the case of Towako Manda's murder

409
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:59,157
by her husband and suspect, Teruomi Manda...

410
00:23:59,158 --> 00:24:01,557
The plot lurking behind it

411
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:04,258
most likely began a month ago.

412
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,457
Next Conan,
