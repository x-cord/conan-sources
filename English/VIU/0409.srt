1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,999
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,699
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,399
The heroine is kidnapped.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,899
Only a few hours are left until the curtain opens.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,899
Let's get at it, The Youth Detective Squad!

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,599
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,299
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,300
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:00,873
Be quiet!

10
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:03,473
"Taketori Story" -Wait! Freeze!

11
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,573
Stop there!

12
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:10,673
Thief, give up!

13
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:13,834
Oh, no! Please forgive me!

14
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:18,134
Thank you, sir.

15
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,733
Okay! Stop there!

16
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:23,734
"Tamanosuke Ito (17), Tamanosuke Theatre Troupe Director."

17
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,933
Everyone's pretty good!

18
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,433
Really?

19
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:30,733
"Megumi Ito (7)" -Especially Conan!

20
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,733
Oh, thank you. I'm very happy!

21
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:37,334
Hey, wait a minute. The two of you...

22
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:43,433
Hey, Mr. Tamanosuke.

23
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,434
What?

24
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:47,833
Are you sure you really want amateurs like us?

25
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,033
Of course.

26
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:53,633
This is a special performance different from our show,

27
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:55,733
the problem is not you but...

28
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:56,734
What?

29
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,333
I bought it yesterday.

30
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:00,834
What are you slacking off for?

31
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:05,333
You don't need a stage to rehearse!

32
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:06,833
Sorry, director.

33
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:09,433
"Renge Kataoka (17)" -Renge!

34
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:11,133
Don't open the script now!

35
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:13,134
When do you think we started rehearsing?

36
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:16,533
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:18,133
Don't apologize so easily!

38
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:22,133
If you're not proud of your acting, quit being an actress!

39
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:23,233
I'm...

40
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,833
No, I mean, yes!

41
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,433
Scary, seems like a different person.

42
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:31,033
No, Genta. That's what an actor is like.

43
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:33,233
Impressive.

44
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:37,633
By the way, don't you think Ms. Renge is a bit like Ran?

45
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,133
What?

46
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:41,234
Okay! Rehearsal begins!

47
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:44,733
Tamanosuke Ito.

48
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:48,133
This young director leading the traveling theatrical troupe,

49
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:51,334
comes to our town again and performs.

50
00:03:54,934 --> 00:04:00,733
"Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 1)"

51
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,733
"Mouri Detective Agency."

52
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:06,134
Ran! Hurry up!

53
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:10,133
Tamanosuke's rehearsal will end!

54
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:14,533
But, I have to make lunch for my dad.

55
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,133
Leave it...

56
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:18,033
He's going to fall asleep drinking, right?

57
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:19,634
Hey, Sonoko!

58
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:27,034
Did I catch a cold?

59
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,134
Or is it...

60
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,533
That?

61
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:38,333
You think the detective maniac will mind?

62
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:39,433
What?

63
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:40,933
Come to think of it...

64
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:44,934
Tamanosuke does resemble him a little.

65
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:49,033
I'm talking about Shinichi.

66
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:52,733
Really? I don't think so.

67
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:56,433
By the way, the title is "Taketori Story".

68
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,033
It's about Princess Kaguya, right?

69
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,233
Right!

70
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:03,833
And The Emperor that falls in love with Princess Kaguya is Tamanosuke.

71
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:07,333
I want to be Princess Kaguya!

72
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,434
Sonoko.

73
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:22,233
What an expensive car.

74
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,534
Who is it?

75
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:27,434
This way, president.

76
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,333
Gosh.

77
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,534
Watch it! Excuse you!

78
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,834
No, that isn't right!

79
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:47,534
No way.

80
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:52,433
I came for you, Renge.

81
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,534
Come on! Come home with me!

82
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:58,833
I'm not going home! I'm staying here!

83
00:05:58,834 --> 00:05:59,934
Renge!

84
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,734
-Ohnuki. -Yes, sir.

85
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,033
Let's go, Ms. Renge.

86
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,234
No!

87
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:16,534
Let go of me!

88
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,033
Ms. Renge!

89
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:20,433
What happened? What's it about?

90
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:23,534
That girl plays Princess Kaguya.

91
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,933
Wait a minute!

92
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:30,533
What is this? Who are you?

93
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,833
"Hanshiro Kataoka (60)" -I am Hanshiro Kataoka.

94
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,233
The father of Renge Kataoka.

95
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:36,334
What?

96
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,833
"Hikoemon Bando(50)" -Kataoka...

97
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,433
"Kikuno Ichimura(40)" -Hanshiro...

98
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,833
Isn't he...

99
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,433
He's the founder of the Kataoka Concern

100
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,733
and is the current president.

101
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,733
What? Then...

102
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:53,033
She's a lady from rich family.

103
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:54,333
Amazing!

104
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:58,833
Renge, you didn't say a word of this to anyone.

105
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,933
But...

106
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,533
That has nothing to do with this!

107
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:06,533
This has nothing to do with me wanting to act!

108
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:08,033
That's...

109
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:10,833
By any chance, Renge...

110
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:11,934
Did you run away?

111
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:18,033
I haven't heard from her for six months.

112
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:22,233
I asked Ohnuki to look for.

113
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,533
"Mataroku Onoue (35)" -What a surprise.

114
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:26,533
"Yoichi Azuma (28)" -Well, we're not much different from you.

115
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:29,933
This profession makes it hard to do anything for our parents.

116
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,133
"Kantaro Sawamura (23)" -True...

117
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:35,333
But I think it's not good to make them worry, after all.

118
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,033
-Ohnuki. -Yes, sir.

119
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:39,433
"Shuichi Ohnuki (38)" -Let us go, Ms. Renge.

120
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:41,333
I don't want to! I'm not going home.

121
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:45,033
-I'm definitely won't be going home! -Ms. Renge!

122
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:46,233
Ohnuki!

123
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,833
Yes, sir. Sorry to have troubled you.

124
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:53,534
We would like to do what is appropriate for everyone here.

125
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:56,533
I don't want anything from you.

126
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:58,333
I have no business doing so.

127
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:01,033
Director!

128
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:03,434
Go home now, Renge.

129
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:11,534
Renge! Go home once and come back after you talk things over.

130
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:17,533
Wait a minute, director!

131
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:20,533
There won't be time for the rehearsal and plan.

132
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,233
The first day is three days from today.

133
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:25,133
True, it won't do.

134
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:29,433
But it won't do to leave things like this.

135
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:30,834
You're right.

136
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,433
Go home now, Renge.

137
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,333
-Wait! -Ms. Renge!

138
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:42,033
Please wait, director! I...

139
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:45,133
Ran, can you come here?

140
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:47,233
What? Okay...

141
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:50,734
Someone bring the costume for Princess Kaguya and the props!

142
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:54,133
Hey, hey, come on.

143
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,533
Are you kidding?

144
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:58,733
Ran is going to substitute for Ms. Renge!

145
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:00,433
No, no way!

146
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:04,733
You're right, we need Kaguya for the rehearsal and planning.

147
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:07,033
To make it in time for the first day.

148
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,333
So until then?

149
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:11,533
Well, it can't be helped.

150
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:12,833
True.

151
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,734
Okay, let's do the rehearsal!

152
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,534
Ms. Renge!

153
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:33,433
Wasn't that a little cold...

154
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:34,734
Who the director?

155
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,733
True.

156
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,233
You're wrong.

157
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:43,033
The director believes in Renge that she will return.

158
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:45,334
That's right, that is obvious.

159
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,733
So pretty, Ran.

160
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:54,533
She's really pretty!

161
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,733
She should actually act out in the play!

162
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,233
I agree.

163
00:09:58,234 --> 00:09:59,434
Hey...

164
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,633
But I don't think that's such a good idea.

165
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:04,734
See.

166
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,334
What?

167
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,934
A love scene!

168
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:13,633
Maybe this...

169
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:16,433
Ran and Tamanosuke...

170
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:17,833
Not good...

171
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:23,133
I'm glad the detective maniac isn't watching.

172
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:24,233
I'm watching.

173
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:28,334
Hey, besides that, why isn't it me?

174
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:32,934
But Ms. Renge did not return.

175
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:41,333
And the first day of the performance arrives.

176
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:44,734
"Taketori Story."

177
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,134
Three more hours...

178
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:57,133
We have come too far not to open the curtain.

179
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,134
Without the protagonist?

180
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,133
Director...

181
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:04,434
What are we going to do?

182
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,134
I'm going to go get her.

183
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,033
Go and get her...

184
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:12,633
Renge?

185
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:15,433
It's going to be difficult with that father...

186
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:19,233
Maybe she changed her mind and doesn't want to come back.

187
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:22,933
No way... What's going to happen to this play?

188
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,733
We will have to cancel it.

189
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:27,334
I haven't heard of a "Taketori Story" without Kaguya.

190
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,233
I'm going.

191
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:32,534
Director!

192
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,333
Wait, Mr. Tamanosuke!

193
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:45,334
What?

194
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:50,933
I have something to say to Ms. Renge as a substitute.

195
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:52,634
Mr. Driver, please hurry!

196
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:06,234
"Kataoka."

197
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:10,534
Conan!

198
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,534
Hey, Officer Takagi...

199
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,033
Hey, you two!

200
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,433
How come you're here?

201
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:28,033
Dad?

202
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:29,633
Officer Takagi.

203
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:31,033
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,533
There's no knowing where the culprit could be watching

205
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:35,933
so I had to let them in.

206
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:36,934
Culprit?

207
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,734
It's you. What do you want?

208
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,833
There's only one thing!

209
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:47,434
Where is she? Where's Renge?

210
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,333
I...

211
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:55,133
I was thinking she is at your place.

212
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:56,633
What?

213
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:59,833
I don't know where she is since last night.

214
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:02,034
She said she was going shopping.

215
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:05,633
What?

216
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,633
Dad, what's going on?

217
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:10,334
You keep out of this!

218
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:17,033
Conan!

219
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:18,734
Hey, stop it!

220
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,933
"Ransom money".

221
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,933
"1,500,000 yen"?

222
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:25,433
Ms. Renge!

223
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:27,333
"Divide the money with Imai Electronics,."

224
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:33,733
"Kato Network and Nakao Media accordingly."

225
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:36,433
"Have the money ready by 2 pm."

226
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:38,033
"And let a secretary carry it."

227
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:41,433
"To the parking lot at first block of Yoshioka."

228
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,333
Ransom...

229
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:44,534
Is it...

230
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:47,134
Kidnapping!

231
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,965
Then... It was just an hour ago?

232
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:01,765
That they sent this blackmail letter was sent?

233
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:02,965
Yes.

234
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,466
Originator?

235
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:08,465
This is quite some trouble.

236
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,365
This is used in international crimes

237
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,166
and the method has become a problem all over the world.

238
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:15,965
Mr. Kataoka.

239
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:20,065
The demand of this division of the ransom...

240
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,165
Ohnuki.

241
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,265
Yes.

242
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:27,365
All the three companies in demand has had recent transaction with us.

243
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,865
But why these three companies?

244
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:33,265
That is...

245
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:36,065
It's okay, explain.

246
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,365
Yes.

247
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:41,065
Well, the managers of these three companies have all asked

248
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,266
for a hand in marriage with Ms. Renge.

249
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,966
Well, that's like...

250
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,065
That's right! Snow White!

251
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:06,265
Dad! You mean Princess Kaguya!

252
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,765
Yeah, that's right. Some people call her that, too.

253
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:11,265
That's the only name people call her.

254
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,765
What is it?

255
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,266
Something is bugging me.

256
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:19,066
Excuse me.

257
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,665
Tell them to leave!

258
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,265
I don't want to hear any excuses!

259
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,565
What's wrong?

260
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:43,865
As a matter of fact, one of the suitors I mentioned,

261
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:47,965
due to situations at the company can't get the ransom ready.

262
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,465
That's a lie!

263
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,966
They just don't want any trouble and scandal!

264
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:55,465
How dare, they weigh my daughter, Renge's life,

265
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,765
with that of the company's reputation.

266
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:02,165
-I won't forgive them! -But, what will happen to the ransom money?

267
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,165
I already have it ready.

268
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,865
I have their company name on the outside.

269
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,365
But I'm not giving my daughter away to them!

270
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:14,065
Drop out from the wooing race?

271
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:15,966
This is becoming more and more...

272
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:22,766
Please forgive me.

273
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:28,366
Snow white...

274
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:29,865
Princess Kaguya!

275
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,365
That's it!

276
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:36,265
Meanwhile, we have received the money from the other two.

277
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:39,666
As soon as it's time, I will carry it to the destination.

278
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,165
We must agree with their terms.

279
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,965
And see what they will do afterwards...

280
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:49,665
We, the police will go about the investigation

281
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,865
with the rescue of your daughter as top priority.

282
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:54,466
Thank you.

283
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,766
What?

284
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:11,765
This is...

285
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,365
The image was cut once probably

286
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,765
to make the halation disappear.

287
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:21,165
The kidnapper stopped the camera and closed the window.

288
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,865
No, wait. This is...

289
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,166
There's something there.

290
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,165
Is that spider web?

291
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:34,066
No, then the position isn't right.

292
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:36,866
This place...

293
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:40,665
This place looks familiar.

294
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,465
-What? -Hey!

295
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:45,265
How many times do I have to tell you, you brat?

296
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,665
Dad!

297
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,865
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:51,766
Darn it, I almost made it.

299
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,165
Kidnapped?

300
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,665
Ms. Renge?

301
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,565
I'll have to be here for awhile.

302
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:05,165
Ayumi, how is it down there?

303
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,965
Everyone doesn't know what to do.

304
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:10,365
There's only one hour until the curtain goes up...

305
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:13,265
What should we do, Conan?

306
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,665
Do something...

307
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,165
Sonoko?

308
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,465
Gosh...

309
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:21,765
You shouldn't go off on your own here and there.

310
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:25,065
Get rid of the cobweb yourself!

311
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,865
I'm asking you because I can't do it myself!

312
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:30,765
I hate spiders!

313
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:34,066
Myself? I can't do it myself...

314
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,966
That's it, I got it!

315
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:14,366
False kidnapping?

316
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:18,466
Renge did it herself?

317
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,065
Why would she want to do that...

318
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:25,465
Maybe she wanted to ruin the talk about marriage?

319
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:26,765
What's that supposed to mean?

320
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,865
I don't really know

321
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:30,765
but probably the reason for asking for ransom

322
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,565
from the people who proposed to her...

323
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:36,265
Was her way of wanting to relate how she felt to her father

324
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:39,065
in accordance to the story of Princess Kaguya?

325
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,065
Right, I think so too!

326
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:45,265
But that's no excuse for her to do such a thing!

327
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,465
Little one!

328
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:49,165
Renge is at the warehouse, right?

329
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,965
Yes, probably...

330
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:52,065
It's probably there!

331
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,765
-What? -Let's go!

332
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:55,566
-Wait up! -Tamanosuke!

333
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:19,765
This is the storage warehouse for the costumes and props that we rented,

334
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:22,566
Renge should have the key too.

335
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,865
This place must be it.

336
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:35,665
Don't you think we should tell dad?

337
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,266
But there's no sign of anyone.

338
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,466
Renge!

339
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,066
Ms. Renge!

340
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,366
I knew it...

341
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:01,966
This!

342
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,466
Renge!

343
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:11,166
And at this instant, the false kidnap became a real one!

344
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:20,066
Somehow, Ms. Renge really got kidnapped.

345
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,165
The culprit is probably

346
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,266
the other person who helped with her false kidnapping!

347
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:37,966
I'll be going.

348
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,365
What? Where's Ran and the others?

349
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:48,665
Where did they go?

350
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,065
Inspector, they're going.

351
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,266
Okay.

352
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,266
And the case moves on...

353
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,466
The curtain for the play has also gone up!

354
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,565
"Next Episode" -Once upon a time,

355
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:03,065
there was an old man who harvests bamboo.

356
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,265
Let me do it!

357
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:06,466
-Ran... -Ran.

358
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:09,665
They got away!

359
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,865
Don't let him get away!

360
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,766
We are definitely going to find Ms. Renge!

361
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:18,765
I found her, Conan!

362
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:21,966
Please hurry back, Ms. Renge, Tamanosuke!

363
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:28,766
Next Conan, "Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 2)"

364
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:46,365
Next Conan's Hint:

365
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,665
"Phone call from the culprit."

366
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,365
In the next story, I am the Princess Kaguya.

367
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,065
-Thank you for your hard work! -Thank you for your hard work!

368
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,466
What?
