1
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:03,625
Two people were killed 20 years ago

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:05,625
and one was killed 15 years ago

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,825
in a serial killing incident.

4
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:10,725
The culprit also ran over Police Detective Morimura

5
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:13,825
who stopped him for questioning and killed him.

6
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:15,825
The culprit wounded the then,

7
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,525
assistant inspector Matsumoto in the left eye.

8
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:20,125
The valid date for the incident that happened

9
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,225
20 years ago had already expired,

10
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:24,125
And, there are only three more days to go

11
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,325
before the incident that happened 15 years will also expire.

12
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:29,925
There are two clues leading to the culprit.

13
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:31,925
One is the straight-lined scar

14
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:33,225
that Superintendent Matsumoto had left

15
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:35,525
on the back of the culprit.

16
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:37,725
The other is the whistling.

17
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:42,225
He kept whistling a song that was popular 20 years ago.

18
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:46,225
While Officer Takagi and the others were doing their best investigating,

19
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:49,125
criminal psychologist, Mr. Douji Hiramune

20
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,225
continued to make provoking statements

21
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:54,325
to the culprit on air and in magazines.

22
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,925
And...

23
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:59,725
I passed a weird guy at the entrance.

24
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:02,225
He was wearing an off-season long coat

25
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,125
and whistling a tune.

26
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:10,025
Did the serial killer really come?

27
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,225
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

28
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:16,525
Saturday nights are for mystery.

29
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:18,525
You're not your usual self, Officer Takagi.

30
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,625
Heading straight to arrest the culprit?

31
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,225
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:24,125
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,125
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:10,746
"A New Scar and the Whistling Man."

35
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:13,646
Really, Conan?

36
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:15,246
Is it true that there is a possibility

37
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:18,146
that the serial killer came to that condo?

38
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,346
I heard that the criminal psychologist

39
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:22,546
named Mr. Hiramune who was on TV a while ago.

40
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:25,346
"Hiramune" -lives in this condo.

41
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:28,746
I'm going over to that person's place!

42
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,146
Wait, Conan!

43
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:31,646
Conan!

44
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,446
Officer Chiba, will you go get the car.

45
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,446
Yes.

46
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,946
"Hiramune."

47
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:41,746
There's no answer.

48
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:49,846
It's open.

49
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,546
Mr. Hiramune.

50
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,746
Are you there?

51
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:01,946
Mr. Hiramune.

52
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:05,546
Mr. Hiramune.

53
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:11,546
No good.

54
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:15,946
There's blood on his Polo shirt?

55
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:17,346
"Z"?

56
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:21,846
The man who was murdered is criminal psychologist,

57
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:24,546
Mr. Douji Hiramune, age 41.

58
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:27,846
The murder weapon is the fruit knife

59
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:31,146
that was in the kitchen here.

60
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,046
There's a trace of a stun gun

61
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,846
having been stuck out at the back of his neck.

62
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:36,446
Judging from the alphabet that is carved on his back,

63
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:38,546
this is likely the doings

64
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,446
of the same serial killer of all the other cases.

65
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:44,546
But the letter this time is "Z".

66
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:47,946
I also thought that the next letter would be "N".

67
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:49,846
According to the investigation reports

68
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:55,346
the letters in the order of E, S, and W

69
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,146
were carved on the bodies of the victims.

70
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:58,246
Therefore, if the next letter is "N",

71
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,946
it would complete the four cardinal directions.

72
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:03,746
But, if the letters symbolize the four cardinal directions,

73
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:07,346
it would be east, west, south, north.

74
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:11,146
So the order of the letters should be E, W, S, N.

75
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:14,746
Well, it's for certain that this is not the doings of a copycat.

76
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,746
It hasn't been publicized that letters

77
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:19,646
are carved on the bodies of the victims and besides,

78
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,246
Conan's friend seems to have mentioned

79
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:25,146
passing a man at the entrance who was whistling.

80
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:28,246
But, no matter if he knew about the case,

81
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:31,546
to think that after hearing from his friend

82
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:33,246
about a man who was whistling

83
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,446
it's amazing that you would sense that Mr. Hiramune

84
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,046
who had been bad-mouthing the killer would be in danger,

85
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,846
and run in here first thing.

86
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:44,146
You're running around like a full fledged detective as always, Conan.

87
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:49,546
Did he bad-mouth the killer that badly?

88
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:50,646
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,746
He would say things like the killer is trembling

90
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:55,146
waiting for his term to expire.

91
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,246
Or, if he's got the guts, to come out and appear before him.

92
00:05:58,246 --> 00:05:59,946
It's as if he's provoking the killer.

93
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:01,146
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:03,946
Mr. Hiramatsu also repeatedly bashed the killer

95
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,346
likewise in the papers and weekly magazines too.

96
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:10,146
It seems that Mr. Hiramune rushed home

97
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:12,146
after finishing his live appearance at a TV station.

98
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:15,746
He seems to have waiting for an acquaintance to come to his place.

99
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,646
I guess we could deem that acquaintance

100
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:18,746
of his to be a suspect.

101
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:22,546
He could be someone connected with copy machines or something.

102
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:27,646
See, under Mr. Hiramune's left hand.

103
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:32,046
There's blood on the Ctrl key and C key.

104
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,746
If you press these two key,

105
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:35,346
you can copy something right?

106
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:38,046
That's true.

107
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:41,446
Maybe the killer left it there deliberately.

108
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:45,846
But, there's no blood on his left hand, right?

109
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:46,946
True.

110
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:50,046
Blood for some reason is only on his right hand

111
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:51,446
where he's holding the mouse.

112
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:54,846
Which means that blood was put on the key with his right hand,

113
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:58,046
which after he went out of his way to cover it with his left hand, right?

114
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:00,546
If the killer left it deliberately,

115
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,446
do you think he would do something like this?

116
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:03,846
Right.

117
00:07:03,846 --> 00:07:06,746
I think he would leave something that is more conspicuous behind.

118
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:09,146
He didn't put the blood on with his left hand

119
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,746
to make it look like it wasn't a coincidence.

120
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:14,746
He hid it with his left hand

121
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:16,946
because he didn't want to show it to the killer.

122
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:19,646
In other words, Mr. Hiramune,

123
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:24,446
at the moment of his death left a dying message.

124
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,546
There is a copy machine in this room but...

125
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:30,146
I checked a while ago,

126
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:32,346
but nothing looked strange.

127
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:35,046
Could it be a coy band or something?

128
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:37,446
The tune the suspect was whistling was a song

129
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:40,146
that was popular 20 years ago, right?

130
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:42,846
It could be a band that is covering that tune.

131
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:45,946
There are a million bands that would doing something like that.

132
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:47,046
Superintendent Matsumoto.

133
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:48,046
-Sir. -Sir.

134
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:51,246
It was the song of the times back then.

135
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:57,146
Well, it seems to hold a deep meaning for the killer though.

136
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:58,746
Deep meaning?

137
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,146
Do you know that 20 years ago.

138
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:04,246
Morimura went to question the person

139
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:06,146
in a suspicious car that he frequently saw

140
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:10,146
and died on duty when he was run over by that car?

141
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:14,146
It seems that the man was whistling that tune

142
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:17,246
even as Morimura approached the car.

143
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,846
And the man was in tears.

144
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:21,546
Tears?

145
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:22,746
Okay.

146
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:25,546
Sato and Chiba, go question people in this vicinity.

147
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,546
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

148
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,746
Shiratori, keep the copy machine in mind

149
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:31,646
and go check around Mr. HIramune once more.

150
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,046
That's just what I plan to do.

151
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,946
Takagi, just to be safe,

152
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,346
go meet the bereaved families of the victims

153
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:37,546
of the past three cases,

154
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:40,246
and check to see if they had any kind of connection

155
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:41,246
with Mr. Hiramune.

156
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,346
Yes, sir! Roger!

157
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:47,946
So enthusiastic.

158
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:53,046
Maybe it worked a bit too effectively.

159
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:58,646
The murder case that had only three days to go before expiration.

160
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,746
Now with a new murder committed by the same killer,

161
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:03,346
has 15 more years to go before expiration.

162
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:04,446
Oh no.

163
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:07,046
The Criminal Procedure Act was revised

164
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,446
and the new expiration date for murders cases is 25 years.

165
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:13,246
If we can only nab this killer

166
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:16,246
within the 25 years we from now.

167
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:21,346
I get to go with Ms. Sato, just the two of us...

168
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,046
to the hot spring!

169
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:25,546
I see.

170
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:30,046
That's why he's more out to get than always.

171
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:31,646
His motive's impure.

172
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:33,546
A hot spring, how nice.

173
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:37,346
Take us with you too.

174
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:39,846
Why are you guys in this car?

175
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,346
You let us on yourself!

176
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:46,946
In the parking lot, we asked you, "Where are you going?"

177
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:49,146
and you opened the door without saying anything.

178
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:51,946
You didn't look like you were all there, though.

179
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:56,146
Well... my head was filled with thoughts about the hot spring.

180
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:59,546
No, I mean the case so...

181
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:01,746
And what do you intend to do?

182
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:04,246
Are you going to take us with you?

183
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:05,846
Or, are you going to let us down?

184
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:08,646
Of course I'm going to let you all down.

185
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:12,746
But Ayumi and Ai passed by the killer, you know.

186
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:17,546
But, I'm headed for the houses of the bereaved families of the victims

187
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:19,546
of the cases 20 and 15 years ago.

188
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:24,346
But, I heard them say on TV that the bereaved families

189
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:25,846
are also being suspected as suspects.

190
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:28,046
True, but...

191
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:31,046
Well, if you intend to wait 25 years

192
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,546
for Officer Sato who'll turn 50

193
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:36,846
and become a super over the hill mature woman,

194
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:38,546
you can try handling everything alone.

195
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:41,146
-Super over the hill mature. -Super over the hill mature.

196
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,946
She's just great now though.

197
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:44,646
She's beautiful too!

198
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,646
She sure is a buy, I'd say.

199
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:54,346
Listen, the only one who gets out of the car is Conan.

200
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:57,946
The rest of you stay put in the car, all right?

201
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:59,246
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir...

202
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:04,846
The person we're about to meet now

203
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:07,946
is the wife of Mr. Tsuguharu Bokawa, a doctor,

204
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:11,346
the first victim who was killed 20 years ago, right?

205
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:15,446
"Bokawa General Hospital" -Yes. Mr. Bokawa was the head of a hospital,

206
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:19,546
and his wife Maiko inherited a great amount of estate,

207
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,246
so she was taken up as a suspect.

208
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:25,746
But, no concrete evidence

209
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,146
was found nor did she have anything connecting her

210
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,746
with Mr. Mugita, the second victim who was killed.

211
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:37,346
Yes. I know this person.

212
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,146
He's Mr. Hiramune, the criminal psychologist.

213
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:42,746
"Maiko Bokawa (62)" -that appears on TV frequently, isn't he?

214
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,946
What about him?

215
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:48,946
He was found killed in his condo just a while ago.

216
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:54,046
Most probably by the same killer who killed your husband 20 years ago.

217
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,946
My, how frightening.

218
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:57,846
So, I'm wondering if your husband

219
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:02,746
was in any way connected to Mr. Hiramune.

220
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:06,146
I wonder how old is Mr. Hiramune?

221
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:08,046
41 years old.

222
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:11,046
Then, 20 years ago he was 21 years old

223
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:14,146
and my husband died when he was 50.

224
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:18,246
It's hard for me to believe that they were connected in any way.

225
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:19,846
I see.

226
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:22,946
Did he ever meet anyone in secret?

227
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:26,346
Who is he, this boy?

228
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:30,446
I'm watching the officer on duty for social studies.

229
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:33,046
Oh, is that so.

230
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:36,146
But, it's true that he used to frequently drink

231
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:39,046
with someone on Saturday nights.

232
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:41,546
Do you have any idea who it was?

233
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:42,946
No.

234
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:46,846
Only, there was a time when he came home totally wasted back then.

235
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:51,946
"Darn! How dare he call me cry baby, cry baby and make fun of me!"

236
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:55,246
He kept complaining.

237
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:57,346
It could've been an old friend of his

238
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,746
that knew him since he was child.

239
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:04,146
I told the police about this 20 years ago too.

240
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:05,746
"For pedestrians and bicycles only."

241
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,346
The next one we're visiting

242
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:12,546
is the house of a victim that was killed 20 years ago too.

243
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:14,346
He is the younger brother of the Assistant Professor

244
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:15,646
of the science and technology department,

245
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,046
Mr. Atsunori Mugita, who was killed 2 days after Mr. Bokawa,

246
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,646
He was suspected because his older brother

247
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:21,646
was covered by a huge insurance policy.

248
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,246
But, no connection was found between him

249
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:26,646
and the victim of the first case.

250
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:29,246
What about with the lawyer in the third case?

251
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:32,046
Of course, it seems they found no connection.

252
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:40,946
Criminal psychologist, Mr. Doji Hiramune.

253
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,146
So he makes...

254
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,846
"Hidekuni Mugita (56)" -a lot of appearances on TV shows,

255
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:47,746
but I don't like watching TV, you see.

256
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,946
And, Mr. Hiramune was killed.

257
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:54,446
By the same killer that killed your brother Atsunori.

258
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:56,746
Aren't you shocked?

259
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:59,046
Well, sort of.

260
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:04,146
But, I've made up my mind to forget about that case 5 years ago

261
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:06,246
when it expired.

262
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:11,846
Then, do you know if your brother and Mr. Hiramune knew each other?

263
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:14,646
I wonder but I don't think so.

264
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:18,946
Saturday night.

265
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:24,246
Did you brother meet with anyone on Saturday nights?

266
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:27,746
Yes. The wife of my late brother

267
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:30,146
who died the year before last used to say

268
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:34,246
that he didn't come home on Saturday nights,

269
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,946
but rather, frequently came back the next morning.

270
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:38,646
Thinking that he may be having an extra-marital affair,

271
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:41,146
his wife persistently rang his pocket bell.

272
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:46,046
It seems that he called her back but was outraged

273
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:50,046
telling her that he was at the doctor so not to bug him.

274
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:52,246
Doctor? Could it have been Dr. Bokawa

275
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:55,246
who was the first person that was killed?

276
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:58,746
Yes. A police detective said the same thing 20 years ago

277
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:01,346
and seemed to be investigating the case.

278
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:06,046
My brother's name wasn't on the patient list of that doctor, was it?

279
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:08,346
I guess not.

280
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,846
How was it, Officer Takagi?

281
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:19,546
Did you find anything?

282
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:20,946
Nothing at all.

283
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:23,846
Ayumi and Ai, what do you think?

284
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:26,446
Didn't the man just now look a lot like the killer?

285
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:29,746
I didn't think he resembled the killer in particular.

286
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,846
I don't think lady is the killer either.

287
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:35,946
Well, I guess if he were wearing a long haired wig and mustache

288
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:38,846
like the time we passed him,

289
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:40,946
he would probably make a different impression, though.

290
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:42,346
True.

291
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:44,746
Where next?

292
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,446
The last place we're going

293
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,146
to go is to the house of Eiki Nabei,

294
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:51,346
the son of the lawyer, Mr. Susumu Nabei,

295
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:53,446
who was killed five years after the serial killings

296
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:55,046
that occurred 20 years ago.

297
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:06,525
Eiki who was 10 years old back then,

298
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:08,325
was in his room when he was awakened

299
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:10,825
by the sound of his father groaning.

300
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:12,525
And, after the killer left,

301
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:15,925
he says that he was so terrified that he couldn't come of his room

302
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:18,425
until his mother came back from shopping.

303
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,425
His mother, after finding her husband lying dead

304
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,225
became bed-ridden because of the shock,

305
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:24,925
and still seems to be in the hospital even now.

306
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:29,525
So, Eiki seems to be living alone in that house now.

307
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:32,125
Will you please give me a break, officer!

308
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,325
I've talked more than enough about the incident in the past!

309
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,925
"Eiki Nabei (25)" -I'm sick and tired of the media coming after me

310
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:41,225
saying that the case is about to expire and all!

311
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:42,825
I could care less if the killer

312
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:46,425
who killed my father is going after a new target!

313
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:48,725
Then, then...

314
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:53,325
At least please tell me if your father knew Mr. Hiramune...

315
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,325
Who knows? Stupid!

316
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,625
Stupid?

317
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:05,325
It seems he wasn't like that before.

318
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,425
Really?

319
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,425
Yes.

320
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,025
According to the police,

321
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:10,825
be it about what happened on the day of the incident

322
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:13,225
or the strange thing that his father was saying

323
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:14,925
before he was killed.

324
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,625
He used to come to the police

325
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,625
and report every little thing he remembered.

326
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:21,525
Strange thing?

327
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:24,225
It seems he used to sleep till noon on Sundays,

328
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,225
and mumble when he got up.

329
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,025
"I had a tough time last night because the dealer (head of the house)

330
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:31,825
went out with a big hand!(was run over)"

331
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:35,025
So, somebody's parent was run over by a car.

332
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:38,325
I see, after all, he was a lawyer.

333
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,825
He must've been handling the case of either

334
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,125
the plaintiff or the defendant.

335
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,625
So? How does that end up being a strange story?

336
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,725
Well, Mr. Nabei who was killed specialized in business law

337
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:52,925
and didn't handle cases having to do with traffic accidents.

338
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:55,425
Then, why?

339
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,225
That's why Eiki thought it strange

340
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:00,125
and reported it to the police.

341
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,225
A cry baby.

342
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:06,625
At the doctor.

343
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,925
The dealer goes out.

344
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,425
So, I see.

345
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,025
I've finally figured out

346
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,525
the connection of the four victims.

347
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:19,525
What?

348
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:24,325
Mahjong?

349
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:28,525
Are you saying that the thing in common all the four people

350
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,525
who were killed had is mahjong?

351
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:34,825
Mr. Hiramune said on the wide show on TV, didn't he?

352
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:36,825
That "it's all last",

353
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,025
or he was getting rid of "anko" to finish that round of the game.

354
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:43,325
These are all terminology used in mahjong, aren't they?

355
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:46,725
I'm sure that Mr. Hiramune loves mahjong.

356
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,725
I... I guess so, but what about the other three?

357
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:54,325
As to Mr. Bokawa, who was the first one killed,

358
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:57,025
when he came home drunk on Saturday night complaining,

359
00:18:57,025 --> 00:19:01,425
"How dare they make fun of me calling me cry baby."

360
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:04,125
Assistant professor, Mugita of the science and technology department,

361
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,425
after being called on his beeper by his wife,

362
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:08,825
retuned her call shouting,

363
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:13,025
"I'm almost ready to win the game. Don't bug me!"

364
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,825
Lawyer Nabei seems to have slept frequently till noon on Sundays,

365
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:17,425
and when he got up would mumble,

366
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:23,225
"The dealer won the game with a big hand, right?"

367
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:25,625
When Mr. Bokawa said they called him a cry baby,

368
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,525
it meant that he'd frequently pick up the tiles of other people

369
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:30,425
-and display part of his hand in the game. -Why does he have to cry?

370
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:32,625
It's a game called Mahjong, isn't it?

371
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,225
To cry, "naku" is when a person,

372
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:38,425
in order to win the game as soon as possible,

373
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:40,825
picks a tile that someone disposes of on the table up

374
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:42,425
to make a pair of threes or fours.

375
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,625
Which means that phrase that Mr. Nabei mentioned about,

376
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,925
"I was in a fix because the parent was run over" was...

377
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:50,925
Maybe that phrase, "The parent was run over" was taken mistakenly

378
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,825
by his the son, Eiki?

379
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,225
"Parent" means the dealer of the mahjong game

380
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:58,425
who gets to score a lot of points.

381
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,525
"Run over" means the points of the person

382
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,425
who wins the game gets higher.

383
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,325
It means that a hand called "Haneman" is played and the player wins.

384
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:06,425
So, he meant, the dealer won with a high point,

385
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:09,025
which put him a fix.

386
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,225
Then what does Mr. Mugita's remark,

387
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:14,925
"I'm at the doctor now" mean?

388
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,525
He probably said,

389
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,125
"I'll be winning the game with just two more tiles now!

390
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,625
Don't bother me!"

391
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:23,925
True.

392
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:26,725
It sounds like "I'm at the doctor now" to me, though.

393
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,925
What does that means?

394
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:34,225
When you need only two more tiles to go win the game,

395
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:37,325
you call it "Iishanten"!

396
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:38,925
In other words, he's angry and saying,

397
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,125
"I'm almost ready to win the game,

398
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,225
so don't call me on the beeper and bother me".

399
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:46,725
Well, all the terminologies used are for mahjong,

400
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:49,425
so if a person who never played mahjong heard wrong,

401
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:51,225
it's understandable.

402
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:52,825
True.

403
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:55,125
Because the ones who heard so, were Mrs. Bohkawa,

404
00:20:55,125 --> 00:21:02,025
Mrs. Mugita and Mr. Nabei's son, Eiki who was still a child.

405
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:03,225
If you think of it that way,

406
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:05,425
the remark the culprit spit out,

407
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:06,825
that Eiki heard was about mahjong too, then.

408
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,225
Remark he spit out?

409
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:13,825
It seems that Eiki heard the words of the culprit who left the house.

410
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:15,525
You're just paying me to take responsibility,

411
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,425
so don't blame it on me.

412
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:21,425
You're to blame for doing something like that.

413
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:26,925
I was cornered by the police who left this big scar on me.

414
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:29,225
Taking responsibility (sekininbarai) and cornered (tenpai)

415
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,325
are also words used in mahjong.

416
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:34,625
And? What from there?

417
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,325
What else?

418
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:38,125
There's a very high possibility

419
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,425
that the four were sitting around

420
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,925
a mahjong table somewhere every Saturday.

421
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,125
Narrow the mahjong parlours down

422
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,925
to ones that the four could've dropped by from their houses

423
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:49,925
or work place 20 years ago and ask around.

424
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,525
As far as mahjong is concerned,

425
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,125
people can play together

426
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,825
no matter what the difference in age is.

427
00:21:58,425 --> 00:21:59,925
Okay!

428
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:04,925
Youth Detective Squad! Let's go!

429
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,325
It's getting late, you know. Is it okay?

430
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:10,325
It's already 9 pm.

431
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,625
Yeah, don't worry about it.

432
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,925
I told mother that I'd be spending the night at doctor's house tonight.

433
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:17,225
No problem.

434
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:18,525
Really?

435
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:22,525
Okay! Let's get going!

436
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:23,825
Aye!

437
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:31,725
Hold on, whistling man.

438
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,125
I'll expose you're true identity for sure.

439
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,125
His address is unknown and he's unemployed.

440
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,525
His name is...

441
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:02,225
Dokuro Kibo.

442
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:06,425
The letter Z that was left on Mr. Hiramune's back's bugging me.

443
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,425
So that person is a cat.

444
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:13,025
Be on full guard when coming in contact with him.

445
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:17,525
Listen! Life is lost in a split second.

446
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:21,225
I guess I'm the only hostage left.

447
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:22,725
Next Conan,

448
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:26,625
"An Old Scar and the Soul of a Detective."

449
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,125
Next Conan's Hint:

450
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,725
"Mouse".

451
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:48,625
Why do they call it a mouse?

452
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,125
You'll find out next episode.

453
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,025
Genta, your mouth looks funny.
