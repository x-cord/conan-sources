1
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:06,226
A month after enrolment,

2
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:10,226
the students are already used to life at the police academy

3
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:11,926
and are now allowed to leave campus

4
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:14,627
as well as stay overnight off-campus.

5
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:23,926
Onizuka Class, do not stop!

6
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:25,426
Let's finish cleaning up as quickly as possible

7
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:26,626
so we can eat!

8
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,826
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

9
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:30,126
Excuse me, Matsuda.

10
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:32,326
Could you hand me the dustpan?

11
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:33,327
Sure thing.

12
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:36,926
But you have to give it back to me, Rei!

13
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:39,526
That was a terrible pun. Two points.

14
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:41,827
Come on... That should have been zero points, don't you think?

15
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:46,226
They've become the best of friends.

16
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:48,826
As Jinpei's best friend,

17
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:50,526
I can't help but feel a bit jealous.

18
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,326
Hagiwara!

19
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:55,326
Don't forget about the mixer that's on the next day off!

20
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:57,926
Sure! It's all in your hands!

21
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,326
Many handsome guys are coming!

22
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,426
Like that blond foreigner over there...

23
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:05,526
Who are you calling a foreigner?

24
00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:07,326
Well, no...

25
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:08,926
I'm sorry, sir.

26
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:11,127
-Please excuse us! -Please excuse us!

27
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:14,926
I'm from Tomori Cleaners.

28
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:17,526
I've come to retrieve the uniforms.

29
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:19,926
I'm sorry that they're always drenched in sweat.

30
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:21,026
No problem at all.

31
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:24,326
You are the ones who will protect us citizens one day.

32
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:26,527
It's not a big deal.

33
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:29,526
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

34
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:31,626
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

35
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:32,826
Youth in full bloom!

36
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,926
The unbreakable bonds between Amuro and his friends!

37
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,626
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:38,326
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:40,727
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:26,326
"Police Academy Arc, Wild Police Story"

41
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:29,027
"Case: Wataru Date"

42
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:31,227
Oh, no...

43
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,426
I haven't prepared for the English lesson.

44
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,226
The English instructor always has it in for me.

45
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:38,326
I'm scared that I'm going to be called up in class.

46
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:41,126
In that case, you should have Furuya tutor you.

47
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,326
Isn't that right, Furuya?

48
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,326
Judging by your looks, you should be fluent in English.

49
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,326
Well, more or less.

50
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,526
You can count on a blond half-foreigner like him.

51
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:52,726
I'm sure he's better at English than the instructor.

52
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:55,826
Hey! You shouldn't judge a person by their looks!

53
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:57,026
Well, I wasn't...

54
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,526
And...

55
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:02,526
Don't try to look cool by putting a toothpick in your mouth.

56
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:03,826
It's disgusting.

57
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,426
I'm sorry...

58
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:08,426
It's all right if you get it.

59
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:10,127
Be careful next time.

60
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,726
Say, Squad Leader...

61
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:18,327
Could it be true that you like Furuya?

62
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,926
You did cover for him during the clean-up.

63
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,026
What?

64
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:25,326
It's all right, you don't have to hide it.

65
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,826
I don't mind that kind of thing.

66
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:29,326
There's no way I like him like that!

67
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:30,926
I do have a girlfriend.

68
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:34,326
What?

69
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:36,527
You guys are too surprised.

70
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:41,227
Oh, no...

71
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:44,826
You talked about us to the guys at the police academy?

72
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,926
Sorry, I blurted it out while in the moment.

73
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:50,426
But we promised to keep it from others

74
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:52,826
until I met your parents.

75
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,326
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,926
Did you ask your dad about his schedule?

77
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,026
It would be better if I met him sooner than later.

78
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:01,226
We don't have to worry about that old man.

79
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:04,426
There you go, saying that again.

80
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:05,526
So?

81
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:07,426
How is the academy going for you?

82
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:10,626
It's quite fun.

83
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,226
There's a guy who's quick to fight,

84
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:14,126
and there's a flashy smooth-talker.

85
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:15,626
There's also a guy who is calm on the outside

86
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:19,526
but is desperately looking for something in private.

87
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,526
There's a guy who gets involved in things

88
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:25,326
because he looks a bit different, like you.

89
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:28,326
They're all interesting, so there's never a dull moment.

90
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,826
I'll introduce them to you when I get the chance, Natalie.

91
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:34,427
I'm looking forward to that.

92
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:39,326
Taiho-jutsu is a technique developed

93
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:42,526
based on ancient Japanese martial arts

94
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,526
to restrain and capture suspects and criminals alike!

95
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,626
Hits are valid if they are on the chin,

96
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:50,826
shoulders, chest and forearms!

97
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:53,326
You can attack using thrusts, kicks,

98
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,826
locks, throws, chokeholds and grappling holds,

99
00:05:55,827 --> 00:06:00,226
or by using batons, canes, and handcuffs.

100
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,026
You will need to put your opponent into submission

101
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:06,727
without hurting them or yourself.

102
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,827
One point! Stop!

103
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:17,726
Good work out there.

104
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:20,626
Gosh, is Squad Leader strong or what?

105
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,626
Goodness, I could still win against him

106
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:24,326
if it came to good old fisticuffs.

107
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:27,726
I won't lose when it comes to women or cars.

108
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:30,427
But Squad Leader said he has a girlfriend.

109
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,526
How about we go somewhere this weekend to change our luck?

110
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:37,726
I'd be fine if it was the car shop or the bike shop,

111
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,226
but not the DIY store.

112
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:42,226
In that case, I'll come with you.

113
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:44,026
So it's decided, then.

114
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:47,026
Do you want to go to the car shop or the bike shop?

115
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:49,026
Speaking of that bike shop,

116
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:52,526
I saw a man with a strange tattoo there the other day.

117
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,126
A strange tattoo?

118
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,126
Yes, a tattoo of a cup that has a base...

119
00:06:57,127 --> 00:07:01,026
I think it's called a goblet?

120
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,626
What kind of man is he?

121
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:04,926
Where does he live? What's his name?

122
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:05,927
I don't know any of that!

123
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:09,426
Hey, what's the matter, Morofushi?

124
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:10,826
Sorry, Matsuda.

125
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:12,726
If you're that curious,

126
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:15,526
how about we go to the bike shop tonight?

127
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,126
One point!

128
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,426
He won against 10 people!

129
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:20,826
Next up, Furuya!

130
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:21,927
Yes, sir.

131
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,926
This is a must-watch.

132
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:29,626
Furuya has the upper hand in his studies.

133
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:31,526
But how will this turn out?

134
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:32,826
Come on, Zero!

135
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,226
Don't lose to Mr. I-Have-A-Girlfriend!

136
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:37,027
So that's what you're annoyed about?

137
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:40,327
Begin!

138
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:46,426
Hagi, how about we bet on who's going to win?

139
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:49,326
I bet one fried noodle bun that Zero is going to win.

140
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,826
Then, I bet one melon bun that Squad Leader will win.

141
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:54,326
If this goes on, he'll force his way through.

142
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:58,226
No, I'm sure his knees are hurting from his bout with me earlier.

143
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,526
There's no way Zero would miss that.

144
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,527
You're playing dirty.

145
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,526
-Zero? -Oh, come on!

146
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:17,926
That fried noodle bun is mine!

147
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,426
You are only able to put your opponent into submission unhurt

148
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:23,826
when you actually put them into submission.

149
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:26,327
I'm disappointed in you, Furuya.

150
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:31,526
Why didn't you hit my knees?

151
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:33,226
Why did you hesitate?

152
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:34,926
If this had been a crime scene,

153
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:36,926
you would have been badly hurt,

154
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,426
and the suspect would have run away.

155
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:42,826
Compassion will not work on vicious criminals.

156
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:45,226
If you show weakness,

157
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:47,726
they will absolutely take advantage of that.

158
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,727
The only thing left would be the worst kind of end,

159
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,126
just like my father had.

160
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,426
If you're not stronger than anyone else,

161
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:56,927
justice will not be served!

162
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:03,227
Was there something wrong with what I said?

163
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,926
If you're not stronger than anyone else,

164
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:18,327
justice will not be served!

165
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:23,726
Come in.

166
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:26,726
Zero. Sorry, were you asleep?

167
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:30,526
No, just lying down thinking about a thing or two.

168
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:31,826
I see.

169
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:34,626
I'm about to go out with Matsuda and Hagiwara,

170
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:36,926
so do you want us to get you anything?

171
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:38,726
Nothing comes to mind.

172
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:39,727
Really?

173
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,626
Okay, then. Sorry to disturb you, Zero.

174
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:42,727
It's fine.

175
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:49,326
If you're going to a convenience store, I'd like a tube of toothpaste...

176
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:52,826
They're gone.

177
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:56,227
Oh, well. I guess I have to go out myself, then.

178
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:11,226
Squad Leader Date?

179
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:12,527
Furuya.

180
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,926
I'm sorry for what I did to you at the dojo earlier.

181
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,326
I said a little too much...

182
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,926
Not at all.

183
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:25,426
None of you was involved with what happened to my father, after all.

184
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:28,726
If I recall, your dad was a police officer. Isn't that right?

185
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,926
He was the head patrol officer attached to a neighbourhood police station.

186
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:35,226
He was tall, thin and frail-looking,

187
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,926
but I respected him.

188
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:41,227
He was off duty until that day.

189
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:46,326
Hey, dad. Why do you always have a toothpick in your mouth?

190
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:49,726
Well, I'm thin and don't look too reliable, do I?

191
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,826
So I have a toothpick in my mouth to look tough to the bad guys!

192
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:56,326
How about you buy me some toothpicks, dad?

193
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:59,826
Kids should make do with lollipops!

194
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,826
Hurry, dad!

195
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,327
Okay.

196
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:10,026
The incident happened right after my father entered the store.

197
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:12,726
An enraged man with blood splattered all over

198
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,526
and a wooden sword in one hand jumped inside

199
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,626
while crying out, "Give me money".

200
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:19,026
Of course, everyone in the store was in a huge panic,

201
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:21,126
but I wasn't scared at all.

202
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,226
There was only one of them.

203
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:24,126
I was sure my father, a police officer,

204
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,026
would do something about it.

205
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:29,027
That's what I believed when I saw...

206
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:33,926
You can have my wallet if you want,

207
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,826
so please leave this store alone!

208
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,026
My dad is a police officer!

209
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:43,026
He's going to beat you up!

210
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:46,426
My words were like oil to a flame.

211
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:51,426
The man beat my father with the wooden sword over and over.

212
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:55,026
A patrol car's siren was heard in the area,

213
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:58,226
so the man fled from the convenience store.

214
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:01,226
My father ended up staying in a hospital for a year

215
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:06,726
and quit the police force because of the injury.

216
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,626
I only found this out later,

217
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,726
but the criminal was a member of a crime syndicate

218
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:14,926
who had lost in a dispute and wanted funds to escape.

219
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:19,326
He later went into another store and assaulted someone else.

220
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,626
In other words...

221
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,726
If my father had been strong enough

222
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:25,626
to apprehend the man then and there,

223
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,426
justice would have been served

224
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:30,927
without someone else getting injured.

225
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,827
Sorry for making you listen to such a pointless story.

226
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,527
Don't make any noise!

227
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:09,226
Why won't you tell me?

228
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:13,026
The guy with the goblet tattoo is a regular at this shop, isn't he?

229
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:16,626
So why are you looking for him?

230
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:18,826
Hey, Morofushi, tell him!

231
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:22,526
The reason you're looking for the guy!

232
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:26,127
That's...

233
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,026
Morofushi...

234
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:36,626
Well, we can't disclose personal information

235
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,426
about our customers without a valid reason.

236
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:44,626
Didn't we say we forgot the reason we're looking for the guy?

237
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:47,126
You have to tell us, or...

238
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,326
I remember now!

239
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:52,526
Didn't Squad Leader tell us about it at the dojo?

240
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,426
The thing from when his father.

241
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:55,427
Yes.

242
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,126
When I was a kid,

243
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,626
I once saw an older man with similar eyebrows as Squad Leader

244
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:04,626
being beaten up by a yakuza guy at a convenience store.

245
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:08,327
Hagi, tell us the details!

246
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:11,326
Stop dawdling!

247
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:14,926
Now put your phones in that basket!

248
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:16,427
Yes...

249
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,526
Is that all of them?

250
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,326
Yes.

251
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,926
Furuya. There are two of them.

252
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:28,026
If you and I deal with one each,

253
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:29,826
we can apprehend them.

254
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,726
-First, I'll draw the attention of -Oh, this is the latest smartphone.

255
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:33,326
-the guy in the knit cap. -Idiot.

256
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:34,926
-Then, you'll be able to... -We'll get as many as we want

257
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:36,926
-Wait. -once we finish this job!

258
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:39,526
Something isn't right.

259
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,326
Why didn't they take money from the cash register

260
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,326
and make a run for it right away?

261
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:44,826
Beats me.

262
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:50,026
But our priority is to make sure all the customers here are safe.

263
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,126
We haven't been restrained yet,

264
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:53,926
so this is our chance.

265
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,327
What are you two whispering about?

266
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:01,826
I'll kill you.

267
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:04,226
Gosh. So the store clerk is one of them.

268
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:08,127
Let's get this started.

269
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:11,927
Come on, now... Just how many of them are there?

270
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:15,126
Don't be so slow!

271
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,627
Get walking!

272
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,026
How much longer?

273
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:26,426
After another 400 or 500 thousand, I guess.

274
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:29,727
Listen up! I don't want to hear any sound from you guys!

275
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:35,827
Gosh, we have to do something about these restraints first.

276
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,327
What are you doing?

277
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:48,226
I see! If we rub the restraints against the shoelaces,

278
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:50,127
the heat from the friction will break them!

279
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:57,826
Nice one, Furuya!

280
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,927
Let's release everyone from their restraints too!

281
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,726
So it is locked after all.

282
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:09,426
But still, what are the criminals here for?

283
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:14,026
They're probably after the cash stored in the ATM.

284
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:15,826
For security reasons, the timing of when cash is replenished

285
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:18,126
isn't known to anyone,

286
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,026
but they could make an estimate

287
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:23,726
if they check the ATM's security footage for large deposits.

288
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,226
I see. So they wouldn't be able to do it

289
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:27,826
unless the store clerk is in on it, too.

290
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:28,827
That's right.

291
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:32,126
But why aren't they covering their faces?

292
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:35,626
The store clerk isn't even wearing sunglasses.

293
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,026
They are probably

294
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:39,926
set on leaving no hostage alive when they're done.

295
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:41,426
That can't be!

296
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:43,426
I just came in to buy some water.

297
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:45,926
I just wanted to buy my daughter some snacks.

298
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:49,127
Don't worry! We'll work something out!

299
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:56,726
Anyway, we have to figure out a way to get us all out of here.

300
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:59,226
A switchboard.

301
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,527
This could work.

302
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:03,526
That's true.

303
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,326
If something like that had happened,

304
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,326
it isn't a stretch to say that

305
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,326
Squad Leader Date would think his father was a coward.

306
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,526
Yes.

307
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:13,426
An active-duty police officer

308
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:16,026
was bowing his head to a criminal, after all.

309
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:20,026
I wouldn't say I don't understand Squad Leader's feelings.

310
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:23,926
When my father was mistakenly apprehended on suspicion of murder,

311
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:26,626
people would call me a murderer's kid,

312
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:29,826
and I was close to hating him for that.

313
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:32,626
In my case, I was told by the people at the gym

314
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:35,026
to trust my father and wait,

315
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:37,327
so it didn't break my faith in him in the end.

316
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,326
So, Morofushi...

317
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,526
I don't know what happened in your past,

318
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:44,826
but if you'd tell us,

319
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:48,726
perhaps our comments could help you out.

320
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:52,526
Help me.

321
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:54,626
What, now?

322
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:57,527
No! Look over there!

323
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:01,626
The convenience store light is flickering

324
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:05,327
like someone is giving out a signal in Morse code.

325
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:10,726
Hey, that's...

326
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:13,927
Someone is actually giving out a signal.

327
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,226
No way! It's being remodelled?

328
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:21,327
I guess we have to go to a different convenience store.

329
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:28,426
It seems the security company car has given us the signal.

330
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:31,026
Remove the sign saying the store is being remodelled.

331
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,127
Sure.

332
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:57,726
-Hey, there! -Hey, there!

333
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:00,626
What, seriously? Isn't that a rifle?

334
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:02,326
Don't be such a wuss!

335
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:05,927
It must be a fake that's used for filming or something!

336
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:08,926
Hey, what are you filming?

337
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,826
Let us be in it, too!

338
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:13,026
What's going on? What's with the commotion?

339
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,726
-Well... Three weirdoes have entered the store. -So I'll have a tequila,

340
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:17,326
-Idiot! -perfect for someone playing a police officer!

341
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,126
There are only three of them,

342
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,426
so kill them!

343
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:23,026
No way! So there's really a movie being filmed here?

344
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:25,226
That gets me so excited!

345
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:26,526
What?

346
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:30,026
Hey, guys! They said they would let us come on as extras!

347
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:33,426
-Yes. -Good!

348
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:35,726
It sure is noisy out there.

349
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:37,926
What's going on?

350
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,926
Sorry to keep you waiting, Zero!

351
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:43,626
-Hiro! -Morofushi, why are you here?

352
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:46,126
We saw the Morse code signal you put up,

353
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:49,026
so we're here to apprehend the criminals.

354
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:51,726
Not with strength,

355
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,626
but with numbers.

356
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:57,326
Well, we only did what your father would have done.

357
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:58,327
What?

358
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:00,126
Isn't that right, Hagi?

359
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,227
Yes.

360
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,826
What do you mean by

361
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:07,026
what my father would have done?

362
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:09,926
I was actually there

363
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,826
when your father was beaten up by the yakuza guy

364
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:15,526
in that convenience store.

365
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:18,426
You were there?

366
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,126
Yes.

367
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:23,326
You might not have realised this because you were taken aback

368
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:26,126
by the sight of your father covered in blood,

369
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:28,126
but a few of the man's accomplices

370
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,326
entered the store not long afterwards.

371
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:32,026
What are you doing?

372
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:34,027
The cops are coming! Run for it!

373
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:39,526
Your father had probably noticed that

374
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:43,626
the man's accomplices were hiding in a nearby car.

375
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:46,126
So even if he had apprehended the man,

376
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:49,726
there was no way he'd win if the accomplices were to come in.

377
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:51,826
There would be a scuffle inside the store,

378
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,526
and in case he had been surrounded,

379
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:56,426
the other customers would be in danger as well.

380
00:20:56,427 --> 00:21:01,427
At the time, I was there with quite a few pregnant women and old folks.

381
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,426
Besides, the police came pretty quickly.

382
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:09,226
Your father probably contacted them

383
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,026
and stopped the man in his tracks

384
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:13,526
before he could get farther into the store

385
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:15,927
until they arrived.

386
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,326
So, Squad Leader...

387
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:23,827
Your father didn't bow to beg for his life,

388
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,926
but he bowed because his police officer's heart

389
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:32,327
wouldn't let anyone else get hurt. Am I wrong?

390
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,027
Hello?

391
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:10,426
Hey, dad. How are you?

392
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:12,626
Wataru? What's the matter?

393
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:14,326
You called me out of the blue...

394
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:18,226
What? There's someone you'd like me to meet?

395
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:21,626
So you're already that age...

396
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:23,526
I'm 22 years old now.

397
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,026
It's been a while since we last saw each other,

398
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:28,826
so you might have forgotten...

399
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:32,426
Anyway, how's the police academy going for you?

400
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:35,026
Do you think you'll be able to become a good police officer?

401
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:36,926
Yes.

402
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:40,026
But I'm no match for you, dad.

403
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:42,127
Don't say something so stupid.
