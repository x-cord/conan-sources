1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,033
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,034 --> 00:00:03,933
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:05,433
An upper classman suddenly disappears.

4
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:06,933
While we trace her footsteps,

5
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:08,933
we catch glimpses of a black shadow.

6
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:10,433
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,434 --> 00:00:12,233
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:14,034
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,980
The battle with the Black Organization has settled for the time being.

10
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,580
We were all leading a peaceful school life...

11
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,279
but we got word that Shoko Amemiya, a 4th grader disappeared.

12
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,680
Moreover, she is said to resemble Haibara.

13
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,579
Don't tell me that the Black Organization has come all the way to school?

14
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,879
The elementary school student, Shoko Amemiya?

15
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,779
And? Do you remember what she bought?

16
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,779
I think it was...

17
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,279
We'd better be careful of that teacher.

18
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,279
He's acting like he's a nice man in front of us,

19
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,279
but the instant we walked away,

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,579
he was glaring with a dreadful look on his face.

21
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,679
Come to think of it, that girl went outside the store

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,579
and drank the fruit juice that she bought on the spot.

23
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,479
She swallowed it down in a gulp.

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,180
She bought fruit juice in a PET bottle, a milk carton and a cutter knife.

25
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,779
She then stops over at the kitchen goods corner.

26
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,480
Her personality resembles Haibara.

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,380
Maybe...

28
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,780
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 2)"

29
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,480
-Conan? -Conan?

30
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,280
What're you doing, Conan?

31
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,780
What's he up to?

32
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,380
Conan!

33
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,979
Just as I thought.

34
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,679
There's no doubt about it!

35
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,979
Just what're you doing, Conan?

36
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,779
If you want a PET bottle, I'll give you mine.

37
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,279
Let me call headquarters and ask them to search for the girl!

38
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,579
Wait!

39
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,879
Before that,

40
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,180
how about checking out the place that crossed my mind?

41
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,979
The place that crossed your mind?

42
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,279
Which means that you figured out where she is?

43
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Yeah.

44
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:54,279
I'm not sure if she's really there yet or not, but let's try going there.

45
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,479
After stopping by at the drugstore though.

46
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,879
The drugstore?

47
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,279
Oh, and Mr. Tanihata.

48
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,779
Yes?

49
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,480
Will you please give me some hot water that you have by the cash register?

50
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,379
Gosh.

51
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,879
Thanks to you, Conan,

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,380
this is my second time today doing cleaning monitor work.

53
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,879
Hey, Genta!

54
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,579
Cut out playing. Hurry and finish cleaning up!

55
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,379
She already said that twice to me.

56
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,979
Ayumi, did you go get it for me?

57
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,779
Yep! See.

58
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,179
Thank you.

59
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,979
Let's go then!

60
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,079
"Beika Pharmacy."

61
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,179
That'll be 470 yen.

62
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,479
Would you like a package?

63
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,979
Nope, it's fine just like that.

64
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,379
Okay. Thank you.

65
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,879
What did you buy?

66
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,279
Stick type formula for babies.

67
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,980
Formula...

68
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,379
What are you going to do with that?

69
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,679
Ayumi,

70
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,079
where's the PET bottle that Genta finished drinking out of?

71
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Here!

72
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,979
The hot water that I had the employee at the convenience store put inside

73
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,479
is still warm.

74
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
Thank you.

75
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,980
I pour the formula inside this bottle of hot water.

76
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,779
Then, shake it and mix it well.

77
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,879
Conan, just what are you going to do with it?

78
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,780
Don't tell me that you're going to raise a baby.

79
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
Yeah, that's just it.

80
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,279
It's no ordinary baby though.

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,179
Wait a minute!

82
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,579
We're looking for Shoko Amemiya,

83
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,579
the 4th grade girl who disappeared on her way to school, you know.

84
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,879
Never mind the baby!

85
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,580
I'm sure that the girl couldn't just watch and do nothing either.

86
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,980
Okay, let's have Officer Yumi show us the way then!

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,879
To the old warehouse where you planning to go

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,579
to issue tickets for illegally parked cars.

89
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,980
Okay.

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,180
Hey, are you sure she's in a place like this?

91
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,079
Talk about a dirty warehouse.

92
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,379
Cough, it's so dusty.

93
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,980
Right, that's why...

94
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,980
You have weak nasal membranes.

95
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,679
I wasn't always like this though.

96
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,779
Right?

97
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,979
Yes.

98
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,379
Officer Yumi, do you have any pets at home?

99
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,179
Yes, two dogs!

100
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,480
Sta and Hachi!

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,479
You mean you're surrounded by dogs at home, too?

102
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,479
Yes.

103
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,579
Come to think of it, yes.

104
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,779
Then, you just haven't realized

105
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,080
that you're allergic.

106
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,979
Allergic?

107
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,980
Yep. The cause of your sneezes is probably not dust.

108
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,380
Conan, where are you going?

109
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,780
Okay! Let's go, too!

110
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,979
Hey!

111
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,680
I'm going, too!

112
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,780
Wait, you guys!

113
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,080
I'll go!

114
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,180
Ms. Miyamoto.

115
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,679
Are you all okay?

116
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,179
Officer Yumi, this way!

117
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
Wait! My butt is stuck.

118
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,679
They're cute!

119
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,480
Cute?

120
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,279
I think the cause of Yumi's sneezes is them.

121
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,379
The cause of my sneezes are the kitten?

122
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,079
Right. It's not dust.

123
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,479
Your reaction was due to the dandruff that they have.

124
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,279
You mean that I'm allergic to cats?

125
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,879
Yep, most probably!

126
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,479
But this place is pretty spacious, and you can't see any dandruff!

127
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,679
Cat dandruff is very small and light!

128
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,779
That's why they go unnoticed

129
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,479
even if they're drifting in the air for a long time!

130
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,079
I see!

131
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,679
The one last thing that the girl and Ai had in common

132
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,179
that Mitsuhiko wanted to tell us about

133
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,779
was maybe that they both like animals?

134
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,179
Right, that's it!

135
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,679
That's what it was!

136
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,279
Which means that she wanted to walk home with us today

137
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,479
because she wanted to show us these kittens

138
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,479
in hope that someone would take the kittens home with them.

139
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,779
Yeah.

140
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,179
Her parents probably either do not like animals or cats,

141
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,879
so she couldn't tell her parents

142
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,779
and was taking care of them secretly by herself.

143
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,779
Look. She cut off the bottom part of the PET bottle

144
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,679
to make a milk container.

145
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,979
I see.

146
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,079
Because back at that convenience store,

147
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,679
they were out of paper plates and cups.

148
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,779
That's why she substituted it by cutting the PET bottle.

149
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,079
Yeah.

150
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,479
Which means that she stayed back in Tokyo without going to Kyushu

151
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,679
to feed these kittens milk.

152
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,580
Then, it's understandable that Shoko would suffer from lack of sleep.

153
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,180
She was probably worried about these kittens and couldn't sleep.

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,779
Well, I don't think that was the only reason

155
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,480
she suffered from lack of sleep though.

156
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,979
Hey, why are you throwing the milk away for?

157
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,079
Shoko went through a lot of trouble to get that milk!

158
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,780
Because the problem was this milk!

159
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,979
Cats do not have the enzyme to break down the lactose in milk,

160
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,379
and the nutrients

161
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,779
in the milk of grass-eating cows and meat-eating cats differ.

162
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,979
So if milk is given as is to cats,

163
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,479
it will give them an upset stomach and they may stop drinking all together.

164
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,379
That's if you warm up baby formula for humans

165
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:49,780
to about 38 degrees and dilute it with 2 parts water and give it to them.

166
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,179
They're drinking, they're drinking!

167
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,579
The fact that the kittens didn't drink the milk

168
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,179
was one of the things that she was worried about, too!

169
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,779
It seems that she thought that the kittens would drink

170
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,579
if she changed the dirty dishes.

171
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,979
Of course this is an emergency measure

172
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,879
if there are no pet shops nearby and you cannot get milk for cats.

173
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,179
And?

174
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,679
Where is the girl,

175
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,880
Shoko Amemiya?

176
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,479
Yeah.

177
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,979
Strange.

178
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,080
I thought she'd still be here because she is worried.

179
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,679
What?

180
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,179
Conan?

181
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,079
I don't know what it is, but...

182
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,180
Let's go!

183
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,680
Not again.

184
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,479
My butt's stuck again.

185
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,879
Where's he going?

186
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,480
Is it this way this time?

187
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,980
My butt hurts.

188
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,080
What?

189
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,279
There was another one.

190
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,879
There are three all together.

191
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,080
I wonder why only this one was outside.

192
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,380
Now what?

193
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,180
Where is it?

194
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
This is...

195
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,979
What's that?

196
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,080
A broken piece of the blinker of a car.

197
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,279
It probably shattered off when it bumped into the telephone pole.

198
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,979
The piece is still brand new,

199
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,679
so I think the accident happened just recently.

200
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,479
But I don't think there were any reports of accidents near here.

201
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
Look.

202
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,780
Isn't this...

203
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,180
human blood?

204
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,479
It goes all the way from the telephone pole to in front of the warehouse.

205
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,580
And over here!

206
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,779
There are traces of a car braking.

207
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,479
Could it be that Shoko was run over by a car?

208
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,879
Yeah, we can't really say,

209
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,679
but it's quite likely.

210
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,080
What...

211
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,119
Yeah, I can't say for sure,

212
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,119
but the possibility that a car was involved in some way is high.

213
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,819
Most likely when Shoko carried the kitten,

214
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,719
it slipped out of her hand.

215
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,219
She went after the kitten,

216
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,119
and when she jumped out in the street,

217
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,820
she ran into the car.

218
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,719
Which means...

219
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,719
Is it hit-and-run?

220
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,519
No. If so, the driver would've left the girl behind and fled.

221
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,319
The fact that no report of an accident have not been made yet,

222
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,319
means that there are no eye-witnesses.

223
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,319
If so, where did Shoko go?

224
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,220
Where do these blood stains lead to?

225
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,819
The blood stains return.

226
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,519
They're returning to where they began?

227
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,119
Are the blood stains those of the driver?

228
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,220
If so, the thinkable thing is...

229
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,819
Officer Yumi,

230
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,020
can you check the hospitals in this area?

231
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,120
Okay.

232
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,920
Thank you very much.

233
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,220
Come to think of it, isn't the Niide Hospital near here?

234
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,319
Huh? Conan!

235
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,519
Hello...

236
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,019
What brings you all here?

237
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,319
Hey.

238
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,920
Is the owner of the car parked in front of the hospital here?

239
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,319
That man had a wound that required about three stitches,

240
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,519
in addition to a slight concussion,

241
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,719
so he's still asleep in bed.

242
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,719
Did he mention anything about a girl?

243
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,319
Rather, he came carrying her in here.

244
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,819
He came in here smeared with blood saying that he ran over a girl

245
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,119
so he asked for help.

246
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,419
Smeared with blood?

247
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,919
Oh, no.

248
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,420
The man was the one smeared with blood.

249
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,919
The girl

250
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,719
is asleep on the bed over here

251
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,620
and Hikaru is examining her.

252
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,719
Is she hurt?

253
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,819
No.

254
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,719
She's asleep because she didn't have enough sleep.

255
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,120
It seems she didn't sleep at all last night.

256
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,619
She told me so when she woke up a while ago.

257
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,219
She thought she was run over by a car,

258
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,219
fainted and fell asleep.

259
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,919
Then why didn't you contact the school about this?

260
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,919
I did ask for the telephone number of her home and tried calling,

261
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,119
but no one answered.

262
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,519
She went to sleep again before I got to ask her what her name was.

263
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,019
Her school bag seems to have been inside the man's car.

264
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,419
I was thinking of asking her for the details after she got up

265
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,719
because she looked to be so deeply asleep.

266
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,620
But I'm so glad.

267
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,119
I'm glad that Ms. Amemiya is okay.

268
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,520
Really.

269
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,320
What's the matter?

270
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,919
Today was not a good day for me.

271
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,719
I didn't know what I would do if something had happened to her.

272
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,820
Hey, don't cry, Mr. Hirayama.

273
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,419
Excuse me.

274
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,319
I think you should contact the school about this quickly, don't you?

275
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,219
That's right!

276
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,319
My cell phone, phone.

277
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,319
Come on!

278
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,619
It seems that the teacher wasn't one of them.

279
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,419
No, I guess not.

280
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,520
I found it!

281
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,019
Hello. This is Hirayama!

282
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,319
I wonder what is was though.

283
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,819
His gaze. That looked as if he was glaring at us.

284
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,519
Well, since his eyes are bad,

285
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,020
he probably squinted to take a good look.

286
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,320
Which means he's wearing glasses with lens that don't fit his eyes?

287
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,119
He did mention, didn't he?

288
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,219
He fell off the stairs today.

289
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,619
He had a wound on the top part of his eye.

290
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,819
He probably dropped or cracked his contact lens at that time,

291
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,819
so he decided to wear his glasses that he used to use before

292
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,819
with much weaker lens than now for the time being!

293
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,619
Don't you remember? He tried to touch his wound

294
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,120
and his finger pushed his glasses, making them slip.

295
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,220
It's proof that he usually wears contact lens!

296
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,820
I'll bet you want to say that's why his action looked so stupid.

297
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,419
If he were one of them,

298
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,919
isn't there a possibility that he deliberately do so,

299
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,819
to keep us off our guard?

300
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,019
Yeah, that thought raced through my mind for an instant.

301
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,519
But I was convinced that he wasn't one of them

302
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,519
from his remarks that followed.

303
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,619
Who are you children?

304
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,819
Do you live in this neighbourhood?

305
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,819
That remark convinced me!

306
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,719
How?

307
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,019
An elementary school teacher would usually ask,

308
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,019
"Where are you students from?"

309
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,419
We were all carrying our school bags back then.

310
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,319
The more so if he were one of them disguised as a teacher.

311
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,019
That's how I figured out that he was a teacher

312
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,219
who had lost his contacts and was using glasses just for the time being,

313
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,619
who couldn't see us very well.

314
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,620
But what if he was perfectly acting out his role as that type of teacher?

315
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,519
There's no reason for him to act out such a complicated person.

316
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,519
Besides, if he thoughtlessly happened to say something like that,

317
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,120
he's no enemy.

318
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,220
The ones that I'm afraid of are people like Bellmot...

319
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,320
who sneak up from behind with precise accuracy.

320
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,919
That's what happened today.

321
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,720
I'm glad that the girl Shoko was found.

322
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,420
Shoots.

323
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,919
And? What happened to the kittens?

324
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,319
The new teacher took one,

325
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,119
and Dr. Niide took the other two.

326
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,120
He said he's going to see if any of his patients would be interested.

327
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,619
Dad?

328
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,419
Why don't we take one of the cats?

329
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,019
No way!

330
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,819
It'll scratch the house all over and ruin the rooms!

331
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,019
Besides, if we get a cat,

332
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,019
it could become a big headed woman.

333
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,119
Are you talking about mom?

334
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,719
I wonder.

335
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,719
Besides, we don't need any more new free loaders.

336
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,419
Gosh.

337
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,919
Oh, right!

338
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,419
Talking about new, today at school...

339
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,919
Hey, Conan.

340
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,420
Conan, listen too.

341
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,719
Are you asleep?

342
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,920
I guess so much happened today that you're tired.

343
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,519
And? Did a new teacher come to your school, too?

344
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,619
Nope, a new student.

345
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,320
A boy came.

346
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,119
He looks a lot like that announcer, Reina Mizunashi!

347
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,419
He said that he has nothing to do with her and that he just looks like her.

348
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,119
He said that he wants to come to our place once,

349
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,620
so I'll introduce him to you when he does!

350
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,119
"Next Episode" -A boy?

351
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,319
Huh? Wasn't she supposed to be a high school girl

352
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,520
who resembled Reina Mizunashi the announcer?

353
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,920
No, Pops!

354
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,619
In other words, this is carbon monoxide poisoning

355
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,019
that was carried out by burning solid fuel in a sealed car.

356
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,019
No. This is cleverly schemed homicide that was set up to look as suicide.

357
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,719
Moreover, the culprit is probably...

358
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,220
Next Conan, "The Point of No Return (Part 1)"

359
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,119
Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,419
"Bad sleeping posture."

361
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,419
Haibara, do you have good sleeping posture?

362
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,220
Would you like to sleep with me and find out for yourself?
