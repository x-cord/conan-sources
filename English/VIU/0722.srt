1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,938
I'm not letting you through!

2
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:09,738
There...

3
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:12,038
I'm not letting you overtake me!

4
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:13,338
There...

5
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:14,638
Oh no!

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:15,638
Go after him!

7
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:18,538
Okay, come!

8
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:19,638
There!

9
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:24,238
All right! Fourth point!

10
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:25,938
Conan, you're fantastic!

11
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:27,438
Yes!

12
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:30,138
No fair.

13
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,238
Maybe there's something wrong with the rule.

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,938
What about it is wrong?

15
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:35,338
We're playing two against one,

16
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:37,838
and you've got more players on your side!

17
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:41,638
Besides, I only get to kick with my left leg too.

18
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:44,038
Then, I guess you'll have to not use your left leg.

19
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:47,238
Hey... then, all I get to use is my head.

20
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:49,438
But, if Conan uses his head,

21
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:51,138
I think we'll be in more trouble.

22
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:53,038
Then, don't use your head either!

23
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:57,138
Hey... what're you getting all worked up about?

24
00:00:57,138 --> 00:01:00,038
We're just playing to empty our stomach

25
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:02,238
until the Christmas cake arrives at Doc's house, right?

26
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,738
So, all we have to do is kill time for the next two hours, right?

27
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:06,738
Go for it!

28
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:08,238
Huh?

29
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:09,238
Hey, no fair!

30
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,238
-Haibara! -Okay!

31
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,338
Huh?

32
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,538
Here goes!

33
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,938
Mr. Higo's special play, non-spin!

34
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,638
Lucky.

35
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:24,138
What do you think you're doing, Haibara?

36
00:01:24,138 --> 00:01:27,738
I'm sorry, I should've made a better pass...

37
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:28,838
That's not it.

38
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,838
Huh?

39
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:33,038
I couldn't kick the ball

40
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:36,238
because this little one came out in front of the ball.

41
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:39,938
Yes, come here.

42
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:41,938
Oh my, how cute!

43
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:43,038
A cat.

44
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:44,938
Huh? It's Tai!

45
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,938
Tai?

46
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:49,238
You know that cat?

47
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:51,738
Yeah! He's a stray that has a territory

48
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:55,038
around the fifth district where the Mouri Detective Agency is.

49
00:01:55,038 --> 00:01:57,838
He likes Azusa of coffee shop Poirot

50
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:01,038
and comes to beg for food around sundown.

51
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,938
So, the manager of the coffee shop named him

52
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:07,538
after the great Detective Poirot's friend, Captain Hasting

53
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:10,138
because he always hangs around Poirot.

54
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:13,038
So, that's why his name is Tai!

55
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:15,538
But, is he really a stray?

56
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:17,138
He's wearing a collar.

57
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,738
It seems that he belonged to someone before, though.

58
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,738
Your sweater got caught

59
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:31,438
on the cat's nail and unraveled.

60
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:33,438
This is handmade, you see.

61
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:37,438
Nevermind that but I wonder where it's going?

62
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:38,838
It may go out into the road

63
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:41,038
and get run over!

64
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:42,638
Let's go after it!

65
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:44,538
We'd better hurry.

66
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,038
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

67
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:04,038
are slashed by the light of deduction.

68
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:05,638
The members of the detective squad are locked

69
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:07,738
in a surprising case inside a refrigerated vehicle compartment.

70
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,238
He sees through the one and only truth.

71
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:11,238
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

72
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:13,838
His name is Detective Conan!

73
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,970
"A Sweet, Cold Courier (Part 1)"

74
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,370
Where'd it go?

75
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,970
It's nowhere in sight.

76
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,070
Oh, there it is!

77
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,170
Behind the car!

78
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,170
Oh, yeah!

79
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,170
It's in a place like that.

80
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,570
It went inside!

81
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,670
Oh no!

82
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,770
I wonder if it smelt fish or things like that,

83
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,970
that are in the back of the truck.

84
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,770
Let's hurry and go get it.

85
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,870
"Cheeta Courier"

86
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,370
The driver's nowhere in sight.

87
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,470
Then, we'll just have to go inside and bring it back out.

88
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,570
It's cold.

89
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,170
This seems to be a refrigerated car.

90
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,370
Tai, where are you?

91
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,070
Tai!

92
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,570
There it is.

93
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,670
Tai.

94
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,970
What a troublesome cat.

95
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,270
You can say that again.

96
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,070
Okay, let's go, Tai.

97
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,970
Not again. You left the door open again!

98
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,070
Huh?

99
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,370
Oh, sorry.

100
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,670
Be careful!

101
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,070
Yeah.

102
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,770
Oh, wait...

103
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,270
Excuse me!

104
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,470
I think I heard the voice of a child or something.

105
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,970
I guess you would, because there's a park nearby.

106
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,770
Oh, I guess so.

107
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,770
They started off without being aware of us!

108
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,170
We're in trouble!

109
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,970
Are we going to freeze too?

110
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,170
Don't worry!

111
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,470
Huh...

112
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,770
There are so many undelivered boxes

113
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,870
that are specified to be delivered today, you see.

114
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,070
Let's have the delivery men let us out

115
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,570
when they open the door during the next delivery.

116
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,770
Hey, wait...

117
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,270
It stopped.

118
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,770
They'll probably be surprised out of their wits

119
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,070
if we come out from inside.

120
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,970
But, they'll scold us too.

121
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,070
Well, we did it for a reason,

122
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,870
so if we tell them honestly...

123
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,470
No.

124
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,670
If you go out now, I'll never forgive you!

125
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,270
Haibara...

126
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,570
Just what are you doing?

127
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,470
In just your underwear?

128
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,870
The yarn of my sweater got caught onto something

129
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,270
and my sweater unraveled.

130
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,270
So, it's gone.

131
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,170
Don't shine the light on me.

132
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,370
Oh, sorry.

133
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,770
Oh, here they come.

134
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,870
Let's hide!

135
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,070
Hey! Just what're you doing?

136
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,070
Hurry up and make the delivery.

137
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,570
I still think I hear voices from inside.

138
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,670
You idiot, why would you?

139
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,370
That's true.

140
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,570
Hurry it up, will you?

141
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,970
Yeah.

142
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,570
The next delivery is...

143
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,970
The Sasagawa residence, at Beika condominium room 205!

144
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,170
Yes... the Sasagawa residence.

145
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,170
Oh, here it is...

146
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,970
This is the one. Assorted fruits.

147
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,270
Hurry and delivery it then.

148
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,570
Drop the delivery at the entrance,

149
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,970
so that the resident will remember your face and name.

150
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,070
The resident is an important witness, you see.

151
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,370
-Witness? -Yeah, I know.

152
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,370
In the mean time, I'll go borrow the men's room again

153
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,170
at a nearby convenience store.

154
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,970
Hey, don't you think we should check inside

155
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,670
the back of the truck just in case?

156
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,270
I'm concerned about the voices I hear.

157
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,670
I'm telling you to not worry about it.

158
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,370
But...

159
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,470
Don't get chicken!

160
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,970
He could never let out a sound.

161
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,670
Can't make a sound?

162
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,770
Come on, hurry it up, will you?

163
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,370
Yeah.

164
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,670
The two just now...

165
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,370
Don't tell me that they...

166
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,570
Please wear my jacket for the time being.

167
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,570
Thank you, you're a life-saver.

168
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,570
You're welcome.

169
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,670
We'd better hurry on out of here,

170
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,970
or we'll all catch cold.

171
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,670
Don't worry.

172
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,770
I can go out now since I'm wearing this.

173
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,970
True!

174
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,070
But, all you're wearing is a jacket,

175
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,470
so would you like to carry Tai?

176
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,970
He's warm.

177
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,870
Yes, I guess so.

178
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,570
So, the next time the men open the door,

179
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,370
let's have them let us out!

180
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,370
Yeah...

181
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,170
No, I don't think we should.

182
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,070
Huh...

183
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,070
It seems somebody else...

184
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,370
was already on this truck before us.

185
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,070
Just what do you mean?

186
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,670
I wonder...

187
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,670
I don't know who or where he came from,

188
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,870
nor do I know why he was killed,

189
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,770
but I'm sure that the ones who did it are the two delivery men.

190
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,170
What...

191
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,970
Are you serious?

192
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,470
But why is he in the back of the truck like this?

193
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,870
Because this truck is equipped with a refrigeration device.

194
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,570
Leaving him in here

195
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,470
would delay the decaying process of the corpse,

196
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,270
thus, also delay the estimated time of death.

197
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,170
Even if they were to drop him off somewhere later

198
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,070
and he's found,

199
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,170
the two would've been working busily

200
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,170
during the time of the crime.

201
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,670
They deliberately wanted to take the delivery to the front door

202
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,070
so that they could leave an impression

203
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,770
of their face and name to the resident,

204
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,770
because so that later when questioned by the police,

205
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,370
the resident would testify

206
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,570
that they certainly made the delivery at that time.

207
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,070
Borrowing the men's room frequently,

208
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,570
his face would show up on the surveillance camera

209
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,970
and serve as an alibi.

210
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,570
No one would suspect him

211
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,870
if he says that he had an upset stomach or something.

212
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,070
Besides, look.

213
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,070
The cardboard box that the corpse is inside.

214
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,270
The corners are squashed

215
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,570
and the sides are dirty too, right?

216
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,970
They deliberately rolled the box with the corpse inside,

217
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,170
so that livor mortis won't be conspicuous.

218
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,170
Hey, wait a minute.

219
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,170
Are you saying that if the two men find us here...

220
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,370
Yeah.

221
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,470
All five of us will probably be locked in here.

222
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,570
So that they can freeze us to death.

223
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,270
No way...

224
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,370
Isn't there anything we can do?

225
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,070
Why don't we burst through the door

226
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,370
as soon as it opens?

227
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,470
It won't work.

228
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,370
If under normal circumstances, maybe,

229
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,970
but with this stiff body,

230
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,970
I don't think it's possible

231
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,770
for all of us to make it outside.

232
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,470
Well, don't worry.

233
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,370
Let us deliver those two men...

234
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,837
To prison.

235
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:13,887
And...

236
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:15,187
What're we going to do?

237
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:16,987
Just how do you intend

238
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,887
to nab the two delivery men?

239
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,987
Please tell us, Conan!

240
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:24,087
We're not going to nab them.

241
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:26,287
We're going to have an outsider nab them.

242
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,587
Huh...

243
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:29,487
The cell phone.

244
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:32,987
We'll use it to call Officer Takagi at MPD.

245
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,187
We'll tell him that the delivery men of the Cheeta Courier are evil

246
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:38,687
and that they have a corpse

247
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,487
in the refrigerated compartment of their truck.

248
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:43,387
We'll tell him that we're locked in the compartment too,

249
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,787
so to set up a checkpoint

250
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:48,887
and check the compartment of the delivery truck.

251
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:51,387
I memorized then license plate of the truck,

252
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:52,887
so everything should work out fine.

253
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,087
What...

254
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,287
You're going to make a call?

255
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:57,887
I thought you had a more far out idea.

256
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,287
Well, in this situation,

257
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:04,287
I guess there's nothing more that can be done, is there?

258
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:05,387
That's right...

259
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:08,187
So, will one of you lend me your cell phone?

260
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,287
I'm charging my cell at Doc's place.

261
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,887
I left mine at Doc's house too.

262
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:17,087
I didn't want to drop mine when playing soccer so...

263
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,487
I did bring mine along,

264
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,587
but just a little while ago, the charge buzzer sounded,

265
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:24,287
so I don't know if it'd be of any use.

266
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,087
Lend it to me, will you?

267
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,487
I'll revive the battery.

268
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:31,287
-Huh? -Revive the battery?

269
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:32,987
Can you do something like that?

270
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:36,887
Yeah, you take the battery out like this

271
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:39,087
and warm it up with body temperature.

272
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:40,387
The voltage rises a bit

273
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,387
and you can use it for a little while move.

274
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:46,087
Well, I'm sure that it'll be enough

275
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:48,787
to explain this situation to Officer Takagi.

276
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,787
Oh, it the sound of brakes!

277
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:53,187
Those guys are going to come back in.

278
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:54,487
-Let's hide. -Okay...

279
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:58,087
We've gotta watch out.

280
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:12,487
The only delivery we have for the fourth district

281
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:15,187
are the Yamada and Nishino residence?

282
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,487
Yeah.

283
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:20,487
But, before that,

284
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:22,987
it's about time we move the box with the corpse inside.

285
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,787
I guess so.

286
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:27,087
It's already been about two hours.

287
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:32,087
Here goes...

288
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:35,087
Okay, now it'll keep for another two hours

289
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:37,887
without livor mortis appearing.

290
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:39,387
What's wrong?

291
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:43,287
It looks like the masking tape had been pulled off once.

292
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:44,387
Huh?

293
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:47,187
You idiot! Just who are you saying pulled it off.

294
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,287
-Oh, no. -What...

295
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,587
I thought I just heard a cat...

296
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:56,087
Heck, what's with you anyway?

297
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,787
First, you say you hear the voices of kids,

298
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:00,287
then now you say you hear a cat?

299
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:01,987
But...

300
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:04,387
Well, you did kill a person,

301
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,887
so I can understand you feeling uncomfortable.

302
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:08,687
I'm really sorry

303
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:11,587
that things had to turn out this way just because of me.

304
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,087
It can't be helped.

305
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,087
It coincidentally turned out that the house you made a delivery to

306
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,787
was the of the husband of the woman you were having an affair with,

307
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,687
and he snapped and attacked you

308
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,287
saying that you were to blame for him getting a divorce.

309
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:25,587
I had no intention of killing him.

310
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:28,487
I tried to pull free from his grasp and knocked him down.

311
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,187
He hit his head somewhere

312
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:32,387
and stopped moving completely.

313
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:35,587
Well, you did then right thing

314
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:37,787
to call me before contacting the police.

315
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:39,887
We did get a hold of the wallet

316
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:42,087
with a lot of cash in it too, besides.

317
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:45,587
But, are you sure nobody's going to find out?

318
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:47,287
Don't worry.

319
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:48,487
After a while, we'll take the corpse back

320
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:52,087
to his house where he previously was and leave him there.

321
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:55,287
After some time, we'll go back to his place

322
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,887
and contact the police telling them

323
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:58,687
that we just found the body.

324
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:00,587
Then, everything will be okay.

325
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:02,987
I guess so.

326
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:06,187
Well, we could crack a window glass

327
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:08,987
to make them think that he was robbed and attacked.

328
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:13,687
After all, we've got loads of people

329
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,487
to prove our alibi.

330
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:16,487
Yeah.

331
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:21,487
I see.

332
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:24,687
So, it turned out to be a homicide.

333
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:27,087
At any rate, let's report this to Officer Takagi.

334
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:33,187
We will be taking off soon.

335
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:35,187
Please switch off your cell phones,

336
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:40,687
laptops game and electronic devices etc.

337
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,787
I am sorry.

338
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:44,087
I was trying to confirm the vicinity

339
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,787
of the Kyoto Prefectural Police area

340
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,787
where we're supposed to go pick up the suspect,

341
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,187
but how am I supposed to switch this off?

342
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:52,487
Push the power switch down for a while!

343
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:58,587
All because you bought a smartphone trying to look edgy.

344
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:00,687
Did you switch yours off already?

345
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,187
Yes! For some time already!

346
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:07,387
The number you have called

347
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:10,287
is out of service range or switched off.

348
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:13,487
So, your call cannot be completed.

349
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,387
No good, I can't get through.

350
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:16,687
No.

351
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:18,087
I've got no choice.

352
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,987
I'll call Doc and explain our situation.

353
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:27,487
Oh, yes, this is Agasa.

354
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,487
Doc? It's me.

355
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,287
Jot down what I'm about to tell you.

356
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:32,787
Oh, I'm sorry.

357
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:35,187
My hands are tied just yet.

358
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,687
Hold on a minute.

359
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:38,687
-Hey! -Hot!

360
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,087
What's cooking?

361
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,487
Okay.

362
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:46,087
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

363
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:48,087
I though just cake wouldn't be enough,

364
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:50,287
so I was deep frying doughnuts.

365
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:52,187
Well, it won't be as good

366
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:55,487
as the exclusive Christmas cake from the famous shop, but...

367
00:17:56,787 --> 00:17:59,387
Huh? He hung up.

368
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:00,787
Well, if it's anything important,

369
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:03,387
I guess he'll call back.

370
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:06,287
Darn, the battery's run out.

371
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:08,587
Then, maybe if you warm it up again...

372
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,587
Once the battery's completely used up,

373
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,987
warming it up is not going to revive it.

374
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,487
So, what now?

375
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:19,387
You guys, put out what you have in front of me.

376
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,987
I'll try thinking whether I can do something using them.

377
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:24,787
Okay...

378
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:31,487
I have a handkerchief, pocket tissue,

379
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,787
candy and a cotton swab.

380
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:34,987
The cotton swab is what was left

381
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:38,287
after mommy cleaned my ears for me this morning.

382
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:41,787
It's not used, so don't worry.

383
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,587
-How about you, Genta? -I...

384
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:47,187
I have a band-aid, chocolate bar,

385
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:50,287
and anti-itching ointment for frost bites.

386
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:51,487
Anti-itching ointment?

387
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:54,887
Oh, I never got frost bites,

388
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:58,187
but mom kept nagging me to keep it with me.

389
00:18:58,187 --> 00:18:59,287
And, what about you, Mitsuhiko?

390
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,587
I...

391
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:04,887
A memo pad, a bal point pen to go with it,

392
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:08,987
handkerchief, a wallet, and a taxi receipt.

393
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:10,887
A taxi receipt?

394
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:14,087
Yes. When I woke up and was washing my face,

395
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,987
I found it on the floor near the washing machine.

396
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:20,087
Mother probably wanting to wash father's clothes,

397
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:23,687
checked the pocket and it dropped out.

398
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:27,087
I forgot to give it back to mother.

399
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:31,087
Next the only thing I have left is the jacket I lent Haibara.

400
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,287
I wore it right after it came back from the cleaners

401
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,487
that I don't think there's anything inside.

402
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:39,187
How about you, Haibara? Do you have anything?

403
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:40,387
Huh?

404
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,587
Oh, that's right.

405
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:43,787
You only have underwear on you.

406
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:44,787
Shut up.

407
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:53,687
But, I don't think you can do with these things.

408
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:56,387
How about writing help on a paper

409
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:57,887
from Mitsuhiko's memo pad,

410
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:01,787
tearing it off and dropping out of the car?

411
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:04,187
Oh, that sounds good.

412
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:05,587
With that much space under the door,

413
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,687
it looks like we can push a paper through.

414
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:11,887
But even if someone were to pick it up,

415
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:15,187
there's no guarantee that they'll call the police right away.

416
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:18,687
Besides, if we can get the paper outside, it'll be okay,

417
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:19,987
but if it gets stuck and we can't get it outside,

418
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,487
that's it for us.

419
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:25,087
The next time the delivery men open the back door of the truck

420
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:27,887
and find the paper stuck to the door,

421
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:31,687
they'll find out that someone is inside.

422
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,987
I see.

423
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,687
Then, what're we going to do?

424
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,387
-Beats me. -What do you mean, beats me?

425
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:43,187
You sure are easygoing, aren't you?

426
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:44,487
If only you didn't jump into

427
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:47,987
the back of this truck to begin with...

428
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:53,587
If I remember correctly, this cat...

429
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,387
I get it! There's a way.

430
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:02,387
No, but I guess that's too far-fetched.

431
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,687
What? If you came up with something,

432
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,087
tell us about it.

433
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,687
Huh?

434
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:11,787
The stop that this delivery truck made just before now

435
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,987
was at Beika Condo in the third district.

436
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:16,987
The two houses that they stopped at now was in the fourth district.

437
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,587
So, the next stop would be?

438
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:21,487
The fifth district?

439
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:22,587
Right.

440
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:24,987
The territory of this cat, Tai.

441
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,787
The fifth district where he goes to beg for food

442
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,087
at coffee shop Poirot.

443
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:32,287
I see!

444
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:33,487
You're going to make Tai go

445
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,887
and deliver a note that asks help for us!

446
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,587
If we stick it in between its collar,

447
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,187
I'm sure Azusa will notice it!

448
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:41,987
Let's do it!

449
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:43,287
Yeah.

450
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:44,987
But...

451
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:47,287
If those two men catch Tai

452
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:50,887
and see the paper attached to its collar...

453
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:53,287
I've already figured that part out too.

454
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:54,987
Huh?

455
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:57,287
I'll think up a code that they won't figure out

456
00:21:57,287 --> 00:22:00,087
even if they were to see it.

457
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,887
A code?

458
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:41,387
-"Next Episode" -A code?

Oh, Tai.

461
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:46,987
You're late today.

462
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:50,087
It's been a while since we let the cat go,

463
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,287
but nobody's coming to help us.

464
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,487
I wonder is that code was too difficult after all.

465
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:58,387
Or maybe the piece of paper with the code

466
00:23:58,387 --> 00:23:59,887
came off from the collar partway.

467
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:03,387
No way.

468
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:04,787
