1
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:05,973
Yumi!

2
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:09,472
Yumi, wait!

3
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:12,472
Officer Chiba?

4
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,672
I just checked with the traffic department

5
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:20,172
and was told that you were patrolling Haido-cho on October 4th.

6
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:23,172
October 4th?

7
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:26,472
You mean, that unusually hot day.

8
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:29,772
Did you see anything while you were on patrol?

9
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:32,372
Like what?

10
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:35,572
Don't tell me you're still investigating that weird case.

11
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:37,872
Yes, sort of.

12
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:41,872
Only the victim and that man were at the scene, right?

13
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:46,172
So why don't you just bring him in and get him to confess?

14
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:49,472
No, I can't do that.

15
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:51,772
Kazunobu Chiba.

16
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:54,872
He has an exceptionally strong sense of justice.

17
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:57,472
He's my childhood friend

18
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,373
and my first love.

19
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,072
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

20
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,172
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

21
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,172
Here's another fretful couple.

22
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:20,372
A queer case brings them close together?

23
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,072
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:23,972
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:26,473
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:55,095 --> 00:03:00,295
"Chiba's Difficult UFO Case (Part 1)"

27
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,940
Kazunobu Chiba.

28
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:05,840
-So, did you see anything? -He has an exceptionally strong sense of justice.

29
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:08,940
-No! I didn't see anything suspicious, okay? -He's my childhood friend

30
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,940
and my first love.

31
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,040
I'm going home then.

32
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,340
I've got a TV program I want to watch too.

33
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,041
Don't cross!

34
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,240
The signal's red!

35
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,640
Who cares?

36
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:24,340
There are no cars

37
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,040
and nobody's watching.

38
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm watching.

39
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,440
And you're watching too.

40
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:32,940
If you go easy on yourself and break the rules once,

41
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:34,840
it can turn into a habit!

42
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,940
And habits aren't easy to fix!

43
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:40,641
You don't know something as simple as that?

44
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,940
His only faults are that he's a little too strict about rules

45
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,840
and that he still doesn't remember me.

46
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:00,140
-How about you? -What?

47
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:03,140
You were riding the mini patrol car together with Yumi, weren't you?

48
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:06,340
Don't you remember if you saw something weird that day?

49
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,940
I know it was three months ago,

50
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:09,940
but if you think it over calmly, I'm sure you'll remember.

51
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,140
Jeez.

52
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,240
You're the one who needs to remember!

53
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,140
-What? -Well, you know...

54
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:19,640
Weird like what?

55
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:23,240
Well, like...

56
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:24,741
an alien, maybe?

57
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:29,241
-What? -An alien?

58
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,440
Of course not, right?

59
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,241
I'll go ask somebody else!

60
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,440
Gee, he's so dense.

61
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,940
Did he gain weight again?

62
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:44,440
You think so?

63
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:46,840
He looks to be a little rounder.

64
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:50,140
He's more than round. He's obese. Obese!

65
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,540
He'll die young!

66
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,140
He's the type you wouldn't want for a boyfriend, right?

67
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,740
I know what you mean.

68
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:00,740
Even if he were to be the last man in this universe,

69
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,840
I wouldn't go with Officer Chiba!

70
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:04,440
Hey, you two!

71
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:07,240
Quit chatting and get going on patrol!

72
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,941
-Yes, ma'am! -Yes, ma'am!

73
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:17,541
Hey, you look scary.

74
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:24,140
Yes, coming.

75
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,940
Hello, manager.

76
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:28,540
A package arrived for you,

77
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,240
so I kept it for you.

78
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,440
Thank you very much.

79
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:35,240
Be careful when you open it though.

80
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:38,941
There was something strange written in the sender's field.

81
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:44,641
Your biggest fan in the universe?

82
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,140
"Mouri Detective Agency"

83
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:50,340
An alien?

84
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:53,040
Are you asking me to search for an alien?

85
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,340
Yes!

86
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,840
You're asking me the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri?

87
00:05:56,841 --> 00:06:00,140
Well, it says so on your website.

88
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,740
"Hina Wada (17)" -We'll travel to the end of the universe

89
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:04,140
"Haido High School, Second-Year" -to search for missing people.

90
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:06,540
The Mouri Detective Agency.

91
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:10,440
That just means I'm willing to work that hard.

92
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:14,540
She's not asking you to go on a space hunt, you know.

93
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,140
Right, Hina?

94
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:20,440
Yes! I definitely saw it with my own eyes.

95
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,440
An Unidentified Flying Object.

96
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:25,940
Unidentified Flying Object?

97
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,240
UFO?

98
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,940
What kind of shape was it?

99
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:33,541
It was a long slender cylinder shape.

100
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,840
A cigar type UFO!

101
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:39,240
You saw it near Haido Park, right?

102
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:42,340
Yeah, while I was jogging with my club.

103
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:46,040
But are you sure it wasn't a blimp?

104
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,140
They're shapes are similar you see.

105
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:52,340
Similar...

106
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,340
Come to think of it, the Sister From Another Domain

107
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,640
that Sera's hiding in her hotel room

108
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:00,440
looked a lot like Haibara.

109
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:03,740
If they're related,

110
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:06,740
that would mean Sera's older brother, Akai,

111
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:09,740
and Haibara are related too.

112
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,140
Wait, wait.

113
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:15,640
Haibara's older sister, Akemi Miyano and Akai used to be...

114
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,540
Conan?

115
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,540
What're you doing, Conan?

116
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,040
Aren't you coming?

117
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,640
Go where?

118
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,140
To the place where Hina witnessed the UFO.

119
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:30,640
Yoko played an extraterrestrial investigator on TV the other day,

120
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:34,241
so Dad's really into UFOs right now.

121
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:40,540
You're in the karate club too, Hina?

122
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,840
That's why you know each other even though you go to different schools.

123
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:45,040
That's right.

124
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:49,640
We usually run into each other at the semi-finals of karate tournaments.

125
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:52,740
I've never beaten Ran, though.

126
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:56,240
No wonder she looked familiar.

127
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:59,140
And, I saw the UFO

128
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:01,940
at our summer training camp.

129
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:05,240
I told the other club members and my friends,

130
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,140
but they didn't believe me.

131
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:11,740
Then I remembered that Ran's dad was the Sleeping Kogoro!

132
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,340
If UFOs exist,

133
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,540
I thought aliens do too.

134
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,940
So I figured no harm trying

135
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:19,740
and sent Ran an e-mail to ask for help finding it.

136
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:23,740
And? What if aliens actually do exist?

137
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:25,440
I'll ask them why they came to Earth,

138
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:27,240
or about the planet they're from

139
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,840
and if they'll let me ride their craft.

140
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,840
I've got so many things I want to ask them.

141
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:37,440
But they may be super unfriendly aliens, you know.

142
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:38,640
Of course!

143
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:41,540
If so, we'll talk with our fists!

144
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,940
That's what I practice karate for!

145
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,941
I see.

146
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,741
This is the place, right here!

147
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:01,440
I saw the UFO flying between the two trees.

148
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,840
It went into Haido Park,

149
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:08,040
I rushed up the stairs and looked around inside the park,

150
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,940
but couldn't find anything.

151
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:14,040
I was jogging and didn't have my cell phone,

152
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,240
so I couldn't take pictures either, you see.

153
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:19,440
But if you were jogging together with the members of the training camp,

154
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,840
maybe some other members saw it too.

155
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,340
But the thing is,

156
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:28,540
I had muscle pains because I worked so hard on my "Beat Ranmaru" practice,

157
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:33,040
so only I had a different menu from everyone else and was running slow.

158
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,240
Ranmaru?

159
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,440
Well, Mouri Ran sounds a lot like Mori Ranmaru,

160
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,540
so that's what I call it.

161
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,740
Beat Nobunaga's sycophant! You know, like so.

162
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:45,241
Really?

163
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:49,340
What? Isn't this place...

164
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,840
And? How's Natsuko doing?

165
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,540
Well, she's seriously injured with a depressed skull fracture.

166
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,140
The surgery somehow finished,

167
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:58,540
but she has regained consciousness yet.

168
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,840
I see.

169
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:04,140
How did you figure out that maybe she was a school teacher?

170
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:07,140
Inside the bag that was on the ground near her,

171
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,940
there were quite a few sheets of answer sheets inside it.

172
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,840
Rather, what brings you here, Conan?

173
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,940
I was taking a drive with him, you see.

174
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:21,640
Were those answer sheets still blank with no names or answers written in?

175
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:25,040
Well, the answers were already written in

176
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,341
and all finished grading too.

177
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:32,140
Then I don't think that teacher was attacked here.

178
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:33,141
-What? -What?

179
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:40,140
Aren't these the stairs that Ms. Jodie's friend,

180
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:43,440
Ms. Shibuya was pushed off from?

181
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,640
What? Really?

182
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:48,540
Ms. Jodie told me so!

183
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,440
Right. Ran didn't know about it.

184
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:55,640
Ms. Shibuya is a teacher at Haido Elementary

185
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:59,140
and she seems to have been using these stairs on her way back home.

186
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,740
So, I'm sure the elementary school is near here too.

187
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,240
I see.

188
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:07,540
She could've mistook something that they flew from the elementary school

189
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,040
during science class for a UFO.

190
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,340
I don't think so.

191
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,040
Elementary schools were on summer vacation.

192
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,940
And the object came flying from the direction of my high school.

193
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:25,540
Well, on that day aside from our karate club using the gym,

194
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,640
there was nobody else there.

195
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,440
Haido High School?

196
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:31,640
I've always wanted to visit it.

197
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:34,540
We can go there, but I don't think we can go inside.

198
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,840
Why not?

199
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:38,740
In the beginning of October,

200
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,040
there was a murder on the campus of the school building

201
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,240
that's being renovated now.

202
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,240
It's winter vacation now,

203
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:47,940
so even we the students of the school

204
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,241
have a super hard time trying to get in.

205
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,000
You're right.

206
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,000
There are police cars parked in front of the back gate.

207
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,901
Ran. Come, this way.

208
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:10,900
This lock is broken, you see.

209
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,201
It opens.

210
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,901
-See! -Yeah, but...

211
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:22,101
Hey, are you sure it's okay?

212
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:34,200
This looks to be the site of the murder.

213
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:37,400
Come to think of it, I saw it on the news.

214
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:39,900
Something about a body covered with concrete

215
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:43,200
was found on the campus of a certain high school.

216
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,000
The name of the high school wasn't publicized,

217
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:49,200
but I didn't think it was at Haido High School.

218
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,400
But, wait.

219
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:53,800
I think they found another body next to the corpse

220
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:56,800
that was immersed in concrete lying next to it.

221
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:00,500
He seems to have been incoherent,

222
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,700
so it was concluded that the man was the perp.

223
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:06,600
I thought that this case had long been solved.

224
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:09,200
Hey, what with you guys?

225
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,300
This place is off limits!

226
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,501
Mr. Mouri?

227
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,900
Officer Chiba?

228
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:17,900
Just what are you doing here?

229
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,600
What?

230
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:23,300
Well, we were listening to this cute client of mine

231
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:26,001
and happened to arrive here.

232
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:32,600
Any rate, unauthorized personnel are not allowed.

233
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,900
Are you feeling sick?

234
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,401
No.

235
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:41,200
I got off the police car partway and came, so...

236
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,900
Why?

237
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,501
The other day, I received a package.

238
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:50,500
There was a fat file inside the package

239
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:55,500
that described in length how obesity can lead to causes hyperglycemia,

240
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,700
high cholesterol,

241
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,300
high blood pressure,

242
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:04,500
and increases the risk of diabetes,

243
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:12,200
coronary infarction and strokes.

244
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:15,700
After that various dieting methods were described,

245
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:20,500
so I've been putting everything into practice left and right.

246
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:21,800
Are you sure

247
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:25,100
you're not being conned into buying supplements that are totally useless?

248
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:30,100
No, there was nothing inside that advertised buying something.

249
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,900
Besides, the handwriting of the sender,

250
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,300
I'm sure I've seen it somewhere before.

251
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:39,600
Never mind that and tell us more about the case, Officer Chiba.

252
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:43,300
We're always helping you solve the case, aren't we?

253
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:45,600
Jeez.

254
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:50,000
The victim was a magazine editor, Mr. Kyogo Nakatsu,

255
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,100
42 years old.

256
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,200
He was lying face down

257
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,500
"Kyogo Nakatsu (42), Magazine Editor" -with his face pressed into the concrete.

258
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:58,301
The cause of death was suffocation.

259
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:05,000
Lying next to him, face up in the concrete

260
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:09,100
"Yusuke Kuchiki (38), Unemployed" -was unemployed Mr. Yusuke Kuchiki,

261
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:11,300
age 38.

262
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:14,400
He frequently submitted photos

263
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:17,100
to the UFO magazines Mr. Nakatsu was editor of.

264
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:18,500
6 months ago,

265
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,300
witnesses saw them arguing violently in the editorial office,

266
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:23,900
so there is definitely a motive for murder.

267
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:27,000
Then, the man must've killed him

268
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:30,100
by pressing the victim's face into the concrete.

269
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:33,600
The victim didn't inhale any concrete

270
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:37,601
and he definitely fell onto the concrete after he was murdered.

271
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:43,000
And we know that the victim wasn't suffocated with a string like weapon,

272
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:48,700
but rather a bag-like thing that was pulled over his head.

273
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:52,000
But that bag-like weapon can't be found.

274
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,800
It was probably blown away by the wind,

275
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:58,800
or stuffed with rocks and thrown far away.

276
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:01,700
On the day of the murder, there was no wind

277
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:05,000
and a bag containing rocks can only be thrown so far

278
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,300
and it won't be that hard to find.

279
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:10,400
And? What is that man saying?

280
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:13,600
That he's not the one who killed Mr. Nakatsu.

281
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,700
He said that an alien who came down from the UFO

282
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,600
killed Mr. Nakatsu while afloat in the air.

283
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:24,000
Then went back inside the UFO and flew off.

284
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:25,401
An alien?

285
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:30,600
See! So aliens do exist after all!

286
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah.

287
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:36,200
No, it's not an alien.

288
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:40,601
This is a murder committed by a human!

289
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,400
Hey, hey. Don't tell me you really believe

290
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,700
that an alien comes down from a UFO

291
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:50,500
and kills a person in mid-air,

292
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:53,700
goes back into the UFO and flees.

293
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:56,900
Well, I don't want to believe it,

294
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,000
but the victim, Mr. Kyogo Nakatsu

295
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:03,600
was definitely suffocated with a bag pulled over his head

296
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:07,200
before falling onto the concrete.

297
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:11,100
And Yusuke Kuchiki who was lying in the concrete next to him

298
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:14,400
didn't have any bag

299
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:18,400
nor have we found it anywhere nearby either.

300
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:21,200
So, judging from the circumstances, Mr. Kuchiki's story of the alien

301
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:23,100
is starting to sound plausible.

302
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:27,900
He could've suffocated him somewhere else, carried the corpse over here

303
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:30,800
and throw him onto the concrete, right?

304
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,900
I don't think so.

305
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:33,901
What?

306
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:38,100
Look. The footprints of the two in the concrete.

307
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:41,000
You can tell both of them walked on their own.

308
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,700
And there aren't any traces of a body having been dragged.

309
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:46,200
Then the perp carried the victim on his back

310
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,400
and went onto the concrete.

311
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,000
After laying the victim down in the concrete,

312
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:54,800
the perp got out, changed his shoes

313
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:57,300
and went back into the concrete.

314
00:17:57,301 --> 00:18:00,300
After putting the first pair of shoes on the victim's feet,

315
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:03,400
he deliberately fell onto the concrete.

316
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:04,800
If that's what happened,

317
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:08,300
the footprints of the time he carried the victim onto the concrete

318
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:10,700
have to be much deeper, right?

319
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:14,100
But all the footprints are about the same depth, you know.

320
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:17,000
Besides, all the footprints are facing that way,

321
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:21,900
so I doubt he left before the concrete hardened.

322
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:26,000
Then, maybe he got up after the concrete hardened,

323
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:28,100
left the concrete once,

324
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:31,600
got rid of the murder weapon bag somewhere,

325
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,800
came back and lay back down in the concrete the same way.

326
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:37,200
He had no reason to come back.

327
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:41,400
Besides, when the construction workers came back to check on the concrete,

328
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,700
the concrete had hardened completely

329
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:48,900
that it was really tough trying to pull them out.

330
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:51,900
Then maybe an alien is the perp after all?

331
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,800
I don't think that's possible either.

332
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:54,900
-What? -What?

333
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,300
The person who was killed was lying face down

334
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:02,100
and the other person was lying face up, right?

335
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,700
Yeah.

336
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:06,800
He said that he was exposed to a strong light and lost consciousness.

337
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:09,600
Then, the shape in the foreground

338
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,000
must be of the man who was lying next to the victim, right?

339
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,200
Because you can see the shape of his butt.

340
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:16,000
If so, this person seems to have laid down

341
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,300
with his jacket hood over his head.

342
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:20,600
So?

343
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:23,900
Maybe he was just wearing his hood because it was cold?

344
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,900
But this incident according to the TV news

345
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:29,000
happened on October 4, right?

346
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,200
That's right.

347
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:33,000
It was when they were having the Haidocho Festival.

348
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:36,100
Oh, right. That unusually hot day.

349
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:40,000
It was hot, yet he was wearing the hood.

350
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:41,400
I see!

351
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:44,800
He fell knowing that the concrete would harden.

352
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:46,400
Unless he wore the hood,

353
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:49,400
his hair would get stuck inside the hardened concrete,

354
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:52,200
making it difficult to remove.

355
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:53,700
If so,

356
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,400
the person who was lying in the concrete together with the victim

357
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:57,200
is the perp after all.

358
00:19:57,201 --> 00:20:00,300
There could've been an accomplice nearby too.

359
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,700
There was no accomplice.

360
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,000
The only way you can get into this school

361
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:07,600
without going through the front or back gate is

362
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:10,401
by using this door with the broken lock.

363
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,400
See!

364
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:15,200
We checked the footage

365
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:18,200
on the security camera attached to that lamppost and found...

366
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:19,500
On that day,

367
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:22,800
only those two were seen entering.

368
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:27,500
Then, the part where the victim was murdered wasn't recorded?

369
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,100
No. It was a matter of the angle.

370
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:33,800
But after the two entered, a while later,

371
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,000
something strange was in view.

372
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,701
Something strange?

373
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:41,500
It went past from above and below the scene.

374
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:45,100
A large, slender, creepy-shaped thing!

375
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:48,200
It went over the fence to the other side and headed towards Haido Park.

376
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:51,700
Maybe that's the same UFO that I saw?

377
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:53,600
What? You saw it too?

378
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes! A slender cigar-type UFO!

379
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:59,300
I saw it during summer vacation though.

380
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:03,700
Goodness! So, aliens exist after all!

381
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:08,801
But that alien could be a killer, you know?

382
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:14,800
In that case, we'll help them have a change of heart using our fists.

383
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,201
I wonder if you can make them have a change of heart.

384
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:21,800
The man who was with the victim is probably the perp,

385
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:25,101
but some unknown entity could also be involved.

386
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:30,100
By the way, what is the concrete here for?

387
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:32,800
It seems they were planning to put a sculpture here

388
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,600
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Haido High School.

389
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:40,000
The construction was supposed to be finished by summer vacation,

390
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:43,601
but it was postponed for some reason till autumn.

391
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:54,100
The victim was lying face down in the concrete

392
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:57,600
and suffocated to death.

393
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:59,700
The man next to him was wearing his hood

394
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,900
and lying face up in the concrete.

395
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:06,200
That man says that an alien flew down in a UFO

396
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,400
and murdered the victim while floating in mid-air.

397
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:11,600
Then got back on the UFO and flew off.

398
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:14,800
And the large, slender, creepy shaped object

399
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:18,201
that was recorded on the security camera...

400
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:46,100
"Next Episode" -What is it? Did you find the alien?

401
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:48,700
No, not yet.

402
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,500
But I was wondering

403
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,800
what color was the cigar type UFO that you saw, Hina.

404
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,000
It was black.

405
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,800
It was a bit shiny and pitch black!

406
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,700
Then go over to his place right this minute

407
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,500
and ask him what's going on!

408
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:04,200
Officer Chiba's changed, hasn't he?

409
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:07,200
Rather, did he lose weight?

410
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:08,800
