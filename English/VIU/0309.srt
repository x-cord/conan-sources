1
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:04,493
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:06,393
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:08,293
The secret of the men in black is finally at hand.

4
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:10,593
I will figure out the diary together with Dr. Agasa.

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,393
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:14,393
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:16,194
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,090
I have it. It's right here.

9
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,490
In my pocket, the clue to those men in the Black Organization.

10
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,389
Now all I have to do is go over to Doc's house

11
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,189
and check this disk thoroughly.

12
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,790
Conan?

13
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,290
I wonder if people change.

14
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,290
If they're apart, will their feelings change?

15
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,389
It's kind of tough

16
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,590
to just keep on waiting.

17
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,289
You don't have to worry about Shinichi.

18
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,389
I think he's just the way you picture him to be, Ran.

19
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,990
So, I don't think you have to worry about him at all.

20
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,090
It would be nice if you were Shinichi, Conan.

21
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,290
How stupid of me, what on earth am I talking about?

22
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,689
Ran, that's not it.

23
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,089
I...

24
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,689
Actually, I am...

25
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,990
No. I can't tell her.

26
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,489
Not until I disclose their identity.

27
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,989
Until I crush them.

28
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,190
I can't tell anybody about me.

29
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,590
You're...

30
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,690
"Contact with the Black Organization (Negotiation Edition)"

31
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,890
So, you're crying again.

32
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,289
Again?

33
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,989
You're always crying.

34
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,290
Always?

35
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,490
Does it bother you?

36
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,490
It's just that you sort of reminded me...

37
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,390
of a girl who resembled you.

38
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,589
A stupid girl who pretended to be composed

39
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,089
but used to cry in private.

40
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,290
Stupid girl?

41
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,290
Hey, Ran.

42
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,289
Do you know that man?

43
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,689
Yes.

44
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,590
I met him when I went to New York with Shinichi.

45
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,689
I was waiting for Shinichi in front of a dilapidated building

46
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,589
when he came walking along

47
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,689
and asked me if I saw a Japanese with long silver dyed hair

48
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,090
and an unshaven face.

49
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,389
Inside that building where the street slasher was hiding?

50
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,790
But, I don't think he's anyone suspicious.

51
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,689
Why?

52
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,089
Because he was together with a person

53
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,390
wearing a jacket with the characters FBI on it.

54
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,890
FBI?

55
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,089
It can't be...

56
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,990
What would the FBI be doing here in Japan?

57
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,889
He's gone.

58
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,390
He's disappeared.

59
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,389
Come on, let's go home, Conan.

60
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,190
Okay.

61
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,189
But, I wonder if he

62
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,190
really belongs to the FBI?

63
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,789
Somebody killed that street slasher

64
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,189
making it look as if he killed himself.

65
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,889
If the FBI had that area covered,

66
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,489
they would never goof like that.

67
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,489
And besides,

68
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,989
during the James kidnap case,

69
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,590
Ai reacted at sensing his presence.

70
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,790
Is it possible he was the one who killed the street slasher?

71
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,790
If he was deeply involved with Ai...

72
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,790
Shuichi Akai.

73
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,590
Don't tell me that his true identity is...

74
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,989
Hey, Conan.

75
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,889
What would you like to eat for dinner?

76
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,189
Sashimi?

77
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,889
Tenshin rice?

78
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,389
Or beef stew?

79
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,189
But, choose only one of the dishes...

80
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,190
Huh?

81
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:26,190
Conan?

82
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,089
"I promised Dr. Agasa that I would play a game with him,

83
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,990
so I'm going to sleep over at his place tonight."

84
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,889
Playing games again?

85
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,090
I tell you, he's so childish.

86
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,889
More important than Shuichi Akai now

87
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,089
is the diary that's inside this disc.

88
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,789
The diary of Mr. Itakura, who met Tequila,

89
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,889
one of the members of the men in black, 2 years ago.

90
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,089
I'm going to check it thoroughly

91
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,490
and figure out their purpose,

92
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,590
as well as their identity.

93
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,989
Shinichi, great timing.

94
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,489
It's been a while, but I've invented something new again.

95
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,889
While I was at it, I also made you another pair of pursuit glasses,

96
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,689
so you won't have to worry about running out of batteries.

97
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,589
By the way, where's Ai?

98
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,289
Ai's taking a bath right now.

99
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,390
That's just great.

100
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,689
Hey, Shinichi. What do you mean that's just great?

101
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,890
Don't tell me that you're going to take a peek?

102
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,090
Oh, come on.

103
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,989
What? You got hold of clues to those guys?

104
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,689
Shinichi, you're not pulling my leg, are you?

105
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,989
No.

106
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,389
If Ai finds out, it may cause her needless worry,

107
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,189
so I've got to check things out while she's not around.

108
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,789
Let me see, two years ago.

109
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,689
Two years ago...

110
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,589
There. This is it.

111
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,089
"March 7th, a man with a Kansai dialect suddenly came to see me.

112
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,489
It seems that he was after a system software

113
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,589
which was under development,

114
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,089
but as soon as he found out that my vision had gone bad

115
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,889
and I gave up the development, he left.

116
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,589
This man was dressed in black from head to toe.

117
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,390
I never want to see him again."

118
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,390
Hey, is this it?

119
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,389
There seems to be nothing more written about the big man

120
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,389
in the diary in the days following either.

121
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,189
Seriously. And I went through all the trouble to get a hold of this diary.

122
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,589
The only thing I found out

123
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,089
was that Mr. Itakura was developing some kind of software,

124
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,089
and that they wanted it.

125
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,290
This Itakura guy sure must've been some unreliable character.

126
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,889
Look, the space between the written and unwritten pages of the book

127
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,489
is disorganized.

128
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,789
If it were me,

129
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,290
I wouldn't be able to stand not placing everything in order.

130
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,889
Come to think of it, he said back then,

131
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,689
that Mr. Itakura would get upset

132
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,290
even if his papers were moved 10 centimeters out of place.

133
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,689
Wrong, Dr. Agasa.

134
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,790
The space between the pages is not disorganized.

135
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,889
Watch, okay?

136
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,489
You place the cursor on the open space like this

137
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,690
and drag the mouse along, then, highlight it.

138
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,689
This is...

139
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,889
I'm pooped.

140
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,789
If this keeps up, I'll probably be killed one day.

141
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,189
"Invisible writing".

142
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,589
It's a method that's frequently used

143
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,289
when people want to hide

144
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,489
what is written on things like the internet website.

145
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:47,089
But, why would Mr. Itakura do something like this to his own diary?

146
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,889
Probably as camouflage just in case

147
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,590
somebody snuck a look at his diary.

148
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,589
Shinichi, don't tell me that the person is...

149
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,890
Yes, I'm sure he didn't want them to see it.

150
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,999
Dr. Agasa.

151
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,399
I finished taking a bath.

152
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,399
Dr. Agasa?

153
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,498
It seems that he's started using invisible writing

154
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,699
10 days after the big man came.

155
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:33,198
It goes on to say,

156
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:35,598
"March 16th.

157
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:38,599
The pen of my desk has been moved another 5 centimeters.

158
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,699
It seems that someone's been sneaking into my office after all.

159
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:47,898
April 15th. Somebody has snuck into my house this time.

160
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,898
The police won't take it seriously.

161
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,498
I guess it couldn't be helped

162
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:55,399
because there were no traces of a break-in or anything being taken.

163
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,198
June 11th.

164
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:02,098
I changed the locks and set up hidden surveillance cameras,

165
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,299
but to no avail.

166
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:07,799
July 6th. Who is it? Show yourself.

167
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:12,298
November 19th. I'm pooped.

168
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:15,399
If this keeps up, I'll probably be killed one day.

169
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,598
January 6th. In order to free me from this terror,

170
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:24,099
I inserted a message addressed to the intruder in the desk.

171
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,498
I wrote that I would go along with their demand.

172
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:31,998
January 8th. I got an answer earlier than expected.

173
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,198
In place of the message I inserted,

174
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,898
there was a memo from the intruder.

175
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,598
"OK" was written in red.

176
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,898
Along with a mysterious phone number was written.

177
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,098
The red words were probably written with blood.

178
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:48,899
It probably means, "Tell no one or you're dead".

179
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,198
January 23rd.

180
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,498
Although I was deliberating on what to do for a while,

181
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:56,899
I decided not to notify the police and call them instead.

182
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:02,198
To my surprise, a woman answered the phone.

183
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,998
A stuck up woman who talked as if she were a queen.

184
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:09,998
Her request was that she wanted to buy the software

185
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,698
that I was developing at a high price

186
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,999
if I could finish making it in a year.

187
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,398
I guess she's a member of the same group

188
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,899
as the big man that previously came to see me.

189
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,198
February 13th.

190
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,298
Their way of contacting me changed to e-mail.

191
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,298
I decided to accept the offer under the condition

192
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:34,898
that they deposit the payment into my account in advance

193
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,398
and that they stop snooping around me anymore.

194
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,798
December 22nd.

195
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,598
No good.

196
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,098
I can't do it after all.

197
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,798
I abandoned making that software

198
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,798
not only because my vision started weakening,

199
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,299
but for the sake of mankind."

200
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,698
For the sake of mankind?

201
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,298
"February 9th.

202
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:58,399
The deadline is drawing near.

203
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,498
I have decided to hide the unfinished software

204
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:04,298
and the check of the payment they made to me

205
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,598
near the computer of my villa

206
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:10,198
and escape abroad.

207
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,398
The e-mail with instructions

208
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,898
as to the time and place of where the software

209
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,898
will be handed over to them

210
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,698
should be arriving 5 days later at midnight.

211
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:19,599
I'll try to somehow make it abroad by then."

212
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:24,098
The date on this diary is four days ago,

213
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:27,799
which means the e-mail should be arriving 3 hours from now at 9 pm.

214
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,898
I guess Mr. Itakura was planning to escape abroad

215
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,499
before seeing that e-mail.

216
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:39,199
There seems to be invisible writing even after the last day.

217
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,298
"February 10th.

218
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:48,299
I wonder what they're going to do with that software?

219
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:51,998
The queer words of that woman who first answered the phone

220
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,299
won't leave my ears.

221
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,998
Yes. I couldn't stand the overbearing tone of voice of the woman

222
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,998
so I taunted her saying, "Just who the hell do you think you are?"

223
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:06,698
She laughed and replied,

224
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:10,598
"We can be both of God and the Devil,

225
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,998
since we're trying to raise the dead

226
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,198
against the stream of time."

227
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,598
What?

228
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,998
We can be both of God and the Devil,

229
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,498
since we're...

230
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:28,299
We're trying to raise the dead against the stream of time.

231
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:32,198
-Ai? -Ai?

232
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,998
What is that?

233
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,098
Are you reading some kind of fantasy story

234
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:36,998
where a witch or something appears?

235
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,298
Yes, exactly.

236
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:43,399
I'm hooked on this internet series of western novels, you see.

237
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,398
And you? What are you doing here, Shinichi?

238
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,698
Oh, me?

239
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,198
I was...

240
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,098
He came to try out my new invention.

241
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:55,498
Right?

242
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:56,599
Yes.

243
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,399
This is called "Fire a ball anywhere belt".

244
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,498
It looks like any ordinary belt at first glance.

245
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,998
No, it doesn't.

246
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,499
But when you adjust the dial and push the button.

247
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,898
There. One soccer ball to go.

248
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,798
That's amazing!

249
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,898
I'd be able to catch a load of culprits with this.

250
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,398
No, maybe just one or two.

251
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,798
Because of the nature of rubber,

252
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,898
once it leaves the belt,

253
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,198
it can only maintain its form for 10 seconds.

254
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,798
I see.

255
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,298
However, it is very elastic.

256
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,998
Depending on the amount of gas that's put in,

257
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,298
it can become as large as an advertisement balloon.

258
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,098
Oh, that's some value.

259
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,998
Sounds silly.

260
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,799
I'm going to go to bed.

261
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,298
So, what now?

262
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,498
What else?

263
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:57,298
We're going to Mr. Itakura's villa right now

264
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:59,498
and get a hold of that system software in question.

265
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,298
Then, we're going to receive the e-mail

266
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,099
that they're going to be sending at midnight.

267
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:11,498
It's amazing how you found out

268
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:14,598
that Mr. Itakura's villa is in Gunma.

269
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,498
Pops asked the man from the game company

270
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:19,699
that came to ask him to look for Mr. Itakura.

271
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,698
He was asking the man for places

272
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,298
that Mr. Itakura could be hiding like his house,

273
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,798
villa, the addresses of his acquaintances and so forth.

274
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,898
Will it be okay though?

275
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:32,098
What if they're waiting in ambush or something?

276
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:33,798
We'll be fine.

277
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,498
Mr. Itakura made them promise

278
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:39,598
not to snoop around him anymore.

279
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,098
They would never break a promise with a character

280
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,798
who is so jittery that he was bothered

281
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,598
that the pen on his desk had been moved 5 centimeters.

282
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,498
I think you have a point.

283
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:51,598
If they upset him before the software is completed,

284
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,298
they'll be throwing everything down the drain.

285
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,398
The problem is, whether the news about Mr. Itakura being killed

286
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:00,798
has already been aired on TV or radio.

287
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,298
Even so, it'll be okay.

288
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,598
I've been listening to the radio all this time,

289
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,398
but all they're broadcasting

290
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:09,799
is about the jewelry robber who is on the run.

291
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,998
The thing that bothers me though, are the last words in the diary.

292
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:16,098
Yes.

293
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,998
"We can be both of God and the Devil,

294
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:24,598
since we are trying to raise the dead against the stream of time."

295
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,599
What does it mean anyway?

296
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,998
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

297
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,499
Don't tell me that the drug Ai was trying to make was...

298
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:37,099
No way. Making zombies. That's ridiculous.

299
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,298
Don't rush things.

300
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,398
People cannot go against the stream of time.

301
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:48,198
If people try to bend things out of line by force,

302
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:50,598
they will be punished.

303
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,298
What is it?

304
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,299
What is the punishment?

305
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:01,898
We've finally arrived.

306
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:06,898
Now, how do we make it inside?

307
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:08,499
Well...

308
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:12,998
Where did you get that key?

309
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,998
It was hidden behind those stairs.

310
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,998
Remember it was written in the diary?

311
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:23,798
"A friend that I haven't seen in 5 years called me from my villa."

312
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,998
Which means that the key was hidden somewhere

313
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,298
so that his friends could come in whenever they wanted to.

314
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,299
I see.

315
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:35,998
But, how dangerous.

316
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:39,598
He left it here just for that very reason.

317
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,998
Because they wouldn't think that the software that they wanted

318
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:46,298
would be left so carelessly in a place like this.

319
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,998
And as for the e-mail that they are about to send here,

320
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,598
if no one receives their mail here,

321
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,898
they'll eventually come here to look for Mr. Itakura,

322
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:56,698
and find the software and the check,

323
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:59,799
so he gets to sever all ties with them without having to see them.

324
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,998
Shinichi, it's almost time.

325
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:05,999
Yes.

326
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,598
Come on, you guys in black.

327
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:13,099
Show your dirty rat selves.

328
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,198
Here it is. The mail.

329
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,499
Okay, if I open this...

330
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:22,898
Password?

331
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,999
Hey, it's counting down really fast.

332
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,599
Darn.

333
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:32,099
The mail disappeared.

334
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,698
Darn. It was set so that if it wasn't opened immediately,

335
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:36,898
it would disappear.

336
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:41,098
So, don't tell me that they found out the mail wasn't opened?

337
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,198
Yes. Not only that, maybe they even found out

338
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,998
that the mail failed to be opened using this computer.

339
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:47,298
What now?

340
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:49,398
They may think that something happened to Mr. Itakura

341
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,198
and come here.

342
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,799
Shinichi?

343
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,399
Shinichi?

344
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,298
I can't come to the phone right now.

345
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:20,799
Please record your message after the tone.

346
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:26,999
Hey, what's going on?

347
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,898
Vodka?

348
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:32,698
You're there, aren't you?

349
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,398
They've found out.

350
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:37,798
They've found out that we failed to open the e-mail.

351
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:41,799
Yes. Or maybe they were watching this villa...

352
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,399
without Mr. Itakura being aware that they were.

353
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,698
What?

354
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:49,898
I'm counting on them not thinking

355
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:52,498
that Mr. Itakura would receive their mail

356
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:55,798
in an unsafe place like this, though.

357
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,798
Hey. If so, how are we going to escape?

358
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,798
We're trapped.

359
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,999
Hey, answer me.

360
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:06,198
I know you're at that villa.

361
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,699
Shinichi?

362
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:10,998
Hurry up and answer me,

363
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,599
Mr. Itakura.

364
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:16,999
Hey. What's going on?

365
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,998
Can't you hear me?

366
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,099
Hey!

367
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,598
"Next Episode" -Hey, answer me.

368
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,098
I know you're at that villa.

369
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,498
Hurry up and answer me.

370
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:11,398
I guess we've no choice

371
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,498
but to make it out the back door

372
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:15,299
and hide in the blizzard.

373
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,999
Not really. There's still one way.

374
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:23,399
It's a bit dangerous, though.

375
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,498
Next Conan,
