1
00:00:01,695 --> 00:00:02,995
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,795
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,195
A novelist's life is sought after by a character

4
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:07,595
that appears in her novel!

5
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:09,395
Is this fiction or non-fiction?

6
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:10,895
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:12,495
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,395
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,101
"Pro Soccer"

10
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,900
They're calling.

11
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,100
Pops?

12
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,200
Excuse me...

13
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
Inspector!

14
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,100
I have a feeling it's time to make an appearance!

15
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Here goes!

16
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,300
Hey!

17
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,400
-Pops! -Inspector!

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
You must really have a lot of time on your hands.

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,200
No, this brat tells me in tears to go help

20
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,400
with the invitation so.

21
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,100
Inspector, what kind of case is this?

22
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,300
Homicide.

23
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,800
The victim is the person who lives in this unit.

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,000
Ms. Murako Saikawa, age 65.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,400
She's living alone.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She looks to be a novelist.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,900
Do you know her, Mouri?

28
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,500
Murako Saikawa...

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Come to think of it, there was a novelist by the name some time ago.

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,100
Murako Saikawa...

31
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
"The Village of Orochi"

32
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,800
Was a once famous mystery writer.

33
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
She died instantly after being struck

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,500
in the back of the head with a bronze figurine.

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,600
From the looks of the corpse,

36
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,200
she was probably killed last night between 7 pm to 9 pm.

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,900
As to the estimated time of death,

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm sure we'll be able to find out more in detail after the autopsy.

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Who would want to kill that famed mystery writer?

40
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,900
And for what reason?

41
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,000
"My Favorite Mystery"

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,500
Inspector.

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,200
They are the two people who first found the body.

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,100
"Shunichi Tono (26)" -I'm Tono. I'm editor from Meikyu Publishing

45
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,300
and was in charge of Ms. Saikawa.

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,000
And he is the manager of the apartment.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
"Keizo Murata (55)" -I'm Murata.

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,700
Please explain how things were when you first found the body once again.

49
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,800
When I came to make arrangements here yesterday,

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,100
she asked me to bring her some documents today.

51
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,800
But despite pushing the doorbell many times there was no answer.

52
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,300
So I sensed that something was not right.

53
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,800
So I went to call the apartment manager,

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,700
had him open the door and entered the room.

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,900
Ms. Saikawa?

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
We saw Ms. Saikawa lying over there...

57
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
I see.

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Mr. Tono, were you at Ms. Saikawa's yesterday too?

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,900
Yes, I was.

60
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,300
From sundown to around 8 pm.

61
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,000
The murder was committed between 7 pm to 9 pm.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,200
You've got great intuition?

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,600
I mean, you felt that something was not right,

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,500
only because after pushing the doorbell, nobody answered, right?

65
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
That's true.

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,100
Most people normally wouldn't think that way right off the bat.

67
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,500
Oh, well...

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
That's because several days ago,

69
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,300
Ms. Saikawa received this.

70
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,000
A postcard?

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,000
"Dear Ms. Murako Saikawa,"

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,800
"I'm thinking of adding your life to my collection next."

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
"I will go to visit you in the near future to take your life."

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,200
A murder warning?

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,400
The sender is...

76
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,500
Taniyoshi Ohebi?

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,400
It's read, Ryo Orochiya.

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
Ryo Orochiya?

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It can't be!

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,800
"Ryo Orochiya" -Who is this Orochiya person?

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,100
He is a genius killer

82
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,700
that appears in one of Ms. Saikawa's main novels.

83
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,900
He's somebody who appears in her novel?

84
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,800
The novelist was killed by a character that appears in her novel?

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
No darn way!

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Oh, I guess not.

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,700
But, that's what actually happened.

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
It's a cheap trick that the killer is using.

89
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,100
To complicate investigations!

90
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,300
To complicate investigations?

91
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,400
I wonder if anyone would do something like this just for that purpose.

92
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,600
Mr. Murata, if you have a vacant room,

93
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,900
could you lend it to us?

94
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,100
I would like to use the room as a stronghold for investigation.

95
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, yes.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Mr. Tono, I think you're probably the last person who met the victim.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,500
Could you spare us a little more of your time?

99
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,900
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,000
Inspector.

101
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,400
Yeah.

102
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
You said that the door was locked, didn't you?

103
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I guess the killer locked the door when escaping last night.

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,600
In order to delay discovery of the body.

105
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,400
But, it seems that at this apartment the residents are given two keys.

106
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,500
And both of Ms. Saikawa's keys were found in the room.

107
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,700
The killer used a spare key?

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes.

109
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,600
And if someone did use a spare key, the number of people

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,900
who can do so is limited.

111
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,600
For example, the editor in charge

112
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,300
who used to come make arrangements with her.

113
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,900
He could make one, if he waited for the chance to do so.

114
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,800
The manager also has a key.

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,300
Megure here.

116
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,400
Okay...

117
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,600
Got it.

118
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,700
Anything?

119
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,800
It's from Mr. Kawanaka who's going around the neighborhood

120
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,700
asking question looking for a lead.

121
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,000
He says that somebody heard the victim and the manager

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,600
having a heated argument several days ago.

123
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,000
It seems that the suspects have been narrowed down already.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,700
Mr. Tono was here at the time the murder was committed.

125
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,300
Mr. Murata seems to have a motive to commit the murder.

126
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,500
And the two men could get spare keys of the room if they wanted to.

127
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,900
And if either of the two is the killer.

128
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,800
It may not be a coincidence that the first to ones

129
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,100
to discover the body were the two.

130
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,900
In order to get rid of the evidence they left behind the day before,

131
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,200
they snuck in here pretending to be the first to discover the body?

132
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
It's very probable.

133
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,700
What?

134
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,900
It's just a slice of fresh marinated ginger slices.

135
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,400
Ms. Saikawa hated fresh marinated ginger slices.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,100
She used to say she didn't like the sweet sour taste of it.

137
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,100
That's why I think that after having sushi delivered here last night,

138
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,500
she disposed of the ginger slices without eating them.

139
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,600
Ms. Saikawa ordered delivery sushi last night?

140
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,900
Yes. I ordered it because Ms. Saikawa asked me to.

141
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,500
Inspector, the room is ready.

142
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,100
Oh, I see. Good work!

143
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,600
Then, Mr. Tono,

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
will you tell us in detail what happened last night?

145
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Yes, sir.

146
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
If it was thrown away last night,

147
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,700
it would've been left there for half a day.

148
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,900
If so, then most naturally...

149
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,100
Ms. Saikawa was killed last night between 7 pm to 9 pm.

150
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,400
I came here last night around 6:30 pm.

151
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,200
Although she has stopped writing now,

152
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Ms. Saikawa has written many masterpieces so far.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,200
We talked things over for about an hour

154
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,100
on making a compilation of her masterpieces.

155
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,600
This is the Saikawa residence.

156
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,500
Yes, of Pearl Mansion.

157
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,700
One serving of the usual prime sushi plate.

158
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,900
The sushi came at about 8 pm.

159
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,000
But I had another place to stop by

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,700
so I left soon afterwards.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,700
I'll bring the documents you wanted tomorrow morning.

162
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,900
Thank you.

163
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,700
Well, then. Excuse me.

164
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,500
At around 8:15 pm,

165
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,600
I joined my friends at a pub in front of the station.

166
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,100
And stayed there all the way through till midnight.

167
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,600
"6:30: Business meeting with Mr. Tono" -All through till midnight...

168
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,800
"7:30: Ordered sushi, 8.00: Sushi delivered"

169
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
"8:15: Mr. Tono left, meeting up with friends"

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,500
I will have to confirm what you said with your friends too.

171
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I know that you suspect me.

172
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
But how could I do something like that

173
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,800
to Japan's jewel of mystery?

174
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,500
I didn't have any brawl with Ms. Saikawa!

175
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,400
Somebody saw wrong!

176
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,500
It could be.

177
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,600
Then, what about last night?

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
I was in the manager's room right through.

179
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,000
I was alone, so there's no one to prove it, though.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That manager's hiding something.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,100
8 pm is the point of focus.

182
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,000
If between 7 pm and 8 pm,

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,400
Mr. Tono could've committed the crime.

184
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,600
If after 8 pm, Mr. Murata could've committed the crime too.

185
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,700
Well, split up and find back ups for everyone's testimony!

186
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
-Yes sir! -Yes sir!

187
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,100
"Treasure sushi, Not yet open for business." -What?

188
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,800
Ms. Saikawa was?

189
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I hear that you delivered a take-out meal to her last night.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
How stupid of me!

191
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
Excuse me?

192
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
It's the mistake of a life time!

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
Why don't you spit it all out?

194
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,700
-The squid and octopus... -What?

195
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,300
Squid and octopus?

196
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,400
We don't usually put squid and octopus

197
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
in our prime sushi plate.

198
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,300
But we used to specially put them in Ms. Saikawa's order only.

199
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,500
Because she used to like them both.

200
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,400
But I carelessly forgot to put them on her plate last night!

201
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,800
I mean, no big deal...

202
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,600
What do you mean it's no big deal?

203
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,900
I goofed on the last order, you know!

204
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,700
I can't face up to Ms. Saikawa.

205
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,400
I would like to ask you about the time you delivered the order to her.

206
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Yes?

207
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,200
He didn't see her?

208
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Yeah, he definitely delivered the sushi to her at 8 pm,

209
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,700
but he says he didn't see Ms. Saikawa

210
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,300
or hear her voice at all.

211
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,400
At that time, she was no longer in the world.

212
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,500
That's a possibility.

213
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,100
Excuse me.

214
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,100
Who are you?

215
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,000
No, chief editor, please don't!

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,100
Let me go!

217
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,200
"Yasunobu Shimasaki (50)" -I'm Shimasaki, Head of Meikyu Publishing.

218
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,100
I hear that you are considering Mr. Tono a suspect?

219
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,500
Oh, no...

220
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,900
He's a guy that came to work for our company

221
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,400
that specializes in mysteries because he adored Ms. Saikawa, you know?

222
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,700
He even planned the compilation of Ms. Saikawa's stories this time too.

223
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Yeah...

224
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,300
So, he was a fervent fan of Murako Saikawa?

225
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,800
Did you know the novelist called Murako Saikawa?

226
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,700
Not until this incident...

227
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,400
Because she's a forgotten novelist, that's why.

228
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,600
But he's the one who insisted,

229
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,900
if so the more the reason to publish her stories.

230
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,000
The public know much too little of how great Ms. Saikawa is.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,900
Creative and unique tricks and a perfect composition.

232
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,000
-I have my mind set on letting entire Japan -To be honest with you,

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,700
-become aware of her jewel-like sparkle! -I don't think it'll sell much.

234
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,300
Our management is always in dire straits.

235
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,000
If we publish a compilation that is unlikely to sell,

236
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
it'll only make things worse.

237
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,700
But, I agreed.

238
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,300
I was moved by his wanting to make her happy

239
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,600
for the very last time with his heart and soul.

240
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
For the very last time?

241
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,700
The doctor had told her that.

242
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,200
She only had only six more months to live.

243
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,200
The one who would be most vexed by Ms. Saikawa's death is Tono!

244
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,600
Excuse me.

245
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,600
Megure here.

246
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,900
Oh, from Beika Medical University Hospital.

247
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,200
Yes...

248
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Okay, thank you very much.

249
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,000
We've got the result of the autopsy.

250
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,600
There seems to have been a little rice grain

251
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,900
and raw seafood left in the stomach of the body.

252
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,700
Sushi, I guess?

253
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,900
Yeah. She seems to have been killed an hour after eating.

254
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,000
Since the food was delivered at 8 pm.

255
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,000
She was killed around 9 pm.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,300
So, as for Mr. Tono.

257
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Since he was with his friends right through after 8:15 pm,

258
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,800
his alibi has already been established.

259
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
Alibi established?

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,300
We're sorry to have suspected you.

261
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,100
You may leave.

262
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,000
-I'm happy for you, Tono. -Thank you.

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,600
Goodbye then.

264
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Then, who's the killer?

265
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,200
What? You saw him last night?

266
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
Is it true?

267
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,700
Yes.

268
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,200
I had a package I had to deliver at a designated time.

269
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,600
So it was when I came to deliver it.

270
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,300
I'm sure it was just around 9 pm.

271
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,700
9 pm?

272
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,300
I really love this.

273
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,800
But that old lady found me sipping this since afternoon.

274
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,100
And she said she would report it to the maintenance company.

275
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,900
No way, if she does, I'll be fired!

276
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,400
That's why last night,

277
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,900
I went to see her to ask her not to report me.

278
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,400
But!

279
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,000
No matter how many times I rang the doorbell,

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,500
that old lady wouldn't answer.

281
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,000
If you insist on suspecting me,

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
show me proof, won't you?

283
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
Show me proof!

284
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,300
Mr. Murata!

285
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,000
You smell of liquor.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,300
Let me go and air the room out a bit?

287
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,700
"The autopsy report"

288
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,900
"Stomach residue: Rice grain, tuna, octopus, squid, egg..."

289
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,300
I get it! There was one more...

290
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,100
And that marinated ginger slices.

291
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,600
I need proof...

292
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,900
I got it.

293
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,300
I've figured out the trick the killer used.

294
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,284
I've figured out the trick.

295
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,784
But why would he kill her?

296
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:45,384
Inspector.

297
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:50,184
From among the things that the forensic officers gathered,

298
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:53,184
nothing points to Mr. Murata as having committed the crime.

299
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:55,584
Nothing, huh?

300
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:58,384
Yes... There it is, clearly and bold letters.

301
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:01,384
"Mystery-novel authoress murdered!" -It's an attention catching headline,

302
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:03,184
"Murako Saikawa's own character sent a murder notice!" -isn't it?

303
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:09,084
Murder warning sent from a character in her novel?

304
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:13,684
Mr. Tono, told the press about the postcard too, didn't he?

305
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:14,784
It's supposed to be kept a secret

306
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:16,684
while investigation is underway and yet...

307
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:20,384
I see. So this is why.

308
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:30,484
Mouri?

309
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:35,084
Is it the usual?

310
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:36,684
Mouri!

311
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:38,684
Inspector Megure.

312
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:42,584
Please tell Mr. Tono and Mr. Murata to come back here again.

313
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,484
I've figured out the entire mystery!

314
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:46,584
Takagi! Chiba!

315
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:47,984
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

316
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:53,584
Inspector, the killer used an alibi trick.

317
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,484
An alibi trick?

318
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,484
Let me organize this case.

319
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:05,384
Ms. Saikawa was killed between 7 pm and 9 pm last night.

320
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:10,484
And we also know that it was an hour after she had eaten the sushi.

321
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:12,584
In other words, she was killed around 9 pm.

322
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:14,484
That's the point.

323
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:17,284
How can you be so sure?

324
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:19,784
Because the sushi was delivered to her place at 8 pm.

325
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:23,084
But, that doesn't mean that the sushi

326
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,184
that was found in Ms. Saikawa's stomach was the sushi that was delivered?

327
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:26,284
Just what do you mean?

328
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,484
There was another sushi package.

329
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:29,984
Another package?

330
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:32,884
Other than the sushi that was delivered here at 8 pm,

331
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,384
there was another package

332
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:36,684
that Mr. Tono had brought along with him as a present.

333
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,984
The sushi that Ms. Saikawa had eaten

334
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:43,984
was in fact the gift sushi that Mr. Tono had brought along.

335
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:47,984
She ate the sushi, not after 8 pm but at 6:30 pm.

336
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:52,784
And an hour later, Ms. Saikawa was killed by Mr. Tono.

337
00:17:52,784 --> 00:17:57,384
This is when Ms. Saikawa's digestive system stopped functioning.

338
00:17:57,384 --> 00:18:00,884
It stopped at an hour after she had eaten the sushi.

339
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:03,884
After this, Mr. Tono ordered sushi delivery.

340
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:07,184
Yes, please deliver one order of the usual prime sushi plate.

341
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:09,084
Thank you for your patronage!

342
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:11,584
You probably put the sushi that arrived at 8 pm

343
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:13,984
into a plastic bag or something.

344
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:17,184
And locked the door using a spare key that you prepared before hand,

345
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:19,484
to delay discovery of the body.

346
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:22,584
You got rid of the sushi and spare key on the way.

347
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,884
And went on to establish your alibi from after 8:15 pm.

348
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:29,284
But, we finally got word after the autopsy that she was killed

349
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:32,184
after she had eaten the sushi.

350
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:35,084
Since the sushi was delivered at 8 pm, so...

351
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:36,484
This most naturally lead us to think

352
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:39,084
that the time the murder was committed was 9 pm.

353
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,684
As a result, Mr. Tono who had an alibi during that time

354
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:44,084
was cleared from the list of suspects.

355
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:46,484
I had things figured out till that point.

356
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,784
In other words, he used the result of the autopsy

357
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:53,184
that is used to help solve cases

358
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:56,084
to his advantage for his alibi trick.

359
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,084
So, you!

360
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,184
Wait a second, Mr. Mouri!

361
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:01,384
However, you made one mistake!

362
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:02,984
The slices of ginger.

363
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:06,884
If the slices were ones that came along with the sushi

364
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,884
that was delivered last night,

365
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:11,084
they would've been dried out long out.

366
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,284
But, the slices of ginger that were found in the disposal

367
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,584
were still soft. Why?

368
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,484
Because when you got rid of the sushi that was delivered last night,

369
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:20,184
you carelessly also threw away the slices of ginger.

370
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:23,384
You realized what you did this morning,

371
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:25,584
so you made Mr. Murata open the room

372
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,684
and when he wasn't watching, you went to the kitchen

373
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,484
and threw the slices of ginger you had on you

374
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:31,984
into the triangular disposal basket.

375
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:33,784
That's enough!

376
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:36,284
What gift sushi are you talking about?

377
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:37,784
Of course, Ms. Saikawa ate the sushi

378
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:41,484
that was delivered at 8 pm!

379
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:42,784
Inspector.

380
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:48,084
What was left in Ms. Saikawa's stomach after the autopsy?

381
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,184
Like I said, sushi.

382
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:53,084
We got more detailed information, didn't we?

383
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,784
What? Oh, let see...

384
00:19:55,784 --> 00:20:01,384
Rice, tuna, sea urchin, flatfish, squid and octopus.

385
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:03,084
Squid and octopus?

386
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,184
Yeah, no mistake about it.

387
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:07,884
Isn't it strange, Officer Takagi?

388
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:08,884
Strange?

389
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:10,484
Yes! It's strange!

390
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:14,084
How stupid of me!

391
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,384
The squid and octopus...

392
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:19,184
He forgot to put in on the plate?

393
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:24,284
You probably made sure that the squid and octopus

394
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:28,084
that Ms. Saikawa liked was in the sushi gift that you brought for her.

395
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:32,384
You assumed the sushi's fillings, didn't you?

396
00:20:32,384 --> 00:20:34,784
You were proven guilty by the autopsy that you schemed

397
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:37,184
to use to your advantage.

398
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:38,384
Tono, you...

399
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:40,884
Admit your crime, Mr. Tono.

400
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:42,984
The criminals that Ms. Murako Saikawa writes

401
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,984
in her books including Ryo Orochiya

402
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,784
all admit their crimes in good grace,

403
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,984
when they are cornered, don't they?

404
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:52,184
Why, Tono?

405
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:58,284
Ms. Saikawa had only a few months to live because of her illness.

406
00:20:58,284 --> 00:21:01,184
But, if she dies of an illness,

407
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:05,484
nobody would make anything of a writer who is long forgotten.

408
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:08,384
However, if she were killed

409
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:12,584
and more so by one of the characters who appeared in her books.

410
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:15,884
The media would make a big thing of it.

411
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:19,384
It would make Ms. Saikawa's name known to the public.

412
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:22,684
Therefore, you wrote that strange postcard warning of the murder

413
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:24,684
and carried it out.

414
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,184
No matter what the motive,

415
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,684
taking another person's life is totally unforgivable!

416
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:31,884
But, in Ms. Saikawa's case,

417
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:32,984
-there wouldn't have been a better way... -Tono!

418
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:36,584
Did you really do it only for Ms. Saikawa's sake?

419
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:39,384
If people are attracted, the compilation of her work will sell

420
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:40,884
and the company you work for will benefit.

421
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,384
Didn't you also have that in mind?

422
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:46,784
I wanted to protect Meikyu Publishing,

423
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:50,084
the fortress of mystery.

424
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:51,684
Tono...

425
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:53,084
You idiot!

426
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,684
Mr. Shimasaki!

427
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:01,584
Those who really love mysteries

428
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:05,384
never take the life of others.

429
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:43,284
What? The manager of this apartment changed.

430
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:45,384
I'm not surprised.

431
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,784
If the manager was drinking from daytime,

432
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:50,384
he wouldn't be able to fulfill his duties.

433
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:52,984
Don't want to waste a drop!

434
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,184
A detective can fulfill his duties despite drinking though?

435
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:02,784
"Next Episode"

436
00:24:02,784 --> 00:24:04,884
If there are really red handkerchiefs everywhere,

437
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:05,984
even if you tie yours on,

438
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:09,084
nobody will know which is yours.

439
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,784
"Hozumi" -Pocket diary? Isn't this...

440
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:15,884
There's blood on the calendar.

441
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:29,084
Next Conan, "Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 1)"

442
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,184
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:47,184 --> 00:24:48,984
"Name in katakana character"

444
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:50,684
How do you write your name in kanji, Conan?

445
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:51,984
"Co" the kanji meaning moth orchid

446
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:53,784
-and "nan" the kanji meaning difficult... -What?
