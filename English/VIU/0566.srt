1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:05,553
Sweet Potato!

2
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:07,453
-Delicious Potato! -Here you go.

3
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:08,653
I bet it's real good.

4
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:11,953
-Piping Hot! -Geez.

5
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:14,353
You think crying can solve everything?

6
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:18,553
It's hot, so you need to blow on it before you eat it.

7
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,953
Like this. Here, have a bite!

8
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:27,253
Where... Where'd you go?

9
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:28,953
Santa?

10
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:31,953
The kid's two years old, name's Santa.

11
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:33,453
About this tall.

12
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:36,653
Blue clothes and green pants.

13
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,053
Santa!

14
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:41,253
Where are you?

15
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:43,553
-Santa! -Be quiet.

16
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,153
Santa!

17
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:53,953
Santa!

18
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:56,453
Watch out!

19
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:04,453
There...

20
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:08,653
This isn't good, Santa!

21
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:09,753
You can't just do whatever you want.

22
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:11,653
There...

23
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:14,153
What? You want to look at the cars?

24
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:16,853
No...

25
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:25,153
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:27,253
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,253
A little companion with a cute name.

28
00:01:29,253 --> 00:01:31,253
Conan's troublesome partner!

29
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:33,053
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:35,053
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,253
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:23,343
"Santa, My Companion."

33
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:27,013
-One, two... -Dad told you to?

34
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:29,413
Yes, he told me to watch this kid.

35
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:34,413
-Go on ahead. -Okay!

36
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:38,913
-One, two... -One, two...

37
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,713
What's your name?

38
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,113
Santa!

39
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,213
Santa?

40
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:48,213
You add honorific to your own name?

41
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:49,913
How old are you?

42
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:56,113
Two years old?

43
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:58,013
How cute!

44
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,813
Ran!

45
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,213
Dad?

46
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:04,913
So you're here, too.

47
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,013
-Mommy! -Conan!

48
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,113
You watched the kid like I told you to, right?

49
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:10,813
Yes.

50
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:13,413
Well, let me introduce her.

51
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:16,113
This is Ms. Shigeko Ishikawa.

52
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:19,713
"Shigeko Ishikawa (30)" -Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:22,613
What?

54
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,613
You were pushed over?

55
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,013
At the pedestrian bridge?

56
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:30,813
Yes, a person wearing a full-face helmet pushed me over from behind.

57
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:34,913
I deliver clothes from a laundry shop as a part time job.

58
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:37,113
When I was in the middle of a delivery...

59
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:46,113
And that's when I happened to walk by.

60
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:48,713
It's a good thing she wasn't hurt,

61
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:50,213
but over the past few days

62
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:53,413
something suspicious has been going, she said.

63
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:56,713
I've been getting this feeling

64
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,813
of being constantly watched.

65
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:05,513
If he only watching from a distance, it wouldn't be a problem,

66
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,413
but pushing her over...

67
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:09,913
We undoubtedly have a case here.

68
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:12,913
Noticing this, I ordered Conan to watch out for the kid.

69
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,313
And I proceeded my investigation.

70
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:17,013
You're too much.

71
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:18,713
Are there any other family members around?

72
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,713
No, my husband died last year.

73
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:24,213
It's just me and my child.

74
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:27,513
Mr. Mouri, I know you're busy, and I'm sorry to bother you.

75
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:29,513
Don't say such a thing.

76
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,813
I am a single father with a kid, too.

77
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:34,413
I am living a life similar to yours.

78
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:37,413
Should anything bad happen to you,

79
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,313
this kid would be left all alone!

80
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:42,413
Something as troublesome as that

81
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:44,813
would never to tolerated by my conscience!

82
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:45,813
Never!

83
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,713
I know how you feel, but even if she's a beauty

84
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,513
I think you're getting carried away.

85
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:53,413
Say, do you have any idea

86
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,313
who the person with the full-face helmet is?

87
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,413
No. Not a clue.

88
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:59,413
Well, let's go!

89
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:03,713
I'll find that bastard and grab him by the neck!

90
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,913
One, two...

91
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:09,413
Hey...

92
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:18,013
Relax your shoulders and act as calmly as you can.

93
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:21,913
-Do not alert them to my presence. -Sure.

94
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,313
Alright. It's perfect so far.

95
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:43,113
"Mouri Detective Agency."

96
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:47,613
Darn, you're bringing me trouble after trouble.

97
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,413
Do you have a grudge against me or what?

98
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:08,213
On to the next news.

99
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:12,913
An adorable baby panda has been born in the zoo yesterday.

100
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:16,113
According to Suzuki, the zookeeper...

101
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:19,713
Good morning, I'm from Sun Sun Cleaning.

102
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:23,113
-Please come in. -Excuse me.

103
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:27,113
"Mouri Detective Agency."

104
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:33,613
Darn, why'd you do that?

105
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:37,613
What's wrong, Santa?

106
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,713
Potty?

107
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,713
Wait, hold it for a while.

108
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,813
Not yet...

109
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,013
-For me? -Yes.

110
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:04,613
Melted candy?

111
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:06,613
Potty, thankies!

112
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,413
No problem, don't mention it.

113
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:11,613
But I guess that was a surprise.

114
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:14,213
-What a turn of events. -Conan!

115
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:15,813
That kid is all right?

116
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:17,313
Santa!

117
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,713
Conan!

118
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:21,113
Santa!

119
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:22,813
What is it? Pop?

120
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:24,913
Conan!

121
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:26,413
You all right!

122
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:29,013
Shigeko was taken by a man!

123
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:30,913
-Taken? -Yes.

124
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:35,213
That bastard hid himself in her customer's house and jumped her!

125
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:38,413
What the heck is he thinking attacking a housewife like that?

126
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:40,813
Boy, I'm with you.

127
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,813
I'm reporting it to the police.

128
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,413
So don't worry!

129
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:46,613
Okay!

130
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:53,613
Well, have you found Shigeko Ishikawa yet?

131
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:54,913
No.

132
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:58,613
We found traces of blood in the backseat of the car.

133
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,513
She might have struggled and hurt herself.

134
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:05,313
The car was stolen from Haido City five days ago.

135
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:07,213
We received a report for this.

136
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,213
That full-face helmet guy again?

137
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:13,013
Judging from the untouched cash,

138
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:16,913
we can assume that the culprit's aim wasn't money.

139
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:19,613
Shigeko is quite a beauty.

140
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:22,613
The culprit may have taken a fancy to her,

141
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,413
but then he couldn't bottle up his desires anymore and took action.

142
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,113
It's a case involving twisted love!

143
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:29,313
Unforgiveable!

144
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:32,113
But would you push over someone you love?

145
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,713
Hey, Conan! How many times have I told you now?

146
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:36,313
You stay out of this!

147
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:37,713
Scat!

148
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:40,013
Fine!

149
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,613
Her bag was open and her things fell out.

150
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:46,113
No! They were scattered.

151
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:48,613
Was that guy after something in the bag?

152
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,013
Thank you, Santa.

153
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:12,213
As I thought.

154
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:15,113
The culprit was looking for something.

155
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:17,813
It happened around 1:30 pm.

156
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:21,613
Did he obtain the key after kidnapping Shigeko?

157
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,913
And what was the culprit looking for?

158
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:29,913
A bird feather?

159
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,613
Why is it there?

160
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:35,613
Santa, good afternoon.

161
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:37,513
I've brought a present for you.

162
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,913
What happened? It's a mess here.

163
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:42,713
We were just playing pro wrestling.

164
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:44,913
Are you friends with this kid, sir?

165
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:45,913
Yes.

166
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,313
"Minoru Moriwaki (22)" -I live upstairs.

167
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,113
My name's Minoru Moriwaki.

168
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:51,113
A vet med student at Beika University.

169
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:52,113
Nice to meet you.

170
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:55,413
Say, do they keep birds in this place?

171
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:58,213
I found this in the room,

172
00:10:58,213 --> 00:10:59,813
but this place was locked,

173
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:02,313
so I wonder where it could've come from?

174
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:05,613
Perhaps it stuck on someone's body and got here that way.

175
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:09,013
For example, maybe on you or Santa.

176
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:12,013
Transfer from someone's body?

177
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,513
Could it be from the culprits?

178
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:17,913
I think this is the feather from a Japanese white-eye.

179
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,913
Let's take a look at Santa's bird book, shall we?

180
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:24,413
Book, look!

181
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:27,313
See, it's white around their eyes, thus the name white-eye.

182
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:30,213
They're in the passer family.

183
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:33,513
There's a bird called black-eye, too!

184
00:11:33,513 --> 00:11:36,613
Oh, they're an endangered species.

185
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,113
I gave you a white-eye figure

186
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:41,113
from the capsule vending machine the other day, didn't I?

187
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:43,513
My friend, present!

188
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:45,713
You gave it away as a present?

189
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:49,813
A white-eye's feather and a white-eye figure.

190
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:51,413
Both involve the white-eye.

191
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:53,813
Do these coinciding facts have anything to do

192
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,413
with Shigeko's kidnapping?

193
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:58,913
Santa.

194
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:02,913
Which friend did you give the white-eye to as a present?

195
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:06,513
There, there and here!

196
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:09,613
What? You gave them everywhere.

197
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:18,613
Santa, which way?

198
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,013
The place where your friend is waiting for your present?

199
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:25,113
-Here! -It hurts...

200
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:26,613
It hurts.

201
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,313
At this rate I'm gonna get bunny ears.

202
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:41,913
Look.

203
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:45,213
No, they don't look like culprit.

204
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:47,313
I said don't pull my ears!

205
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:48,613
Look.

206
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,213
It hurts...

207
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:57,113
It hurts... So you'd like me to go straight?

208
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:59,613
-It's cute! -I want to see...

209
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:07,113
Santa, which way are we going?

210
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:09,813
What's wrong?

211
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:11,513
Santa, please wake up.

212
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:14,413
We're not quite finished here, Santa!

213
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:16,613
Sleepy...

214
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,313
I know you're tired,

215
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,513
but please try to stay awake for a while.

216
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:24,513
No! Sleepy...

217
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,213
I'm the one who wants to cry.

218
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,713
Pop Candy.

219
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,513
Pop Candy?

220
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:40,213
You mean the man who gave you this?

221
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:41,813
Yes!

222
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,213
I see.

223
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:46,213
"Yamanaka."

224
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:48,613
This is?

225
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:54,213
"Shop, 27th, 5 pm."

226
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:56,413
Today at 5 pm at the shop?

227
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:00,213
4:30 pm.

228
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,113
I don't have much time.

229
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,613
Santa, you all right?

230
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:21,913
About your neighbor Mr. Yamanaka,

231
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,813
does he own a pet shop?

232
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:28,713
Yes, I've heard previously that he was selling birds and goldfish.

233
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:31,713
Could you please tell me the location and the name of the shop?

234
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:32,913
Please!

235
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,013
I think it was Beika City's 3rd District?

236
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:39,013
But it seems his shop already went bankrupt.

237
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:42,013
He's going to the shop that went bankrupt at 5 pm.

238
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:45,213
Could it be that Santa's mom is there?

239
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:50,834
Enjoying this, aren't you?

240
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:53,234
Well, beats crying at me.

241
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:56,634
"Pet Shop Yamanaka."

242
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,759
So that's why.

243
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,659
I actually prevented the kid from chasing that Pop Candy.

244
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,659
No wonder this little one was upset.

245
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,459
Hey, sir!

246
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,659
What is it, you kids?

247
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,259
We're looking for someone.

248
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,159
The mother of Santa...

249
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,159
-She's here, isn't she? -I don't think so.

250
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,759
Except for me, no one else is here.

251
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,359
I'm sorry but I'm very busy.

252
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,959
Can you please leave?

253
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,359
Say, about that bird in the cage,

254
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,059
isn't it a black-eye?

255
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,659
Black-eye?

256
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,759
No, it's a white-eye.

257
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,359
Is that so?

258
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,559
It's written right here.

259
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,959
The black-eye species is protected by our country.

260
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,659
It gets its name from the black patch around its eyes.

261
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,659
The yellow feathers from the neck to its chest are its characteristic.

262
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:06,059
Its favorite food is papaya.

263
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,759
No, it's wrong!

264
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,959
If that bird is really a black-eye, the endangered species...

265
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,859
It could sell for a fortune, right?

266
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,459
I said go home!

267
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,959
Sir, you were in this kid's home, weren't you?

268
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,159
This feather had fallen in the room.

269
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,259
My guess is it got stuck on your clothes

270
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,459
and was transferred there.

271
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,859
No! I don't remember!

272
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:31,559
Sir, I think you'll get a lighter punishment

273
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,759
if you turn yourself into the police.

274
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,259
The police?

275
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:38,859
Why do I have to go to the police?

276
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,159
I don't have time for kids!

277
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,459
If you don't leave, you'll regret it!

278
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,859
Listen to me for a little bit more.

279
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:48,359
I think you misunderstood.

280
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,559
About what?

281
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,459
This figure was near the door, right?

282
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,759
The one who put it there was Santa.

283
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,959
Santa.

284
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,459
This kid?

285
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,259
Sir, you gave Santa a piece of candy before, right?

286
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,459
This was a gift for you.

287
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,759
A gift?

288
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,959
The reason for the name "Santa"

289
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,559
is because this kid loves Santa Claus.

290
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,359
That why this kid wants to give others presents, too.

291
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,359
Santa Claus...

292
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,359
Presents?

293
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,559
The one who placed it there was this kid?

294
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,959
As a present...

295
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,159
I see.

296
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:30,759
That's what it was.

297
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,659
Sir, this Santa loves you very much.

298
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:36,659
I think you are highly trusted.

299
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:39,659
You can't let Santa cry, now can you?

300
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:46,159
Santa,

301
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,859
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,959
Mama!

303
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,559
My shop hasn't been doing well,

304
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,459
and my debts grew larger and larger.

305
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,659
That's why I didn't want others to find out,

306
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:11,359
and fled to the mountains in Ogasawara.

307
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,659
I found a black-eye there.

308
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:18,359
A bird that was said to be extinct from that Island.

309
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,959
So Kurata, the man I borrowed money from

310
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:26,159
said he'd sell it for me to an upstart colleague of his who loves animals.

311
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:28,659
But, soon afterward,

312
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:32,059
a black-eye figure is paced at my door by someone.

313
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:37,359
Then, I saw that woman walk away with a suggestive smile,

314
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,759
as if she knew everything.

315
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,159
That woman must've noticed the black-eye!

316
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,259
I thought the figure and her smile were a silent threat.

317
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:51,059
I was only getting my child back.

318
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,359
But you hired that media-buzzing detective.

319
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,559
I didn't want my deal to be broken off,

320
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,859
so I thought that, if you had any evidence against me,

321
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:02,759
I'd take it away. That's why I searched your home.

322
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,259
Santa was smiling so cutely

323
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,559
while looking into the capsule vending machines,

324
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,159
that I couldn't help but to hand out a candy.

325
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,459
And yet I misunderstood the figurine gift,

326
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,859
and the goodwill of the child.

327
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,559
Boy, I vow to become a man

328
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,359
who's suitable for getting presents from Santa.

329
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,059
Please take care of that black-eye.

330
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,759
Pops, here!

331
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,959
What?

332
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,759
A black-eye figure.

333
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,459
Sir, look closely.

334
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:43,059
That bird's a white-eye.

335
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,159
What?

336
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,559
White-eye?

337
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,259
No, the color around its eye is black,

338
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,659
so it's a black-eye.

339
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:52,059
Wrong.

340
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,959
It's just that the white paint fell off,

341
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,059
exposing the original black inside.

342
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:58,659
What?

343
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,059
It's true.

344
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,159
The paint merely fell off.

345
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,259
I viewed this with impure eyes,

346
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:09,659
that's why I failed to notice It.

347
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:13,059
Santa, I'll cherish it.

348
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,359
Cherish!

349
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,859
I've heard your entire stupid conversation.

350
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:20,559
You're going to the police.

351
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,159
-Then I'll take this black-eye. -You can't!

352
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,959
I'm returning this bird back to its island!

353
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,659
-Shut up! -Stop it!

354
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,359
Back off, brat.

355
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,559
I'm calling the police!

356
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,459
Call them if you can.

357
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,659
No!

358
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:40,059
Hang up the phone!

359
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:43,159
Understand, so please release my child!

360
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,659
Until I'm somewhere safe,

361
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,759
this brat is going to keep me company.

362
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,859
-Santa! -Kurata!

363
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,659
What? Did it malfunction because of the struggle?

364
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:56,359
Kurata, let go!

365
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,859
Don't move. Don't you move a bit!

366
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:07,959
Now!

367
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,059
Go!

368
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:48,159
Well, the police said they would consider Yamanaka's circumstances.

369
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,759
I see.

370
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,659
You've very considerate, Santa.

371
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:56,659
What's going on, Santa?

372
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,759
Wearing a ribbon like that.

373
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,259
It's a gift from Ran.

374
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:03,859
That fits you perfectly, Haruka.

375
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:05,559
Haruka?

376
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,059
Could it be that Santa is a girl?

377
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,759
Yes.

378
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,059
But I can't believe you figured that out.

379
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,659
It was when she first hugged me.

380
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,659
I've heard that baby girls hug

381
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:22,359
with their whole bodies.

382
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,859
Conan, so you've known that too?

383
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:27,259
No. I didn't.

384
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:30,559
Actually, I noticed that while we were in the bathroom.

385
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,959
You didn't notice even you were with her all this time?

386
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,959
Is that so?

387
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,359
Is this funny?

388
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,959
All right, come and have fun some other time!

389
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,859
And bring your mom.

390
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,459
"Bring your mom",

391
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,259
I know you'd say that.

392
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,159
Hot Spring Park?

393
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,259
It looks like fun!

394
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:00,759
Let's stop over there.

395
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,459
Let's check out the iron tub first!

396
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:07,159
Something strange.

397
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,359
Someone stood up on top of the cliff

398
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,159
and threw the rock off on Mr. Umezu.

399
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,959
This is not an accident but a murder!

400
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:19,259
I've figured out the trick that the culprit played on!

401
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,659
Next Conan,

402
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:27,759
"Murder Intent Raining on Outdoor Spa."
