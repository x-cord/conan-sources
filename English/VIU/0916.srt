"30th National High School Spring Kendo Tournament"

3
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:20,073
Head!

4
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:21,573
Side!

5
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:25,573
Yes!

6
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:26,573
Winner!

7
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:29,473
Red, Heiji Hattori of Kaiho Academy!

8
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:36,173
Hattori's in the finals now.

9
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:39,073
Yeah. Since only Heiji won

10
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,873
in yesterday's semifinal team match,

11
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:42,573
they didn't make it.

12
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:45,273
But it seems like he should be able to win today's individual match.

13
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:47,473
Yeah.

14
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:49,773
As long as he's not here.

15
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,373
Who do you mean?

16
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:54,873
The boy he'll probably face in the finals.

17
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:57,073
Kyoto Senshin High School's...

18
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,873
Soshi Okita.

19
00:01:05,873 --> 00:01:07,973
Heiji's lost to that five-level strike before.

20
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:11,073
He's strong.

21
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:13,873
What? Five levels?

22
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,273
It only looked like one strike to me.

23
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:22,273
His opponent's being carried away on a stretcher.

24
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:33,873
You just watch, Okita.

25
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:36,973
Today I'll settle the score between us...

26
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:42,073
and tell Kazuha.

27
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,373
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

28
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:51,373
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

29
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:52,973
Heiji's rival Okita appears.

30
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:55,273
What will Heiji tell Kazuha?

31
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:56,773
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:58,573
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:00,973
His name is Detective Conan!

"Toto Gymnasium"

36
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:53,832
Thanks for coming today, Ran, to cheer him on.

37
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:56,832
No problem. It's Sunday. I didn't have anything else to do.

38
00:03:56,832 --> 00:04:01,432
The semifinal and final matches will begin

39
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:04,032
after lunch at 2 pm.

40
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:07,432
2 pm? That's two hours from now.

41
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:11,232
I'm going to get lunch with my friends.

42
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:14,332
You guys should get something to eat, too.

43
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:15,432
Okay.

44
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,832
What do you want to eat, Conan?

45
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:22,432
We can go to one of the fast food places we saw on the way here.

46
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:25,532
Should we go to the bathroom first?

47
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,632
Yeah.

48
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:31,232
No way.

49
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:33,332
The men's and women's bathrooms are crowded.

50
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:35,432
We won't be able to get in for a while.

51
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,832
Excuse me.

52
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:39,832
Do you know where the other bathrooms are?

53
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:43,432
The bathroom outside the north entrance

54
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,232
should be less crowded.

55
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:47,532
Thank you.

56
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:50,232
"Heiji Hattori" -Hattori texted me?

57
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:53,032
Kudo, want to get lunch?

58
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:56,332
Focus on your match.

59
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:57,932
Who texted you?

60
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,932
Dr. Agasa.

61
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,032
Iori?

62
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:07,932
Have the preparations for Heiji's victory party been made?

63
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,632
Yes, on the top floor of the Teito Hotel.

64
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:15,532
It's a surprise. Don't let Heiji find out.

65
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,632
I know.

66
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:23,732
So, do you think Heiji will win?

67
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:26,332
I believe he'll make it to the finals,

68
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:28,732
but winning may be a bit difficult.

69
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:33,032
You mean my classmate, Okita?

70
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,232
Do we need to do something about him?

71
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:38,332
No. He's one obstacle,

72
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:43,832
but there's another very strong student in the tournament.

73
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:47,232
Really? I'm excited.

74
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:50,332
I'll be arriving soon.

75
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,232
Come meet me when I arrive.

76
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:56,032
Yes, Ms. Momiji.

"Shido Nukitani (43)"

78
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,232
You're a Kyoto Senshin student?

79
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:11,732
If you're planning to practice here before your match, don't.

80
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:14,732
You'll damage the grass.

81
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:17,132
You'll get in trouble with the groundskeeper.

82
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:32,232
Excuse me.

83
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:41,132
I thought I heard a groan.

84
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:47,732
Excuse me. Did something happen?

85
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:52,132
Excuse me.

86
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:01,932
Where's the bathroom?

87
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:05,232
There it is.

88
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:10,232
Are you all right? Hang in there!

89
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,232
It's no use.

90
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,532
He's already dead.

91
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,032
But...

92
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,932
His body's not that cold yet.

93
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:22,132
The killer might be nearby.

94
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:23,532
What?

95
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:27,532
We didn't pass anyone on the way here, right?

96
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:28,632
No.

97
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:30,732
Excuse me.

98
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:33,532
Did something happen after all?

99
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:35,732
"Did something happen"?

100
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:42,432
Mister, are you blind?

101
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:45,532
Yes, since three years ago.

102
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:49,732
What are you doing here?

103
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:53,132
I was listening to the sounds of the kendo tournament.

104
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:54,432
The sounds?

105
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,632
The sound of feet striking the floor.

106
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:59,332
The sound of bamboo swords clashing.

107
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:01,932
The shrill vocalizations of the combatants.

108
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:05,232
I was listening to the sounds that can be heard out here

109
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:08,132
and thinking about the past.

110
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:12,132
I used to practice kendo when I was young, too.

111
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:16,132
Until four years ago, I used to watch from the stands,

112
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:18,332
but since I lost my sight,

113
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:24,132
I started listening to the tournaments alone here.

114
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:27,232
So, did something happen to someone?

115
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:30,432
A man's throat was cut. He's dead.

116
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,332
What?

117
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:37,332
Then the person who approached me after I heard a groan

118
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,832
must've been the killer.

119
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:42,832
Did they ignore him because he's blind?

120
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:47,432
By the way, the killer said something.

121
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:51,932
"This box cutter is bloody and useless."

122
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:56,132
"Bring me another one."

123
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:59,032
You heard the killer's voice?

124
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:03,532
Yes. I didn't hear the voice of the person they were speaking to,

125
00:09:03,532 --> 00:09:07,132
so they were probably on the phone with someone.

126
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:10,632
Do you know which way the killer went

127
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,532
after they approached you?

128
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,932
Yes, that way.

129
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:17,832
Towards that bathroom.

130
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:21,232
Did anyone walk past you after that?

131
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:24,432
Yes, about two people.

132
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,632
I thought they went to the bathroom,

133
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:31,232
but after that, I don't think anyone exited the bathroom

134
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:34,332
and walked past me.

135
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,232
Then the killer...

136
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:39,832
is still inside that bathroom?

137
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,832
Okay.

138
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,532
Don't, Ran!

139
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:48,432
The killer told their accomplice to bring them a new blade.

140
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:51,232
It sounds like they still have another target.

141
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:55,032
It's better for us to call the police and keep watch here.

142
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,532
I see. You're right.

143
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:08,932
There isn't a single defensive wound.

144
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:11,532
-Officer Takagi? There's a dead man -Was he killed by someone he knew?

145
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:14,132
next to the bathroom at the Toto Gymnasium.

146
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:18,332
You already sniffed out the murder, Hattori?

147
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:19,632
Huh?

148
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:22,432
It's like they were breaking in a new sword.

149
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:27,032
Furthermore, this looks like the work of a rather skilled swordsman.

150
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:28,632
Who are you?

151
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:30,532
Who? Me?

152
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:33,432
I'm Kyoto Senshin High School student,

153
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,932
Soshi Okita.

154
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,032
What?

155
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,732
Okita?

156
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:44,532
Perhaps you're the five-level striker Kazuha mentioned earlier?

157
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,432
You're really cute.

158
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:53,232
What's your name?

159
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:56,232
Ran Mouri.

160
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:59,432
Ran? That's a nice name.

161
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:02,832
I live in Kyoto's Kamigyo Ward.

162
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:06,632
Let me know if you ever come to Kyoto.

163
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,832
I'll show you around.

164
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:11,132
Who is this guy?

165
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:14,932
He's exactly like Shinichi.

166
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:21,332
You said the person who attacked this man

167
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,932
might be a skilled swordsman.

168
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,232
How can you tell?

169
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:27,332
You mean you can't?

170
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:30,932
It certainly looks like he was cut down by a single blow.

171
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,032
No...

172
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:33,732
It's his clothes.

173
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,632
-His clothes? -Yeah.

174
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:40,132
Navy blazer, gray pants, dark red necktie.

175
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,132
He's a kendo referee.

176
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,432
I see!

177
00:11:44,432 --> 00:11:47,132
If he's a referee, he must be ranked.

178
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:50,132
I figured the killer must be pretty skilled

179
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,932
to kill a man like that with a single blow.

180
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:57,932
He really is just like Shinichi.

181
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:02,732
What? Have you fallen in love with me?

182
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:04,032
No.

183
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:06,432
Don't underestimate a samurai.

184
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:10,332
I can sense it.

185
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:26,036
No one can sense that, idiot!

186
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,036
Hattori.

187
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:31,636
And that's my friend's girl.

188
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:32,936
Stay away from her.

189
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:36,536
Who cares? I haven't seen him around.

190
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,936
You sure have. Is there a problem?

191
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:41,636
Anyway, I just came to get some practice swings in

192
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,036
before my match against you.

193
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,736
I wasn't expecting you to be here,

194
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:49,336
much less caught up in a murder.

195
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,136
You came to do some practice swings, too?

196
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:54,436
Oh? Too?

197
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:57,536
Does that mean I'm on your radar?

198
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:03,236
Nah. There's one other fighter I might lose to.

199
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:09,836
It sounds like the police are here.

200
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:11,636
Who's the old man?

201
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:14,136
Oh, he's...

202
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:18,836
What? You heard the killer's voice?

203
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,536
Is that true, sir?

204
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:22,336
Probably.

205
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:25,536
They called someone on the phone and said the following,

206
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:29,036
"Katsunari Yasuoka (78)" -"This box cutter is bloody and useless."

207
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:32,636
"Bring me another one."

208
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:35,136
They said a bunch of other things,

209
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:36,936
but since they were speaking quietly,

210
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:39,736
I couldn't hear them.

211
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,736
According to you,

212
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:44,836
after killing the victim, they headed to the bathroom.

213
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:48,836
Later, about two people passed by you

214
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,136
and also headed to the bathroom.

215
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:54,436
But by the time Ran and Conan came here and discovered the body,

216
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:57,336
no one's left the bathroom.

217
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,336
They must still be inside.

218
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,536
Yes.

219
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:03,036
Inside that bathroom...

220
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:05,036
is the murderer.

221
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,836
I'll check the women's room.

222
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:08,436
Officer Takagi, check the men's room.

223
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:09,736
Got it.

224
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:12,436
Be careful.

225
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,736
The killer could still have a box cutter.

226
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:17,336
Okay.

227
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,736
It should be obvious who the killer is.

228
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,236
They'll be covered in blood.

229
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:28,436
"Nenji Norimura (40)" -What's going on?

230
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,736
"Tsuneyuki Yokote (28)" -The bathroom's available.

231
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,936
"Akane Sadamori (31)" -The toilet paper's almost out.

232
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:34,836
Be careful.

233
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,436
None of them...

234
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:39,936
Have blood on them?

235
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:44,736
Did something happen?

236
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:47,036
What?

237
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,136
Mr. Nukitani?

238
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:50,336
Mr. Nukitani!

239
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:53,136
Hold on.

240
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:56,736
That outfit. You're a referee, too.

241
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,036
In other words, you're ranked.

242
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:01,836
You sure you didn't kill him?

243
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:05,536
Kill him? Mr. Nukitani's dead?

244
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:08,236
Yeah. Sliced his neck right open.

245
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:09,736
It wasn't me.

246
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:14,836
But it's true that you knew each other.

247
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:17,936
Yeah. We're both referees.

248
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:21,036
And we frequently faced each other in tournaments.

249
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:25,136
But I'd never beaten Mr. Nukitani.

250
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:29,536
You didn't kill him because you couldn't win, did you?

251
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:31,736
Of course not.

252
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,936
I've never seen that man before.

253
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,236
Me, neither.

254
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:42,936
But there was a photo of you with this man on his phone.

255
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:45,536
Right, mister?

256
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:46,836
Yeah.

257
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:49,336
See?

258
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:52,736
That's...

259
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:55,936
Come to think of it, Mr. Nukitani often mentioned...

260
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:56,936
What?

261
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:58,836
That he was being hit on by a student

262
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:02,236
who was a former Self-Defense Force official.

263
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:03,636
A student?

264
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:06,536
Does that mean you used to practice kendo, too?

265
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:10,036
Yeah, just for three years in high school.

266
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:14,536
Mr. Nukitani was the gym teacher and adviser of the kendo club.

267
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:17,136
Then why did you say you don't know him?

268
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:20,736
Because I don't want to get involved in the case, obviously.

269
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:22,736
By the time I walked past here,

270
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:26,536
Mr. Nukitani was already bleeding from his neck and dead.

271
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:31,236
Why didn't you report it to the police?

272
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:35,036
I had a lot going on. I was shaken up.

273
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,736
How about when you came to the bathroom?

274
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:41,236
I'm not sure. I didn't have time to use the bathroom this morning,

275
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:43,036
so I was in a hurry.

276
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:47,436
It's possible I didn't notice Mr. Nukitani.

277
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:50,336
How about when you came?

278
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:53,936
I was in a hurry because I was about to wet myself, too.

279
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:56,836
But I've never seen that man

280
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:58,336
and I've never done kendo before.

281
00:16:58,336 --> 00:16:59,736
I've got nothing to do with this case.

282
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,636
You're lying.

283
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:05,536
I saw you bragging to your lady friend

284
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:06,936
while you were having tea

285
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:09,836
at a cafe in Beika City with Mr. Nukitani.

286
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:13,536
You said, "I once won a kendo tournament."

287
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,636
You said, "I wish I could've shown you

288
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:18,936
the victory pose I struck after I won."

289
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:23,136
You were arguing with Mr. Nukitani who was sitting next to you.

290
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:26,436
He asked you which tournament that was.

291
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:30,636
And I remember how the woman with you left you there

292
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:32,936
with a disgusted look on her face.

293
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:36,136
Well, you were arguing with him, too.

294
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,736
You said you'd kill yourself or someone else

295
00:17:37,736 --> 00:17:40,236
if he didn't leave his wife.

296
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:44,736
Not to mention that referee

297
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:48,836
was arguing with Mr. Nukitani

298
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:50,636
after yesterday's final team match.

299
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,136
Oh, that?

300
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:56,636
When I said his refereeing had been a little lax lately,

301
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:59,636
he said to hold my complaints until after I'd beaten him.

302
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:01,836
It made me angry.

303
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:07,736
In other words, you all had a motive to kill Nukitani.

304
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:11,736
Excuse me.

305
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:16,836
Can't we determine the killer by asking this old man?

306
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:19,836
He heard the killer's voice.

307
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:22,136
Right, sir?

308
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,736
Well, actually...

309
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:30,736
None of them are it.

310
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,936
What?

311
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:36,736
I heard the hoarse voice of a man.

312
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,236
Hoarse voice?

313
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:41,336
Could it have been Mr. Nukitani's voice?

314
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,736
It was the victim's voice?

315
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:51,236
You heard the request for a new box cutter before a groan?

316
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:52,336
Yes.

317
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:57,136
Then the person who brought the box cutter killed him?

318
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,036
Well...

319
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:02,136
Who's the last person in the victim's call history?

320
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:04,536
The victim's wife.

321
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:07,236
She's on her way here now.

322
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:08,836
What's going on?

323
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:15,136
It's possible the killer erased themselves from his call history.

324
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,436
It's crazy back here.

325
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:18,536
-What? -What?

326
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:19,736
Behind the bathroom.

327
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:20,836
Come check it out.

328
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:26,136
There's a bloody uniform and armor back here.

329
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:30,336
Maybe the killer was wearing them when they killed Mr. Nukitani.

330
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,136
They're right between the men's and women's bathrooms.

331
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:38,336
Isn't that a set of Kyoto Senshin High School armor?

332
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:41,836
Come to think of it, after yesterday's team match,

333
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:47,436
a first-year said our spare armor and uniform were missing.

334
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,136
A spare set? Then it must've been worn by a bunch of guys.

335
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:54,436
I wore that yesterday.

336
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:59,136
I was asked to practice with someone before their match.

337
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:02,136
Then you must've met Okita then.

338
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:04,736
I did skip practice.

339
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,036
If it was worn by multiple people,

340
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:09,636
then it'll be difficult

341
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:12,536
to determine the killer's identity using DNA.

342
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:15,836
Yeah. Since the uniform can be worn over your clothes,

343
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:17,636
we can't expect much.

344
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:18,636
In any case,

345
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:21,936
tell the tournament organizer to put the matches on hold.

346
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:23,936
There's been a murder.

347
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:25,536
Got it.

348
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:28,436
Hold on! You can't stop the tournament!

349
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,736
What? Why not?

350
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:33,236
Because, well...

351
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:35,436
Could it be?

352
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:38,036
I...

353
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,936
There's something I've got to say to her

354
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:42,536
after I win this tournament!

355
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:46,936
-Huh? -What?

356
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:51,736
We've got 40 minutes before the matches start.

357
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:54,436
We just need to solve the case before then, right?

358
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:56,736
But...

359
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:59,136
In any case, you can't stop the tournament.

360
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,236
Hattori.

361
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:03,936
Maybe I misheard you,

362
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:08,636
but did you just say something about winning the tournament?

363
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,336
I sure did. What about it?

364
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,836
I see. Which means...

365
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:18,036
you think you'll beat me?

366
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:20,036
Of course, idiot!

367
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:23,136
Then we don't need to wait until the match.

368
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:27,336
Why don't we settle this here?

369
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:32,136
I'd love to, cuckoo of Mt. Arigata.

370
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:47,536
Wait a minute.

371
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:51,136
He means Kazuha, doesn't he?

372
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:55,436
That means if Hattori wins this tournament...

373
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:59,336
he's going to confess his feelings to Kazuha?

374
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:07,736
Ran sure is taking a long time.

375
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:10,936
If they don't hurry, the matches will start.

376
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:17,136
That's delicious. Fragrant, too.

377
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,136
Your tea is always fantastic, Iori.

378
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:22,736
Thank you, miss.

379
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,736
"Next Episode" -Now that I've caught you...

380
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,736
you're not getting away.

381
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:54,336
No. It is me who has come to find you.

382
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:55,836
"Onimaru"

383
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:58,536
This name...

384
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:01,736
Cutter?

385
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:03,636
What about a change of clothes?

386
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:05,136
Sorry, Kudo.

387
00:24:05,136 --> 00:24:07,836
This case is mine.

388
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:14,336
