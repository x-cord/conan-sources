1
00:00:03,258 --> 00:00:04,857
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:06,257
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:07,857
Great adventure at the mansion of tricks.

4
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:09,557
Surprising tricks that are dangerous enough to take lives.

5
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:11,657
Youth Detective Squad, outfox that snobbish guy!

6
00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:13,157
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:14,757
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:17,058
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:56,357
I figured out the mail address of the boss of the Black Organization

10
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:59,757
from the melody of the "Seven Baby Crows".

11
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:02,057
But I decided not to pursue any further

12
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:04,458
after Haibara gives me a piece of her mind.

13
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,558
In the meantime,

14
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,158
Genta and the others found a strange stone box.

15
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:15,157
And there, they find a code having to do with the Big Jewel,

16
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:19,558
as well as a strangled corpse beside it.

17
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:24,158
And in its hand brimming with stones.

18
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,957
Hey, Conan.

19
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,957
What is it? Tell us what follows.

20
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:35,757
Its hand brimming with...

21
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:37,658
the Big Jewel!

22
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,158
No doubt about it.

23
00:02:54,658 --> 00:03:00,558
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Tricks."

24
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:05,057
I see.

25
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:10,258
I guess this is the start of diamond cut diamond.

26
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,457
What's that?

27
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,657
It's a proverb of Belgium.

28
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,457
In order to cut hard diamond, another diamond has to be used, right?

29
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,957
Therefore, it refers to the start of a composed yet vicious battle

30
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,158
between the sages and the strong men.

31
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:29,558
But who's battling against who?

32
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:34,357
Idiot.

33
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:37,957
Neither he nor I is something as great as a diamond.

34
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:44,157
He's just a thief who hides the truth under a veil and enjoys it.

35
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:50,258
And I'm just a detective who's dying to tear off that veil.

36
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:57,257
And? Just who is that thief?

37
00:03:57,258 --> 00:04:01,958
Are you talking about the partner of the man who was sunk into the swamp?

38
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:07,457
A snobby evil thief who only goes after large gems like Big Jewel,

39
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,858
called Thief Kid.

40
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,758
Thief Kid...

41
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:15,958
Yes.

42
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,157
I know that name.

43
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,657
Elusive and daring.

44
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:23,257
Gentleman thief.

45
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:25,457
Doc has told me

46
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,658
about your battles.

47
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:30,257
Our battles?

48
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:33,257
It seems that you've been outfoxed quite a few times?

49
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,657
It's not that he outfoxed me or anything.

50
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:38,657
Because he's never stole any treasure from me yet.

51
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:40,958
Is Thief Kid here?

52
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,857
It's just my guess.

53
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,757
It was written in the man's notebook, right?

54
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:51,358
"So now I can outfox that petty thief that puts on airs."

55
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:56,157
That petty thief that he was referring to is probably Thief Kid.

56
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:59,257
Then are you saying the one that killed that man...

57
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,357
Was Thief Kid?

58
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,657
Beats me.

59
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:06,957
Rumour has it that he never takes a person's life though.

60
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,357
But it's for sure that Thief Kid as well as the one who killed that man

61
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,657
is still around here somewhere.

62
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,157
Right,

63
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:16,558
if the treasure hasn't been found yet.

64
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,358
It's most likely that it's inside this mansion.

65
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:29,657
Well, it's started to rain.

66
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:33,457
So let's take shelter from the rain and take a look inside.

67
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,458
Then...

68
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,857
We're going to start...

69
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:38,257
Treasure hunting, right?

70
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,257
Don't get me wrong.

71
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:43,657
It's only until Doc calls the police and they get here, understand?

72
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:45,458
All right...

73
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:23,257
But now that we're going inside, it sure is a creepy mansion.

74
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,557
Are you sure there's treasure in here?

75
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:30,357
I'm sure it's hidden somewhere in here.

76
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,757
It bothered me a while ago, but...

77
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:35,857
The brand new traces of wet mud on the border of the wall

78
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:38,557
and the floor of the mansion.

79
00:06:38,558 --> 00:06:41,457
Moreover, throughout the mansion there is...

80
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,057
I wonder why?

81
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:44,558
Hey, Conan!

82
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:48,457
Explain the meaning of the writing one more time!

83
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,357
The meaning of the writing that was written inside the stone lantern.

84
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,557
Oh, that...

85
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:57,957
The God Nioh is not around, right?

86
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,357
Right.

87
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,557
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

88
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:06,257
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

89
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,557
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

90
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:11,257
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

91
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:14,357
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

92
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:17,257
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

93
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:19,457
Kichiemon Samizu.

94
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,257
In other words,

95
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:24,957
the God Nioh sleep in a place closest to the sun

96
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,457
and where the elders gather, in a very lively place.

97
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,357
That's where the stone of the God Nioh is.

98
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:34,257
In other words, the place where the diamond is hidden, right?

99
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:37,657
But the point is the words that follows.

100
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,357
Yes, that's right.

101
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,657
Conan went on to explain it part way and became silent,

102
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,357
so we still don't understand it.

103
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:46,357
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

104
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:49,757
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

105
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:52,458
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

106
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:56,157
What does that mean?

107
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:58,257
The God Nioh is going to get angry after all.

108
00:07:58,258 --> 00:07:59,357
Right.

109
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:02,657
And the comma-shaped bead made of stone with the word fire carved onto it

110
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:05,857
that was hidden in the hem of the dead body that was found a while ago.

111
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:11,757
I have no idea what this has to do with the code.

112
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,557
Hey, let's go inside already.

113
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,457
Hold your horses.

114
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,357
Isn't there anything else written in that man's notebook?

115
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:22,457
There is,

116
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,857
but since it's wet I think we should wait until it dries.

117
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:27,957
Otherwise it'll rip and become unreadable.

118
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,258
We don't have all day, you know.

119
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,058
Hey, Genta!

120
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,157
Genta!

121
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:41,157
Don't go inside carelessly.

122
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,558
The puppet maker Kichiemon built this mansion, you know.

123
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,857
The diamond is in a place nearest to the sun, right?

124
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,957
-If so, then I'm sure it's hidden... -Hey, Genta!

125
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,758
at the top most part of the house!

126
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:03,558
At any rate, let's go to the very top.

127
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,257
Hold it, Genta!

128
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:11,557
One step at a time. It's gonna be alright.

129
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:12,758
What?

130
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,458
Genta!

131
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:28,158
-Genta! -Genta!

132
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:34,558
Huh?

133
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,457
What's with you kids?

134
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,957
Genta, are you all right?

135
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,957
Are you guys looking for Kichiemon's treasure, too?

136
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,457
No.

137
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,757
Well, who cares?

138
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,057
You'd better be really careful though.

139
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:56,858
This step is a trap!

140
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,757
If you want to go up, you have to go on farther beyond.

141
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:08,157
Puppet maker Kichiemon is quite a sourpuss, you know.

142
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:13,157
If you move just according to what you see, you'll get hurt.

143
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:16,657
By the way, didn't you guys found an odd looking stone?

144
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,357
As to that...

145
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:21,657
We didn't found anything!

146
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:23,457
Oh, really?

147
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,157
Tell me if you found it then, okay?

148
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,057
Okay, sure!

149
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:30,157
Hey, Conan.

150
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:32,557
Why are you lying?

151
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:35,458
He's a good man who saved Genta, you know?

152
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:39,458
You never know if he's a good man.

153
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:44,557
He could acting friendly just so he can take away the stone.

154
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:49,457
Yes. If that guy is Thief Kid the more so.

155
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,758
He could even be the guy who killed the body that was found a while ago.

156
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:58,057
But it seems that we'd be safer staying close to the guy

157
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,857
because he seems to know a lot about the traps inside this mansion.

158
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:04,357
Also so that he doesn't get away till the police get here.

159
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:08,758
I wonder if Doc got hold of the police already?

160
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:13,257
Is it still farther away?

161
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,957
That dilapidated mansion?

162
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,058
Well...

163
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:22,058
It's hard to find it in the dark.

164
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:27,357
Now, which way was it?

165
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:29,258
Come on.

166
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,457
Oh, carps!

167
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,857
There are a lot of them.

168
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:38,457
This place is like a high class Japanese restaurant

169
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,757
with the river flowing throughout the house.

170
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:44,058
I wonder if it's connected to the swamp outside.

171
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,557
Look.

172
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:48,158
There's even a bridge.

173
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,558
All right.

174
00:11:58,258 --> 00:11:59,958
A pitfall?

175
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:09,557
I'm not going to fall for the same trick this time.

176
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:11,858
No, it looks like a pitfall but it's actually...

177
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:38,857
Amazing!

178
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,858
It's just like an elevator.

179
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:45,157
Conan.

180
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:46,958
Get on quickly.

181
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:55,757
In other words, if we try to go up, we end up going down.

182
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:59,457
And if we try to go down, we go up, right?

183
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,657
Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty simple.

184
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:02,858
Yes!

185
00:13:06,658 --> 00:13:07,958
Here we are.

186
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,458
It was simple, wasn't it?

187
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,257
How silly.

188
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:18,457
If it were that easy,

189
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,157
we wouldn't have to go through the trouble of looking for it.

190
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:24,958
Isn't it right, treasure hunter with kids?

191
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:31,257
These kids are not with me.

192
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:34,957
And I don't think you should be using knives around kids.

193
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,658
Take a good look at the tip of the knife.

194
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,557
Poison spider?

195
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:43,457
Kichiemon was not only a sourpuss

196
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,358
but he seems to have been quite mean, too.

197
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,557
If you want to go to the very top, it's this way.

198
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:53,257
Hey, could she be Thief Kid?

199
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,357
I thought Thief Kid was a boy.

200
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:58,558
I've heard that he disguises himself as a woman, too.

201
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:06,657
Right, kids. Be careful now.

202
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:08,758
The spider could still be around somewhere, you know.

203
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:13,958
Wait for me!

204
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:22,357
Conan, hurry up and come.

205
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,958
You're going to get bitten by the poison spider!

206
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:27,558
I'm coming!

207
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:33,357
Hey, look!

208
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,857
It seems like we've reached the top.

209
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,357
But there's nothing here.

210
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:40,557
Does it mean it's on the roof?

211
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:43,957
In order to climb up on the roof...

212
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,257
Strange.

213
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:48,457
How come there are no thick pillars on this floor?

214
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,358
Here it is. A ladder!

215
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,957
There were thick pillars on the floors below.

216
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,757
Okay! We're going to be the first ones to get there.

217
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,457
Wait a second.

218
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,658
If the big pillar were to be hollow...

219
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:05,958
No! That's a trap!

220
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:13,657
Hey!

221
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:14,658
Shoots!

222
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,857
Genta! Ayumi!

223
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,758
Mitsuhiko! Haibara!

224
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:03,646
Hey, are you all right?

225
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:06,246
I'll send a rope down right now!

226
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:07,946
Remember, we were saying,

227
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:11,447
if you try to go up, you'll fall down.

228
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:15,147
Not again.

229
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,146
Are you guys all right?

230
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,646
-Yes. -Yes.

231
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:27,647
Yes.

232
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,046
We somehow got down safely,

233
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,546
but we're down at the very bottom, aren't we?

234
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:37,746
We were supposed to go to the top.

235
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,646
I checked on top the roof, but there was nothing there.

236
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:42,846
Really?

237
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:45,146
You were probably right to come down here.

238
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:48,147
It hurts.

239
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:51,147
What?

240
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,746
Skulls!

241
00:16:57,747 --> 00:16:59,246
Hey, Conan!

242
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:02,446
Hey, this place is full of skulls!

243
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:03,447
What?

244
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,546
From the looks of their outfits,

245
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:10,446
they look to be treasure hunters.

246
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,447
No.

247
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,647
Even this old man, too.

248
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,247
Not an old man, but an old woman.

249
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,746
I slept well.

250
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,446
She's alive!

251
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:36,747
Which means that you're our rival, too?

252
00:17:38,547 --> 00:17:41,246
You're a treasure hunter, aren't you?

253
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:43,846
I'm not here on leisure.

254
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:46,846
I just came to pay homage to the grave.

255
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,246
Grave?

256
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:52,146
Yes. Kichiemon's grave.

257
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:54,546
Kichiemon Samizu's grave?

258
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:56,847
The grave of Kichiemon Samizu?

259
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:00,047
This time for sure, I'll be the first one!

260
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,246
At the rate you're going,

261
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:05,547
the kids will get to the treasure before you do.

262
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:10,546
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me.

263
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,446
Samizu Kichiemon."

264
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:16,346
Hey, grandma. Isn't this a code?

265
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:17,946
Oh, is it?

266
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:21,146
I just took it to be Kichiemon's gravestone.

267
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:23,746
But what does it mean?

268
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:26,846
Is it asking for some kind of offering?

269
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,346
But we have no flowers or food.

270
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,946
Come to think of it,

271
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:36,246
the man who was found in the swamp was also holding and hiding something.

272
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:39,446
The comma-shaped bead made of stone.

273
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:41,846
Sir.

274
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:44,346
You asked a while ago

275
00:18:44,347 --> 00:18:47,346
if we found an odd looking stone, right?

276
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:51,346
Don't you have an odd stone on you, too?

277
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:52,846
What?

278
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,746
We found one, too.

279
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:58,946
One of the sacred treasures made of stone.

280
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,746
Hey, Conan.

281
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:03,946
Didn't you said to keep that a secret?

282
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,146
What was written on it?

283
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:10,646
Something was carved on the stone you found, right?

284
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:13,147
So you found one, too.

285
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:16,746
Well...

286
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:18,146
Oh, my.

287
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:21,246
Under these circumstances, I don't think that hogging information

288
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,746
would do anyone any good.

289
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,146
Right, right.

290
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:28,146
If you don't want to be excluded,

291
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,147
hurry up and show us what you have.

292
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:33,947
Okay.

293
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:45,146
The thing I found is this mirror made of stone.

294
00:19:45,147 --> 00:19:48,946
The letter carved on it is forever from the word eternal.

295
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:52,246
Then, it does have something to do with the sun.

296
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:55,846
Because it keeps burning forever, too.

297
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:58,346
Which means that the one that you kids found

298
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:01,346
had something like flames carved on it?

299
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,246
Yes.

300
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:05,646
You hit the bull's eye.

301
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,546
But I can't make it out.

302
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,746
Forever and flames.

303
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:12,846
Maybe if we stick those stones somewhere inside the gravestone,

304
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:18,746
the God Nioh stone which is the diamond will come out?

305
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:20,546
What makes you think so?

306
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:25,146
Because it was carved inside the stone garden lantern

307
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:29,446
that the diamond would be in a busy place where elders get together, right?

308
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:33,346
Is this the busy place where elders get together?

309
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,846
Yes. What was it?

310
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:38,946
The resting place of the God Nioh?

311
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,346
The resting place of the God Nioh is nearest to the sun,

312
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:46,546
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

313
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:50,346
That is where the God Nioh stone is, right?

314
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:51,347
Yes!

315
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:53,446
I guess you want to interpret the part that goes,

316
00:20:53,447 --> 00:21:00,146
"An extremely busy place where the elders get together"

317
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:02,846
to this shabby pile of dead bodies.

318
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,446
Yes.

319
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:07,946
But those here are the foolish ones

320
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,446
who have been blinded by greed and decayed,

321
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,446
not being able to find the way out of here.

322
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:17,946
When Kichiemon built this mansion, none of them were here.

323
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,546
I guess so.

324
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:22,446
Then you saw the lanterns, too?

325
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,346
They weren't sunk in the swamp though.

326
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:29,647
At any rate, I guess the treasure is not here.

327
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:35,746
Because this grave doesn't seem to have a place to insert the stone.

328
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:38,846
I guess we'll have to find the other sacred treasure

329
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,946
to solve the mystery.

330
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:42,646
The other?

331
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:45,146
They're called the three sacred treasures.

332
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:48,346
The mirror and the comma-shaped bead were found,

333
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:50,446
so there should be one more somewhere.

334
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:52,546
The three sacred treasures?

335
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:55,346
Yes. The mirror is the Mirror of Yata,

336
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,546
the comma-shaped bead is called the Magatama of Yasakani.

337
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:00,346
And the remaining one

338
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:03,346
is the sword of the God Nioh.

339
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:06,546
It got its name because it is said to have saved God Takeru Yamato,

340
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:08,446
who was in a pinch

341
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,646
by slashing down the grass when fire was set to the field.

342
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:13,447
The Sword of Kusanagi.

343
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:19,547
-The Sword of Kusanagi? -The Sword of Kusanagi?

344
00:23:56,547 --> 00:24:01,546
"Next Episode."

345
00:24:01,547 --> 00:24:02,547
Brat!

346
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:08,147
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me."

347
00:24:16,947 --> 00:24:20,546
We'll be washed down to the valley below by the water.

348
00:24:20,547 --> 00:24:26,547
Next Conan, "Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Case Closed".

349
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,646
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,746
"Kichiemon Samizu."

351
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:48,046
Is Kichiemon some kind of gate?

352
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:49,846
-No. -It's the name of a person!

353
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:51,347
That's what it usually is.
