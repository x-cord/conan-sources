1
00:00:01,703 --> 00:00:03,102
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,902
Turns out to a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:06,402
The truth behind the murder committed behind illusion.

4
00:00:06,403 --> 00:00:09,002
Is it a cleverly devised trick or blinding magic?

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:10,502
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:12,102
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:14,003
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:55,196
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show."

9
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,127
Pops received a call from the famous magician, Mr. Genyo Fuyuki,

10
00:01:58,128 --> 00:02:00,828
saying that he wants to meet Pops right away.

11
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,500
"Genyo Fuyuki (35)" -Mr. Fuyuki says

12
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:06,700
that someone in the troupe is after his life,

13
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:09,101
so Pops has to find out who it is.

14
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,201
There are five members in his troupe.

15
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,100
"Misa Uehara (26)" -His assistant, Ms. Misa Uehara.

16
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,401
"Chiaki Nakagawa (24)" -Likewise, Ms. Chiaki Nakagawa.

17
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:21,701
"Kazuma Ishida (19)" -Mr. Kazuma Ishida, who is in charge of taking videos.

18
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,901
"Shingo Shoji (37)" -Mr. Shingo Shoji, in charge of stage performance.

19
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,300
"Minoru Hasegawa (45)" -And Mr. Minoru Hasegawa,

20
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,300
who is in charge of operating the crane.

21
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:32,000
Afterwards, soon after conducting investigations,

22
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:33,501
the magic show began.

23
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,399
And...

24
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,401
What the...

25
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,701
Shoots!

26
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,701
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

27
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:06,700
"Trick Versus Magic (Part 2)"

28
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:11,701
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show."

29
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:23,046
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

30
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,346
Just what are you doing?

31
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:25,747
Hurry and unlock the lid!

32
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:32,546
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

33
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,747
Hasegawa, pull up the lid!

34
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,247
Did something happen?

35
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:49,646
The ambulance!

36
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,546
-Call the ambulance! -Yes, sir!

37
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:54,846
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

38
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,947
-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

39
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:02,847
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

40
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:10,346
Leader...

41
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,346
-Mr. Fuyuki... -Leader!

42
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:13,646
Mr. Fuyuki!

43
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:15,746
Get a hold of yourself, Fuyuki!

44
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,046
-Leader! -Mr. Fuyuki...

45
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,146
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

46
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:20,446
Mr. Fuyuki!

47
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:21,547
Mr. Fuyuki.

48
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:24,747
No good.

49
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:28,347
Leader.

50
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:34,346
This is all I filmed.

51
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,546
We got absorbed watching it.

52
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:38,547
It's a valuable film though.

53
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,646
It's amazing how you kept on filming.

54
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:42,647
It's nothing.

55
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:46,046
Thanks to these videos,

56
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:48,346
we have more or less an idea of what took place.

57
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:52,446
But how was this magic supposed to work out in the first place?

58
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:56,246
Mr. Fuyuki was supposed to be standing on top of the aquarium

59
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,546
when the curtains were raised.

60
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,646
How was he supposed to escape from the aquarium?

61
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,846
Well...

62
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,846
We can't tell you from our side.

63
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,346
Why not? This is for investigation...

64
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:11,046
Inspector.

65
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,146
It doesn't matter if it's for investigation purposes,

66
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:16,046
we can't reveal how the magic is performed.

67
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,247
I know how!

68
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:22,547
The secret is on the lid of the aquarium, isn't it?

69
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:25,646
Just as I thought.

70
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:28,446
Hey, what do you mean by that?

71
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,047
See, look at this.

72
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:32,146
Huh?

73
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:35,346
This latch doesn't have the pin that holds it in place.

74
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:41,446
That's right, when the assistants put shackles on Mr. Fuyuki's legs,

75
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:45,746
they locked the latch on the lid and also the padlock, right?

76
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:49,547
They're both real, but they removed the pin holding the latch in place.

77
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,747
That way, the lid comes off easily, right?

78
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,946
Then, Mr. Fuyuki was put in the aquarium

79
00:05:57,947 --> 00:05:59,547
and was later covered with the curtains.

80
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:02,846
He used his abdominal muscles and got up

81
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:05,246
and grabbed the handle that was hidden in back of the lid,

82
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,346
stuck his head out of the lid and took a breath.

83
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,546
There's really a handle.

84
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,647
So this is how it was.

85
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:17,146
Mr. Fuyuki immersed his body back into the water

86
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:21,147
and showed that he was struggling in water after the curtains were raised.

87
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:23,247
Dad.

88
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:25,046
No, that's his performance.

89
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,746
He's not giving any signal.

90
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:29,546
And when the curtains were lowered again,

91
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:33,646
he removed the handcuff that was rigged earlier so it'll come off easily,

92
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:37,146
and used his abdominal muscles again to get up.

93
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,746
He grabbed the handle that was hidden in back of the lid

94
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,846
and escaped from the aquarium.

95
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,246
I see.

96
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:45,147
Fantastic, Conan.

97
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:48,946
I saw it on television before.

98
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:51,846
Was what he said just now correct?

99
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:52,946
Yes.

100
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:55,346
Well, I guess so.

101
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:57,446
According to the report,

102
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:01,846
it is 10 to 1 that Mr. Fuyuki drowned to death.

103
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:06,446
The question is whether this is just an accident or rigged by someone.

104
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,246
I know who did it, Inspector.

105
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:09,646
What?

106
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:12,646
This is homicide and the murderers are...

107
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:16,246
Ms. Misa Uehara and Ms. Chiaki Nakagawa!

108
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:17,346
What?

109
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:19,746
-Hey! -How can you say that?

110
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:24,146
You both conspired to kill Mr. Fuyuki

111
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:28,646
and pretended to remove the pin from the lid of the aquarium but didn't.

112
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,246
You've got to be kidding!

113
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:32,546
We removed the pin like we were supposed to!

114
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:34,547
-See! -See it for yourself!

115
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:38,846
Besides, the lid was opened like it's supposed to be, isn't it?

116
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:39,847
Look.

117
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:48,146
You could've gotten the pins back when you were trying to save Mr. Fuyuki.

118
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,746
Just what do you think you're saying?

119
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:53,346
Chiaki and I were holding Mr. Fuyuki's body, you know.

120
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,346
You were the one that was holding the lid!

121
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:57,746
Oh, that's right.

122
00:07:57,747 --> 00:07:58,747
Pops.

123
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,846
Wasn't the lid opened then?

124
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,847
I wonder if that's true.

125
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:08,246
I was also thinking about that,

126
00:08:08,247 --> 00:08:13,646
but it was easy to open the lid when we were trying to save Mr. Fuyuki.

127
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:16,547
Which means that the pins were removed.

128
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:21,347
Let's watch the video Mr. Kazuma recorded one more time.

129
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:25,747
After this.

130
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,046
Why did you pan it?

131
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:39,746
Because I didn't want to reveal the trick.

132
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,946
You can't possibly reveal it by filming it.

133
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:44,046
Well, it's fine.

134
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:45,047
Please show us the part

135
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:49,246
where Mr. Shoji said he removed Mr. Fuyuki's feet from the lid.

136
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:50,247
Yes, sir.

137
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:54,346
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

138
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:55,746
-It's after here. -Mr. Fuyuki!

139
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:57,546
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

140
00:08:57,547 --> 00:09:00,547
-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

141
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,647
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

142
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:13,246
Leader...

143
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,046
-Mr. Fuyuki... -Leader!

144
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,746
Mr. Fuyuki.

145
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,547
-Stop the video. -Yes, sir.

146
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,046
Why did you pan it?

147
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,046
I already told you to film the necessary parts.

148
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,646
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,447
Too bad, isn't it, Inspector?

150
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:33,247
It is unlikely that Misa or Chiaki had anything to do with the murder.

151
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:38,546
Kazuma.

152
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:39,947
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:46,446
Come to think of it, Mr. Kazuma,

154
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:49,846
you gave something to Mr. Fuyuki during break, didn't you?

155
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:51,646
Oh, it was medicine.

156
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:54,146
Medicine? What medicine?

157
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:56,546
A beta blocker.

158
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:58,546
Beta blocker?

159
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,946
It's a blocker drug.

160
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:03,146
It lowers his heart rate.

161
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:05,646
He always drinks it about 15 minutes before performing

162
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,546
the "escape from underwater" magic

163
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:11,246
that requires him to stop his breath for a long time.

164
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,646
Is it under Mr. Fuyuki's orders?

165
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,546
Of course.

166
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:16,646
I got it!

167
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:20,647
You switched that drug to a drug for hypomyotonia.

168
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:23,646
"Kinchikannzai (Forbidden pervert crime)" -Forbidden pervert crime?

169
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,846
"Kinchikannzai (Forbidden pervert crime)" -Just what're you talking about?

170
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,646
It's a drug for hypomyotonia.

171
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:30,246
Taking this drug causes a condition similar to adynamia,

172
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:32,846
in which the hands and legs muscles lose strength

173
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:37,246
and it becomes impossible to get up using one's muscles, too.

174
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,646
But when the curtains went up once,

175
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:42,346
although Mr. Fuyuki looked like he was struggling,

176
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:43,747
he didn't send out any signal.

177
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:48,947
Well, at that time, the drug was still not working.

178
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:51,846
It started working when he tried to get up the second time

179
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,346
using his abdominal muscle.

180
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:54,846
Please wait.

181
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,046
I respect Mr. Fuyuki, so why would I do something like that?

182
00:10:57,047 --> 00:11:00,546
Deep down in your heart, didn't you have a grudge against Mr. Fuyuki?

183
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:04,547
He wouldn't let you be on stage as a magician for such a long time.

184
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:08,046
That can't be.

185
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,446
As proof of that,

186
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:12,646
when everyone was trying to save Mr. Fuyuki,

187
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:15,246
you alone kept filming the scenes.

188
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:17,946
If you really respected your master,

189
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:20,246
when the situation calls for life or death,

190
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,647
you couldn't possibly be filming the scene.

191
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,846
That's because...

192
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:27,446
Mr. Fuyuki kept telling me

193
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:31,146
to always keep a record of everything that happens, even accidents.

194
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:33,246
He said that it would serve as proof

195
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,246
that Genyo Fuyuki has always been a professional magician.

196
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:36,247
Forensic officer.

197
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,546
Yes, sir. What is it?

198
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,346
Then, did you really switch the drugs?

199
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:42,346
Of course I didn't do it.

200
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,646
An analysis of the corpse's blood?

201
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:45,647
I understand, sir.

202
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:46,946
I'll be waiting.

203
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:50,546
It's going to take some time before we get the results of the analysis,

204
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:53,947
so I'd like everyone to wait in the waiting room till then.

205
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,647
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show."

206
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:05,947
What's the matter, Conan?

207
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,547
I need to go to the restroom.

208
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:11,447
Gosh.

209
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:17,346
Try to remember that magic.

210
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:18,946
Where is it?

211
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,747
I'm sure that somewhere, the murderer's trick is hidden.

212
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:29,847
Back then, the chain was lowered completely.

213
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:34,247
Come to think of it, back then...

214
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,247
Maybe...

215
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,146
Let's take another look at the video.

216
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:44,147
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

217
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:54,947
Officer Takagi!

218
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,847
Just what do you think you're doing, Takagi?

219
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,447
I am sorry, I did it unintentionally.

220
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,947
-What's the matter with you, clinging on like that? -Give me a break.

221
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:07,646
Come to think of it,

222
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,646
after the curtains went down for the third time,

223
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,347
it became pitch dark once.

224
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:22,146
This latch...

225
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:24,547
Huh? Did you find something again?

226
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:28,346
Doesn't this latch look strange?

227
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:31,646
Isn't the middle part of the latch usually long?

228
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:33,146
That's right.

229
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,546
It's surprising that you noticed.

230
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,246
Besides, I wonder what this hole is.

231
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:39,146
I was concerned about it, too.

232
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:41,746
It looks like someone tried to open it later after that.

233
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:43,047
Later?

234
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:51,846
Conan.

235
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,346
You sure took your time in the restroom.

236
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:56,346
I had a stomachache.

237
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:58,046
Oh, well.

238
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,346
Hey.

239
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:03,346
Have you been using the same latch on the lid from before?

240
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:04,546
The latch?

241
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:05,846
No.

242
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:08,347
It got old so it was recently changed to a new one.

243
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,647
And who changed it?

244
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:14,247
I need to go to the restroom again!

245
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:16,746
I got it.

246
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:17,847
All I need now is proof!

247
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:23,947
Watch closely. We may have overlooked something.

248
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:29,247
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

249
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:33,647
I've found the proof.

250
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,872
The murderer is him after all!

251
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,629
Nothing was detected?

252
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,729
Yes, we got report from the lab

253
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,229
that no traces of a drug for hypomyotonia

254
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,429
was detected in Mr. Fuyuki's blood.

255
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,530
So Mr. Kazuma is cleared.

256
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,129
We can't really get anything out of the video either,

257
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,730
so I guess we can't keep them here any longer.

258
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,129
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

259
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,929
Darn it! I was pretty sure I was right and yet...

260
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,729
Hey, Pops.

261
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,930
What is it, kid?

262
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,729
This way.

263
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,330
What is this strange thing you're telling me about?

264
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,229
There's nothing here.

265
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,530
Hey, kid!

266
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,529
Huh? Mr. Mouri said so?

267
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,430
Yeah, he told me to get everyone to gather at the stage.

268
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,829
Inspector, maybe...

269
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,730
He's here! Now, we will know the truth.

270
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,430
Hey, Officer Chiba.

271
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,830
Pops! Everybody's gathered!

272
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,029
Everyone, this case was indeed very peculiar.

273
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,529
What I mean

274
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,029
is the magic that was performed on stage itself was rigged beforehand.

275
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,329
The murderer rigged the magic

276
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,029
that was already rigged with his own devised trick.

277
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,529
This ended up in a double and triple trick.

278
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,829
But it is my mistake for not being able to see through it beforehand.

279
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,829
Although it's delayed, I'd like to point out the murderer

280
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,830
who killed Mr. Fuyuki with his cleverly thought out trick.

281
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,629
It's you, Mr. Shingo Shoji, the stage director!

282
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,829
What?

283
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,129
During the time the "escape from underwater" magic was being performed,

284
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,229
you, who were supposed to be watching the monitor

285
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,329
was in fact, not there.

286
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,030
You were on the beam right above the aquarium.

287
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,529
But if he were there,

288
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,029
wouldn't he be seen by the audience, Misa and the others who were on stage?

289
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,829
No, he couldn't be seen from the audience.

290
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,929
It was dark on top of the aquarium since the light did not reach there.

291
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,829
Of course, Misa and Chiaki who were on stage

292
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,929
and Mr. Hasegawa who was behind the stage, couldn't see him either.

293
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,729
No, we couldn't see him.

294
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,029
True.

295
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,029
Let's say the murderer was hiding on the beam,

296
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,629
then how did he kill Mr. Fuyuki?

297
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,229
From the camera shot taken from the audience,

298
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,529
there were no signs of anyone approaching the aquarium.

299
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,229
That's right.

300
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,829
It's impossible to approach the aquarium

301
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,129
without being seen by the audience or being filmed by the camera.

302
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,429
Impossible?

303
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,729
No, it's not impossible.

304
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:45,529
When the curtains were raised showing Mr. Fuyuki struggling in agony,

305
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,829
you, who were on the beam, used the chain from the crane

306
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,230
and landed on top of the lid.

307
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,829
The technique is possible

308
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,429
because of Mr. Shoji's experience of being a magician in the past.

309
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,229
After he landed on the lid,

310
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,229
he stuck the pin in the connecting part of the latch in question.

311
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,529
But how did he get back up on the beam of the ceiling?

312
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,929
Mr. Shoji did not go back to the beam of the ceiling.

313
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,529
He came out of the bottom of the aquarium.

314
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,829
Bottom of the aquarium?

315
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,429
After the curtain was lowered,

316
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,030
he jumped down from the top of the lid.

317
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,229
When the stage went dark for an instant,

318
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,229
he swiftly came out from under the curtain

319
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,929
and ran over backstage.

320
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,829
And when everyone realized that something was wrong,

321
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,629
he made everyone bring Mr. Fuyuki down,

322
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,629
distracting everyone from the video and all.

323
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,029
So he should have the pins on him, right?

324
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,229
Takagi, search his body!

325
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,629
Yes. Please excuse me.

326
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,730
Go ahead.

327
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,929
Please check very carefully

328
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,329
because I can't take being accused as the murderer anymore.

329
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,929
Inspector, he doesn't have it on him.

330
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,629
Did you check thoroughly?

331
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,230
The pin is small, so he could've thrown it out somewhere.

332
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,129
According to reports from the forensic officer,

333
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,029
there were no pins found on stage.

334
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,429
Maybe it's in the aisles or waiting room?

335
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,929
Chiba was with them right through in the waiting room.

336
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:19,429
Even if we did find the pin, we have no proof that he threw it out.

337
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,030
There is proof.

338
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,029
Mr. Shoji didn't use a pin.

339
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,229
He used a ring instead.

340
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,230
A ring?

341
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,229
Inspector!

342
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,129
Please look at the latch on the lid of the aquarium.

343
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,429
The latch on the lid?

344
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,630
There should be a hole that shouldn't be on the latch's connector.

345
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,529
This?

346
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,529
He pulled a ring that could be opened through the hole of the connector

347
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,429
and stuck it and rigged it so that the lid wouldn't open.

348
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,729
And that ring...

349
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,129
Mr. Shoji, you're wearing it on your middle finger.

350
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,130
Excuse me.

351
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,029
I found it. It's a two strand ring.

352
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,030
There is a slit in that two strand ring so they can easily be separated.

353
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,429
I'm sure it's rigged so that it can be twisted and opened even more.

354
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,129
It's true.

355
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,829
What's the meaning of this?

356
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,529
Being a magician, I can work out one or two tricks.

357
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,929
First of all, you've got no proof that I used that ring.

358
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,729
Let's not be so unrelenting.

359
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,429
Let's take a look at the video Mr. Kazuma took one more time, then.

360
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,430
Officer Chiba!

361
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,730
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

362
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,130
Stop!

363
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,230
It's the ring!

364
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,029
Which means...

365
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,429
It means I had the ring on all the time.

366
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,230
Please look a little before this image.

367
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,830
The ambulance!

368
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,630
The ring is not there.

369
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,929
After he pulled me away from the lid,

370
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,129
he removed the ring that was put through the hole of the latch's connector

371
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,030
and took off the feet shackles from Mr. Fuyuki.

372
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,930
Mr. Shoji, do you admit to committing the crime?

373
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,630
I have no regrets.

374
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,430
Because I got to perform the magic of my lifetime.

375
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,930
What did you say?

376
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,429
Mr. Shoji, isn't magic supposed to entertain people?

377
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,529
How could you think of using it as a tool to commit murder?

378
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,329
You're not only disqualified to be a magician,

379
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,530
but you're a failure as a human being as well!

380
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,129
It's gotten so late.

381
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,629
But your deduction was great again, Dad.

382
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,129
Well...

383
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,429
But I don't remember a thing.

384
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,930
Hold it! This may be the ultimate magic.

385
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,629
What's the matter?

386
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,729
Ran, from now on, I'm making a change from the Sleeping Kogoro

387
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,830
to Magician Kogoro.

388
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,830
Huh?

389
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,230
Shall I make you sleep again?

390
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,829
"Next Episode."

391
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,829
It's the last of a popular movie that's been playing for 20 years.

392
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,229
"Film content" -Strange.

393
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,829
See, there are two tickets for the preview of this movie three years ago,

394
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,230
unused in between the pages of his pocketbook.

395
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,530
Maybe he has no intention...

396
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,930
of coming back here.

397
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:28,330
Next Conan, "Preview of Karma and Friendship".

398
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,029
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,329
"Stage actor."

400
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,129
In the next episode, the troupe in Konpira is in trouble!

401
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,029
I can make kinpira too, you know.

402
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,530
She's cracking an hour special joke.
