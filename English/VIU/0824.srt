00:00:07,723 --> 00:00:11,222
Now way. What should we do now?

3
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:13,222
I'm thinking.

4
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:14,723
Will you shut up?

5
00:00:20,723 --> 00:00:22,322
Hello!

6
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,022
Is anybody home?

7
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:27,022
Please hurry! I'm going to leak!

8
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,722
Hang in there, Genta.

9
00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:30,222
Just a little longer.

10
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:32,422
Somebody!

11
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:33,722
What? It's open.

12
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:35,022
All right!

13
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:37,022
I'm coming in!

14
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:38,823
-Genta! -Restroom...

15
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:43,822
Fantastic!

16
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:46,122
There are so many toys!

17
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:49,122
This is indeed a museum of toys.

18
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:50,823
Where is it?

19
00:00:52,323 --> 00:00:54,823
Hey, there's someone here!

20
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,322
Please let me use your restroom.

21
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:02,323
Sure. We'd be more than glad to.

22
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:09,022

Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color.

24
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:13,522
A toy mansion that everyone dreamed of.

25
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:15,722
But something is wrong here.

26
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:17,422
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:17,423 --> 00:01:19,322
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:21,923
His name is Detective Conan!

00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,817
Look! Isn't that Gomera?

31
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,816
It's really huge!

32
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:16,516
Bro, why'd you let them in?

33
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:18,016
I couldn't help it!

34
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:19,816
Let's hurry and let him use the restroom

35
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,617
and get them out of here.

36
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:25,716
Hey.

37
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:27,216
Isn't that the restroom?

38
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:28,517
Really?

39
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:38,616
This is not the restroom.

40
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:41,216
Sir, your name is Mr. Masaki Amamiya, isn't it?

41
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:42,316
What?

42
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:44,616
It was written on the name plate.

43
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:47,916
And he's your big brother Sho, right?

44
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,817
After all, you call him Bro.

45
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:52,616
Right, that's right!

46
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,916
I'm his big brother, Sho Amamiya.

47
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:58,116
And I'm his little brother, Masaki Amamiya.

48
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:00,316
Only the two of you live here together?

49
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,216
Yeah! We're brothers that love toys

50
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:04,917
and we get along really well together.

51
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,916
Toys are great!

52
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,616
Forget that. I'm looking for the restroom.

53
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,917
Sorry, sorry.

54
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:15,116
Over here.

55
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:17,617
Idiot! That's the bathroom!

56
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:20,516
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:22,516
We just moved here, you see.

58
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:25,116
Where is the restroom?

59
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:28,316
That's why you're both wearing gloves.

60
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:30,416
Sorry to intrude on you while you're moving.

61
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,516
Yeah.

62
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,617
Well...

63
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,917
I found it! The restroom is over here!

64
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,017
Thanks!

65
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,216
What a relief!

66
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:49,916
Hey, since we're already here,

67
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,316
why don't we ask them if we can stay here until the rain stop?

68
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:55,016
Sounds good. Maybe we can help them move...

69
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,916
No!

70
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,216
Let's go already.

71
00:04:58,217 --> 00:04:59,816
What?

72
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:02,916
Doc will worry if we don't get back soon, right?

73
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:05,417
-Now, let's go. -Okay...

74
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:08,417
We're sorry to have intruded on you!

75
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:11,017
Be careful on your way home.

76
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,017
Someone help!

77
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,616
Darn it. That woman got up!

78
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,116
This isn't good. Guys, hurry!

79
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,417
Stay there!

80
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,817
What is going on?

81
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:33,917
You're not getting away.

82
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:37,516
Run! They're robbers!

83
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,117
What?

84
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:46,417
Shoots. My shoes and tranquilizer gun are all being repaired.

85
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,917
Darn it.

86
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:56,016
Forget it already, bro.

87
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:58,116
Let's just leave the brats and split.

88
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:02,216
Idiot! The gold plates are somewhere in this house for sure!

89
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:05,516
We haven't seen the treasure yet, so how can we leave?

90
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:06,517
Let's go!

91
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,516
Okay.

92
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:12,416
The initials on the matching sweatshirts were K and M?

93
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,316
Yeah. Also...

94
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:16,316
there was a woman's one-piece dress.

95
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,916
The names of the real residents of this house

96
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,516
is most likely a man named Kakeru and a woman named Maki.

97
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:24,617
Then the scream we just heard was...

98
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,116
Let me go!

99
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:29,316
-Genta! -Genta!

100
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:31,517
Gosh! Isn't there something we can use?

101
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,616
I said, let me go!

102
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:35,917
Get down, Genta!

103
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:45,117
-We did it! -We did it!

104
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:47,716
-Genta, hurry! -Okay!

105
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,317
Please, help me!

106
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,017
Over here!

107
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,116
There she is!

108
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,316
Are you all right?

109
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,716
Yes.

110
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,916
I was just passed out.

111
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:03,016
You're Mrs. Maki Amamiya, right?

112
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,617
Who are you?

113
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,916
Don't tell me only you children are here?

114
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:09,816
We're not ordinary children.

115
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,716
We're members of the Detective Squad!

116
00:07:11,717 --> 00:07:13,717
-What? -Oh, no! Here they come!

117
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,516
Gosh!

118
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:20,016
They got away because you're a slow poke!

119
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:21,717
What are you doing, idiot?

120
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:28,516
Hurry and look for them!

121
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,817
I know.

122
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,417
Gosh, where are they hiding?

123
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:44,616
This sure is some house, though.

124
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:47,016
I know, it's full of toys.

125
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:50,916
My husband is a grown up child, you see.

126
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,916
He's a toy collector.

127
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,216
Where's your husband now?

128
00:07:55,217 --> 00:07:57,916
I don't know. He was supposed to be at home, though.

129
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:00,016
I was taking a shower, you see.

130
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,217
Wait a minute. Is there a phone here?

131
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:06,416
Those two said they cut the phone line.

132
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,816
They took my cell phone, too.

133
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:12,816
We left our cell phones at the camping site, too.

134
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:15,916
Which means we can't contact outside.

135
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:17,516
But it's strange.

136
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:21,716
Around this time, the police usually come to patrol the area.

137
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,916
Well, the downpour today is really heavy.

138
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,316
So maybe they're running late,

139
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:29,616
or working on a landslide somewhere else.

140
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:30,617
No way!

141
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:32,817
I heard a voice coming from that side!

142
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:44,417
Isn't there something that could serve as a weapon?

143
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:56,716
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:59,316
I got you and the others involved.

145
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:01,217
It's not your fault, Maki.

146
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:04,816
What should we do with them, Bro?

147
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,717
What else?

148
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:10,616
We'll tie them up and...

149
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,817
Hold it!

150
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,016
No way.

151
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,916
Idiot! It's only a toy!

152
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,116
Originally yes.

153
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:25,117
But it's my husband's hobby to remodel things like these.

154
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:28,917
Would you like me to try it?

155
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:32,817
Now!

156
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:36,916
She's shooting me!

157
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,416
-Are you guys okay? -Yes!

158
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,516
She shot me in the chest! I'm going to die!

159
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:45,017
Idiot! Don't die on me!

160
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,416
You're not even bleeding!

161
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,417
What?

162
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:53,316
Darn it!

163
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:55,217
Sorry, Bro.

164
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:58,516
How dare those guys deceive us?

165
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,117
Stop!

166
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,517
Hurry!

167
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:26,617
I'm going to kill those guys!

168
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:35,617
This way! This way!

169
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:46,717
You're not getting away!

170
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,517
How dare you?

171
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,816
Gosh! What's this?

172
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:18,516
It's super adhesive glue that's used to make plastic models.

173
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:20,117
Now, Genta!

174
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,017
Help!

175
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:38,417
All right. The stairs are scattered with the balls that they threw.

176
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:46,016
Those brats!

177
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,916
It's too dangerous, Bro!

178
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,317
Shut up! You must come, too!

179
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:55,717
Bro! Behind you!

180
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,917
No way!

181
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,817
Bro!

182
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,216
Now is our chance! Hurry!

183
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,517
Okay!

184
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:28,216
That is...

185
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:29,217
That can't be...

186
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,316
Conan?

187
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,817
You guys leave without me!

188
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:41,917
This is...

189
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:45,017
Kakeru?

190
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:48,417
Don't tell me those guys did this?

191
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:00,456
Maybe...

192
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:02,957
we're going to end up like him.

193
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:05,956
It all depends on you guys.

194
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,157
Right?

195
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:17,256
Someone called "God" online said

196
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:20,656
that there are a lot of gold plates in this house.

197
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:21,657
"God?"

198
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:24,456
Don't tell me you robbed this house because God told you to?

199
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:26,856
Are you guys out of your minds?

200
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:28,457
Watch your mouth!

201
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,456
Where are the gold bars?

202
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,357
Hurry and spit it out or I'll kill you!

203
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:40,956
All right. Found it.

204
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:43,456
Now we can pay off all our debts, right?

205
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,357
Of course.

206
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:50,056
We can say goodbye to the debt collectors.

207
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:53,656
But won't the police be coming after us?

208
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:56,056
Compared to the collectors, the police are way better.

209
00:13:56,057 --> 00:14:00,156
Besides, if we shut that lady and those kids up,

210
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:02,856
the police won't ever get to us.

211
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:04,856
There are quite a lot in here.

212
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,356
This is nice.

213
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:08,557
Yeah, it'll probably work.

214
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:12,056
How about this, Conan?

215
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:13,756
Yeah, not bad.

216
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:15,756
You look more handsome than you usually do.

217
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:17,356
What?

218
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,257
I'm only joking.

219
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:21,956
Why?

220
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:24,356
How can everyone be so carefree at times like this?

221
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:27,156
That's because Conan is with us.

222
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,256
He always overcomes every desperate situation,

223
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,257
no matter how bad it is.

224
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,356
Hey, Bro.

225
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:39,656
Are you serious about killing off the kids, too?

226
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,657
Maybe we should ask "God" first.

227
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,956
It's already too late.

228
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:46,456
They've seen our faces.

229
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:48,157
So we have no choice but to kill them.

230
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:02,256
Monster!

231
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,957
Don't run! Hurry and get them, idiot!

232
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:06,956
Shut up!

233
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:09,056
You've done nothing but order me around!

234
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:11,357
I'm tired of it!

235
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:15,557
What did you say, you idiot?

236
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:22,357
We did it!

237
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,557
Guys, let's get out of here!

238
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:36,356
What the...

239
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:38,456
You tricked me.

240
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,057
You brats!

241
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:45,957
Ayumi!

242
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:49,957
Ayumi!

243
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,456
Ayumi!

244
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:01,856
Genta!

245
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:02,957
Conan!

246
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:11,557
I won't let you get away anymore, you brats.

247
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:25,256
These guys stink.

248
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:28,056
We couldn't take a bath for a long time.

249
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,556
Poor thing.

250
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,356
You must've had it tough.

251
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,157
You're right.

252
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:39,257
Everybody! The police will be arriving soon, too!

253
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,556
Hey, wait a minute!

254
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:44,956
We didn't kill anybody, you know.

255
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:47,156
It's too late for excuses!

256
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:48,656
We're not lying!

257
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:52,556
We pretended to kill him, just to scare you guys.

258
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:54,356
You can't fool us anymore!

259
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:56,456
What? Where's that boy?

260
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:58,556
-What? -Conan?

261
00:16:58,557 --> 00:17:00,856
He was just here until a minute ago.

262
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,557
I wonder where he went?

263
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,757
What are you doing?

264
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:17,757
What are you doing, Conan?

265
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:25,256
So...

266
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:29,557
you're the one who killed your husband after all, Maki.

267
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:34,956
Rather, the one who planned this crime,

268
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:37,156
and the mastermind of the robbery,

269
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,557
"God".

270
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,556
Where's all this coming from?

271
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,856
Those words rang a bell in me.

272
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:47,356
Those two guys... They don't look religious at all,

273
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,056
and yet they're using the word "God."

274
00:17:49,057 --> 00:17:51,756
Someone called "God" online said

275
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:54,957
that there are a lot of gold plates in this house.

276
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:57,356
Hey, Bro.

277
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:59,556
Are you serious about killing off the kids, too?

278
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:01,756
Maybe we should ask "God" first.

279
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:04,256
But if the God that they're referring to

280
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:07,856
is the handle name of the one who planned this crime,

281
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:11,856
an alias used online, then everything falls into place.

282
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,656
There is a mastermind called "God" manipulating those two.

283
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:19,556
And if you rearrange the romanized spelling of the letters "KAMI",

284
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,556
that's right, you'll get "MAKI".

285
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:25,056
Which is your name, Maki.

286
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:26,456
Anagram.

287
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:29,556
Rearranging your name letters, when creating a handle name,

288
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:31,956
is a method that is often used.

289
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:34,456
That's just a far-fetched argument.

290
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:35,557
Yes.

291
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:42,357
But you're the only one who could've killed your husband, Maki.

292
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,857
What do you mean by that?

293
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:50,056
Your husband seems to have lost a lot of blood, right?

294
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:51,356
From what I saw,

295
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,556
the killer must've gotten a lot of blood splattered on them, too.

296
00:18:54,557 --> 00:19:00,156
Enough blood that they had to take a shower to get it all off.

297
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:04,156
However, no blood were seen on those two guys.

298
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,857
Then those two probably took a shower and...

299
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:12,256
That's right. Those guys haven't taken a bath recently.

300
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:16,256
Of course, they didn't take a shower in the bathroom here, either.

301
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:19,156
They even mistook the shower room for the restroom.

302
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:23,056
They probably didn't even know where the restroom was.

303
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:27,056
In other words, there's only one person who took a shower here.

304
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:30,256
That... That won't serve as evidence.

305
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:32,456
Splattered blood not only goes on your body,

306
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:35,756
but a lot of residue is found on your clothes, too.

307
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,656
I thought something was strange

308
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:40,557
because this one-piece dress was quite damp.

309
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:44,756
You hurriedly washed the blood off it, right?

310
00:19:44,757 --> 00:19:46,256
I think you already know,

311
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:48,856
but no matter how much you wash something, a blood test will...

312
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,157
Enough already.

313
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,956
You're right. I killed my husband.

314
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:56,956
I killed that freak who kept turning the wealth

315
00:19:56,957 --> 00:20:00,357
that was supposed to be inherited by me to those stupid toys!

316
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:09,256
All there is left to do was for those two to come at the instructed time,

317
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:12,456
unaware of anything and rob this house.

318
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:15,156
I planned on framing them for the crime

319
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:18,156
after telling them where the fake golden bars were.

320
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,256
While they were taking their time getting the job done,

321
00:20:20,257 --> 00:20:23,356
I was going to get them arrested by the police who comes patrolling.

322
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:24,756
This way, I would be a pitiful victim

323
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,056
whose husband was killed by robbers.

324
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:29,557
Anybody would think so, right?

325
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:33,756
Though thanks to the rain,

326
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:37,256
the circumstances have change.

327
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:38,857
But it doesn't matter.

328
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:45,056
You're going to be gotten rid off, too,

329
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:46,857
by those robbers!

330
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,456
Hey, Conan.

331
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:52,656
Conan?

332
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:55,057
-Run, you guys! -What?

333
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,956
-Maki? -What's going on?

334
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,157
Either way, Conan is in trouble!

335
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:14,357
Idiots! Run away!

336
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,657
I'll start by getting rid of you guys first!

337
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:24,357
Darn it! Bummers!

338
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,157
All right.

339
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,857
Go!

340
00:21:37,457 --> 00:21:38,857
Get out of the way!

341
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:21,656
I don't want to look at toys for awhile.

342
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:24,556
-Me neither. -True.

343
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:27,656
Kids! You guys did a good job this time, too.

344
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:28,657
What do you say?

345
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,157
It's not so often, but I'll get you some toys as a reward.

346
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:34,557
What?

347
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,757
I don't think they want any.

348
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:43,556
"Next Episode" -Ryuji Kimijima, age 48.

349
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,056
He is the 2nd generation president

350
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,657
of a food manufacturing company.

351
00:23:47,457 --> 00:23:50,657
Why did you have to die and leave me behind?

352
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:53,156
What do you mean?

353
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:56,056
Ryuji can't swim at all.

354
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:57,657
This is unmistakably a mur...

355
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:01,256
Mr. Mouri?

356
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:03,657
There's another person, isn't there?

357
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:10,257
