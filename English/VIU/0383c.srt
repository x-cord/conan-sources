1
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:18,438
It is the top of the fourth inning,

2
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,538
the batter for Ohgane High School

3
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:23,738
is number five, left fielder, Shigeta.

4
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:28,038
Shigeta versus Sakuraba.

5
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:29,838
The first pitch.

6
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:31,538
He hit the ball!

7
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:33,538
It's up! The left line.

8
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:37,338
He caught it! He caught the ball!

9
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,838
Great play!

10
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,838
That third is really fantastic!

11
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:52,638
Yes. He sure is.

12
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:02,838
At any rate, let's get with this code.

13
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:05,138
Before the end of the bottom of the sixth inning,

14
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:09,138
we've got to locate where this number 47,3, 4 indicates

15
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:12,138
and find the second cell phone!

16
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,538
Before that man wearing the white cap

17
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:17,438
uses the bomb to commit suicide.

18
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:22,338
But these numbers are hard to figure out again.

19
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:24,938
Not really. I've figured out half of it.

20
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:26,138
What?

21
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:31,738
Because we figured out that the first code 96, 7, 13,

22
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:35,038
indicated that the first cell phone was on the 13th aisle

23
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:38,438
at the edge of the left pole.

24
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,738
96 is the distance from the home base to the pole.

25
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:45,238
The seven in parenthesis is the number on the back of the uniform

26
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,738
and left of high school baseball.

27
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:50,838
The final 13 means the seat on the 13th aisle!

28
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:53,938
Which means that the number 3 in the parenthesis of the numbers 47, 3, 4

29
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:56,238
is the number on back of the uniform

30
00:01:56,238 --> 00:02:00,238
and the last number four means the fourth aisle of a seat somewhere, right?

31
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:04,538
But we've got to find out where that somewhere is.

32
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:08,538
Number four is probably the one that indicates that.

33
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,938
There's no doubt that it's a seat by the first base.

34
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:15,838
In high school baseball, the player with number three is at first base.

35
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:19,838
But Heiji, the one wearing number three at Konan High School

36
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,938
is the third base.

37
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:26,438
Out!

38
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:30,538
He's special so you shouldn't be concerned about him.

39
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:32,838
But if the guy made the code in accordance

40
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:37,438
to this final game between Konan and Ohgane,

41
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:40,438
maybe it would be of some concern.

42
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,238
Okay, tell you what?

43
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:46,938
I'll go check the fourth aisle of the infield stand by first base,

44
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:48,738
so you go check the third base side.

45
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:49,738
Okay.

46
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:51,038
What about me?

47
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,838
After you get us into the infield stand,

48
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:58,838
wait for us at the map of the Koshien outside that we saw a while ago.

49
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:02,738
That place is right in the centre of the infield stand

50
00:03:02,738 --> 00:03:04,238
of the first and third base,

51
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:06,638
so whether I find the cell phone or the kid does,

52
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:09,038
it'll be easy for us to join up.

53
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:10,738
Okay. While I'm waiting,

54
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:13,938
I'll call and ask my superior at Hyogo Prefectural Station

55
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:19,638
if the Takano Transport company that was bombed and set on fire

56
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:22,838
by the guy wearing the white cap had been hated by someone recently.

57
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,638
Do that will you, Mr. Ohtaki?

58
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,538
Strike!

59
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:31,738
Three strikes.

60
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,138
Eight strike outs in a row!

61
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:40,338
The droning ball shows no signs of weakening at all even at the finals.

62
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:45,538
Hey, what's with you, kid?

63
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:49,438
I'm just looking for something.

64
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,538
Okay, they're really going for it!

65
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:54,438
Will the ninth player strike out in a row?

66
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:59,838
Idiot! Use more balls and slow down the progress of the game.

67
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:05,338
What? Is that true?

68
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:08,438
Last month the truck of Takano Transport...

69
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:12,138
Huh?

70
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:26,838
It's a homerun!

71
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:27,838
In the bottom of the fourth inning,

72
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:29,938
thanks to the hit of the big slugger of Konan High School,

73
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,238
they've taken a one point lead.

74
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:36,438
No, no. I can't be watching the game.

75
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:38,938
-I got to find it quick. -Super batting just as expected.

76
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:40,138
Moreover,

77
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:43,538
-he's using a wooden bat and not a metal one. -47, 3 and 4.

78
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:46,338
-Incredible. -47, 3 and 4. What is it?

79
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,938
Metal?

80
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:56,138
Metal...

81
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:57,238
Metal.

82
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:28,784
Strike! Batter out!

83
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:31,784
Kubota gets three strikes and is out!

84
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:32,784
But in this inning,

85
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:36,984
Konan High School scored a run from Nagashima's home run.

86
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:39,884
Ohgane High School are trying to make up for it now.

87
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:41,784
In the batter box is number eight, Watanabe.

88
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:52,684
Sakuraba throws against Watanabe.

89
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:53,984
A hit.

90
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:55,384
Right down to the middle.

91
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:19,784
Out!

92
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:24,884
Konan High School third baseman,

93
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,484
Nagashima is really showing his skills in this game.

94
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:39,784
Strike!

95
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:57,584
Inao's third pitch against Sakuraba.

96
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,384
Here it comes!

97
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,184
Strike! Batter out!

98
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:02,884
A swing and a strike out.

99
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:05,284
Konan High School with no runs in this inning.

100
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:09,884
As the fifth inning comes to a close, the score is 0-1.

101
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,484
Konan High School is still with a one run lead

102
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:14,584
from Nagashima's home run in the fourth.

103
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,284
Out!

104
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:19,084
Top of the sixth inning, hitting for Konan High School

105
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:23,084
is number nine, second baseman, Michishita.

106
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:24,984
Kudo?

107
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,684
How about it? Did you find it?

108
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:30,584
No. I searched all through the fourth aisle,

109
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:31,784
but it's nowhere.

110
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:33,584
And how about you?

111
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:35,184
Same here.

112
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:38,284
I guess we'll just have to decipher

113
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,284
the meaning of the figure 47.

114
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:43,684
Hey, Hattori.

115
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,484
What is it, Kudo?

116
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,984
At Koshien,

117
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:50,184
there's nothing that is gold, is there?

118
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:54,484
Well, at Koshien the gold would be...

119
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:55,884
"Ginsan".

120
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:58,384
Huh? You mean there is something called that?

121
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:00,384
You can see it, can't you?

122
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:03,484
The big roof hooked onto the ceiling behind the back net,

123
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,384
that's it.

124
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,284
Then, there's no doubt about it.

125
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:09,384
The second cell phone is there!

126
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:11,284
Huh? Why?

127
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,484
You know, don't you?

128
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:15,084
47 is gold.

129
00:09:15,084 --> 00:09:16,384
That's right!

130
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:20,084
47 is the atomic number for gold!

131
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:23,084
Let's go outside and go in behind the back net

132
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,384
and check the seats in the fourth aisle.

133
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:26,084
But I wonder if we'll make it in time?

134
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,584
The seats under the "ginsan" behind the back net

135
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:30,284
has 100 seats an aisle.

136
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:32,184
If we try checking every seat from now,

137
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:34,384
three outs and that's it!

138
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,784
Then maybe it's first base or third base?

139
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,584
Because there's a 3 under 47.

140
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:40,884
Idiot!

141
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,084
You just checked there.

142
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,884
There's got to be something else.

143
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,184
Number three on the back of the uniform

144
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:48,284
that would indicate a seat under "ginsan".

145
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:53,084
I got it.

146
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,784
There is one, Kudo!

147
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:57,684
Another number three, on the back of the uniform!

148
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:02,084
Mr. Ohtaki!

149
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,884
Heiji.

150
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,984
Did you figure out the code?

151
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:07,484
Yes.

152
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:10,084
The first 47 stands for "ginsan",

153
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:13,584
and the next three in the parenthesis is...

154
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:17,584
the one wearing the number three on the back of his uniform,

155
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,484
the Bay Bruce monument!

156
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:24,584
Which means that the location of the 2nd cell phone is...

157
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,584
The location of this monument

158
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,384
is slightly left from the centre.

159
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:30,784
In other words,

160
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:35,484
under "ginsan", slightly left from the center behind the back net

161
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:38,484
and a seat in the fourth aisle!

162
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,184
What is it?

163
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,984
What's up?

164
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,384
The player made first base because the catcher fumbled.

165
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,184
But we've got to hurry.

166
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,684
It's two outs already.

167
00:10:57,684 --> 00:10:58,784
There's only one more out to go!

168
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,684
-Ball! -Ball!

169
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:04,484
Two three!

170
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:05,484
It's the bottom of the sixth inning.

171
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:08,584
It's two out with a runner on first base because of a fumble.

172
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,984
Count two three.

173
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:11,884
If this batter walks,

174
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:16,684
next in line is Konan's big slugger, who scored a homerun.

175
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:21,884
Okay, the pitcher gets a hold of himself

176
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:24,884
and from set position, throws his sixth ball.

177
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,884
The ball's been hit.

178
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:29,884
It's a foul fly.

179
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:33,284
But the ball flies in front of the Konan bench by first base.

180
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:34,584
The catcher stops going after the ball.

181
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:36,884
The pitcher.

182
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:40,084
The pitcher goes after the ball and dashes into the Konan bench!

183
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:46,084
Is the pitcher all right?

184
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:53,084
He caught the ball! He caught it!

185
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:57,284
The fantastic play of the pitcher and it's three out change!

186
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,284
Amazing!

187
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:01,184
Talk about being reckless.

188
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:07,884
I wonder if all boys are that way.

189
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:08,884
Huh?

190
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:12,384
This is indeed the finals of the Koshien.

191
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,684
The passion that the players display towards the ball can't help

192
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:16,784
but has touched the hearts of all who are watching!

193
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,484
Hey, you stupid idiot!

194
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:39,084
Listen, I'm going to find the third cell phone right away

195
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,884
and get a hold of where you are

196
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:43,484
so you can look forward to me getting to you real soon, you fool!

197
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:49,884
Darn it! He hung up without saying anything.

198
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,584
Come to think of it, Heiji.

199
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,484
You know the Takano Transport case?

200
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:57,184
According to what my superior told me,

201
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:01,584
the truck of that company ran over a person a month ago in Tokyo,

202
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:04,484
and it seemed one person died.

203
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,884
Maybe that accident has something to do with this?

204
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:11,784
But what does that have to do with Koshien?

205
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:14,484
I still don't know but...

206
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:15,884
Well, never mind.

207
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:18,684
Let's just nab the guy and ask him directly.

208
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:23,084
We already know how to decipher the code, so...

209
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:27,484
What's this?

210
00:13:27,484 --> 00:13:30,884
Only the number of aisle is written here.

211
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:34,484
No hint.

212
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:52,784
Hiroshi.

213
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,587
Why?

214
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:30,187
Why is only the aisle number of the seats written?

215
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:38,669
Maybe it's because you shouted at him furiously on the phone a while ago?

216
00:14:38,987 --> 00:14:41,587
I'm going to find the 3rd cell phone right away

217
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:43,587
and get a hold of where you are,

218
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:46,087
so you can look forward to me getting to you real soon, you fool!

219
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,189
Darn it! He hung up without saying anything.

220
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:54,889
If the guy's saying that he's going to commit suicide using a bomb,

221
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,989
it's not surprising that he'd get pissed at what you said

222
00:14:56,989 --> 00:15:00,289
and decided not to give you any clue!

223
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:01,289
Idiot!

224
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,789
If he was one to get pissed over something like that,

225
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,889
he would've pushed the switch for the bomb long ago

226
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,489
and the stand somewhere here would be in bad trouble!

227
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:10,289
There's some kind of meaning to it.

228
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,789
The blank in this code.

229
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:15,789
It's indicating some stand of Koshien here.

230
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,389
But what an odd guy.

231
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:30,089
If he really wants to commit suicide,

232
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,789
why would he give out complicated clues

233
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:35,989
and make people look for where he is?

234
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:39,689
Maybe he wants somebody to stop him?

235
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,789
-Huh? -Huh?

236
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,589
I'm sure that person

237
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,889
is hoping deep down in his heart that somebody will stop him.

238
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,189
And maybe he doesn't even realize it himself.

239
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,789
He wants somebody to stop him?

240
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,589
Because the code that he thought up

241
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:59,589
cannot be made unless he is interested in Koshien or baseball.

242
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,989
It's hard to believe that such a person

243
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:06,989
would want to do something like that at Koshien,

244
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:09,889
much less use a bomb to commit suicide, right?

245
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,389
I guess so.

246
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,089
Mr. Ohtaki.

247
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,089
Huh?

248
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,489
Please call the Hyogo Prefectural police once more

249
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,289
and ask them for more detailed information

250
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,889
about the traffic accident a month ago,

251
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:26,289
that Takano Transport the man set fire with a bomb that was involved in.

252
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,789
I also want to know what the motive of a baseball fan

253
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:31,789
who would do something like this at Koshien is, too.

254
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,489
Okay.

255
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:36,989
Then, shall we think about this code

256
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:39,589
and look through the seats in the 13th row?

257
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:42,189
Just look at each and every seat

258
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,089
until the time limit when the bottom of the ninth inning ends.

259
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:46,789
Let's do so.

260
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:50,589
Who know whether there'll be a bottom of the ninth inning or not though.

261
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:51,889
I see!

262
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:55,889
Unless Ohgane who is batting first, catches up or wins the score,

263
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,489
the top of the ninth inning will be the end of the game.

264
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:00,889
The game is at the top of eight,

265
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,189
one out, runner on third.

266
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,689
Ohgane High School has a chance to even the score.

267
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,589
The pitcher gets into set position.

268
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:17,189
The third runner has dashed off!

269
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:18,189
It's a squeeze!

270
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,089
It's a short fly in front of the pitcher!

271
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,689
He caught the ball! He caught it!

272
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,289
It's a direct catch by the third!

273
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,389
The ball goes to third base and it's a double play!

274
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:42,089
Home base is far for Ohgane High School!

275
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,089
It's the top of the eighth inning

276
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,089
and though they've establish opportunities,

277
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:45,089
they haven't scored a point yet!

278
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:50,689
The score is still 0-1. It is the bottom of the eighth inning

279
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,489
and Konan High School will be batting.

280
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,889
Yes.

281
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:58,589
Huh?

282
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,289
Huh? A high school student?

283
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,589
Are you sure that the one who was run over by the truck

284
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,789
was a high school student?

285
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,189
Yes.

286
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:12,589
I was in charge of that accident together with a colleague

287
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:15,289
who was appointed to the Metropolitan police in Tokyo.

288
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,889
I asked for all kinds of details.

289
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,489
Here it is.

290
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:23,189
I'm sure that you would know since you like high school baseball, right?

291
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,289
The name Hiroshi Torimitsu.

292
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:31,389
Yes.

293
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:34,089
In the first game during the spring selection,

294
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:35,389
the left hander of Teito Jitsugyo High school,

295
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:38,789
who threw 18 extended games along with Ohgane's ace,

296
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,989
but lost by a close game.

297
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,089
Don't tell me it was that boy?

298
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,289
Right.

299
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,189
He seems to have dashed out into the road after baseball club practice

300
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,689
and was run over.

301
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,789
Well, it seems that the boy's bicycle was moving unsteadily to begin with.

302
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:07,889
Something about he had been over practicing baseball.

303
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:13,189
Come to think of it, since the accident,

304
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:14,989
the whereabouts of the boy's father have been unknown,

305
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:17,689
so they were having problems not being able to ask questions.

306
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:20,489
Don't tell me that...

307
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,389
Father.

308
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:28,489
Strike!

309
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:35,889
I'm going to give it my best shot.

310
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,589
I'm going to do even better

311
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,689
during the summer Koshien,

312
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,289
become a professional,

313
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:48,189
and make money

314
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:49,789
so that you won't have to work that hard.

315
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,189
You can count on me.

316
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:03,589
Father.

317
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,789
Hiroshi.

318
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,789
Hey, Kudo. Did you find it?

319
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,189
No, it's nowhere.

320
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:26,789
It seems that it's nowhere in the seats of this back net.

321
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:27,889
Darn it!

322
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:31,089
Why is everything else besides 13 blank?

323
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,089
The least he could do

324
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,689
is write the number on back of the uniform in parenthesis!

325
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:35,989
Hey, Hattori.

326
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:38,789
Maybe it's that...

327
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:41,589
There's a player with no number on the back of his uniform near the bench.

328
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:44,989
Right.

329
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:46,489
The ball boy, right?

330
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:47,989
I thought so, too.

331
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:51,389
I've checked the seats on the 13th aisle behind both benches,

332
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:52,989
but found nothing.

333
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:58,189
Then all that's left are the Alps stand or outfield seats.

334
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:10,689
Strike! Batter out!

335
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,589
Called out on strike, two out!

336
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:18,889
Ohgane High School's tie runner

337
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:21,489
cannot budge an inch from second base.

338
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:26,089
Konan High School is only one player away from winning the championship.

339
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:29,989
No good! If the game ends the man's going to blow himself up!

340
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:30,989
Darn it!

341
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,689
We don't have time to go around the Alps stands nor the outfield seats!

342
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,189
What is this?

343
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:37,489
Why is there nothing written?

344
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:39,589
That fact that nothing is written...

345
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,589
A zero? Nothing? White?

346
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:02,189
He hit the ball!

347
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:04,789
An interesting ball that goes up left!

348
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,389
Can he catch it?

349
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,089
Can he pull through?

350
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:09,789
Will the scores be reversed?

351
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,389
Will the game end?

352
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:16,489
Don't catch the ball, you idiot!
