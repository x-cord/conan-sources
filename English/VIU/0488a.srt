1
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:08,222
What? Cancel our last live show?

2
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:09,422
Yeah.

3
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:11,422
I don't think any of you

4
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:14,122
have the thing it takes to fill the hall up anymore.

5
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:15,422
I think it's better for you this way too.

6
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:18,322
Boss! Please wait, Boss!

7
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,822
Our last live is something

8
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:21,522
that I went out of my way to get to.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,222
Well, you see this is all business.

10
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:25,222
I can't go through with something that I know

11
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:27,322
is going to put us in the red.

12
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:30,622
Then, just how do you propose we say goodbye to our fans?

13
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:33,022
Why don't you write about it on your website or something?

14
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:36,522
I can write it for you again like last time. Would you like me to?

15
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:41,122
But you'll still have to work another six months for me.

16
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:43,122
As for variety shows and talk shows,

17
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:46,422
you're still worth some value.

18
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,122
You've gotta be kidding.

19
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:49,922
If you're not going to let us do our last live show,

20
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:52,022
I'll quit right this.

21
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:53,522
Just fine with me!

22
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,922
But if you quit while the contract is still valid,

23
00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:01,422
you're paying me for damages incurred.

24
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:03,622
Okay. Bye.

25
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:51,822
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

26
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:53,922
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

27
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,522
The stage today is at a TV station.

28
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:56,922
In a glamorous world of masks,

29
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:58,822
there is danger of real faces being exposed.

30
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:00,322
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:02,022
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,522
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:42,722
"Devil at the TV Station".

34
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,622
-What? -What?

35
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,122
You mean the location that the TV station

36
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,922
was going on was cancelled?

37
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:58,022
No joke?

38
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:59,322
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,522
I was really looking forward to it.

40
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:05,522
Yes. We thought we would be seeing...

41
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:09,022
-I'm so sorry. -a new Jocker monster.

42
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:12,322
I was looking forward to eating box lunch on location.

43
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:13,822
The staff member was an acquaintance of mine,

44
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:15,622
so I got to invite you over,

45
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,422
but they don't seem to be able to cope with spectators now.

46
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:20,222
So, I'm really so sorry!

47
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:21,822
No, it's okay.

48
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,722
I'm so sorry.

49
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:28,722
Well, all's well

50
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:32,222
because we did get to specially come into the TV studio after all.

51
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:34,622
So, why don't we go look around here?

52
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,622
Right!

53
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:38,122
That's right!

54
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:40,522
I'll bet there're many famous people here!

55
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:43,622
I'd like to see the weather lady!

56
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:45,322
I'd like to see Toraya!

57
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,422
I want to see Yak!

58
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,022
Hey, a popular idol, Ms. Yoko Okino,

59
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:54,722
is right before your eyes.

60
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:57,822
Good morning, Yoko!

61
00:04:57,822 --> 00:04:59,922
Good morning.

62
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:02,522
It's Ms. Kazuka Inoue! See.

63
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:03,622
Really!

64
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:05,722
The gourmet lady.

65
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,922
"Kazuka Inoue" -Yoko.

66
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:09,422
Take it easy on me today, okay?

67
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:12,022
Same to you!

68
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:14,522
Her parents run a noodle shop, right?

69
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,122
I wonder if they serve eels over rice.

70
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,522
Oh, come on, Genta.

71
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:22,522
Kazuka Inoue, birthday May 13th.

72
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,222
166 centimeters tall.

73
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:28,222
Good morning.

74
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:32,322
-Good morning! -Good morning.

75
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:35,222
"Azusa Yamamoto" -Good morning.

76
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:41,622
It's Ms. Azusa Yamamoto, Genta!

77
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:44,622
Famous people here there and everywhere.

78
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:48,422
Yoko Okino, Kazuka Inoue, Azusa Yamamoto.

79
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:50,122
Hey, you guys...

80
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:08,422
But how lucky to see so many idols so soon!

81
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:09,622
-Yep! -Right!

82
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:15,422
You all look familiar.

83
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:18,522
I think I've seen you somewhere before too.

84
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:23,922
You probably saw us in the papers or something!

85
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:25,722
Because we are...

86
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:28,922
-the Youth Detective Squad! -The Youth Detective Squad!

87
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,122
-Youth Detective Squad? -Youth Detective Squad?

88
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:34,522
Right, we're the Youth Detective Squad!

89
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:37,322
We've arrested a lot of bad guys!

90
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:39,122
Yes!

91
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,322
Really?

92
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:42,422
Wow!

93
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:45,022
Well, it's really no big deal...

94
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:48,322
Conan here in particular is special.

95
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:51,422
He's a famous detective trained by Mr. Mouri.

96
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,322
You mean that famous Mr. Mouri?

97
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,522
Yes! Kogoro Mouri!

98
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:01,422
He's a great fan of mine!

99
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,922
Come to think of it,

100
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,622
he's well known for being a fan of yours.

101
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:08,322
I guess questions involving cases and deductions

102
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,422
are all yours, Yoko.

103
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:12,322
Not really!

104
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:14,422
What questions?

105
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:19,422
We're shooting a quiz program today.

106
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:20,522
All three of us

107
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:22,622
are challenging each other answering the questions.

108
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:27,122
I see. That's why you said to take it easy on you.

109
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:29,522
Yoko, forget that we're friends today.

110
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:30,822
I'm going to be a devil today

111
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:33,422
and I'm going to win no matter what!

112
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:36,722
What? Oh, no. A devil?

113
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,122
A devil.

114
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:39,722
A devil, she says.

115
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,422
What's the matter, Ayumi?

116
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:48,722
-It appeared! -It appeared!

117
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:56,322
So I'll bet you're the new monster

118
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,322
that's appearing in Kamen Yaiba?

119
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,922
I'd say he's more like

120
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:05,422
the new executive of the evil organization rather than a monster.

121
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:09,622
He's the new boss! I'm sure he's the boss!

122
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:13,322
What's with you, Brats?

123
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:19,422
You mean you guys really don't know who I am?

124
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:21,122
-No. -No.

125
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:22,122
Nope.

126
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:27,222
I've really fallen to the pit.

127
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:32,122
Well, I guess you're not all that wrong in saying

128
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:34,922
that I'm a monster that appears in Kamen Yaiba.

129
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:39,822
Good morning!

130
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,122
I wonder who he is?

131
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,022
I've never seen him before.

132
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,122
Neither have I.

133
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:50,122
He's the vocal for a rock group called Styx III.

134
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:52,122
Mr. Satan Onizuka!

135
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:55,622
"Satan Onizuka (32), vocalist for Styx III"

136
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:59,622
I heard that he's going to be appearing on a variety show today.

137
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:04,822
A rock singer appearing on a variety show.

138
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:07,522
I guess the world of devils is going through tough times too.

139
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,822
Onizuka? Satan.

140
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:13,622
Satan? Onizuka Satan?

141
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:16,222
Satan Onizuka?

142
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,622
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

143
00:09:18,622 --> 00:09:20,122
It's nothing.

144
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:22,222
Satan Onizuka...

145
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:25,222
I've heard this name somewhere before, I think.

146
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:32,022
I remember!

147
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,622
My older sister is Satan Onizuka's fan,

148
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:36,222
and she asked me to do her a favor!

149
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,322
She asked me to get his autograph for her

150
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:40,622
if I get to see him at the TV station!

151
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,322
I've got to go after him right away and get his autograph!

152
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:46,922
But he seems to have gone some place already.

153
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,222
Talk about exaggerating.

154
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:53,722
Now, now.

155
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:56,022
If we ask Yoko where his dressing room is,

156
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:57,722
I'm sure we can.

157
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,222
Right, Yoko?

158
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:02,422
Huh? Where's Yoko?

159
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:10,622
Yoko was here just a second ago...

160
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:14,922
Oh, the AD came to get her just a while ago

161
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:16,522
saying that it was time for her to go on air.

162
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:18,922
He took the two challengers along too.

163
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:23,722
Well, I guess we'll just have to find her on our own.

164
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,422
True!

165
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:28,922
I mean we know that he's here in the TV station after all.

166
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,022
Yes!

167
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,722
Let's go look for him together!

168
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:35,622
"Satan Onizuka"

169
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:42,522
Huh?

170
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:45,022
Mr. Satan.

171
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,522
You're already here.

172
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:51,622
I thought you were supposed to come in after noon?

173
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:55,622
Yeah, I came early because I had nothing to do.

174
00:10:55,622 --> 00:11:00,022
So, won't you order me a take out meal, manager?

175
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:02,122
I didn't have lunch yet.

176
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:04,622
Okay, no problem.

177
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,522
So, what would you like?

178
00:11:09,122 --> 00:11:11,722
Tenpuku-tei's ramen and...

179
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:14,522
Tenpuku-tei's ramen.

180
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,922
Fried rice from Janjanken.

181
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,722
Janjanken's fried rice and...

182
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:24,322
That's right, I want to eat Eirinan's dumplings.

183
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:27,522
Erinan's dumplings.

184
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,022
Ramen, fried rice, dumplings...

185
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,222
You mean you want all three dishes from a different shop?

186
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:34,122
Since they are all Chinese dishes, why not order them from the same shop?

187
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:35,822
Who cares!

188
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,322
I want that certain dish from that certain shop!

189
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,722
Besides, I go to all three shops often to eat,

190
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:44,422
so I'm sure they'll bring my order even it's only one dish each.

191
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,122
By the way,

192
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:50,122
did you find that mirror?

193
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:51,522
Yes!

194
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:54,022
An acquaintance of mine seems to have found something similar,

195
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:56,622
so I was thinking of going to that shop now.

196
00:11:56,622 --> 00:11:58,222
Is that right?

197
00:11:58,222 --> 00:11:59,922
Thanks.

198
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:01,422
It just has to be that mirror,

199
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:04,122
or I just can't seem to get myself into make-up mode.

200
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:07,722
Okay, I'll be on my way then, to go get it.

201
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:09,722
And...

202
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:11,822
after I eat lunch, I'll catch some sleep,

203
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,822
so, don't wake me up, okay?

204
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,222
Yes, sir.

205
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:18,322
I had it out with boss last night,

206
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:22,322
and couldn't sleep because I was bothered about it.

207
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:25,222
Boss is here too, isn't he?

208
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,222
Yes.

209
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:29,522
I'm sure he's in the reception room on the second floor.

210
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,422
I'll be on my way then.

211
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:35,222
After I finish shooting, I want to go apologize.

212
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,622
Good idea.

213
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:49,022
TV stations are so complicated

214
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:51,722
that it's hard to tell what's where.

215
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:54,122
I'll bet it's even hard to find the restroom.

216
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:55,822
It's like a labyrinth.

217
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:58,822
I think it's better to ask someone, after all.

218
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:01,222
I guess so.

219
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:16,122
Yes!

220
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,722
"Meeting Room"

221
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:25,222
You're early!

222
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,222
I thought the meeting was scheduled to start from 2:00?

223
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:30,122
Oh, it's you.

224
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:32,322
I'm sorry about last night.

225
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:43,822
Are you going to have a meeting at the TV station, Boss?

226
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,522
I want to have them use one of the actors of my company

227
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:49,222
as a regular on the new program, so I'm putting in a request.

228
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:54,122
Don't you have to take a program from 2:00 yourself too?

229
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:57,022
-Are you ready for it? -Yes.

230
00:13:57,022 --> 00:14:00,422
All I need is 30 minutes. That'll be more than enough.

231
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:04,322
Right, about that matter...

232
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:07,622
I already refused.

233
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:09,322
I know you're not feeling good about it,

234
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:12,022
but I did so for your sake too.

235
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:14,722
Forget it, let's not talk about that.

236
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:18,722
By the way, what do you think of this raincoat?

237
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:22,622
It's light and water-proof.

238
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:24,822
And above all, it's cheap!

239
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,022
I guess it's good.

240
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:31,622
And, what I like most of all about it

241
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,322
is when you pull the hood over your head like this...

242
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:50,022
It's a superb item that keeps blood

243
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,422
from splattering on your body.

244
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:08,825
"Satan Onizuka"

245
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,125
There it is!

246
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,025
Satan Onizuka.

247
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,925
I'm sure it's here.

248
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:15,625
Lucky you, Mitsuhiko!

249
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,725
Yes!

250
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,725
But I wonder if it'll be okay?

251
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,925
To just go in like that without an appointment.

252
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,725
Maybe he's going to scold us with that frightening face.

253
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,425
We'll be fine!

254
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,525
There are many people walking the corridor,

255
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,425
so if things start looking bad, we can call for help.

256
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,325
What? Why call for help?

257
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,225
Okay, I'm going to knock on the door then!

258
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,825
Hey!

259
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:42,225
No!

260
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:45,425
Satan is sleeping now.

261
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:48,025
He's sleeping?

262
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,425
Yes.

263
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,725
I'm going to sleep.

264
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:57,625
If I don't sleep, I can't build up my evil powers.

265
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,725
I... I'm sorry,

266
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:05,225
but if it's okay with you, may I have your autograph?

267
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,225
My... my older sister is a great fan of yours.

268
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,625
What's her name?

269
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,925
Asami.

270
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:26,725
The kanji character is "Asa" as in morning and "mi" as in beautiful!

271
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:29,325
My follower, Asami.

272
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,825
Here you go!

273
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:38,225
Thank you very much!

274
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:40,025
So now, your older sister

275
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:42,625
is a member of our evil group.

276
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:46,925
It's origami!

277
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:53,025
Hey, hey!

278
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,925
There're so many paper cranes!

279
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:58,325
You're right!

280
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:05,825
Did you fold all this, Satan?

281
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,425
Yeah. Sometimes, I do things that humans do

282
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:12,125
while I'm waiting.

283
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,325
All I got to fold today were those five though.

284
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,625
What's this ruler for?

285
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,125
Using a ruler

286
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,225
helps me fold the cranes neatly and nicely.

287
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:27,125
But a devil folding origami

288
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,125
is sort of image breaking, isn't it?

289
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,825
Yeah, that's why I tell all my followers

290
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,625
to keep it a secret.

291
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:37,325
I tell them that I'll curse them to death

292
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:39,625
if they let the word out!

293
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,225
Okay!

294
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,925
That's right, Satan.

295
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:48,325
I found the mirror you were looking for.

296
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:49,725
Well...

297
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,025
This is the one, right?

298
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:52,425
Here you go.

299
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:53,725
This is it, this!

300
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:55,225
With this, I'll be able to put on make-up

301
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:56,825
while I'm waiting in the dressing room.

302
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,425
-Thank you! -Not at all.

303
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:04,325
Is anything the matter?

304
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:05,625
Oh, no.

305
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,025
It's just that my contacts slipped out of place a bit.

306
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:11,125
Why don't you come in?

307
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,625
Thank you.

308
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,825
Are you okay, Mitsuhiko?

309
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:16,925
You look nervous.

310
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,325
I... I'm fine.

311
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:24,525
That's right, and this.

312
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,525
I also got you eye drops.

313
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,025
You ran out, right?

314
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,825
Yeah, leave them there somewhere.

315
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:31,925
Okay.

316
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,325
"Tenpuku-tei"

317
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,825
"Eirinan"

318
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:41,625
"Janjanken"

319
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,725
The names on the shop of all these plates

320
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:47,725
are of different shops. Why?

321
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,725
Satan is particular when it comes to where he orders what food.

322
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:55,725
Well, I guess you can say that the food of humans

323
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:59,125
rarely suit my taste.

324
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:07,925
Police car?

325
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,625
An ambulance too.

326
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:14,225
I wonder if something happened near here.

327
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:24,325
It seems that something's happened here at the TV station.

328
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,825
-What? -Here at the TV station?

329
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,125
What the...

330
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,125
Yes?

331
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:39,625
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,025
We were just about to leave for the studio.

333
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:44,325
Well, your boss...

334
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:47,825
Something terrible's happened to your boss!

335
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:51,125
Anyway! Please come. Come right away!

336
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,925
Please excuse me and open the way.

337
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,325
Satan? Satan Onizuka?

338
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,725
Excuse me!

339
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:58,125
Satan Onizuka!

340
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:04,925
-Satan? It's been a long time since I saw him last. -Excuse me!

341
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,125
This way, please.

342
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:14,825
Boss!

343
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,425
Boss...

344
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:25,725
Who on earth could've done such a thing?
