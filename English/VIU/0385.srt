1
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:22,607
Today's stage is a musical family's mansion.

2
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:23,907
A famed musical instrument plays the melody of murder.

3
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:26,007
That befalls the violinist.

4
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:27,607
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,307
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:31,208
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,213
What? The area code for Tottori Prefecture?

8
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:59,313
What's up?

9
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:01,113
I mentioned it before, didn't I?

10
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:02,813
During the incident that happened in Okinawa,

11
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:05,913
that I was concerned about the phone call that Mr. Motoyama was making.

12
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:08,413
He called a place is Tottori called "Kurayoshi".

13
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,713
And in the incident before that.

14
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,213
Police Detective Yamamura called a place in Tottori

15
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,913
where his grandmother lives called "Yazu".

16
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,513
What they both have in common

17
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,413
is that their area code is "0858".

18
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:24,113
Which means...

19
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:26,014
I have a feeling it's the same...

20
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:33,113
as the mail address that Bellmot sent to her people.

21
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:34,114
What?

22
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:36,513
Besides, I don't think it's just some ordinary person.

23
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:38,213
If I remember correctly, I heard,

24
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:40,913
the words that she mumbled back then was...

25
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:43,613
"Okay, boss".

26
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:46,313
Then, don't tell me that the number is...

27
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:49,713
Yeah, this number 0858 may be

28
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:52,313
the mail address that connects

29
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:55,413
to the boss that controls all of them.

30
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:56,613
But...

31
00:02:56,614 --> 00:03:00,213
Only the top four numbers seem to be the same.

32
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,813
Besides, although the numbers are the same 0858,

33
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:06,213
I feel there is some very slight difference.

34
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:07,513
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm home.

35
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:09,413
Hi.

36
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:13,114
Hey, Ran, do you know what this melody is?

37
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,314
What's that?

38
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:19,514
Oh, a quiz that's the talk of the town now.

39
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:27,913
"Fa, mi, re, mi" right?

40
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,413
Maybe it's "so-fa-mi-fa?"

41
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:31,713
It's "ti-la-so-la"

42
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,013
although I'm a bit off.

43
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:35,713
My, you're really confident, aren't you?

44
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:38,314
Then try singing it.

45
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:44,313
Do re mi...

46
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:50,213
Fa so la ti do.

47
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:52,113
-Wow, talk about off key. -Two horses away, no three.

48
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:54,313
-But, I'm definite that it's ti-la-so-la. -Aozora Hikarin is in the lead.

49
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:55,913
-No, it's Fa-mi-re-mi. -Aozora Hikarin is in the lead.

50
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:57,813
Come off it! Cut out the noise!

51
00:03:57,814 --> 00:03:59,613
I'll ask those people later for you,

52
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,413
so cut out the noise.

53
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:03,313
Ask who?

54
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:07,313
The people that I'm going to see after this is a family of musicians.

55
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:12,413
And there's a composer with perfect-pitch among them.

56
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:14,914
Perfect pitch.

57
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:22,514
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Prelude!"

58
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:28,213
Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

59
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:32,313
I don't see Mr. Shitara having an appointment with anyone by that name.

60
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:37,113
Well, I was asked to come here by his granddaughter Hasuki Shitara.

61
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:39,513
"Benio Tsumagari (54), Steward for the Shitara family" -I see.

62
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:43,813
Hasuki is at the annex practicing right now.

63
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:45,814
See, you can hear her playing?

64
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:49,413
So the music that's been playing all this time

65
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,413
was a live performance.

66
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:53,114
How fantastic.

67
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,513
I don't know what kind of appointment you have,

68
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,213
but please make sure you do not get in the way of her practice,

69
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:02,914
because she has an important concert performance tonight.

70
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:06,413
Which means tonight is some special occasion?

71
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:10,114
It is Mr. Shitara's 72nd birthday.

72
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,813
"Hasuki Shitara (23), Choichiro's granddaughter."

73
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,813
Hasuki.

74
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:31,114
This is Mr. Mouri here to see you.

75
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:36,613
Yes, I'm glad. You really did come.

76
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:42,114
Well, of course, if for a beautiful lady like you.

77
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:47,714
Are you the one with the perfect-pitch, Miss?

78
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,513
That's not me.

79
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,713
Hey, hey, are you sure it's okay, Hasuki,

80
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:55,213
to slack off practice?

81
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:57,813
"Genzaburo Shitara (60)" -You're the one who's performing tonight, right?

82
00:05:57,814 --> 00:05:59,413
"Choichiro's younger brother" -Using the you know what...

83
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:00,913
Yes.

84
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:04,413
If you goof, you're going to get it from big brother.

85
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:07,313
Genzaburo, I would really like you to let us know beforehand

86
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:10,413
if you're coming home.

87
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:11,913
Come on.

88
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,914
I came all this way after leaving in the middle of the orchestra meeting.

89
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:20,113
I'd like to take a snooze for a while.

90
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:23,414
Will you wake me like always when the birthday party starts?

91
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:27,513
I hope you haven't touched anything in my room without my permission?

92
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:32,313
No, because I don't want to be yelled at by you like your late wife.

93
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:33,414
I see.

94
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:40,713
Miss, is that man the person with the perfect-pitch?

95
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:45,213
Nope. Grand-Uncle Genzaburo is a famous conductor,

96
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:48,013
but he says he does not have perfect pitch.

97
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:49,513
The one who has perfect pitch is...

98
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:52,813
Ti-so-ti-so.

99
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:54,613
Ti-so.

100
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,513
"Kyosuke Haga (32), Choichiro's nephew" -Oops, I went flat on "ti".

101
00:06:57,514 --> 00:07:00,913
Sorry, an ambulance just went by.

102
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:03,313
About yesterday's music,

103
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:07,613
could you make the BPM from 120-130.

104
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:09,413
I want it to be a bit more lively.

105
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:10,414
Right, right.

106
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:12,313
Could it be him?

107
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:15,313
Yes, he's the one with the perfect-pitch.

108
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:19,213
He is a genius composer and in charge of soundtracks for several dramas.

109
00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:22,114
He's Kyosuke Haga, my uncle.

110
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,413
Are you talking about me?

111
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:33,413
Yes?

112
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:36,913
Can you tell me what the notes are?

113
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,913
Uncle.

114
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:41,313
How did you like what I played?

115
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:45,613
It was good, although you were 1/4th pitch flat on a note.

116
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:48,013
I prefer it that way, though.

117
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:49,814
Thank you!

118
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,013
Yes, hello.

119
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:56,413
You mean that piece.

120
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:59,313
I'd like to break the notes up a bit more.

121
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:01,513
Can you handle it?

122
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,313
What I'm trying to say is...

123
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:05,613
Furuto!

124
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:08,013
Where are you?

125
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:09,214
Furuto!

126
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:11,913
Grandmother?

127
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:14,413
I hear the sound of the violin playing.

128
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:16,013
"Ayane Shitara (68)" -Furuto, don't hide.

129
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:17,613
"Choichiro's wife" -and come out here.

130
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:19,613
Grandmother, not again.

131
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:22,313
Father passed away last year today,

132
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:23,813
have you forgotten?

133
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:25,313
Last year today?

134
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:28,213
No, Furuto is still...

135
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,713
Hey, Ayane, how unsightly!

136
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:31,913
Grandfather.

137
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:35,213
"Choichiro Shitara (72)" -Going after the shadow of the dead for so long.

138
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,013
"The head of the Shitara family" -Our son Furuto has returned to dust.

139
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:40,213
Don't you understand after all this time!

140
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:44,113
Grandfather, you were told by the doctor not to walk around.

141
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:45,813
-Mr. Mouri. -Yes.

142
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:49,713
I'm sorry but I'm going to take care of the two for now,

143
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:51,313
so I'll meet you at the main house later.

144
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,313
I'd like to talk to you there.

145
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:55,314
I've got something I'd like to show you.

146
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:28,213
This violin seems to have been used over a long period of time.

147
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:32,413
Yes, it's been made about 300 year ago.

148
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:35,214
This sure is some antique then.

149
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,613
The one who made it is an Italian

150
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:44,814
by the name of Antonio Stradivari.

151
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:48,513
Stradivari...

152
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:49,813
You mean that famous...

153
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:51,413
Just as I thought.

154
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,813
Stradivarius?

155
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:57,613
Doesn't this cost several billion yen?

156
00:09:57,614 --> 00:10:01,213
The legendary and famed musical instrument.

157
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:03,613
Let go of it, Dad, quickly!

158
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:06,013
My body's frozen in place that I,

159
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,713
I can't let go of it.

160
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:10,714
-What? Oh come on. -Yes. Yes.

161
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:18,113
And...

162
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:21,313
what about this legendary musical instrument?

163
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:22,314
Well...

164
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,913
This violin is what Danjiro Shitara,

165
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:29,713
Uncle Kyosuke Haga's father had given as a gift

166
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:34,313
to Grandfather Choichiro, his older brother.

167
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:36,613
Despite being the son of blood-related brothers,

168
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:38,913
why is his last name Haga?

169
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:41,813
Yes, the thing is unfortunately, on the day of his birthday,

170
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:43,913
Danjiro was attacked by a robber.

171
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:45,413
Robber?

172
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:47,513
Grandfather Choichiro and the others

173
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,013
gave in quietly and was tied up so they were fine,

174
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:52,513
but Danjiro resisted

175
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:54,713
so he passed away a few days later

176
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:57,913
because of the blow he incurred during the robbery.

177
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:59,813
Uncle Kyosuke who was left behind,

178
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:01,913
was adopted by the family on his mother's side

179
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:04,613
and took after the surname Haga.

180
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,213
I see.

181
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:09,513
But, it's a amazing that this wasn't stolen.

182
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:13,813
I mean the robber was probably after the Stradivarius.

183
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:16,113
The robber seems to have taken the wrong violin.

184
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:18,713
Since the Shitara Family has been musicians for generations.

185
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:21,513
There were many violins.

186
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,414
It all happened 30 years ago though.

187
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,613
Don't tell me that you want me to find out

188
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:30,413
who the robber that broke in here 30 years ago was?

189
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:32,613
No, what I'd like to ask you to do is...

190
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:34,613
to solve the shuddering incidents,

191
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:37,014
that have happened within the last two years.

192
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:43,313
The first one is the incident that happened the year before last.

193
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:46,813
Uncle Genzaburo's wife who had been very athletic,

194
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:50,113
tripped on the stairs and passed away.

195
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:52,813
The other one is an incident that happened last year...

196
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:56,913
My father, Furuto leaned against a corroded fence of the veranda.

197
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:58,813
It's unlikely that my father who was a very careful person

198
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:00,513
would fall to his death like that.

199
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:03,013
I just can't make myself think that something like that could happen.

200
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,614
I would like you to solve these hideous cases, Detective Mouri.

201
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,613
Maybe those two incidents were accidents...

202
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:15,113
No! Both of them passed away on Grandfather's birthday!

203
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,513
Moreover, at this time,

204
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:19,113
the two played this Stradivarius.

205
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,913
It is as if they were cursed by the incident

206
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,913
that occurred 30 years ago.

207
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:25,613
And, this year, I'm going to be playing it...

208
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:28,313
I'm sure that something bad will happen to me too.

209
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,314
Then, don't play it.

210
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:32,714
I want to play it!

211
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:37,213
But, if you can take it out freely like this anytime,

212
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,313
you can play it any time you like, can't you?

213
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:41,313
I can't take it out freely.

214
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:45,113
I borrowed it from Grandfather just for today

215
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,713
for this special occasion so I can practice.

216
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:48,814
That's why...

217
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:56,413
See, I'm sure he's watching me.

218
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:58,213
Then, you mean the violin that I played

219
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:00,113
a little a while ago wasn't supposed to be...

220
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,814
Of course it's a secret.

221
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:05,713
And, what would you like me to do?

222
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:08,013
I want you to undo the curse of this Stradivarius

223
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:09,714
before I begin playing it.

224
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,813
A curse is not something

225
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:16,013
that a detective like me can solve, you see.

226
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:20,414
What? I thought that detectives solve anything.

227
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:23,513
It somehow seems to be bright outside.

228
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:26,313
Are you going to have some birthday fireworks or something?

229
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:28,614
No, there are no such plans...

230
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,613
The annex!

231
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,814
It's on fire!

232
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,619
Grand-Uncle Genzaburo is there.

233
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:55,528
Fire! Open the curtains and look!

234
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:00,727
Where's your uncle's room?

235
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:03,528
It's on the 2nd floor right up the stairs.

236
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,627
Hey, uncle, can you hear me?

237
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:08,628
Hey!

238
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:11,427
Darn. The door is locked.

239
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:13,428
We've got no other choice.

240
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,027
-Great Uncle! -Don't go inside!

241
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:26,628
It is impossible to help him.

242
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,627
Ayane. Ayane...

243
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:31,728
Grandfather!

244
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:37,927
Ayane is still upstairs.

245
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,827
What? Grandmother is upstairs.

246
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,527
Where is the room upstairs?

247
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:43,628
The room at the very end of the 3rd floor.

248
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,127
This is impossible, unless we have a fire-proof suit or something.

249
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,128
Oh no.

250
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,227
I can't help myself for being the way I am.

251
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:07,728
Take care of everyone else, will you?

252
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:09,828
Uncle.

253
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,227
Pops, please park your car below that window, quick!

254
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:15,228
Do that, okay?

255
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,528
Hey, you! Wait, it's dangerous.

256
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,627
Are you all right?

257
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,628
Grandfather, please get a hold of yourself.

258
00:15:37,128 --> 00:15:39,627
Hey, Dad, wait, just what do you think you're doing?

259
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:40,828
Beats me!

260
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:48,527
That kid told me to park my car here.

261
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:51,028
How come I'm listening to that kid?

262
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:24,628
What?

263
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:32,027
Hey, get a hold of yourself, Aunty!

264
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:33,028
Mrs. Shitara!

265
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:40,227
I see, he wanted to reduce the distance of the fall with the car

266
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:41,827
and used the roof as cushion.

267
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:44,027
Just what a kid would think of.

268
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:45,427
We were lucky that we got a wagon

269
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:47,927
because they had nothing else.

270
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,827
It's a rental car, you know!

271
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:52,728
Who knows how much we're going to have to pay for repair.

272
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:56,727
The fire engines soon arrived at the scene but...

273
00:16:56,728 --> 00:17:00,627
the annex of the Shitara family kept on burning for a while.

274
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:06,128
As if it were grieving the postlude of the conductor Genzaburo Shitara.

275
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:15,427
No!

276
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:18,727
But, we've got to treat you at the hospital either way.

277
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,427
No, no!

278
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:24,327
I'm sorry, but could you let her have her way, please.

279
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:28,127
A year ago, our son was taken away on the ambulance

280
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:30,927
and never came back.

281
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:33,827
I guess she doesn't want to ride the same vehicle.

282
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:38,528
Could you please treat her at home just for today?

283
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,627
Thank you, sonny.

284
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,527
I'm sorry for what you had to go through too, Kyosuke.

285
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:47,927
Thank you.

286
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:49,028
No problem.

287
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:53,227
Little Kyosuke, are you all right?

288
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:54,527
I'm fine.

289
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:57,627
Will you please cut out that "Little" when calling me?

290
00:17:57,628 --> 00:18:00,028
30 years have gone by all ready.

291
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:05,127
The steward, Ms. Tsumagari

292
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:09,027
was originally working at Uncle Kyosuke's house.

293
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:12,227
But, 30 years ago after that robbery,

294
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:14,227
when Danjiro and his wife passed away,

295
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:15,927
and Uncle Kyosuke who was left behind

296
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,927
took after the Haga family name,

297
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,827
we had Ms. Tsumagari come to work for us,

298
00:18:19,828 --> 00:18:21,627
and she's been with us since.

299
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:25,227
Kyosuke's father was not the only one who passed away?

300
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:26,327
No.

301
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:30,727
His mother Chiha, was not a very healthy person to begin with,

302
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:33,727
but she watched over her husband Danjiro without sleeping...

303
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:37,427
As a result, she fell ill of extreme fatigue and...

304
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:40,527
And, what about your mother, Hasuki?

305
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:42,827
She got a divorce and went back to her parental home,

306
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:46,227
just before Grandfather's birthday 2 years ago.

307
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:51,127
That's why Great Aunty Eimi ended up playing for his birthday,

308
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,427
since it was Grandfather's 70th birthday

309
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:55,727
as well as to encourage Father.

310
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:59,727
She was to play that Stradivarius that had been sealed for 30 years.

311
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:01,627
That famed musical instrument was sealed?

312
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:04,827
Yes. When Grandfather received it from Danjiro,

313
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:07,428
he was very happy but...

314
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:12,327
My father who borrowed it when he was 18 years old,

315
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:13,627
and performed in a contest

316
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:15,627
experienced the strings snapping apart twice on stage,

317
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,527
and was disqualified.

318
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:18,727
Yet, on another occasion,

319
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:22,427
my aunt who was scheduled to perform on a certain TV program,

320
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:26,327
came down with a high fever right before show time.

321
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:29,327
And, Great Uncle Genzaburo, who was on his way to a concert abroad,

322
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:32,227
came down with a serious case of tenosynovitis during practice.

323
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:36,027
I see. I can see why you'd want to seal it.

324
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:39,427
You think the violin's okay?

325
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,028
It was left on the desk in the room as is.

326
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:45,827
If this fire was a case of arson,

327
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:47,727
it could've been taken during all this commotion.

328
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,327
No, it wasn't.

329
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:52,627
I put it back in the storage room right away.

330
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:55,327
Or, do I look like an incompetent steward

331
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:59,027
who would leave such a famed musical instrument unattended in a household

332
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:00,928
where outsiders are walking around?

333
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:02,928
Oh, well... No.

334
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,227
Besides, the fire was not caused by arson,

335
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:06,428
but rather, smoking while sleeping.

336
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,627
It seems that the area around the ashtray

337
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:11,027
that was in that room is where the fire started,

338
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:13,527
and the door was torn off with the key locked.

339
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:15,827
You're the one who broke it down, right?

340
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:18,027
If so, the room was locked

341
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:19,627
and arson would be impossible.

342
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:21,327
Oh, is that right.

343
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:25,027
Well, please be extremely careful when smoking.

344
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:27,927
It's best not to smoke though.

345
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:30,028
Yeah, that's right.

346
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:34,127
But, even if everything were to be a coincidence,

347
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:35,627
it sure is frightening.

348
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:36,827
To think that something would happen

349
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:38,227
on the same day for three consecutive years.

350
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:39,627
Yes.

351
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:45,827
Including Kyosuke's father who died in the robbery 30 years ago,

352
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,927
it comes up to a total of four all together.

353
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:49,127
Taking this into consideration,

354
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:54,727
I think you should stop celebrating Choichiro's birthday from next year.

355
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,427
I tell you, he's already smoking.

356
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:00,127
Well, it'll turn out that way anyway,

357
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,927
because Uncle has bad lungs

358
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,027
and has only a half a year to live.

359
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:06,527
Really?

360
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:10,827
Yes. I wanted to at least celebrate today with him.

361
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:12,627
We can't anymore,

362
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:15,427
because he's already gone to bed.

363
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:18,827
The Mrs. has already been treated and has also gone to bed.

364
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:22,527
So, since this doesn't seem to be a case or anything,

365
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:24,528
we'll start off home too.

366
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,727
Who's cigarette butt is this?

367
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:36,627
It doesn't seem to be yours, Pops.

368
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,727
That brand is the one...

369
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:41,127
that Great Uncle Genzaburo used to smoke.

370
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:42,527
Come to think of it,

371
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,927
he stopped by here before going to the annex.

372
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:47,727
If so, then...

373
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:49,028
this is...

374
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,028
Conan?

375
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:59,628
Kid, where do you think you're going?

376
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:16,928
Just as I thought.

377
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:24,027
This is not an accident, but murder.

378
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:27,127
Moreover, if my deduction is correct,

379
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,128
the next target is...

380
00:23:57,628 --> 00:24:02,027
"Next Episode."

381
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:05,527
This could be a serial murder case.

382
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,727
What?

383
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:09,127
Wait!

384
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:11,427
D-E-F-G...

385
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:15,227
then the next target is Hasuki with the initial H.

386
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:18,328
Oh no! She shouldn't be left alone!

387
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,627
Next Conan,

388
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,528
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Interlude!"

389
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:45,827
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:47,827
"Initial."

391
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:50,227
-Conan, I'm sure the murderer is the mother. -Why do you say that?

392
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:52,628
I'm certain it's mother and child.
