1
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:22,010
Prize contest, lucky draw and lottery.

2
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:23,610
The lucky man who's envied by all.

3
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,610
Something's bound to happen if you're too lucky.

4
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,110
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,910
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:30,911
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,484
"First prize" -Red for the first prize!

8
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,284
"Second prize" -Blue for the second prize!

9
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:05,984
"Third prize" -Yellow for the third prize!

10
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:07,984
Please, at least the third prize.

11
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,684
Give me the yellow!

12
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:10,685
Come on!

13
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:22,784
White.

14
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,484
You won a pack of tissues!

15
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:26,585
Here you go!

16
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:31,984
Come on! Forget about it, Genta!

17
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,484
Things can't always go the way you want.

18
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,284
That's right, Genta.

19
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:37,285
Yeah, but...

20
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:38,884
"Third prize" -I really wanted the prize.

21
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:41,385
At least the third prize. That digital camera.

22
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:46,784
Here goes the winner! The third prize!

23
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,484
Oh, he's.

24
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:52,384
"Makoto Owada (30)" -Dr. Owada, isn't he?

25
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,584
He won a prize again.

26
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:56,384
So you know him?

27
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,984
He is the doctor at Beika Hospital.

28
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:00,984
He's a doctor!

29
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:03,184
No, he is a great doctor.

30
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,984
He's enthusiastic and talented.

31
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,784
He's also kind to everybody too.

32
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,984
Who would say bad about him?

33
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:11,384
Nobody.

34
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:12,484
Right.

35
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:14,584
Why don't you see that doctor, Conan?

36
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:15,784
Yeah, you should!

37
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:18,784
It's okay! I'm healthy.

38
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:20,484
Ayumi?

39
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:23,184
You said he won a prize again.

40
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,484
Yeah.

41
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:27,685
I think it was two week ago...

42
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:32,985
So beautiful!

43
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:36,784
"Super scratch lottery."

44
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:39,285
Dr. Owada won the lottery ticket.

45
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:43,284
Really? The lottery ticket too?

46
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:44,584
He must be lucky.

47
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:46,584
He's too lucky!

48
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:49,384
I think my mom told me that

49
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:53,784
last week he won Union Beer lucky draw too.

50
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:56,584
I heard he's got a year supply of beer.

51
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:58,784
So within a week,

52
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:01,184
Dr. Owada has won money from lottery ticket, Union Beer,

53
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:04,985
and a digital camera.

54
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,584
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm home!

55
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:11,785
Yeah!

56
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,785
I got beer supply for a year!

57
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:20,185
Come on, Union Beer. You can't do this!

58
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:25,484
Pops, what happened to Union Beer?

59
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:28,284
I thought I got this letter because I won,

60
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:31,184
but it was actually a letter of apology

61
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,684
that the drawing had been postponed until next month.

62
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:33,884
Gosh!

63
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:36,084
The drawing had been postponed?

64
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,184
It's true!

65
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:40,885
But then, what did Dr. Owada win?

66
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:48,885
"The Lucky Man's Suspense."

67
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:52,184
Dr. Owada didn't win the prize?

68
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:54,584
Yeah, it cannot be true.

69
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:58,284
Because they haven't done the drawing yet.

70
00:04:58,285 --> 00:04:59,784
You're right.

71
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:02,384
If this is what's really happening,

72
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,284
then the rest of the prizes cannot be real too.

73
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,584
What do you mean the other prizes?

74
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,484
But it's true that he won the lottery.

75
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:10,984
I think it's also true that he won the lucky draw!

76
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:13,084
We saw it, right?

77
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:14,484
Yes, I did.

78
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,884
And you guys all saw it too.

79
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,485
But not the exact moment.

80
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:24,785
What? Cheating?

81
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:28,084
Can you stay here?

82
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:29,685
Let's talk about it somewhere else.

83
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:40,785
Okay, I admit that I cheated a bit.

84
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,585
All right, go ahead!

85
00:05:57,785 --> 00:05:59,985
Here goes the winner! The third prize!

86
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:04,084
So it was.

87
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,584
Cheating!

88
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:06,684
It's not fair!

89
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:07,884
Just as I thought.

90
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:10,484
But the doctor doesn't know this!

91
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,584
This was actually his wife's request.

92
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:16,784
What? The doctor's wife's request, you said?

93
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,684
Right. She asked me to give him

94
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:21,584
the third prize when he came over.

95
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:24,684
She said she wanted to cheer him up

96
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,184
since he had lost confidence as a doctor.

97
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,984
Since Dr. Owada saved my life before,

98
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:33,284
so I wanted to help him too.

99
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,684
So you did it to return the favor.

100
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,884
But cheating is still bad!

101
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:41,684
That prize could've been won by somebody else.

102
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:44,484
Well, actually the doctor's wife brought the camera,

103
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:46,284
when she came over to the tent.

104
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:48,884
What? She prepared it herself?

105
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:52,584
So that means, Mrs. Owada gave you the digital camera she bought

106
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:56,084
and you gave it to Dr. Owada as prize, am I right?

107
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:57,085
Yeah.

108
00:06:57,086 --> 00:07:00,184
Nobody was victim, even if it was a cheating.

109
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:03,585
Then, this isn't a crime, is it?

110
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:07,684
"Owada" -I asked him?

111
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:10,384
No, I never ask him to do that.

112
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:13,284
But the guy said the doctor's wife came.

113
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:16,385
First of all, my husband is doing pretty well at work.

114
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:20,584
He lost confidence as a doctor and depressed?

115
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:23,084
No. It can't be!

116
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,384
Why is it so different?

117
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:26,584
Yeah, it is.

118
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:28,584
It's weird.

119
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:33,584
Oh, right. I heard that you won Union Beer. Is that true?

120
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,484
I heard there's been a rumor like that

121
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:37,684
but that's not true either.

122
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:40,584
Because neither of us can't drink.

123
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,284
There's no reason for him to enter a lucky draw

124
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:44,184
for a one-year supply of beer.

125
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:46,984
-What? -He didn't even enter the lucky draw?

126
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:48,784
Whether it's the lucky draw or the beer...

127
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,885
I think somebody has mixed us up with someone with the same last name.

128
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,785
-What's going on? -What's going on?

129
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,084
She really asked me, trust me!

130
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:01,984
She was the doctor's wife!

131
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:03,184
I'm not lying!

132
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:07,084
She said she was Dr. Owada's wife from Beika Hospital.

133
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:11,184
She was a tall, slim, beautiful woman.

134
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:13,384
What's the point of telling you a lie?

135
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,085
I have to go. I'm busy.

136
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:18,384
She was a tall, slim.

137
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:20,585
Beautiful woman.

138
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:24,284
It can't be her.

139
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:26,884
It seems we're getting somewhere.

140
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:29,984
It seems to be true that Dr. Owada won the lottery.

141
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,484
But the lucky draw was a setup.

142
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:36,484
The beer lucky draw is nothing but a baseless lie.

143
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:38,084
This is the work of a woman

144
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,784
who is tall, slim and beautiful

145
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:44,984
and try to make everybody thinks that Dr. Owada is lucky.

146
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:49,184
But what's the point of doing so anyway?

147
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:52,384
She even bought the prize for the lucky draw herself.

148
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:54,084
That's it!

149
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:56,584
What's waiting for her

150
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,185
after making the doctor a "super lucky man"?

151
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:03,684
Here's your prize, a pack of tissue!

152
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:05,484
There's gotta be something.

153
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,584
Some kind of reason to it.

154
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:09,984
We never win a prize, do we?

155
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:13,384
But you know, Dr. Owada at Beika Hospital.

156
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:14,385
Yes, I heard!

157
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,284
He won the third prize, right?

158
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:18,884
He also won the Union Beer's drawing, right?

159
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:23,484
Sounds like the doctor is sucking up fortune from us.

160
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:26,484
Yeah, so somebody was saying that,

161
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,184
too much luck can actually make other people envious

162
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:31,884
and that could bring about misfortune on the doctor.

163
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:33,285
Making others envious?

164
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:37,684
That's true. Envy is a scary thing.

165
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:39,084
Yeah.

166
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:41,685
People envy others when they are too lucky.

167
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:45,784
Maybe the purpose of that woman's action is...

168
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,384
Dr. Owada is an amazing guy, right?

169
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:51,084
Why are you asking that again?

170
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:55,384
I told you, nobody says bad about him. Right?

171
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:56,584
Yup!

172
00:09:56,585 --> 00:10:01,584
He's not a guy people hold a grudge against.

173
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:04,384
Maybe that's why the woman has been acting that way.

174
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:06,884
What's the matter, Conan?

175
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:09,784
Maybe that woman

176
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:12,684
is trying to make a forest.

177
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,084
-A forest? -A forest?

178
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:16,484
What do you mean by a forest?

179
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:17,884
So then...

180
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,784
There should be many other lucky stories about Dr. Owada.

181
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:23,384
There must be.

182
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:25,284
Other lucky stories?

183
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:29,584
Yeah, and also stories about people envying him.

184
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,684
Perhaps the tall, slim, beautiful woman

185
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:34,984
is where all those stories are coming from.

186
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:39,184
We're gonna go out separately to find out who this woman is.

187
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:40,984
I'll do it by using some other route!

188
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:42,785
What was that? All of a sudden?

189
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:45,984
If my deduction is correct,

190
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:47,985
then something is going to happen pretty soon.

191
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:59,994
He told me to find out who but where should I go?

192
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,493
"Beika Kindergarten" -You mean Dr. Owada at Beika Hospital?

193
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:04,893
Yeah!

194
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:06,193
Owada?

195
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,693
I heard he found tons of gold coins

196
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:10,793
when he was digging a hole in his backyard!

197
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:13,293
Really? Oh, my. He must be lucky.

198
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:15,893
It's not all good stories though.

199
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:18,793
His tremendous luck is actually making many people envy him.

200
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,793
Excuse me.

201
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:23,093
About that story, where did you hear about it?

202
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:26,093
About the people envying Dr. Owada!

203
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:27,893
"Osawa Fruit and Vegetables Store" -A hundred million yen!

204
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:30,193
He found a big bag with a hundred million yen in it!

205
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:31,793
Dr. Owada did?

206
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:34,693
I heard so, and when he returned the money to the owner,

207
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,693
he received 5 million yen from the owner as a reward.

208
00:11:37,694 --> 00:11:39,793
He's a lucky guy, really.

209
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:42,693
From who did you hear that story?

210
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:45,693
It was one of our customers, I think.

211
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:48,394
Wasn't that a woman with a tall and slim body?

212
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,893
But why?

213
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:54,093
-That's because... -I really don't know,

214
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:57,193
but I swear some terrible thing is about to happen for sure!

215
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:59,793
"Beika Hospital" -A person who hates Dr. Owada?

216
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:03,193
It's a woman, tall and slim.

217
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:07,793
I don't think there's anybody that hates Dr. Owada in this world.

218
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,893
Not only by the patients but also his co-workers.

219
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:13,693
Dr. Owada is loved by everybody.

220
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:14,793
Thank you!

221
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:16,093
Bye.

222
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:17,493
Good afternoon.

223
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:18,793
Dr. Owada.

224
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:20,393
How are you feeling today?

225
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:21,693
I'm quite well, thank you.

226
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:24,993
That's good! But take it easy, okay?

227
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,193
Thank you, doctor.

228
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:28,793
Okay, take care.

229
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:30,694
There's nothing in the hospital.

230
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:37,194
It hurts...

231
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:42,593
Hiroaki, I told you not to run inside the hospital.

232
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:44,593
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,893
But I'm glad that you can run now.

234
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:47,994
Yeah!

235
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:56,493
Having a fight with Dr. Owada?

236
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:57,494
Yeah.

237
00:12:57,495 --> 00:13:01,293
Who would do such thing to that great doctor?

238
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:03,793
It was a woman, I was shocked!

239
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:04,894
What?

240
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:08,193
Excuse me, sir!

241
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,393
About what you just said,

242
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:12,293
a woman was having a fight with Dr. Owada?

243
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:13,493
Yeah.

244
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:14,593
When?

245
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,794
It was about a month ago.

246
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,593
Mrs. Shiina...

247
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:29,493
Please calm down, Mrs. Shiina!

248
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:32,093
Please, Mrs. Shiina.

249
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,393
So her name is Mrs. Shiina?

250
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:37,193
She was tall and slim.

251
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:39,293
That must be her!

252
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:41,693
I think she was dressed in black.

253
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:42,894
Dressed in black.

254
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,393
It's me, I found her.

255
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,394
I found the woman!

256
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,993
Mitsuhiko.

257
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:59,894
Conan, she's the one on the right.

258
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:06,893
"Akiko Shiina, (30)" -She's living in an apartment around here.

259
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:09,093
Her name is Akiko Shiina.

260
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:10,993
Shiina.

261
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,193
So you found her?

262
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:15,393
The one on the right.

263
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:18,093
I think I've met her before.

264
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:20,693
Come and find me, mom!

265
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,393
Hey, wait!

266
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,394
Hey, Conan.

267
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:30,693
I'm glad that Mrs. Shiina has got better.

268
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:33,893
Yeah. I thought she would never get over the shock

269
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:35,893
when her husband passed away.

270
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:37,493
Excuse me, aunties.

271
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,993
Did Mrs. Shiina lose her husband?

272
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:43,993
Yes. A month ago, Mr. Shiina was hit by a car.

273
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:47,494
The ambulance came and took him to the hospital right away.

274
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:51,293
Is that the motive?

275
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:54,593
I heard it was already too late

276
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,993
when the ambulance came to the scene of the accident.

277
00:14:56,994 --> 00:15:00,793
What? So, it's not the doctor's fault?

278
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:04,493
What is she trying to do?

279
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:08,193
She looks like a kind mother to me.

280
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:09,493
Who is she?

281
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:10,993
Conan.

282
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,594
What did you ask?

283
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:15,193
Now I remember!

284
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:18,193
I knew I saw her somewhere before.

285
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:19,694
She was there.

286
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:25,993
Dr. Owada won the lottery ticket.

287
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:28,293
How can you laugh?

288
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,293
As if nothing happened at all,

289
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,693
without mourning the patient's death.

290
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:34,294
How could you act like that?

291
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,293
Now I see.

292
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:44,593
Perhaps that was when she decided to make the plan.

293
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:45,793
Let's go home.

294
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:46,794
-What? -What?

295
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:49,893
But you said something is going to happen soon.

296
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:51,893
Nothing is going to happen, I think.

297
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:54,293
I was just imagining things.

298
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,893
Imagining things?

299
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:59,793
Then why was that woman making all those rumors?

300
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,093
-That's right! -That's right!

301
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,493
The aunties told me that she is a habitual liar, believe it or not.

302
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:05,893
A habitual liar?

303
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:07,993
What a troublemaker.

304
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:10,693
Man, you're the troublemaker.

305
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:14,293
Even you make a mistake sometimes, Conan.

306
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:16,193
Yeah.

307
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:17,794
Now, let's go home!

308
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:30,093
I won't let anything happen.

309
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:31,493
I will not!

310
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:34,793
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Where are you going, Conan?

311
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,193
To Dr. Agasa's house!

312
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:37,593
I left my stuff there.

313
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:39,894
-Be careful! -Okay!

314
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:14,293
Does it make you feel better,

315
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:16,793
if you kill Dr. Owada, Mrs. Shiina?

316
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:19,994
I'm Mouri, a private detective.

317
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:25,193
I heard some strange rumors about Dr. Owada,

318
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:28,693
so I did some investigation and ended up with you.

319
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:30,593
Akiko Shiina.

320
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:35,094
I heard your husband was hit by a car a month ago.

321
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:44,693
When the ambulance arrived at Beika Hospital,

322
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:46,393
everybody knew that nothing could be done.

323
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:48,993
It was too late.

324
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:51,193
But it was Dr. Owada who was on duty that night,

325
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:53,293
he encourage your husband.

326
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:56,193
You're gonna be just fine! I'm gonna save you, so don't die!

327
00:17:56,194 --> 00:17:57,793
Come on!

328
00:17:57,794 --> 00:18:01,694
He tried the best he could do to save your husband's life.

329
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:12,394
"In Operation."

330
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:31,693
Of course it wasn't Dr. Owada's fault.

331
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,593
And you knew it too.

332
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:35,294
You knew it, but...

333
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:38,693
How come you couldn't save him!

334
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:40,793
Why? Why?

335
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:41,794
As a matter of fact,

336
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:44,693
the driver who hit your husband is the one to be hated,

337
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:48,593
but he ran away, so there's no clue whatsoever about who he is.

338
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:55,293
Dr. Owada was the only one whom you could vent your anger out on.

339
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:59,493
Then, your irrational anger against the doctor reaches its peak

340
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:02,894
after a half month passed.

341
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,693
How can you laugh?

342
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,793
As if nothing happened at all,

343
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:11,093
without mourning the patient's death.

344
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:12,593
How could you act like that?

345
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:15,693
You felt it was unforgivable

346
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,894
and you even felt that you wanted to kill him.

347
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,293
However, you knew that

348
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,793
nobody hates or holds a grudge against Dr. Owada.

349
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:27,993
If you just murdered him,

350
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:31,693
it was obvious that you were going to be the first suspect.

351
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:39,493
Because people witnessed you having a fight with Dr. Owada.

352
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,293
You wanted to kill Dr. Owada,

353
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:44,393
but you cannot be arrested no matter what.

354
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:46,393
If you get arrested,

355
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:50,693
there will be no future for your little children.

356
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,793
So you came up with a plan.

357
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:55,793
"Lottery ticket."

358
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,493
The rumors about Dr. Owada as a man of good luck.

359
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:00,993
You made them up.

360
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:03,393
Dr. Owada is so lucky, he's almost too lucky.

361
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,993
So there are many people, envying him.

362
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:09,893
That's what you wanted to make people think.

363
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:11,893
They weren't just simple rumors.

364
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:15,693
You changed them to make them sound more realistic.

365
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:19,893
This circumstance made it is safe for you to murder Dr. Owada,

366
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:23,193
since the police would think that

367
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:26,493
one of the envious people murdered him.

368
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:29,793
Moreover, it would be impossible to find out who actually did it.

369
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,093
Yes.

370
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:34,493
You created a fake situation,

371
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:38,193
in which there were a lot of people with motive of killing the doctor.

372
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:42,193
That way, you would just one of those people

373
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:45,293
who might be envious enough to kill the doctor but didn't.

374
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:47,593
It's like hiding a tree in a forest.

375
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,393
If there's no forest, then you can just make one.

376
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:54,193
You made up all those rumors so they would disguise you.

377
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:55,294
Am I right?

378
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:59,593
But Mrs. Shiina,

379
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:01,993
no matter how well you try,

380
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,894
a criminal attempt can never be kept hidden.

381
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:10,694
But, it's not too late.

382
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:15,994
Because nothing happened yet.

383
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:19,793
Nothing happened yet.

384
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:23,993
So, you can always still turn back.

385
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:26,693
Now, please go home,

386
00:21:26,694 --> 00:21:29,593
before your beloved children wake up!

387
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:31,594
Mr. Mouri.

388
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,793
I will...

389
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:39,793
I will never do this again.

390
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:42,393
I know. It's gonna be all right.

391
00:21:42,394 --> 00:21:46,294
You will be able to get over it.

392
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:22,193
Did you watch yesterday's Masked Yaiba?

393
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,693
Yeah, the super Yaiba kick was incredible!

394
00:23:25,694 --> 00:23:26,793
Good morning, everyone!

395
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:28,393
-Good morning! -Good morning!

396
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:31,293
Lord, please give them a peaceful day!

397
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:32,693
-Yes! -Yes!

398
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:34,693
Good morning...

399
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:37,293
Nothing happened.

400
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:38,494
Nothing.

401
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:50,593
I guess I did something without realizing it, didn't I?

402
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:52,194
Well, it's all good!

403
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:57,294
The luckiest guy in this world may be him.

404
00:23:58,594 --> 00:23:59,894
"Next Episode" -Gadlin!

405
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:04,093
A gun?

406
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,294
What's going on?

407
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:11,593
We got to get out of here right now!

408
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:14,093
Come on, Genta! Hurry up!

409
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:16,494
It's game over, isn't it?

410
00:24:19,494 --> 00:24:21,094
"If you have seen this boy, call 110."

411
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:28,686
Next Conan, "Fugitive TV Game".

412
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:46,393
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:47,593
"Nameplate."

414
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:49,293
The Youth Detective Squad take the center stage next time.

415
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:50,993
You must hurry up. It's gonna melt.

416
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:53,194
It is not an ice-cream.
