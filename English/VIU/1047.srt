“Ryouta Beppu (20)”
My girlfriend has been kidnapped by Red Sheep.

4
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:11,880
Please save her, Detective!

5
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,465
Calm down, now!

6
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:17,887
Who or what is this Red Sheep?

7
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:19,680
This is Red Sheep.

8
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:23,474
Just what is it?

9
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:25,560
I don't know their real identity.

10
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:28,187
It's just that my girlfriend

11
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:31,275
once told me her ex-boyfriend was a scary guy,

12
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:35,696
so it might be him.

13
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:38,489
A threat?

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,701
"I have abducted Ami Takigawa."

15
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:44,495
The Ami mentioned in the threat is my girlfriend.

16
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:47,373
She and I both work part-time at a restaurant called La Mucho.

17
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,667
La Mucho?

18
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,380
"If you want Ami to return to you safely,"

19
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:58,885

"Absolutely do not inform the police."

00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:03,766
"By Red Sheep."

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,767
Is that all?

23
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:06,768
Yes.

24
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:08,686
Did they ask for any ransom?

25
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:10,898
No.

26
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:13,567
No?

27
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,569
Red Sheep...

28
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,199
I feel like I've seen them a long time ago.

29
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:26,579
I'm pretty sure there was a Red Sheep

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,666
somewhere deep in my memories.

31
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:31,584
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

32
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:33,586
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

33
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:35,380
The kidnapper is the Red Sheep?

34
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:37,173
An ominous incident behind the scenes of a video!

35
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:38,591
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:40,468
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:42,763

If the kidnapper didn't ask for any ransom,

41
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:49,681
what do they want?

42
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:58,899
Oh, no!

43
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:04,488
Ryota!

44
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:06,073
Ami?

45
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:13,288
Here's Ryota, the guy who has come to save me!

46
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:18,000
Where's Red Sheep?

"Ami Takigawa (20), La Mucho employee"

- "Ami Takigawa (20), La Mucho employee" -Who are you, mister?

49
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,091
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

50
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:26,968
A detective?

51
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,970
I was the one who hired him.

52
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:30,888
I'd be too scared on my own.

53
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:32,473
What?

54
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:35,268
But I wanted you to come by yourself!

55
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:38,271
Weren't you kidnapped?

56
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:40,899
That's right! I thought you were...

57
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,862
This is a game, Mr. Detective.

58
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:46,989
A game?

59
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:48,573
That's right!

60
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:51,367
It's the Red Sheep game, designed to test a boyfriend's

61
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:53,369
courage and love for his girlfriend!

62
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,872
It's trending on social media right now!

63
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:57,790
Is that so?

64
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,501
Don't scare me like that, Ami.

65
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:01,461
Yeah!

66
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:04,882
I'm sorry, Ryota.

67
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,176
Okay.

68
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:10,261
-Are you angry with me? -I'm not angry at all.

69
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:11,471
Will you forgive me?

70
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:13,891
Stop fooling around!

71
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:16,893
What kind of game is this?

72
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:20,479
I've been hard at work with Ryota's feelings in mind!

73
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,398
I don't care if you are lovebirds!

74
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:29,490
What's so fun about toying with other people's feelings?

75
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,169
This is bad! It's almost midnight!

76
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:44,296
Conan.

77
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:52,386
Where are you going this late at night?

78
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:55,097
I was just curious about Red Sheep.

79
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:57,099
What about you, Ran?

80
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,772
Actually, I was also curious about Red Sheep.

81
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:17,496
What is that?

82
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,065
What's going on, Conan?

83
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:01,665
Call the police and an ambulance!

84
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:11,300
Goodness!

85
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,064
Ran! Conan!

86
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:28,482
Dad!

87
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:31,569
Inspector, is it a murder?

88
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,991
Yes. Ran and Conan were the first to witness it.

89
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:38,701
Did you see the culprit?

90
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:41,288
I don't know if they were the culprit,

91
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:43,165
but we saw Red Sheep.

92
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,084
Red Sheep?

93
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:50,171
It's a costume.

94
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:53,799
We saw someone wearing a sheep costume running away from us.

95
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,763
Don't you see the marks left by the horns on the ceiling?

96
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:00,765
Have you identified the victim?

97
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:04,560
Tetsusaburo Wakabayashi, 45 years old.

98
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:07,396
“Tetsusaburou Wakabayashi (45)”
He was the owner and head cook of a restaurant

99
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:08,898
called La Mucho.

100
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,692
La Mucho?

101
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:15,072
She and I both work part-time at a restaurant called La Mucho.

102
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,576
Those two.

103
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:22,371
What's the matter, Mouri?

104
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:27,500
Inspector, please leave this case to me.

105
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,294
Mouri?

106
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:33,465
It looks like the restaurant where Mr. Beppu works part-time is involved.

107
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,967
"La Mucho"

108
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:38,762
"Temporarily Closed"

109
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,099
"Kokichi Mukai (45), La Mucho assistant head cook"

110
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:48,063
"Daiki Kamio (25), La Mucho cook"

111
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:51,900
This is the knife that was used as the murder weapon.

112
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:59,783
This is the head cook's knife, isn't it?

113
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:03,577
This is Wakabayashi's knife?

114
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:05,162
That would mean

115
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:09,793
Wakabayashi was stabbed to death by his own kitchen knife.

116
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:19,594
And you are...

117
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:22,763
“Motojirou Hirasawa (40)”
I'm Hirasawa, one of the managers.

118
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:26,684
Is it true that Wakabayashi was killed?

119
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:27,768
Yes.

120
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,565
Excuse me, but where were you around midnight last night?

121
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,705
I was working at the office.

122
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:38,626
I mainly work as an interior designer, so...

123
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:39,919
Were you by yourself?

124
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,712
-Yes. -In other words,

125
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:45,299
there's no one to confirm your alibi?

126
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,928
Are you suspecting me?

127
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:52,098
No, we're asking everyone involved.

128
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:54,392
It was the same with Kamio and me.

129
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:58,813
Yesterday was a designated off day, so we were both at home.

130
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:01,399
Both of us live on our own,

131
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,110
so it's not much of an alibi, is it?

132
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:05,404
That's right.

133
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:11,118
Were you riding around on your motorbike all night again?

134
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:14,328
I was at home all day yesterday.

135
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:17,915
I haven't ridden my motorbike since I had that accident.

136
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,917
Inspector Megure,

137
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:23,130
wouldn't it be a good idea to ask them about Red Sheep?

138
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,298
Red Sheep?

139
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,011
Conan and I saw someone wearing a red sheep costume

140
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:33,098
run away from the crime scene.

141
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,810
Is something the matter, Kamio?

142
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:38,811
No, sir.

143
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:44,108
Red Sheep has been a popular topic on video websites lately.

144
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,818
Video websites?

145
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:46,903
Yes.

146
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,906
Found it. Here you go.

147
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,410
Red Sheep

148
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:55,828
has been uploading videos of themselves

149
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,496
pranking couples that are on dates

150
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:00,709
for the last two to three weeks.

151
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:03,919
Who is behind this Red Sheep?

152
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,296
It's unknown.

153
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,590
The videos were uploaded anonymously, after all.

154
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:11,093
We saw the same sheep last night!

155
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:12,095
Isn't that right?

156
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:13,930
Yes.

157
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:19,518
It's the same colour and design.

158
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,813
But something is off.

159
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,997
Hey! What are you doing?

160
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:47,922
Just come in already!

161
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,591
Stop trying to resist!

162
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,811
It's you two.

163
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:03,229
Who are they?

164
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,606
They both work front-of-house on a part-time basis.

165
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,610
Ryota Beppu and Ami Takigawa.

166
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,907
Around the time of the incident,

167
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,912
they dragged me into this Red Sheep game.

168
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,330
A game?

169
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:23,999
It's a lousy game where the boyfriend is tested

170
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,127
by sending a fake email threat

171
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:29,004
so that he would come for his girlfriend.

172
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,799
That's right. It's just a game!

173
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,219
Why do you have to make such a big fuss?

174
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,430
You haven't heard of the incident, then?

175
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:39,599
Incident?

176
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,226
Wakabayashi, the head cook,

177
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:44,228
has been stabbed to death with a kitchen knife.

178
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,604
What?

179
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:48,023
Red Sheep is the culprit!

180
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,900
That can't be.

181
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:52,319
Are you suspecting me?

182
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,698
Where were you at midnight last night?

183
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:59,493
I was at Beika Park with this detective over here.

184
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:00,495
Pardon?

185
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:04,290
Are you two using me as your alibi?

186
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:09,712
No! Why would we kill the head cook anyway?

187
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:10,796
Ryota's right!

188
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:13,507
We've never even talked to the chef,

189
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:17,011
and I don't think he even knows what we look like!

190
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,512
Stop making up excuses!

191
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,306
You all work at the same restaurant,

192
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,600
so there's no way you wouldn't know each other!

193
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,020
No, I don't believe they know each other.

194
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:28,897
There are more than ten part-timers working front-of-house,

195
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:32,109
and Wakabayashi wasn't interested in anything other than cooking.

196
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,404
He rarely ever went out of the kitchen, either.

197
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:36,406
See?

198
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:43,329
If that's the case, how are Wakabayashi and Red Sheep related?

199
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,207
Why did he have to be stabbed to death?

200
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:50,294
Aren't you two involved in this after all?

201
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:53,130
I told you, we're not involved in this!

202
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:56,592
I was just imitating it because it was trending on social media!

203
00:13:56,593 --> 00:14:00,304
Is it possible that Mr. Wakabayashi also received an email threat

204
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:03,223
saying that his girlfriend had been kidnapped?

205
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:05,017
That's not possible.

206
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,019
Wakabayashi was devoted to his job,

207
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,104
and a girlfriend shouldn't be in the picture.

208
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,607
Don't butt in when others are speaking!

209
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:12,609
Inspector!

210
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:18,030
It looks like an email threat was sent to Wakabayashi's home computer.

211
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,615
An email threat?

212
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,326
Yes. It was received at 10 p.m.

213
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,621
The sender was Red Sheep.

214
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:26,706
Red Sheep?

215
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,925
I have kidnapped Anri.

216
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,594
Bring the 50 million yen ransom to the tunnel

217
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:43,515
under Beika Bridge at 12 a.m. tonight.

218
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,809
50 million?

219
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:52,690
If you want Anri to return to you safely,

220
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:56,026
absolutely do not inform the police.

221
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:57,112
Do you understand?

222
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:05,911
Is this Anri person Wakabayashi's girlfriend?

223
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,621
I do not know.

224
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:10,416
It's my first time hearing that he even had one.

225
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:15,212
He probably knew her from a dating app.

226
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,297
Dating app?

227
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,799
A month ago,

228
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,592
I recommended a dating app to the chef

229
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:23,929
because he didn't have any experience with women.

230
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,723
Did he tell you about Anri?

231
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,308
No, not a thing.

232
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:31,812
He might have wanted to keep it a secret.

233
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:35,817
So we're left with no clues.

234
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:39,528
But we now know the full picture of the incident.

235
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:43,615
Wakabayashi's girlfriend Anri was taken hostage,

236
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:47,327
and he was instructed to bring a 50 million yen ransom

237
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,620
to the tunnel.

238
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:50,706
That's what happened.

239
00:15:50,707 --> 00:15:55,503
Ran, the Red Sheep we saw was carrying a black bag, right?

240
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:58,505
Yes, you're right.

241
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:02,801
Could the 50 million yen ransom be inside it?

242
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:06,221
So that means the culprit stabbed Wakabayashi

243
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:09,016
and left him to die while they ran away with the ransom.

244
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,727
That would be extremely cruel of the culprit.

245
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:14,813
I wonder if Miss Anri is all right.

246
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:19,318
Kamio, what was the head cook to you?

247
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,319
Pardon?

248
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,113
From the way you recommended a dating app to him,

249
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,825
I'd say you were rather close.

250
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,827
I wouldn't say we're close.

251
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:31,121
He scolded me every single day.

252
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:33,207
It was his fault

253
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,710
for sneaking his phone into the kitchen.

254
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:38,712
I only brought my phone into the kitchen to record the recipes

255
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:41,298
because I couldn't memorise them completely!

256
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:43,217
Of course, that would get you scolded!

257
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:47,221
I thought he would become more lenient if he had a girlfriend,

258
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:48,722
so I suggested that he find one.

259
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:50,224
I told him that these days,

260
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:53,394
you could even get married to someone you met using a dating app.

261
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:56,522
The head cook was really into it.

262
00:16:56,523 --> 00:17:00,526
When he showed us his profile,

263
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:02,820
we saw a photo of him with a smile we'd never seen before.

264
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,491
I'm pretty sure his display name was "Chef".

265
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,700
"Chef"?

266
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:13,121
The head cook actually wanted to run a French restaurant.

267
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:15,999
So that was why he wanted to be called "Chef".

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,419
This restaurant flourished because we served ethnic food!

269
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,005
I was also the one that decided that his title should be "Head Cook"!

270
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:25,592
Wakabayashi should have understood that!

271
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:28,804
Please calm down.

272
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:32,891
Could you show me the video from earlier one more time?

273
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:34,727
Sure thing.

274
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:40,608
That's it.

275
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:44,403
What did you see, Conan?

276
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:46,322
Nothing.

277
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:48,490
Say, Ran,

278
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:52,619
didn't you say that you saw Red Sheep somewhere a long time ago?

279
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,623
I did, but now I don't remember where I saw it.

280
00:17:56,624 --> 00:17:58,709
How about you take a closer look?

281
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,420
One more time, please, Mr. Kamio.

282
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:02,297
Here you go.

283
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,799
Thank you.

284
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,801
Let me watch it, too.

285
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:08,803
Okay.

286
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:11,514
What?

287
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,311
What's wrong?

288
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,313
Ran?

289
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,418
That's it!

290
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,420
I remember now.

291
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,632
Red Sheep was from back then.

292
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,800
Are you okay?

293
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:50,719
I remember now.

294
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,222
I know what Red Sheep really is!

295
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:54,224
What?

296
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,405
"Beika Costumes Rental Storehouse"

297
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:11,032
This is the place.

298
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:32,595
Ouch.

299
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,431
Gosh.

300
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:46,901
Red Sheep!

301
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:56,410
This has to be the one.

302
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,830
The horns left marks on the ceiling!

303
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:06,628
I've caught you now, you thief!

304
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:08,630
I'm handing you over to the police!

305
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:10,591
- "Beika Costumes Rental Storehouse" -Is this the place?

306
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:12,718
Probably.

307
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:15,220
I'm not a thief!

308
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,222
-Conan? -What?

309
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,599
Conan! How did you get here?

310
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,103
I'm sorry. But he's with us.

311
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:24,731
Who are you guys?

312
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,398
Pardon my intrusion!

313
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,526
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

314
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:33,322
And while I'm here, I have something to ask.

315
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,495
I see, so you're investigating Red Sheep.

316
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:44,624
And here I thought someone was taking it out of the storehouse again.

317
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,001
Taking it out again?

318
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,003
Yes. There are traces of someone taking it out

319
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:52,090
in the middle of the night for the last two or three weeks.

320
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:53,592
- "Hideto Iwami (50)" -They would always be returned

321
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:55,093
- "Beika Costume Rental owner" -by morning time,

322
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:58,597
so I was unsure whether to bring it up with the police.

323
00:20:58,598 --> 00:21:02,100
Was it only the red sheep costume that was taken out?

324
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:05,896
Yes. It had never been popular at all until recently,

325
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:09,816
but someone borrowed it once three weeks ago.

326
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:11,902
Three weeks ago?

327
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,530
That's when Red Sheep started appearing on social media, right?

328
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:19,326
It was properly returned the next day, though.

329
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:21,912
Do you know who borrowed it?

330
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,706
Yes. There's a record of it.

331
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey, how did you know it was here?

332
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:28,502
What about you?

333
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:30,796
I remembered that

334
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:35,217
I saw a red sheep at a nearby festival when I was in kindergarten.

335
00:21:35,218 --> 00:21:36,510
So that's why we came here.

336
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,220
I thought so.

337
00:21:38,221 --> 00:21:39,430
You thought so?

338
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:43,100
I was in kindergarten when it happened,

339
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,520
so it was before you were born, you know?

340
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:48,021
You're right.

341
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:52,901
But I thought I heard the teachers talking about a festival at school.

342
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:54,821
Here it is.

343
00:21:57,698 --> 00:22:03,121
She had invited me to that festival at the time.

344
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,623
This is the person who borrowed the costume.

345
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,128
"Red Sheep, Motojiro Hirasawa"

346
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,631
Motojiro Hirasawa?

347
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,509
Isn't Motojiro Hirasawa

348
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,720
one of the restaurant's managers?

349
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:48,808
Detective, if we're being called here...

350
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:52,730
Does that mean the culprit behind Wakabayashi's murder is among us?

351
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:56,524
The one who murdered Tetsusaburo Wakabayashi...

352
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:57,901
was you!

353
00:23:57,902 --> 00:24:00,320
I had nothing to do with it!

354
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:01,613
They're gone?

355
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,490
The red sheep costume.

356
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:04,992
And the 50 million yen, too?

357
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:08,704
That's it! Could it be...

358
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,914
Next Conan,

359
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:13,291
"The Red Sheep's Ominous Game"

360
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:14,412
"(Part 2)"
