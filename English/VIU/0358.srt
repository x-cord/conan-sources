1
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,199
The stars of today's episode are these two.

2
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,899
A cute date with many chaperones.

3
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,799
A very serious case also comes along.

4
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,399
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,199
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,930
Spit it out!

8
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,229
Spit it out and relieve yourself.

9
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,229
You didn't go to a class reunion, did you?

10
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,829
You couldn't think of anything else to say.

11
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,029
That's why you said so, right?

12
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,629
No...

13
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,229
I... I really went to a class reunion...

14
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,029
Don't play dumb with us!

15
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,729
Do you think you can get away with something like that?

16
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,930
That's enough. Spit out the truth, Takagi!

17
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,129
Inspector Shiratori, we got back up info.

18
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,529
The thing about him going to a class reunion is a lie.

19
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,029
Moreover, we found this in his desk.

20
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,729
"Ticket."

21
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,129
Not only did you deceive us,

22
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,829
but you also have something like this on you.

23
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,030
That's...

24
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,529
It seems that you've taken action

25
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,429
which is against the moral of the police.

26
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,329
Come on, and spit it out.

27
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,029
Your mother in your home country is crying.

28
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,129
Takagi.

29
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,730
Takagi!

30
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,030
"Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 1)"

31
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,830
"Tropical Marine Land."

32
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,429
And?

33
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,229
You mean you told them about today's date...

34
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,129
No, I haven't said a word!

35
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,729
I really pulled through this time.

36
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,029
I... I didn't say a word.

37
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,629
Really?

38
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,529
I even went out of my way

39
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,729
to leave a platinum ticket in my desk.

40
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,529
So, I'm sure that everyone's been distracted by it by now

41
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,129
and is going to stake us out at Tohto Dome.

42
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,329
Seriously.

43
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,029
I don't know why they get all heated up like that over a mere date.

44
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,329
You must be extremely popular, Officer Takagi.

45
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,730
I'm not the one who's popular...

46
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,530
What... what's this sharp glance that I'm sensing?

47
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,829
This is group D, Fukui and Kawanaka.

48
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,229
We've spotted Ms. Sato and Takagi.

49
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,629
Our target is currently having a friendly chat

50
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,130
at Cafe Aqua in area 3.

51
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,629
This is group E, Horita and Saito.

52
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,229
We've succeeded in taking a picture of them from behind the counter.

53
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,929
This is group B, Oda and Miyazaki.

54
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,130
We have taken seats behind the two.

55
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,529
Roger.

56
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,029
Remember to keep on your guard.

57
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,729
Understand, our goal

58
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,429
is not to watch over their dating with warmth.

59
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,629
Should they behave in a queer manner or make any moves,

60
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,429
be sure to report back to me immediately.

61
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,329
Speaking about queer behavior,

62
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,029
Ms. Sato's been acting strange since this morning.

63
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,929
-Strange, you said? -Yes, sir.

64
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,329
She's not her usual dignified self, but rather...

65
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,930
I don't know how to express it.

66
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,429
-She... she's cute. -She... she's cute.

67
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,129
That's bad.

68
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,329
Officer Takagi may resort to immoral actions.

69
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,429
Officer Oda and Miyazaki,

70
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,129
I want you to carry out strategy 104 in manual C immediately.

71
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,729
And you know, Yumi told me...

72
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,329
-Hey, did you see yesterday's paper? -Yeah.

73
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,029
They specified the hideout

74
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,629
of a drug dealer, and still let them get away.

75
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,129
The police really are no good like always.

76
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,129
Hey!

77
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,829
Stop talking nonsense.

78
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,529
They didn't flee.

79
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,629
It was misinformation to begin with!

80
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,129
Ms. Sato, please calm down.

81
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,229
Where are you going?

82
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,630
To the ladies' room. Does that bug you?

83
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,929
We did it!

84
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,229
We've succeeded. She's back to her usual self.

85
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,230
Roger.

86
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,829
Hey, wait a second.

87
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,230
Takagi is taking something out of his bag.

88
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,930
That's...

89
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,329
a ring.

90
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,629
There's no doubt about it.

91
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,629
I'm sure he's going to give it to Ms. Sato.

92
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,029
What shall we do?

93
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,429
If we're going to confiscate it, now's the time to do so.

94
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,929
Please calm down. That's within assumption.

95
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,730
I've already got something worked out.

96
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,030
What a relief.

97
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,329
What's that?

98
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,329
Well, it's nothing.

99
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,729
What? What is it?

100
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,629
Is it something you don't want me to see?

101
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,729
No, I mean...

102
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,330
I'll show this to you a little later.

103
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,029
It's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato!

104
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,429
You kids... What?

105
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,029
Dr. Agasa!

106
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,329
What brings you here?

107
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:14,029
Well, Inspector Shiratori sent me the tickets to come here.

108
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,630
He said that it's his token of gratitude towards us.

109
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,529
Inspector Shiratori did?

110
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,029
But what a coincidence...

111
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,030
to run into everyone in a place like this.

112
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,129
The mascot of Marine Land, Marilyn brought us here.

113
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,429
So that we could take a picture together.

114
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,129
See...

115
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,529
What? She's gone.

116
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,230
She disappeared.

117
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,929
Hey, Shiratori. This is Takano.

118
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,729
I made the kids join the two of them like you told me to.

119
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,030
Roger. Please continue watching them.

120
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,230
Hi, Inspector Shiratori.

121
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,029
Yes, thanks to you, we've all come to Marine Land.

122
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,430
Oh, the case the other day?

123
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,529
What? You have something you want me to verify?

124
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,229
Yes, I'm passing the area by car,

125
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,129
so I'd like to see you there.

126
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,729
You're coming here now?

127
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,530
No, no. Say no.

128
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,929
No. That's... Well...

129
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,529
I tell you what.

130
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,329
I'll send a fax to your residence now,

131
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,829
so please call me on my cell phone

132
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,129
after confirming it by 3 o'clock this afternoon.

133
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,130
Goodbye.

134
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,130
Hey...

135
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,129
We'll have to go home now, or we won't make it in time.

136
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,029
We'll take care of the children,

137
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,329
so you can leave them with us.

138
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,629
Is that so?

139
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,030
I guess I'll leave them with you then.

140
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,629
But Ms. Sato...

141
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,929
Don't worry.

142
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,029
If the worst comes to the worst,

143
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,229
we can always call Mr. Mouri or Ran.

144
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,429
No, that's not what I meant.

145
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,729
Neither Pops nor Ran could come today.

146
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,729
Pops is participating in a community baseball game

147
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,029
and Ran is cheering for him.

148
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,929
But they could've lost the first time around

149
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,129
and gone home already.

150
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,229
I don't think so.

151
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,129
Because Mr. Mouri was bragging that they're a really strong team

152
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,129
that made it to the semi-finals last year.

153
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,629
Right?

154
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,529
He was polishing his glove till it got glossy

155
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,429
and he was going all out.

156
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,729
Then, just as I thought...

157
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,229
Well, everything's fine.

158
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,829
The more the merrier in a place like this.

159
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,430
Okay, then.

160
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,029
All's well, at least for now.

161
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,829
We'll just have to wait and see what happens from here.

162
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,629
I'm going to take a rest,

163
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,529
so if any changes come up, be sure you let me know.

164
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,029
Yes, sir.

165
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,629
I stayed up all night finishing up work that I had on my hands

166
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,729
that I haven't slept.

167
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,029
And of course, be on guard for the case on the "deal" too.

168
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,429
Yes, sir!

169
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,529
What? 30 men to stake out on a drug deal?

170
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,629
Yes, sir. According to a tip,

171
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,929
the deal is to be held at Tropical Marine Land

172
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,729
by the dealer named Asakichi Yakura.

173
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,029
Oh, that big shot who's on the run

174
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,629
after committing three assault cases.

175
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,329
Is that tip reliable or what?

176
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,629
It's not misinformation, is it?

177
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,729
I'm sure it's real.

178
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,029
Inspector Shiratori is currently in charge at the site.

179
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,829
Don't worry.

180
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,129
God is on our side.

181
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,329
-So he says. -I see.

182
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,429
If he's that confident, then...

183
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,130
I guess everything will go well.

184
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,730
Miwako...

185
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,929
Hi!

186
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,729
Eels over rice!

187
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,030
Yahoo!

188
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,729
Hey, what kind of look is that?

189
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,830
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,129
But we were on a date and yet...

191
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,229
Don't be silly.

192
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,629
The world's not going to end today, is it?

193
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,730
Besides...

194
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,030
we can just consider this a rehearsal.

195
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,830
Of when we have a family of our own.

196
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,130
Ms. Sato...

197
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,230
Well, you know.

198
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,629
This is Sogawa.

199
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,429
They've entered a pretty dangerous mood now!

200
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,929
Inspector Shiratori!

201
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,330
Inspector, please wake up! It's an emergency!

202
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,529
This is not something...

203
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,429
all that great, but...

204
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,030
What is it?

205
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,329
Well...

206
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,429
What?

207
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,229
What is this?

208
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,029
What's in this paper bag?

209
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,429
That's not mine.

210
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,929
Come to think of it,

211
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,830
although this bag looks like mine, it seems to be a bit different.

212
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,530
Hey, this is...

213
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,629
a narcotic!

214
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,130
What?

215
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,150
It's approximately 1 kilogram in weight.

216
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,950
-What? -What is it? What is it?

217
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,150
What's up?

218
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,751
Did you have that bag on you at all times?

219
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:10,750
Come to think of it, I let go of it just once.

220
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:13,950
Please wait a while more before we depart.

221
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:17,150
Please give your belongings to the person in charge

222
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:19,750
because there is a danger that you may drop it.

223
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,250
Here.

224
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:22,550
That's right.

225
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,950
It was when I rode the "50,000 Miles Under The Sea" attraction.

226
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:27,950
I'm sure someone made a mistake back then

227
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:29,950
and took my bag.

228
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,950
Let's go check.

229
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:34,751
Maybe that person had come to get this bag.

230
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,850
This is Shiratori. Is anything wrong?

231
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,450
Well, it seems like something has happened.

232
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,150
Ms. Sato's expression has changed into a police officer's look.

233
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,451
A police officer's look?

234
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:51,850
Inspector Shiratori sure is taking his time.

235
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,751
I haven't heard a beep from my fax.

236
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,350
"Central Information."

237
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:00,050
What? Nobody came?

238
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:04,150
No. No one came to deliver a bag like that.

239
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:05,350
That's strange.

240
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,650
It's already been two hours since then.

241
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:10,250
Could it be that he has already gone home?

242
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:13,950
Right, there's only one bag after all.

243
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,150
Maybe he didn't want it anymore.

244
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:17,250
Don't be silly.

245
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,450
That amount of drug

246
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:21,750
would add up to several dozen million yen.

247
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:24,350
If he finds out that he has the wrong bag,

248
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:26,750
he would go crazy looking around for it.

249
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,950
-Several dozen million? -Several dozen million?

250
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,350
The owner of the bag probably hasn't been told

251
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:33,250
about what's in the bag,

252
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,350
and is probably just a mule.

253
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:37,550
Otherwise, it's hard to imagine he would easily leave his bag behind

254
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,651
and enjoy riding an attraction ride.

255
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:44,550
Besides, he doesn't even seem to know that the bag had been switched.

256
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,650
In other words, the deal has not been carried out.

257
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,050
The deal's probably going to take place

258
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:51,350
somewhere here in Marine Land soon, and the drug will be handed over.

259
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:54,350
Then, we've got to find that person quickly.

260
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,250
But how do we look for him

261
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,451
from among so many people?

262
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:07,950
And if the content inside the bag is heroin,

263
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:12,650
the dealer may be Asakichi Yakura who is on the run right now.

264
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:17,050
Yes. He's a heroin dealer.

265
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:21,050
We've also got information that he's in hiding in this area.

266
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,950
What's this thing called "Heroin"?

267
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:25,550
You know, the American festival in October

268
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,250
when everybody wears ghost and monster costumes!

269
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,750
That's Halloween.

270
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:34,050
Heroin is a narcotic drug made from morphine.

271
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,550
And once you become addicted,

272
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:37,750
you're attacked by unceasing bouts of agony

273
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:40,050
and eventually become mentally deranged.

274
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,150
It's an extremely dangerous drug.

275
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:45,650
Anyway, the problem is how are we going to

276
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:47,450
identify this mule.

277
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,450
The only clue we have is this bag.

278
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,950
Besides the paper bag with the drug, the other content include

279
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:57,651
are a brand new sports towel and a soiled handkerchief.

280
00:15:58,551 --> 00:15:59,750
Isn't there anything on the bag

281
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,850
that indicates the characteristic or some kinds of habit of its owner?

282
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,050
Like a scratch, blood stains and such.

283
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,250
No, nothing in particular.

284
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,250
Then, maybe we should just forget about it.

285
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:11,850
There wasn't anything really important in your bag

286
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,451
that was taken away, was there?

287
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:17,850
On the contrary, there sure was!

288
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,551
The precious ring...

289
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,150
I was planning to give Ms. Sato.

290
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,550
You've got a clue!

291
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,050
Look at the shoulder belt of that bag.

292
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,251
Only the hole on the left side is spread out wide.

293
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,350
He's right.

294
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,150
That means that the owner

295
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,550
always carried the bag on his left shoulder.

296
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:42,050
If the owner carried it on his right shoulder,

297
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,550
the hole of the shoulder belt on the right side

298
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:45,350
should be spread out more.

299
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:48,350
But what can you tell from that?

300
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,750
Well, which side would you carry the bag on, Officer Takagi?

301
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,650
I would carry it on the side that I feel comfortable with.

302
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:54,650
On the right.

303
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:55,950
I see.

304
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:58,950
A right-handed person would normally carry it on the right shoulder,

305
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:02,850
but the owner of that bag always carried it on his left shoulder.

306
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:04,550
Which means

307
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,251
the possibility of him being left-handed is very high.

308
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:11,650
And if a large sports towel is kept in the bag,

309
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:13,350
he could be having a job where he sweats a lot

310
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:16,550
or somebody who does sports.

311
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,750
You're right.

312
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,950
But how do we search

313
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,650
when there are so many people here?

314
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:24,051
If only we could have a picture...

315
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:31,350
There were a lot of pictures pasted by the exit

316
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,450
of the attraction "50,000 Miles Under The Sea".

317
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,350
Yes, the people who got off the ride were gathering

318
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:37,350
and looking at the pictures.

319
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:41,150
Aren't those the service pictures that's part of the attraction?

320
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:43,150
The ones that are taken automatically

321
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,850
at the peak of excitement

322
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:46,951
and sold to anyone who wants them.

323
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:50,650
Come to think of it, something like a camera flash shined

324
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:52,150
when we were riding it.

325
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,350
Yeah.

326
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:57,050
The picture may still be there if we go now.

327
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:59,550
This is the number to my cell phone.

328
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,750
Remember.

329
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,450
If someone comes looking for a bag that looks a lot like this one,

330
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:05,250
call me right away.

331
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,251
Yes, madam.

332
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:10,850
Try and buy time until we get here, okay?

333
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:12,151
I understand.

334
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:27,150
We're the police.

335
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,950
Police officers?

336
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:32,750
What did the people who just came want?

337
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:35,150
Well, that man seem to have his bag

338
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:38,650
mistakenly taken away by someone else.

339
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,050
The bag? Could it be...

340
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:41,450
The one with the ring inside.

341
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:43,750
That's why he looked so desperate.

342
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:47,350
Excuse me. Did those people do something?

343
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:48,850
What do you mean?

344
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:51,650
Well, I heard them mentioning things

345
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,150
like blood stains (same in pronunciation as "wedding" in Japanese)

346
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:54,551
and heroin (similar in sound to "reception" in Japanese).

347
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:59,450
Wedding...

348
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:03,451
reception?

349
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:05,751
Sir...

350
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:11,350
Shiratori! This is an emergency!

351
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:14,350
They're getting married! A wedding reception!

352
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:15,550
That Takagi!

353
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:18,951
He just might get married here today!

354
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,250
Well, calm down

355
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:23,951
and tell me what you have to say from the start.

356
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,350
I see.

357
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:30,350
So the bag with the ring in question

358
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,650
was taken away by someone else by mistake?

359
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,650
Then, all we have to do is get a hold of that bag

360
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,350
before the two get to it

361
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:40,250
to prevent the worst from happening.

362
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,650
Dispatch all the officers at the site

363
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:45,850
and find the person who has this bag and get him.

364
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,650
Of course, I will be there too.

365
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:51,551
"50,000 Miles Under The Sea."

366
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:54,850
There it is!

367
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:57,250
This is it, our picture!

368
00:19:57,251 --> 00:20:01,450
The people who rode with us are

369
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,650
five other people.

370
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:06,850
Four, if we exclude the kid in the second seat from the rear.

371
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:09,250
But with such a small picture,

372
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,250
it's hard to tell whether someone is left-handed or not,

373
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,050
let alone what kind of work or sports he does.

374
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:16,950
Oh, but the man next to Genta

375
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:20,350
was practicing golf swings while waiting.

376
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,850
He seems to be right-handed, though.

377
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:26,850
But since there are only a few golf clubs for left-handers,

378
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,850
many left-handed people may start with their right hand.

379
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:32,250
I guess you're right.

380
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,850
But the man who was behind me

381
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:36,650
is surely right-handed

382
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:39,350
because I saw him doing this.

383
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,151
So, he plays baseball.

384
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:46,050
Come to think of it, the man in the very back plays soccer.

385
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:49,250
Both his legs were suntanned.

386
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:52,450
Most people who play soccer wear long socks,

387
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,150
showing just a bit of the shin guard.

388
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:59,350
Then, the woman beside the man must be a swimmer.

389
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,650
She had a white streak about 1 centimeter wide

390
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,650
on the side of her eye that wasn't suntanned.

391
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:06,851
It's probably because she's always wearing goggles, right?

392
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:14,450
Golf, baseball, soccer and swimming.

393
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,051
All of them use sports towels, don't they?

394
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,050
But I can tell that the man right beside Genta

395
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,550
is a really timid person.

396
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:25,350
See. He was clinging onto Genta.

397
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,950
Come to think of it, after he grabbed my shirt,

398
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,451
there is a blue ink smear on it now.

399
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,950
Big sister, you were taking a survey

400
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:36,950
using a blue ballpoint pen while we were waiting, right?

401
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:38,150
Yes.

402
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:40,351
Could you show us the survey sheets?

403
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,851
"Genta Kojima."

404
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:47,250
Here it is. This was taken right after Genta's,

405
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:48,950
so there's no mistake about it.

406
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:51,850
And this person is left-handed!

407
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:53,850
How do you know?

408
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:55,950
See, look closely.

409
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:57,050
The characters written using the ballpoint pen

410
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,550
smeared to the right.

411
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,950
This is proof that the person is left-handed.

412
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:02,750
When he writes something sideways,

413
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:05,350
he has to write the next character before the ink dries,

414
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:07,850
so it inevitably gets rubbed and stained to the right.

415
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:09,750
After that, I think that the ink that was left on his hand

416
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:13,450
rubbed off on Genta's shirt when he clung onto Genta.

417
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:15,351
I... I see.

418
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,451
You... you're a police?

419
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:22,250
Please announce his name on the survey sheet

420
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,050
and have him come here immediately!

421
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,351
He's a major witness for an investigation!

422
00:23:58,051 --> 00:23:59,550
"Next Episode" -Roger.

423
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,651
Let's make sure that we get to it before they do, no matter what.

424
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:05,450
Did you have something very important inside it, after all?

425
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:06,950
Yes.

426
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:09,850
It's what I was planning to give you, Ms. Sato.

427
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:12,850
A... a ri...

428
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,450
What? A finger?

429
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:19,050
Don't tell me that it's in the bag.

430
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:20,550
That's...

431
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:22,450
Ms. Sato!

432
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:28,051
Next Conan, "Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 2)"

433
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:45,950
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,050
"Sportsman."

435
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,350
What is this episode about?

436
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:50,750
It was supposed to be about our date...

437
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,751
-Officer Takagi. -I'm sorry.
