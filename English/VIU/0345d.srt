1
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,039
Who are you?

2
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,638
It's a secret. A secret.

3
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:01,238
I can't tell you.

4
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,638
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

5
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:09,038
Daddy's glasses.

6
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,838
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:13,238
Daddy. What's the matter?

8
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,638
Is he already asleep?

9
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:19,938
He promised to read me a story before going to bed and yet...

10
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,438
Then, will you stay by your father until he gets up?

11
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,639
Okay!

12
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,438
Then, you set fire to my house

13
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,838
and burned everything down to ashes.

14
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:43,438
All of what my father, as an FBI agent,

15
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,938
gathered behind closed doors,

16
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,339
the investigation data on all of you.

17
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,938
But, I was saved

18
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,538
because after that...

19
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,038
I remembered that there was no more orange juice

20
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,638
that father always drinks upon getting up

21
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:07,138
and since he was lying down from exhaustion from afternoon

22
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,138
taking care of my mother who wasn't feeling well.

23
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,738
I wanted to be of help and went out shopping.

24
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,538
Oh, so you're the little girl I saw back then!

25
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,338
I really went all out looking for you,

26
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,538
because all that was left from the remains

27
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,839
were the bones of your parents.

28
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,438
My father's colleagues protected me.

29
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,038
They applied for the witness protection program for me.

30
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,938
That stupid system of changing the name and address of a witness

31
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,338
whose life is in danger in order to protect that person

32
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,439
under a different identity.

33
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,038
It must've been really restricting, right?

34
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,738
To live away from your hometown, as a different person.

35
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,639
You went through hard times, didn't you?

36
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,238
And?

37
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,238
You took after your father, and came after me?

38
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,038
FBI agent Jodie Starling?

39
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,738
Just as expected of a witch with a thousand faces, Vermouth.

40
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,938
With your ability of disguise, you can sneak in anywhere

41
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:23,738
and check on things to your heart's content.

42
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,938
I'm amazed that you saw through the disguise of Dr. Araide.

43
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,438
It's obvious.

44
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,838
Despite of not having that bad of an illness,

45
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:39,138
you keep frequenting Araide Hospital with no makeup.

46
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,138
You were planning to kill him and become him!

47
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,538
Then you mean that...

48
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:50,538
the time his car passed right before me with his family

49
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,938
and crashed through the guard rail

50
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,039
eventually sinking into the sea...

51
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,138
was all set up by you?

52
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,338
Yes!

53
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,438
I made it look as if he died of an accident

54
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,438
before you got to kill him.

55
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,238
Because if the car was left at the bottom of the sea

56
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,438
and if nobody knew that he was dead,

57
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,438
it would make it easier for you to go around

58
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,538
acting as Dr. Araide.

59
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,539
Of course,

60
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,538
the people in the car were my colleagues equipped with air pumps.

61
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:24,138
The real Dr. Araide is living in peace in a place far away.

62
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,838
Then just as we expected,

63
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,438
you established yourself in Araide Hospital

64
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,438
and began checking on something.

65
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,638
It was obvious what you waiting for

66
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,038
the moment we snuck into your room in that hospital.

67
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,038
A picture was poked all over with darts.

68
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,538
The picture of a girl in her 20's with reddish brown hair.

69
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,439
You were planning to find her and get rid of her!

70
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:53,438
Now I have a question!

71
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,638
The picture of the woman you were trying to get hold of and kill

72
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,038
and this girl that looks just like her.

73
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,638
Of course the witness protection program

74
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,139
will be applied to her but...

75
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,639
Is she really the woman in the picture?

76
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,138
There's still more!

77
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,238
The two pictures that were below her picture,

78
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:19,638
with the words Cool Guy and Angel that are written on the pictures.

79
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,038
That boy is unmistakably sharp,

80
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,438
but he's more a "kid" than a "guy," isn't he?

81
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,038
Yes. That boy called Conan.

82
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,838
Until that boy left the girl's side,

83
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,538
you didn't do anything.

84
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,238
Inside the bus that was jacked too.

85
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,938
Please don't!

86
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,538
It's just the mischief of a child, isn't it?

87
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,938
Will tell me why you went all out to protect that boy

88
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,739
to the point of almost risking your own life?

89
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:00,438
If she didn't come around,

90
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,538
things wouldn't have turned out like this.

91
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,038
So...

92
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,038
Nab that person called Vermouth too!

93
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,138
And?

94
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,438
So that name Vermouth, that sounds like the name of some liquor

95
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,238
is probably a fake name, right?

96
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,139
Do you know the person's identity?

97
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,938
You haven't seen that person yourself, either?

98
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,538
No.

99
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,938
Then, what about the receipts of the things

100
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,738
that you received that she used to blackmail you?

101
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:29,438
Well...

102
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,238
What? No way!

103
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,839
You threw them away?

104
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,238
The address is probably a phony one too.

105
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,538
I guess for now...

106
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:45,238
until we arrive at the harbor, we'll have to keep him tied up somewhere.

107
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,839
So now, the case is closed.

108
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,138
Come on.

109
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,039
Will you tell me?

110
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,538
Okay!

111
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,138
I'll tell you.

112
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,739
That's...

113
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,539
Don't move!

114
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,738
Gosh.

115
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:37,238
What a dangerous thing you have there.

116
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:41,338
Did you get permission from the police in Japan?

117
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,938
We'll request joint investigation

118
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,638
from the police here after we nab you!

119
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,338
Of course, I'm willing to take full responsibility for this.

120
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,738
But before that I have something I want to ask you!

121
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:58,139
And what may that be?

122
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,439
Why don't you...

123
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,839
Why don't you age at all?

124
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,938
You caught my attention because of what you said

125
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,938
in front of my mother's coffin.

126
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:29,339
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

127
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,938
I was really excited and started investigating,

128
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,938
then sure enough, there was a perfect match.

129
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:38,838
Remember back when you killed my father

130
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,738
making it look like he committed suicide.

131
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:43,038
You picked up his glasses trying to replace it

132
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,438
because of the way it lay unnaturally on the floor.

133
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:49,138
The fingerprints that were on the lens of the glasses

134
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,838
and yours matched perfectly!

135
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,838
But, I had my doubts.

136
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,738
You were too young to be a suspect of an incident

137
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:59,638
that had happened 20 years ago.

138
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,438
I didn't think it possible at first,

139
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,438
but when I matched your prints with a certain person's,

140
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:08,238
I got results that made a shiver go up my spine.

141
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:13,338
You're the one and the same as your mother, Sharon Vineyard!

142
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,538
And, I finally found the witness

143
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:19,838
that could explain the mystery

144
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,839
of what was keeping you from being arrested!

145
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:28,539
You guys! Come out and hold this woman!

146
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:31,938
When I get custody of you from the Japanese police,

147
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,738
I'll make you spit it out.

148
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,138
You'll tell me everything.

149
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:38,038
Well, even if you insist on saying nothing,

150
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,639
she will eventually.

151
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,639
Thank you, Calvados.

152
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,338
Don't kill her yet.

153
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,439
I've still got something I want to ask her.

154
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,238
Why?

155
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,738
You all staked out here

156
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:22,338
and figured you lured me out but...

157
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,938
I came here once already two hours ago,

158
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,238
disguised as you.

159
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,938
And this is what I said in your voice.

160
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:36,138
This is it tonight! Come back tomorrow!

161
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,938
Didn't you realize?

162
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,338
There was another reason as to why the papers of the cases

163
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,338
that Detective Mouri was involved in were stolen.

164
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,038
All of the documents were stolen

165
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,738
so that the papers we actually needed would not be specified,

166
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:53,838
however, all of the documents were sent back to the MPD in one batch

167
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,638
because I wanted you people to think that my stay in Japan

168
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,738
had something to do with Detective Mouri

169
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:03,838
so that you would stake out the detective agency.

170
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,838
Which as a result, it would help me figure out who the FBI agents are.

171
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,438
Just as expected, I figured out how many of you there were,

172
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:11,838
the place you were all staying

173
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,238
and the way you were all communicating.

174
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:18,038
I also knew that you were trying to trap me here.

175
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,238
Then, you knew that we snuck into your room too?

176
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,738
Yes. I was just playing dumb.

177
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:27,538
I thought that if you saw that picture,

178
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:32,738
you would find her for me.

179
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:37,338
But you surprised me twice already.

180
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:40,438
The first is that you are the girl

181
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:42,738
that I met 20 years ago.

182
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:43,938
The other is that

183
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:47,338
you knew what went on behind the scenes regarding Dr. Araide.

184
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,138
How did you get information on it

185
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,039
when nothing about it was spoken to anyone?

186
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,838
I didn't hear about it from anyone.

187
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,438
I was asked to do so by someone.

188
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:01,338
To corner you and disclose your identity,

189
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,438
and in turn for doing so, she said that she would trust me.

190
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:07,238
This girl over here.

191
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:10,538
Oh, I see.

192
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,439
She said so.

193
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,738
Anyway, let's hear the whole story

194
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:24,339
when we get to the police station!

195
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:28,838
He solved the case in such a short time!

196
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:31,738
Just as expected of Shinichi Kudo!

197
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,139
Fantastic!

198
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:37,438
It's nothing...

199
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:38,838
The reason I got to solve it right away

200
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,838
is because I used the same trick as the killer.

201
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,238
Just what does that mean?

202
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,438
What?

203
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,239
The same trick that Werewolf over there used!

204
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,538
So, this is it, for our re-encounter after 20 years.

205
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,138
It's time to say goodbye.

206
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,538
Come on and smile

207
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:03,439
because you're going to get to see your father in heaven.

208
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,639
What?

209
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,538
The same trick as Werewolf used?

210
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:26,538
The killer put a mask over the victim, who was already disguised.

211
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,338
Which means he double disguised the victim.

212
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,938
Don't you only have bandages wrapped around you?

213
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:35,539
Just what do you mean by that?

214
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:59,439
Don't tell me that you're...

215
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,238
Yeah.

216
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:06,338
So this...

217
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:07,938
is what I mean!

218
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:09,738
What?

219
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:12,438
You're...

220
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,939
Heiji Hattori?

221
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,839
Cool kid?

222
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,238
Conan Edogawa.

223
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,939
A detective!

224
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:36,414
He wasn't Shinichi.

225
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:39,514
Heiji Hattori?

226
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:41,114
Disguise?

227
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,314
It's a disguise?

228
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,114
But his voice and tone were just like Shinichi.

229
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:48,215
Yes.

230
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:51,708
Of course.

231
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,808
It's my masterpiece that took me six hours to put him on this disguise.

232
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,808
As for his voice, the microphone on his collar

233
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:02,208
picks up the deduction that Heiji whispers into it,

234
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,908
then Shinichi says it through the microphone on his mask.

235
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:09,109
That voice output is the speaker on Heiji's necktie.

236
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,308
How do you like it?

237
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,609
A perfect collaboration by Dr. Agasa and I.

238
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:19,908
Okay! We're okay on this side, Kudo!

239
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,809
Do your thing on your side too, now!

240
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,308
Don't move!

241
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:33,709
Your body's the blind spot for the rifle.

242
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,208
Now...

243
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:47,508
get in the car after Ms. Jodie.

244
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,009
Let's take a drive to the police!

245
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,008
Ms. Jodie.

246
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,009
Quick and get in the car!

247
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,408
Ms. Jodie! Are you all right?

248
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,809
Yes.

249
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:21,009
Don't tell me that?

250
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,008
Shinichi Kudo?

251
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,208
Remember? The kid that you poisoned to death

252
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,608
with the drug made by the organization back then!

253
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:38,808
Sorry, Vodka.

254
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:43,308
I make it a policy to forget the name and face...

255
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,709
of the ones I get rid of.

256
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:48,808
And?

257
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,708
Are you saying that the kid rose from the dead

258
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,208
and appeared as a ghost?

259
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,108
Yeah, I mean no.

260
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:58,508
Something strange is happening.

261
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:04,608
Why are you disguised as Shinichi Kudo in the first place anyway?

262
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,408
Sorry! Pops!

263
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,708
I haven't seen Kudo for some time,

264
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,608
so I got kind of lonely.

265
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,608
I figured that if I came out looking like him

266
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,908
and made a deduction, maybe he just might pop out too.

267
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:23,108
But maybe he's dead, just as rumor has it, don't you think?

268
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,508
Darn it! Kid from Osaka,

269
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,908
this is the second time you're pulling this trick!

270
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:32,008
If Ran were here,

271
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,908
you'd be way gone by now!

272
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:37,508
Scary. Give me a break.

273
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:39,008
I had no choice.

274
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:41,908
After all, Kudo e-mailed me asking me to do this.

275
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:43,908
He told me that those guys are trying to pull him away from Ai

276
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,108
and do something,

277
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:49,108
so he wanted me to disguise myself as him and find out about it.

278
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,508
That's why I'm on board this ship!

279
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:55,008
But, it sure freaked me out

280
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,308
when I got to his house

281
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,208
and found his mother there.

282
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,908
She seems to have been worried about him,

283
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:04,309
and hiding for a while in the house watching him.

284
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,409
Mother?

285
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,508
Hey...

286
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,708
I didn't think she had a special talent to disguise people

287
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:20,608
but she would even freak Arsene Lupin out too!

288
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:22,808
Thanks to her,

289
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,108
I didn't have to complete my deduction all bandaged up.

290
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,708
The only one I'm worried about is

291
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,508
the little girl that is left sleeping

292
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,008
and confined in the basement of Dr. Agasa's house.

293
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:36,008
Kudo says she'll be fine

294
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:38,508
if she doesn't have the pursuit glasses

295
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:41,908
hidden somewhere with her.

296
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:43,808
But, if I were her...

297
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:48,508
knowing that he would be meeting someone dangerous disguised as me,

298
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:51,608
I wouldn't be able to wait for him just like that.

299
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:53,508
I would break the door open

300
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,509
and go after him no matter what.

301
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:03,108
No matter what, Kudo!

302
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,909
I'd go after you.

303
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:19,709
Haibara. You...

304
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:43,508
Haibara?

305
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:44,709
Darn it!

306
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:58,908
Don't come!

307
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:00,308
Stay away!

308
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:01,309
Go back!

309
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,509
You idiot!

310
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:05,508
No, Kudo.

311
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,009
This is my problem!

312
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,509
This had nothing to do with you.

313
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:15,608
That's why...

314
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:16,909
Don't die!

315
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:19,909
I don't want you to die!

316
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:39,108
So you had the spare pursuit glasses

317
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:42,009
hidden after all.

318
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,608
Kudo.

319
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,008
Run for it, Haibara!

320
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:51,409
Hurry!

321
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:56,008
Just what are you doing?

322
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,708
Get out of here, Haibara!

323
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,108
Hurry and get out!

324
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:00,409
Quick!

325
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:23,708
Goodnight, baby.

326
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:24,909
And...

327
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,709
Welcome...

328
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,109
Sherry!

329
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,608
The only reason I can think of

330
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:54,908
for Vermouth to go after Haibara's life

331
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:57,808
and want me to stay away from her

332
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,608
is because of her identity as actress Chris Vineyard

333
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:05,308
as well as Sharon since she is both of them.

334
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,608
She was probably acting out two roles under disguise.

335
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:11,108
If she knows mom,

336
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:14,808
she would've probably seen pictures of me as a kid,

337
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,908
so she would've easily made out who I am

338
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:19,608
and I also understand why she wouldn't want

339
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:21,809
to be messed up with a scandal.

340
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,408
I'll be fine!

341
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,209
Don't worry because I promise to make it back alive!

342
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:32,209
Is that really true,

343
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:35,209
Sharon?

344
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:46,708
Stupid woman.

345
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:50,808
Screwing up this little boy's plan,

346
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:55,009
and coming out here on your own initiative to die.

347
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,708
I didn't come here just to die.

348
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:03,208
I came here to end everything.

349
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,308
Even if you were to be arrested,

350
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,208
as long as I'm alive,

351
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:11,908
you guys will never stop pursuing me.

352
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:15,108
But, I'd like you to give me your word.

353
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:18,809
That you will not lay a hand on anyone else except me.

354
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:23,809
Will you promise to give me your word?

355
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:26,708
Okay.

356
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,508
I'll save all the others

357
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,608
except for this woman FBI agent here.

358
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,408
But first, I'll get rid of you, Sherry.

359
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:35,008
If you want to hold a grudge on anyone,

360
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,108
hate your parents for starting

361
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:40,009
such a stupid research in the first place.

362
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,409
Cool kid.

363
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:54,608
No way!

364
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:55,809
How?

365
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:01,809
Stop! Calvados!

366
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:05,809
Could it be...

367
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:09,409
she saw everything?

368
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,309
Stop! Calvados!

369
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:37,909
Stop!

370
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,309
Can't you hear I'm telling you to stop?

371
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:12,608
So...

372
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:15,409
Get away from that brown-haired girl!

373
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:20,008
If you don't want to die, you'd better hurry!

374
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,308
No! Don't move!

375
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:24,809
Come on. Hurry! Get out of the way!

376
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:28,609
Stop it!

377
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,708
I called the police.

378
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:34,209
So just put up with this a while longer. Please!

379
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,509
Big sis.

380
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:53,108
Silver hair?

381
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:55,808
The story was meant to end this way.

382
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,209
Hate God for what is happening to you.

383
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,608
What are you doing?

384
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,108
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

385
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:16,108
Hurry or my arm will get slippery from the rain.

386
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:18,308
Why'd you save me?

387
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:20,209
Why on earth?

388
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:25,808
Who needs a reason?

389
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,508
Who cares what the motives are

390
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,308
for a person to want to kill another person?

391
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:31,509
Why would a person want to save another then?

392
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:35,609
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

393
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:49,209
Get out of the way!

394
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:56,608
What are you doing?

395
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:59,209
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

396
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:04,309
Move it, Angel!

397
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:13,009
What?

398
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:20,108
This is a blind spot for the rifle.

399
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:22,008
When did you...

400
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:23,609
Throw your gun down.

401
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:26,908
Throw your gun down!

402
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:29,209
If not, I'll aim for your head next.

403
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:38,208
The sound of a pump?

404
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:39,508
A shotgun?

405
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:41,908
Okay! Calvados.

406
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:43,509
We'll attack them from both sides!

407
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,508
This is bad.

408
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:49,709
He's coming from behind.

409
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:08,808
Come on, Calvados.

410
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:11,708
Use that dear shotgun of yours

411
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:15,009
and blow up the little kitty FBI agent, will you?

412
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:20,809
So, his name is Calvados.

413
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:27,009
A rifle, a shotgun and three guns.

414
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:32,209
I thought he was a weapon vendor or something.

415
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,208
Shuichi Akai?

416
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:37,008
Shu!

417
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:39,408
But with two broken legs,

418
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:42,009
I don't think he'll be doing business for quite some time.

419
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:52,508
Well, Calvados is like a strong apple spirit.

420
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:53,908
So, I guess he's just right

421
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:56,308
for the partner of a rotten apple like you.

422
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,908
Rotten apple?

423
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,508
That's the name we call you by.

424
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:04,208
Golden Apple was the stage

425
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:07,208
in which the great actress Sharon stole the limelight.

426
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:10,508
You're just as beautiful now as you were back then but...

427
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:14,408
Inside, you're a wrinkled up rotten apple.

428
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,809
A really rotten apple!

429
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,408
Don't, Shu!

430
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:36,208
Don't worry.

431
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:38,508
I can tell from the way she moves

432
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:41,108
that she's wearing a bullet proof jacket

433
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,508
and layers of bullet proof pads all over her body.

434
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:46,009
I think she'll get two or three broken ribs at most.

435
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,908
Moreover, look.

436
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:51,508
Look at her face that tore apart with the shot that was fired.

437
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:55,809
That's the face of that woman with no make-up after all.

438
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,209
The brats are a nuisance!

439
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,909
Cool kid.

440
00:34:58,209 --> 00:34:59,708
To think she can blow up the gasoline tank

441
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:01,809
by looking over the mirror in that situation.

442
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,208
She's pretty good.

443
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,508
Shu!

444
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:14,608
This is no time to be amazed by her!

445
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:18,408
She took a child hostage and got away, you know?

446
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:21,109
Then why didn't you take the key out of the car?

447
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:25,008
Well, I'm sorry.

448
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:26,808
We did get our share though,

449
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:29,209
because that woman's comrade is...

450
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:33,508
Hey...

451
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:36,708
Don't tell me he still had a gun on him?

452
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:38,609
Could it be that he killed himself?

453
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:42,908
Look at that.

454
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:45,409
The Japanese police are here.

455
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:51,208
This girl must've called them.

456
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:53,208
Inside the trunk,

457
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:54,808
it's hard to make out conversation

458
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:57,108
but bullets can be heard.

459
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:58,208
I'm sure

460
00:35:58,209 --> 00:36:01,208
she saw the pictures in my room and got suspicious,

461
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:03,208
and snuck inside my car

462
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:05,109
in order to investigate me.

463
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:10,108
She heard the bullets and came outside.

464
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:14,908
Then protected the brown haired girl, who had a gun pointed at her.

465
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:18,108
They probably thought they were shot

466
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,408
and both passed out.

467
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:23,108
Geez.

468
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:26,408
I don't know if you can say they got guts or not.

469
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:29,708
Then, I'll leave the rest up to you.

470
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,308
Just go ahead and explain to them that

471
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:33,108
you're an FBI agent on a long leave of absence came to Japan

472
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:36,809
and got mixed up in a child kidnapping case.

473
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:41,208
Since that woman got away,

474
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:46,008
nobody would believe anything we say anyway.

475
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:49,408
The big guy behind all this hasn't come up front yet.

476
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:51,708
And besides I can't have

477
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:56,409
that girl with the brown hair see me yet.

478
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:31,408
"Seems that I gave you too much freedom before."

479
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:34,508
"Return to me immediately, Vermouth."

480
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:37,309
Okay, boss.

481
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:45,509
Now...

482
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,808
This child.

483
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,408
What shall do with this child who thinks

484
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:51,909
he is capable of doing everything?

485
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:13,309
The electrodes of an ECG monitor?

486
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,408
There is a tracing device as well as a recorder.

487
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:18,808
Don't tell me that

488
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:21,008
the sound of the telephone I made just a while ago was.

489
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:23,708
Don't.

490
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,508
If you pull that out,

491
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:28,308
it means that my heart has stopped

492
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:31,308
and the mail address of the boss you sent an e-mail to

493
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,608
will be disclosed to my friend.

494
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:38,208
The telephone company must protect the privacy of their clients.

495
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,608
But the police

496
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,108
can get that information if they fill out a special form

497
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:45,508
and have one of the higher-ups put a seal on it,

498
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:48,808
then have the information disclosed before several witnesses.

499
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:51,708
If the call that was received was not from a cell phone,

500
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:55,608
but a regular home phone, even the address would be disclosed!

501
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:56,708
In other words,

502
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,308
if the sound just now is recorded

503
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:01,708
and analyzed to decipher the alphabets and number,

504
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:06,208
the name of your boss, as well as his whereabouts can be tracked down!

505
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:08,708
That is, even if I were to be killed!

506
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:09,808
Well,

507
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:12,808
I did figure that if you found Sherry,

508
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,208
who you guys are going nuts looking for,

509
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:20,309
you would unmistakably contact your big boss.

510
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:24,408
Since things began to look dangerous for Ms. Jodie,

511
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:27,109
I had to change my plans.

512
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:30,609
So, what are you going to do now?

513
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:35,108
My friends are waiting for contact from me

514
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:38,009
at a distant place from here.

515
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:43,508
If you don't want this to go out,

516
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:45,708
take me to your boss!

517
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:49,009
Let's get things over with once and for all, Vermouth!

518
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:53,309
I want to stop playing hide-and-seek already!

519
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,908
Okay.

520
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:01,608
I lost.

521
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:04,009
I'll give up going after Sherry.

522
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,508
It's mere sleeping gas.

523
00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:16,108
You idiot!

524
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,508
If you do something like this, you'll suck in the gas too.

525
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:21,808
Yes. This is a gamble.

526
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:23,808
If you get up first,

527
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:26,508
you go ahead and call the police and have me arrested,

528
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:30,208
then go raid the boss along with them.

529
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:33,308
You already know what happens

530
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:35,009
if I get up first, don't you?

531
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:38,409
Bad news!

532
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:43,508
I've got to go wake him up right away.

533
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:44,809
Shinichi!

534
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:55,509
Shinichi...

535
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:26,608
You guys were blasted by Shuichi Akai?

536
00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:28,608
Yes.

537
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,408
He just happened to find us by,

538
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:33,508
and Calvados ended up with three broken ribs.

539
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,108
You mean that FBI agent that you failed to get rid of

540
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:39,308
back in New York a year ago,

541
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:43,308
when you disguised yourself as serial killer.

542
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:45,008
I thought he'd be off his guard if he figured

543
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:47,709
I was just an ordinary killer, but...

544
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:52,608
I should've gotten rid of him back then

545
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:55,109
even if I had to risk being killed myself.

546
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:15,108
Our boss said that

547
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:17,708
that person

548
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:21,809
could be our silver bullet.

549
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,809
He is to be feared.

550
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:33,808
A silver bullet that capable to kill us in one shot

551
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:35,808
doesn't exist.

552
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:39,508
At any rate, I'm in a phone booth on route 20,

553
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:41,808
so can you come pick me up?

554
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:45,208
I got into a bit of trouble,

555
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,908
and can't move.

556
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:50,509
Before that, I have something I want to ask you.

557
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,809
Do you know a kid by the name of Shinichi Kudo?

558
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:00,808
No.

559
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,508
I don't.

560
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:04,809
Why did you save me?

561
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:09,008
Who needs a reason?

562
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:11,308
Why would a person want to save another then?

563
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:14,809
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

564
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:20,309
Yes, it's him.

565
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:29,208
He, the one who pierced through our heart,

566
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,009
could prove to be him.

567
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:44,708
The one that we have long awaited,

568
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:46,709
the silver bullet.

569
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:54,408
"Next Episode."

570
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:56,208
At any rate, we'll have to figure out

571
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:59,808
what this mark that Ayumi drew is.

572
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:01,009
Hey!

573
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:06,009
The mark on Genta's butt sure looks familiar.

574
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:17,708
Next Conan,

575
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:21,909
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 1)"

576
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:40,208
Next Conan's Hint:

577
00:45:40,209 --> 00:45:41,908
"Emblem."

578
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,508
How did you like the first two hour and a half special?

579
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:45,208
It's been nine years since the Detective Conan series has been aired.

580
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,809
Keep tuning in on us, okay!
