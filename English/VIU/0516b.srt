1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,560
Impossible murder?

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,159
Well, there is the possibility of your footprints being there

3
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:11,359
are already before the body had been lowered.

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,259
Is that right, early-bird police detective?

5
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,459
When I arrived at the Torada residence,

6
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:23,059
I was told that everybody went searching for Ayaka Tatsuo.

7
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,359
That's why I came.

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,959
Still, the timing seems to be too perfect, maybe.

9
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:32,459
It could be that Ayaka had been asked on her cell phone

10
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:34,059
to come out of the toilet

11
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,859
was put to sleep, staging it to look like suicide

12
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:39,759
and returning to the Torada residence, pretending to know nothing.

13
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,959
I don't think that's possible.

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:47,359
I saw the police detective put her down on the ground

15
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,659
and I didn't see any footprints or traces of his cane.

16
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,859
By the way, I heard she was acting strange

17
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:55,459
right before she locked herself up in the toilet.

18
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,159
What happened?

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,260
Last night, we saw from our room

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,860
the silhouette of an armored warrior on our screen door.

21
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,559
When we said the helmet

22
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:07,159
looked like a Suwa Hossyou from the shape of it,

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,759
Ayaka started to tremble.

24
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,759
It is a curse.

25
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,859
They brought on the curse of Lord Shingen

26
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,159
and were driven to their deaths.

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,359
And the dead centipede is the proof of it!

28
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:27,259
Why Shingen Takeda and the centipede?

29
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:29,759
Don't you know?

30
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,659
Lord Shingen called his messengers in the battlefield

31
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,859
the "Centipedes".

32
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,359
And made them bear centipede banners.

33
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,859
So, that's why!

34
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,159
I thought I was centipede drawings somewhere.

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,359
I saw someone carrying the banner

36
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,659
in the mock battle staged in the festival.

37
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,959
And you were searching for the treasure, not knowing such things?

38
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,159
Then the treasure you're looking for...

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,359
Shingen Takeda's?

40
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,959
Yes, the hidden treasure of Shingen!

41
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,359
Ever since scrolls and maps suggesting its existence

42
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,859
were found in our warehouse,

43
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,059
Shigetsugu became absorbed in it.

44
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:13,359
The two who died before, as well as Ayaka

45
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:19,459
and Akira Tatsuo over there, got involved in it.

46
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,359
It wasn't greed!

47
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:22,759
We thought that if really found,

48
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,359
it will be a great way to revive the community.

49
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:29,159
And, why must Ayaka be cursed?

50
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,259
She just paid visits to the excavation site to bring food and supplies?

51
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:35,459
It's not a curse at all.

52
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,959
This is a genuine case of serial murders!

53
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,659
Like that mustached guy says.

54
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,559
I couldn't find Ayaka's cell phone in her belt bag.

55
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:51,559
She had been lured out of where she locked herself up.

56
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,259
By the serial murderer.

57
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:57,259
Well, if you don't have to end up dead,

58
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,659
make sure you don't walk around alone.

59
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:06,859
Especially those who had been treasure hunters.

60
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:14,959
Really? So, the warrior was standing right here?

61
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,559
Yeah, though it disappeared right away.

62
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:23,259
Why didn't you open the door and use your karate to catch it?

63
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:26,659
But I was petrified because I thought I saw a ghost!

64
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,859
And karate and aikido don't work on ghosts.

65
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,059
Silly! There aren't any ghosts here.

66
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,159
See what it is.

67
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,359
Plastic rope used in packages!

68
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,959
The rope appears to be shredded into fiber.

69
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,759
I saw a few on them in the corridor and on the ground.

70
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,859
I get it!

71
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,459
If you shred it, bundle the fiber and attach it to a helment.

72
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,259
The silhouette seen through the screen door

73
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,859
will look like Shingen Takeda's Suwa Hossyo helmet!

74
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:00,259
Then, it's the armor found in Shigetsugu's room,

75
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,259
the one used in festivals?

76
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:03,459
No.

77
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:04,459
Look at that!

78
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,159
There are strange straw sandal footprints!

79
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,559
They're leading all the way out of the back gate!

80
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,859
That means, someone from outside entered,

81
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,559
took the suit of armor and created the Shingen silhouette.

82
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,259
Either that or someone in the house left the footprints there

83
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,459
to make it look like an outsider entered the house.

84
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:28,359
Come to think of it, Shigetsugu was saying,

85
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:32,759
there's another suit of armor in Akira's house.

86
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,259
There's another set in the other house?

87
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,659
Yeah.

88
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,159
The armor at the Tatsuo house is supposedly great-looking.

89
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,759
Then, we'll go check out the Tatsuos.

90
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,959
You two stay with Pops.

91
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,459
What?

92
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,159
Just to let you know, uncle.

93
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:55,559
Keep an eye from that treasure hunter Shigetsugu!

94
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,959
I know what to do!

95
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,659
-Okay, see ya! -Darn!

96
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,759
We're left behind again.

97
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,859
I think he doesn't want you to get hurt.

98
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:09,859
Yeah, we often see horrid stuff

99
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,759
and get chased by murderers.

100
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,559
You think so?

101
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,959
Yeah! He's trying to be evasive now

102
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,259
and brag about his discovery later on!

103
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,259
Shinichi used to do that. Really.

104
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,559
But in Shinichi's case, it has nothing to do with

105
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,059
liking you a lot or something like that.

106
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:31,959
"Let your rapidity be that of the wind."

107
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,659
You like him, don't you? That tanned boy.

108
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,459
No...

109
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:44,259
You might choose to sit tight, immovable as a mountain.

110
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,859
The other is to take swift action,

111
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:51,759
like the wind, when the affection is still burning in you.

112
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,559
If you leave it untouched,

113
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,359
before you let know how you feel...

114
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,759
that person might disappear from you

115
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,959
and make you regret over what you didn't do.

116
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,459
Like me.

117
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,259
It's strange, isn't it, Kudo?

118
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:20,559
Yeah, the gag that sealed Ayaka's mouth!

119
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:24,259
At first, I thought it was for not letting out a sound.

120
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,059
But if you're going to make it look like

121
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:28,659
a suicide driven by Shingen's curse,

122
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,359
you would take it off, wouldn't you?

123
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:33,359
So, that means there was a reason for not taking it off.

124
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,259
Or was it deliberate?

125
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:40,759
If it were deliberate, why would that be necessary?

126
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,259
I don't see the possibility of a corpse talking.

127
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,659
Might be a signal to someone?

128
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,759
Like, keep quiet, don't talk?

129
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,859
Well, this is quite impressive.

130
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:00,859
It's red, meaning Shingen's red?

131
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:02,759
Yes.

132
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,359
Is this family somehow related to the Takeda family?

133
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:09,259
No. My mother and I are just great Shingen fans.

134
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:11,759
We invested a small fortune into it.

135
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,459
The late Koji-kun, my son, and Torada's Yoshiro

136
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,759
were also Shingen fans.

137
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,759
They often came here to take a look.

138
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,659
My other son Akira wasn't all that interested, though.

139
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:26,659
Both Koji and Akira are your sons, right?

140
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,459
Why do you refer to Koji as "Koji-kun"

141
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:31,159
while you call Akira simply as Akira?

142
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,759
Actually Koji-kun was my son-in-law,

143
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
married to my daughter born after Akira.

144
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,359
He adopted our family name.

145
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:42,259
My daughter died long time ago in a traffic accident.

146
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,759
Long before the marriage,

147
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,359
Koji-kun had been classmates with Akira at school

148
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,659
and frequented our house as a kid.

149
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:51,159
I've been calling him "Koji-kun" since then and couldn't kick the habit.

150
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,159
Talking of classmates,

151
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,059
Yoshiro and Shigetsugu of the Torada family

152
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,059
had been classmates, too.

153
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:03,159
How can brothers born in different years be classmates?

154
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,659
Well, Yoshiro

155
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:09,159
is the son of Naonobu Torada's elder sister,

156
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,159
who died with her husband long ago.

157
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,259
He had been adopted into the family

158
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,259
and was brought up with Shigetsugu like brothers.

159
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,859
So, that means the three who died recently

160
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:23,359
actually aren't related to either the Toradas or the Tatsuos?

161
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:27,459
Right. And, Ayaka was Akira's wife.

162
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:31,259
Hey, what's that banner behind the armor?

163
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,259
Oh, that's a replica.

164
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:37,759
Can you read it, son?

165
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,259
Let your rapidity be that of the wind,

166
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,059
your silence that of the forest.

167
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,259
In raiding and plundering be like fire,

168
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,059
in immovability like a mountain.

169
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:54,759
From Art of War, the ancient teaching in military warfare from Sun Tzu.

170
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,459
I got it!

171
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,559
Left abandoned after being seriously injured

172
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,459
in the tornado, Yoshiro.

173
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,659
Wind!

174
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:09,759
Yoshiro, tied and buried in a mound shaped like a mountain.

175
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,159
Mountain!

176
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:16,859
Ayaka gagged and hung from a tree in the middle of the woods.

177
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:17,959
Forest!

178
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:19,759
Then it can't be...

179
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,859
Yes, the killings

180
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,559
are patterned after Shingen Takeda's military slogan!

181
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,559
The strategy he embraced.

182
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,359
The "Fuurinkazan"!

183
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,222
What? Fuurinkazan?

184
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:47,822
The killings are being executed after that pattern?

185
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,022
Right.

186
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:54,022
Think back carefully! Three murders in a row!

187
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:57,122
First, there was Yoshiro Torada, who was seriously injured

188
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,922
in a tornado and left to die.

189
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:02,122
Tornado means wind,

190
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:05,922
referring to "let your rapidity be that of the wind."

191
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:11,722
Next, the second was Koji found tied up and buried in a mound.

192
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:14,322
He was tied up so he can't move,

193
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:18,022
like a mountain.

194
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:21,822
"In immovability like a mountain." Mountain!

195
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:27,422
And the third murder of Ayaka Tatsuo, found dead in the forest.

196
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:32,322
If the gag was a message to be quiet and not talk...

197
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:33,422
I see.

198
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:37,522
The message was "your silence that of a forest".

199
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:38,522
Right.

200
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:43,722
This serial murderer seems to have a fixation for Shingen Takeda.

201
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:46,522
But, why Shingen?

202
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:51,222
Is it a plot to block them from finding Shingen's hidden treasure?

203
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:52,922
Beats me.

204
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:55,622
So far, what we know

205
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:59,922
is that we still have the character "fire" left from that phrase.

206
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:01,822
It means that the killer is scheming

207
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:05,622
to take the life of one more person!

208
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:08,522
Then does that mean the next target

209
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:12,022
is either Shigetsugu or Akira,

210
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:14,222
who had cooperated in the treasure hunt?

211
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:17,122
Yeah. That's highly likely.

212
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:18,922
But, there still is the off chance

213
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:21,822
that the next victim is someone else.

214
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:25,022
Anyway, we'll be on the lookout for that one.

215
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:27,722
I want Pops to keep an eye on the guys!

216
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:29,822
Especially, Shigetsugu.

217
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,022
Yeah.

218
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:34,422
Ran. What's "Fuurinkazan"?

219
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:38,122
I don't know. I think I've heard about it on TV and movies.

220
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:40,322
What, you don't know?

221
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:42,622
Let your rapidity be that of the wind,

222
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:45,422
your silence that of the forest.

223
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:48,122
In raiding and plundering be like fire,

224
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:50,722
in immovability like a mountain.

225
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,822
It's an approach to warfare

226
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:55,322
conceived by a master named Sun Tzu.

227
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:59,122
When you mobilize an army, you have to be swift as the wind.

228
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:02,422
When you stop the army's movement, as quiet as a forest.

229
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,622
When attacking, you have to be as fierce as fire!

230
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:09,422
If you decide to defend, be as immovable as a mountain.

231
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:13,222
Shingen Takeda embraced this Art of War

232
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:15,822
and displayed it in his war banners.

233
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:19,622
That was what Yui had been telling us.

234
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:23,622
You might choose to sit tight, immovable as a mountain.

235
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:25,922
The other is to take swift action,

236
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:30,422
like the wind, when the affection is still burning in you.

237
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:32,822
Right! It applies in the game of love, too.

238
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:35,222
Fuurinkazan is the way to go!

239
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:52,222
Here you are!

240
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:56,322
I don't think practice will do you any good

241
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,022
when you're down over

242
00:12:58,022 --> 00:12:59,922
the loss of your wife.

243
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:02,022
I must, with the festival approaching.

244
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:05,022
Nothing can interrupt practice.

245
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,722
I pledge to my mentor Kai

246
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:11,222
that I will defend the title of the horseback archer the best I can.

247
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:16,522
And, it was also the wish of my wife Ayaka.

248
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:18,122
And the reason why I missed

249
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:20,422
wasn't because of any emotional problems.

250
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:23,722
Look, can you see traces of the target being moved slightly?

251
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:25,422
Right you are.

252
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:27,422
I wonder who did it.

253
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:31,122
Right behind the trees! I see people!

254
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:33,722
Who are you?

255
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:34,922
Wait up!

256
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:39,022
Probably people from the neighboring village.

257
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,822
They're trying to make me lose confidence.

258
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,522
What ever for?

259
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:47,022
Because the honor of the village is at stake.

260
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:50,122
The festival

261
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:54,322
has been traditionally organized by the two villages

262
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:56,622
and there is only one archer in horseback archery,

263
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:58,722
which is the highlight of the event.

264
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,822
If they are able to crush Akira,

265
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,222
who went through the preliminaries

266
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:04,122
and became village representative,

267
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:07,722
the star of the festival will be the archer of their village

268
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,022
and will be able to brag all year long.

269
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,722
Starting with Kai,

270
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:15,922
the title had been ours for more than 10 years.

271
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,322
About the preliminaries, how are they've done?

272
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,622
It takes place in the shrine grounds,

273
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:21,822
with ten targets positioned in equal distance from each other,

274
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:24,022
calculating the success rate.

275
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,922
Again and again, until the winner is chosen.

276
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:33,422
Yes. Six years ago, you and Kai didn't miss a mark.

277
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:34,922
The sun began to set,

278
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:38,122
so the competition was to continue the next day.

279
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:41,722
Then, Kai went missing.

280
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:45,122
And I found him dead one week later.

281
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:46,622
Yes.

282
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:49,222
If the competition had continued the next day,

283
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,222
I would've lost.

284
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,722
After the tie,

285
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:56,622
Kai told me that he was going on the refresher practice.

286
00:14:56,622 --> 00:15:01,422
As for me, I was exhausted and wasn't able to move anymore.

287
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:04,422
He went to practice, when it was already dark?

288
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:05,822
Yeah.

289
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,922
So long as he knew the location of the targets,

290
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:11,822
he was able to hit them with his eyes closed.

291
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:15,022
But, he missed one in the last competition, didn't he?

292
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:16,322
I'm sure

293
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:19,222
it was the doing of the people from the neighboring village!

294
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:24,422
The target was moved intentionally to embarrass Kai!

295
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:32,022
Not knowing that, Uncle Naonobu was furious at Kai.

296
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:35,422
You disgraced me!

297
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:37,222
Why was it a disgrace?

298
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:41,722
I heard that Uncle taught Kai horseback archery.

299
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:43,922
And, it developed into an argument

300
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:47,222
with Grandmother Shigeyo who happened to step in.

301
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:51,022
How dare you act like that when you've never even once

302
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:53,822
been an archer of the festival?

303
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:58,322
So most everyone had ties to this person Kai.

304
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,722
Right.

305
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:04,622
And, every one of them is a suspect of the serial murders.

306
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:07,722
I investigated thoroughly into the site

307
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:10,022
where Ayaka Tatsuo was found dead.

308
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:12,422
And only found footprints of the members of the search party,

309
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:14,322
hoof prints,

310
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:18,322
and tracks of scooter and car tires.

311
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,522
In other words,

312
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:21,722
the people who were able to commit the crime,

313
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:24,022
except for you outsiders, are seven people,

314
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:28,722
Naonobu, Tatsue, Shigetsuku and Yui of the Torada family

315
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:34,122
and Shigeyo, Tamefumi and Akira of the Tatsuo family.

316
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:36,922
There are eight!

317
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:41,322
Your footprints. There were traces of your cane, too...

318
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:42,422
Isn't that right, police detective?

319
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:43,422
Okay!

320
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:45,522
Include me, if you want to!

321
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:49,222
Mrs. Torada, you came to pick up that black horse, right?

322
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:52,822
Then take it and go back home right away!

323
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:56,922
You, too. Take the brats and go back to the Tatsuos!

324
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:57,922
Yes.

325
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:00,722
When you get back, tell the people that

326
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:02,722
the killer is among you!

327
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:07,122
Tell them to pray to the gods while they wait for me to arrive

328
00:17:07,122 --> 00:17:10,022
and get my hands on the murderer!

329
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:21,022
You no longer call me by my name, Kan.

330
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:25,822
Sorry, but you're no longer Yui that I knew from childhood.

331
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:28,422
Neither are you my subordinate Officer Uehara.

332
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:32,522
You're just the wife of a murder victim

333
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:34,922
and one of the suspects.

334
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:37,822
A subordinate? That means...

335
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:39,622
A former detective?

336
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:43,222
How many times do I have to tell you?

337
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:47,422
I see no reason why anybody would want to kill me!

338
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:50,122
What in the world are you doing?

339
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:51,522
With all these things going on,

340
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:53,822
I decided the treasure hunt must be interrupted.

341
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,122
So, I came to pick up my documents.

342
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,522
But, I can't find it.

343
00:17:57,522 --> 00:18:00,722
The notes I took while searching for the treasure.

344
00:18:00,722 --> 00:18:04,222
Don't you think Akira might have taken them?

345
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:09,022
You and he are the only survivors of the excavation team.

346
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,522
Maybe to keep the treasure for himself.

347
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:14,322
No way! Akira won't do such a thing!

348
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:16,922
He's the hero of our class!

349
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:21,622
But, people change, you know, Shigetsugu.

350
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,222
He is a Tatsuo, after all.

351
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:26,822
You never know what really on his mind!

352
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:31,322
Don't put him on the same level as that good-for-nothing son of yours!

353
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:35,622
Akira is a samurai! An archer of the festival for five straight years!

354
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:37,322
What are you doing here?

355
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:39,422
We're looking for Akira.

356
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:41,722
We thought he might be here.

357
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:44,222
I just got a call from Heiji

358
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:47,122
that Akira had just finished his archery practice

359
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,622
and is on his way home.

360
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:53,622
Anyway, let us all go home and wait.

361
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:56,222
Until the case is settled.

362
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:59,022
You, too, Mr. Shigetsugu!

363
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:00,522
All right.

364
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,022
Then, we will be going this way.

365
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:05,822
Be careful on your way home!

366
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,222
That ogre of a woman!

367
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:10,622
Who's going to attack that monster?

368
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:15,022
The feeling's mutual, you bald racoon dog!

369
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,222
Well...

370
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,422
Don't you two remember what Shingen said?

371
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:23,322
"Friendship is your ally, enmity is your foe."

372
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,522
Shouldn't you stop quarreling

373
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:28,822
and cooperate to solve this case,

374
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,522
for the good of both families?

375
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:38,122
I don't need to hear that from a dullard like you!

376
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:42,322
Those were Officer Kai's pet phrase.

377
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:48,022
He used to settle disputes between the families with those words.

378
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:51,522
You, Shingen-freak dolt!

379
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:59,222
Will you be my wife when you grow up?

380
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:04,422
Just kidding! Kansuke will start complaining!

381
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:08,822
Hey, don't call me "master".

382
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:12,622
I may be older than you. But you are my rival!

383
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,722
Just call me Kai!

384
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:18,422
Hey, Hattori.

385
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:23,022
Why does the killer pattern the murders after "Fuurinkazan"?

386
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,922
It might have something to do with

387
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:30,222
the three of them looking for Shingen's treasure.

388
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:32,822
Or trying to make it look like that,

389
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:35,822
trying to hide the real motive.

390
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:40,622
But, the tornado that swept off Yoshiro was a coincidence.

391
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:45,222
Still, there was the dead centipede ready to be placed near him.

392
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:50,222
So, the killer had been planning to kill the three for a long time.

393
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:54,822
Then, I need to find out what Yoshiro and Koji

394
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:58,722
wanted to talk about with that police detective Yamato.

395
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:05,022
And why Ayaka was horrified by the story of Shingen's helmet.

396
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:07,222
And the other thing that bugs me.

397
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,922
Yeah.

398
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:12,022
Officer Kai falling off the cliff.

399
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:15,022
Anyway, we still have the character

400
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:17,322
for "fire" left from "Fuurinkazan."

401
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:22,822
Who's next? It is Akira! Or is it...

402
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:29,922
What was that?

403
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,822
It sounded like thunder.

404
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:35,722
Heiji! Something's happened!

405
00:21:35,722 --> 00:21:38,622
What, Kazuha? What is it?

406
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:41,222
There was a big noise and when I turned around,

407
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:43,122
Shigetsugu was gone.

408
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:45,122
When I came looking for him to the railway crossing,

409
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:47,022
the train was stopped there.

410
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:49,422
At the head of the train.

411
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:53,922
A person was lying on the ground. A person is burning!

412
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:55,622
A person is burning?

413
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:58,722
Yeah. Is that Shigetsugu?

414
00:21:58,722 --> 00:22:01,422
Stay there! I'll be there right now!

415
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:07,722
Is that "In raiding and plundering be like fire"?

416
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:34,022
And there was a dead centipede beside the case.

417
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:37,622
That means Shigetsugu didn't die of an accident?

418
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:40,522
Yeah... serial murder...

419
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:42,122
Yes.

420
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:43,822
Thunder.

421
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:47,822
So it seems...

422
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:50,522
The battle isn't over yet...

423
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:54,922
Next Conan,

424
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:56,122
"Fuurinkazan:"

425
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:58,922
"The Conclusion in Lightning and Shadow"

426
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:02,222
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:04,122
Eyeshadow.

428
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:05,622
It's from 7 pm again!

429
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:08,594
Mystery-solving Conan and Yatta-man resumes.
