1
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:05,608
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,308
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:08,908
A robber steals and runs away.

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:12,008
When he is cornered, he disappears beyond time and space!

5
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:13,508
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,208
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,109
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:00,933
Here!

9
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:07,933
Tell Dr. Agasa this cell phone saved my life, will you?

10
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,132
So I guess she didn't find out

11
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,432
who you are.

12
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,432
Yeah, that was close though.

13
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,933
Seems Ran no longer thinks I'm Shinichi Kudo.

14
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,732
Well, I'm pretty sure I could hide it.

15
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,332
Who would believe a story about a guy

16
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,832
who got shrunk by a drug, right?

17
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,532
You better thank me.

18
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,132
You made it through

19
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,032
because I sent you so many e-mails to your cell phone

20
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,532
so that Ran would believe

21
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,432
that you were Conan.

22
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,432
Yeah.

23
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,532
More importantly, are you really sure that

24
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,932
she's not suspicious about you anymore?

25
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,632
Yeah.

26
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,933
That actually made my morning quite an ordeal, though.

27
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,732
Hey Conan, I didn't know you were that smart!

28
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:52,733
Or like...

29
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:56,232
Here! Extra rice for the future detective!

30
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,332
Or like...

31
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,532
Conan, you have to hear this!

32
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,032
It's Shinichi's voice!

33
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,232
You've reached Shinichi Kudo.

34
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:05,932
I'm not available right now. Please leave a message after the tone.

35
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:06,933
Or like...

36
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,132
You told her the cell phone number?

37
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,132
Hey, don't worry!

38
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,732
I'll turn on the answerphone when I'm with her, okay.

39
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,732
Whatever you say, but you gotta be careful.

40
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,432
If she finds out who you are, then...

41
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,332
I know!

42
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:27,032
I'll keep her away from the Black Organization no matter what.

43
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,132
She's a strong girl, you know.

44
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,032
More than you think.

45
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,532
No, don't move!

46
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,833
Stop!

47
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,433
You mean, as in Karate?

48
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,632
Hey man! Look at that!

49
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:42,633
What is it?

50
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,933
Officer Takagi?

51
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,732
Officer Takagi is acting somewhat strange.

52
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,332
Looks like he's having a hard time.

53
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,032
There must be something going on!

54
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,133
Definitely!

55
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,733
All right.

56
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,232
Look, he went inside the jewelry store!

57
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,832
Don't tell me he's gonna rob that store.

58
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,032
What are you, stupid?

59
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,132
There's only reason men go to jewelry store.

60
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,132
To buy a present.

61
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:22,232
It could be for his mother, sister, wife or somebody else.

62
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:25,132
But his face was all red and looked restless when he went inside.

63
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,433
So probably it's for his girlfriend, I think.

64
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:38,232
Eighty thousand yen.

65
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,332
It's expensive after all.

66
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,332
I still have to pay the loan for the ring I bought last time.

67
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,932
But...

68
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,532
That must be it!

69
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,832
Trust me. Miwako was staring at this brooch.

70
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,132
She wasn't even blinking at all!

71
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:54,232
But you didn't hear this from me, okay?

72
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:57,132
Look, coincidence makes girls believe in destiny

73
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,833
and that's where the love deepens!

74
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,432
Love...

75
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:06,132
Sir? Would you like to take a look at it?

76
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:07,532
No, thanks.

77
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,932
Is it a present for child?

78
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,032
What?

79
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:13,132
Child?

80
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:16,532
How about this? The one with lots of diamonds. What do you think?

81
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,632
Well, I think it's too gorgeous for Officer Sato.

82
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,432
Guys, how did you know that...

83
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:24,732
I remember Officer Sato was saying her birthday was in April!

84
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,632
The birthstone of April is diamond.

85
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,532
Then, this one is perfect!

86
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,632
Guys...

87
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:33,132
Who said I was buying Officer Sato a present?

88
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,732
Oh, so you're not?

89
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:37,533
You were right.

90
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:43,433
Sorry.

91
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:46,532
Actually, could I see that brooch, please?

92
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,132
Of course.

93
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,433
This is the one, right?

94
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,032
This is pretty good!

95
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,432
It's got a nice design too!

96
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:58,132
Oh, how nice for Officer Sato!

97
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,733
You think so?

98
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:12,033
"A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 1)"

99
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:18,633
Hey!

100
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,932
"Put the jewels in this bag!"

101
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,733
Jewel robbery?

102
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,332
What are you waiting?

103
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,732
Use your tranquilizer gun.

104
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,932
I can't.

105
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,732
He's wearing a helmet and a heavy coat,

106
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,632
the needle wouldn't go through.

107
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:41,532
We don't know whether it's a real gun or not.

108
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,332
I can't use my high-power kicking shoes

109
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,832
in this situation either.

110
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,533
Now, guys, go...

111
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,932
No, don't take that!

112
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:01,933
Yes!

113
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,033
Now!

114
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,132
"Police Sergeant, Wataru Takagi" -Police!

115
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,132
I was on patrol,

116
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,732
so there are several police officers in this area!

117
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,532
It would be best if you just give up

118
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,833
and throw down your weapon!

119
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,933
He smiled?

120
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,632
Wait!

121
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:31,332
Where are your officers? I don't see any!

122
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,932
Stop!

123
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,132
Of course, there's no officer!

124
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,832
What?

125
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,532
I'm off duty today!

126
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:40,432
That was a total bluff!

127
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,133
Where did he go?

128
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,333
Over there! He's climbing the stairs!

129
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,433
You're not gonna get away!

130
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,632
You guys stay here, okay?

131
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,833
Okay!

132
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,233
There's no way out.

133
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:27,932
Now.

134
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:30,233
Just put down your gun and...

135
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:34,733
Wait a second!

136
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,233
Oh, my God!

137
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,532
Did something fall?

138
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,432
Yeah. What was that huge noise?

139
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,832
You see anything?

140
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,932
No.

141
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,233
"Moving company" -Hey, somebody go up and check it!

142
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,732
Police.

143
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,432
Does this truck belong to you?

144
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:01,632
Yeah.

145
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,332
What happened?

146
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,332
It looks like something fell on the container.

147
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,533
Yeah. Actually...

148
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,533
What is going on? What was that noise?

149
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,932
Somebody's dead!

150
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,532
What?

151
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:19,932
That's what happened.

152
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,832
So, until the ambulance and the police come,

153
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,532
please do not move anything including the stuff.

154
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:25,632
Stuff too?

155
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,632
Yes. We have to maintain the scene the way it is.

156
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:31,232
Oh, no. You can't do that!

157
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:34,132
Look, we have to move all the stuff in by today.

158
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,832
Okay, we'll wait until the ambulance comes,

159
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,532
but after that, you let us to do our job!

160
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:41,132
All right. Why don't I speak to your client, then?

161
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,032
Okay. Mr. Nekota should be in his office.

162
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,532
Hey, get him over here.

163
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,533
Sure.

164
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,932
What is this? What's going on?

165
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,232
Mr. Nekota, somebody's here for you.

166
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,932
"Sakanobu Nekota (51)" -You've barely moved anything yet.

167
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,632
Come on, hurry up!

168
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:59,332
Actually, a man fell on our moving truck so...

169
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,032
-A man? -Right.

170
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,132
So I'm wondering if you could stop moving your stuff for a while?

171
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:07,532
Okay, fine. Call your friends and do what you have to do. Just be quick!

172
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,832
You're not the only one who got a schedule, okay?

173
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,932
I guess it's our fault, isn't it?

174
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:15,032
Yeah. If we hadn't chase him down to the roof...

175
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:17,933
He wouldn't have had to jump off the building,

176
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,832
Come on.

177
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,832
We got an officer with no weapon and five kids.

178
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,832
Even if we did corner on the roof of the building,

179
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,532
he had a gun and he could've used it,

180
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,532
at least to threaten us and run away.

181
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:35,432
So you are saying that man planned to commit suicide from the beginning?

182
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,832
Yes.

183
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,932
Or maybe he was absolutely confident that he was not going to die.

184
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,532
Nonetheless, I think this case...

185
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,333
is not a simple jewel robbery.

186
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,433
It's not a suicide either.

187
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,375
So, you're saying that

188
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:01,375
you were chasing this guy who robbed the jewelry store

189
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,375
who happened to jumped off the building and killed himself?

190
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:04,575
Yes.

191
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:08,075
He went over the fence on the roof of this building.

192
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:11,475
And crashed onto the container of this truck right here.

193
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,775
What were you doing?

194
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:16,175
The media is gonna attack us again.

195
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:21,375
A reckless chase of a hero-wannabe officer led to an unnecessary death.

196
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,075
No way.

197
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:25,475
We weren't just a hero-wannabe!

198
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,975
We were chasing him all the way from the store!

199
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:31,376
We were doing really good until we cornered on the roof.

200
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,575
It happened all of a sudden.

201
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,875
There's no way we could stop him!

202
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:37,876
Right, Conan?

203
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,976
Yeah. He jumped off the building without any hesitation.

204
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:46,176
As if he planned to do it from the beginning.

205
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:48,975
I see. So...

206
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,475
You guys were there when the robber broke

207
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:53,275
into the jewelry store, correct?

208
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:57,575
Yes, we saw Officer Takagi walking into that store.

209
00:11:57,576 --> 00:12:01,775
Oh, Takagi goes to a jewelry store on his day off.

210
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:03,776
For what kind of occasion?

211
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,475
No, that was for...

212
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:12,775
I didn't know you liked jewelries and stuff, Takagi.

213
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:13,876
It's surprising!

214
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,475
It was for you, Officer Sato!

215
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:22,175
So, did you find any jewelry you like?

216
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,875
Actually...

217
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,775
The robber took it just before he bought it!

218
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:28,575
I dropped it on the floor.

219
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:30,975
Did the culprit take it with him?

220
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,975
Yeah, he picked it up

221
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:36,075
and put it in the pocket of his raincoat!

222
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:38,375
Then that thing is supposed be in his pocket still.

223
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:41,775
But the thing is, I went on the truck

224
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:44,075
and checked his pocket before you guys came.

225
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:47,275
But the brooch was not there at all!

226
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:49,075
A brooch.

227
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:52,075
It's a present for your mom, isn't it?

228
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:55,875
No, that's a present for you.

229
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,275
No way.

230
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:02,075
Well, perhaps, the robber threw it away or dropped it.

231
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:05,975
Or maybe it just popped out of his pocket when he fell on the container.

232
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:09,176
In either case, I think you should forget about that brooch.

233
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:13,375
Even if it's found, prosecutors will keep it for a while

234
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,775
since it's material evidence.

235
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:19,775
Who would want a jewelry that has a bloody past anyway, right?

236
00:13:19,776 --> 00:13:21,576
That's true.

237
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,575
Well, I wouldn't mind at all.

238
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:28,275
Even if it's got someone's blood on it, you can just wipe it off.

239
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:29,575
Jewelries have nothing to do with crime.

240
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:30,875
Yeah, that's what I thought!

241
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:34,675
Oh, also, there're some other strange things.

242
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:37,275
The robber was wearing a helmet,

243
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,675
but there's no way he could bleed that much on his head.

244
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:42,376
Unless he removed his helmet while falling down.

245
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,675
I see.

246
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,775
And one more thing,

247
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:53,775
When Officer Takagi said "police" to the robber in the store,

248
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:57,075
the robber actually smiled.

249
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:00,675
As if he was waiting for the police officers to come!

250
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:02,075
Smiled?

251
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:04,275
-Are you sure? -Yes.

252
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,175
If he did smile,

253
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:09,375
then that means he was well prepared for his getaway.

254
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:11,975
Maybe there was something that supposedly guaranteed his life

255
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,075
even after jumping off the building.

256
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:18,775
So, removing his helmet while falling down

257
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,375
was actually a part of his escape plan?

258
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:25,375
I don't know. Anyway, we have to identify the dead body first.

259
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:27,075
Sir, you can't come in!

260
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,475
No, he looks like someone that I know.

261
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:32,075
Oh! It's really Mr. Atomura after all!

262
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:33,076
What?

263
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:35,475
I own a restaurant over there,

264
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:37,675
and he was one of the regular customers.

265
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,675
I think he's working for Mr. Nekota's company.

266
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,175
Nekota?

267
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:43,475
Do you know him?

268
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:47,375
Yes. The robber fell on the moving truck

269
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:53,076
which was carrying the stuff of Mr. Nekota, the man over there.

270
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:57,875
Mr. Atomura?

271
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,375
He's Mr. Atomura!

272
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:00,775
Why did you?

273
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:04,375
Okay, so he is one of your staff, right?

274
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:06,875
Yes, until last week though.

275
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,275
Until last week?

276
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:12,075
He had been working for me since the company was established,

277
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,775
but we're facing some financial difficulties right now,

278
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:15,975
so I had to make him leave unfortunately.

279
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:18,975
It was necessary because our company needs to scale back.

280
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:22,475
But I didn't know it was going to end up like this.

281
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:25,675
So the fact you're moving today is also for the scale back?

282
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:26,775
You got that right.

283
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:31,375
This building's got a smaller space but also a cheap rent.

284
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:34,675
Where was the previous office by the way?

285
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:38,376
It's the building, right across this one, on the top floor.

286
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,975
It's really close.

287
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:46,175
Then, shall we go and see the previous office?

288
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:48,375
Why do you need to?

289
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:52,375
Because if he did plan to commit the robbery,

290
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:55,675
then maybe there are clues about his plan in your office, right?

291
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:57,175
I understand.

292
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:59,275
Hey, sir.

293
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:02,775
Have you met these officers before?

294
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:05,275
No. Why would I have?

295
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:08,076
I've never done anything bad before!

296
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:15,575
"Nekota Food Import Company" -This was Mr. Atomura's locker.

297
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:19,475
And this is the desk he was using before.

298
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:20,875
I see.

299
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:23,775
You got a lot of things in this office still.

300
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:27,675
Yes, we decided to buy new lockers, desks and chairs

301
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,675
to make a clean start.

302
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:31,175
So that's why things are still here.

303
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:35,475
It seems there's nothing that's related to the robbery.

304
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,675
There's nothing in his desk too.

305
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:40,075
But, it's kind of strange, I think.

306
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,575
This man was fired a week ago,

307
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:44,775
but a lot of his stuff is still in this office.

308
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:46,075
Oh that.

309
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:50,375
I didn't want the workers to be upset over the dismissal.

310
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,375
So I decided to keep it secret until our new company gets stable,

311
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:57,275
I told them he was on a business trip.

312
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:59,175
I asked him to come and get his stuff

313
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,175
after moving the office, secretly.

314
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:02,275
Hey, look!

315
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:04,775
Isn't that the truck that the guy crashed?

316
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:05,776
Oh, yeah, it is!

317
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,175
We can see the truck in front of this building.

318
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:10,275
That means this place is right across

319
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:11,676
the building that the robber jumped off.

320
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,175
Maybe he was trying to make a jump from there to here.

321
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,375
What do you think?

322
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,975
That's impossible.

323
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,875
He was holding a bag of jewelries, remember?

324
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,575
Even the world-class long jumpers can go around nine meters or so.

325
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:31,075
A normal person wouldn't even think about jumping off,

326
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,475
unless he was like your superhero, Masked Yaiba.

327
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:34,875
What's wrong with you?

328
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:37,475
Masked Yaiba will never steal things!

329
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:38,675
Yeah, you're right.

330
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:39,875
Hey, guys.

331
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:41,575
Look, you can't go there.

332
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:43,975
Hey, can I ask you something?

333
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:45,376
Where were you when the moving people got here?

334
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:49,575
I was in my house that's below this room.

335
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:50,775
Your house?

336
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:51,876
I see.

337
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,175
Below that office is his living space.

338
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:02,075
That office is four stories above which is the ninth floor.

339
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:03,676
So this house is on the fifth floor.

340
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:07,675
-What is this? -It's a strange helmet, isn't it?

341
00:18:07,676 --> 00:18:08,676
Hey!

342
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:11,075
Is that for a sports bicycle?

343
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:15,175
Yes, I was into triathlon when I was young.

344
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:16,375
Are you done now?

345
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:18,475
Look, we knew each other for a long time,

346
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:21,376
but there's nothing that belongs to him in here!

347
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:25,176
Oh, I'll get it.

348
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:31,075
Hi. How can I help you?

349
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,775
People told me that police officers are here.

350
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,075
Something happened?

351
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:40,475
Oh, Officer. You know there was a jewel robbery over there, right?

352
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:43,676
I just thought that this is something about it.

353
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:48,675
My name is Isaka. I'm living on the sixth floor.

354
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:50,875
Three days ago, around 2 am midnight...

355
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,375
I woke up because I heard this noise from the window.

356
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:55,475
And when I looked at it,

357
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:59,076
there was a thin long stick shadow, on the curtain!

358
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:02,875
So I woke my husband up right away.

359
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,876
He checked the terrace, but nothing was there.

360
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:10,375
My husband said it was just a dream,

361
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:12,676
but I thought I should tell you guys about this.

362
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:16,575
Is your house right above this house?

363
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:20,075
Yeah. It's number 605, just right above.

364
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,375
Then, did you hear the same noise

365
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:24,175
when there was the robbery over there?

366
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,575
No, because I was watching TV.

367
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:28,175
Honestly, I didn't even know about the robbery

368
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:30,475
until I heard the police car siren.

369
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:32,375
Excuse me.

370
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:36,275
Is it okay if we start moving the stuff now?

371
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:40,175
Looks like we need to take two or three more trips to move everything.

372
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:41,875
Two or three more trips?

373
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,475
From the old office?

374
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,675
Yes, we got a lot of stuff

375
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:48,575
because the whole ninth floor was our office.

376
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:51,675
We got storage, meeting room and all that.

377
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:53,775
Well, we're not totally done with your old office,

378
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,775
but it seems it really was a suicide.

379
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:58,175
True, we got the pictures of the scene,

380
00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,675
and the fake gun the robber used to threaten people.

381
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,875
We also got the jewelries back.

382
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,675
Except that brooch,

383
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:07,075
because everything was in the bag.

384
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:09,175
So I think you can start moving now.

385
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:12,675
But you leave the cover on the container.

386
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:14,775
You can start now, but once you're done,

387
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:18,375
the police going to take the truck for a while, okay?

388
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,675
Okay.

389
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,975
-All right, let's get to work! -Okay.

390
00:20:21,976 --> 00:20:23,276
Hey, wait! Hold on!

391
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:29,675
Where did you guys park the truck when you were moving the stuff

392
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:31,975
from the old office to that container?

393
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:33,775
We parked the truck.

394
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,175
"Movers destination. Former office" -at the back of this building.

395
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:37,175
"Movers destination. Former office" -That's where the back entrance is.

396
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:39,875
We used the back street when we carried the stuff

397
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:41,775
just to avoid the crowd.

398
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:44,275
Did you hear anything when you were there?

399
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,075
Yeah, I heard a noise.

400
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,075
What kind of noise?

401
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:50,175
That was jackhammer from the water supply work

402
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:51,875
they've been doing since last week.

403
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,875
That was annoying.

404
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,675
"Back Door" -Noise of water supply work.

405
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:59,375
"Mr. Nekota's house" -The back street is narrow

406
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:01,075
and does not have many passersby as well.

407
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,875
"The place culprit jumped down."

408
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:05,675
What's also annoying was the Nekota guy.

409
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:07,475
He told us what to do like a kindergarten teacher!

410
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,475
Yeah. He told all of us, including the driver,

411
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:14,175
to come upstairs, just to teach us which thing goes first and stuff.

412
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:18,375
We also had to wait for a while in front of his office, you know?

413
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:20,975
Plus, he canceled us twice in a row.

414
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:22,575
Canceled?

415
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:26,075
We were actually supposed to do the moving the day before yesterday,

416
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,575
but he called us that morning and said he can't make it.

417
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:30,375
Yesterday was too. It was a nice day.

418
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,475
Actually, it really was a perfect day for moving.

419
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:34,875
Well, he booked us for three days just in case

420
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,975
he might have to cancel.

421
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,675
Sure the pay was good but...

422
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:40,975
We don't wanna work for a guy like him ever again.

423
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:42,975
I get it! It's the rain!

424
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,076
Thank you so much! Good luck with the moving!

425
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:48,676
Hey, Conan!

426
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,676
Where is the bedroom?

427
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,176
I found it!

428
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:58,176
It's here!

429
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:02,075
If my deduction is correct...

430
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,176
Then, probably...

431
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,576
It's wet!

432
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,876
Just as I thought, it wasn't a suicide!

433
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:18,175
Mr. Atomura was murdered by Mr. Nekota,

434
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:21,676
who disguised the murder as suicide.

435
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,776
With the time lag and the gap between the buildings.

436
00:23:57,776 --> 00:24:01,675
"Next Episode" -Why are you not getting mad at us?

437
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,676
We're kids, you know.

438
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:08,175
Talk about a trick that is unbelievably reliant on luck.

439
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:10,475
But it's only kid's shallow cleverness after all.

440
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:13,175
I can't believe you're actually listening to them!

441
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:16,975
we were important witnesses of the jewel robbery.

442
00:24:16,976 --> 00:24:19,776
And the brooch that I was going to buy...

443
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:27,776
Next Conan, "A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 2)"

444
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:45,875
Next Conan's Hint:

445
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,875
"Rain."

446
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:50,375
With this brooch, I'll approach Ms. Sato!

447
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:51,575
That's not funny.

448
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:52,676
It isn't?
