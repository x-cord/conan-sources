1
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:03,897
Ran, Sonoko and Sera,

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:07,397
on their way to school runs into a certain corpse.

3
00:00:07,997 --> 00:00:09,197
What seems to be the matter?

4
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:11,797
Well, you see, we were looking for him

5
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:12,797
because he didn't show up at work,

6
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:14,697
we found him slumped down in a place like this.

7
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:16,697
He's bleeding from the mouth too.

8
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:20,297
We called the ambulance while we were at it already.

9
00:00:21,497 --> 00:00:23,597
He doesn't need an ambulance.

10
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:25,797
What?

11
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:28,097
Almost about nine hours seems to have passed

12
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:30,397
since he died already.

13
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,797
Does he have alcohol dependency?

14
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:37,197
Yeah. He used to say that the doctor

15
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:38,997
told him to stay away from alcoholic drinks.

16
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,397
But, how'd you know about it?

17
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,797
He's got jaundice on the white of his eye.

18
00:00:44,797 --> 00:00:47,397
He's skinny but has a popped belly.

19
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,097
This is an abdominal build of fluids!

20
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:51,097
It's proof that he's got a malfunctioning liver!

21
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:54,997
Furthermore, there is a bottle of sake left behind untouched

22
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:57,897
in the dispenser of the vending machine.

23
00:00:57,897 --> 00:00:59,297
From the circumstances,

24
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:03,497
it's very likely that it's the bottle of sake that he bought!

25
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,597
So, well, an alcoholic

26
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:08,397
suffering from cirrhosis of the liver had a burst varix

27
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:09,897
and spit blood.

28
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:12,397
And since unfortunately, there was no one around at that time,

29
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:15,497
he couldn't get help and died.

30
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:18,197
That's what you'd normally think.

31
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:21,197
But, this is not death by illness.

32
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,997
It's a crime committed by someone with malicious intent!

33
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:28,197
As proof of this, right in front of this man, see!

34
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:31,497
There is the word "Death" written with blood.

35
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:35,197
The word "Death" written in blood that was left near the corpse.

36
00:01:35,197 --> 00:01:39,197
It was similar to the only case ten years ago,

37
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:43,397
that my Dad, Yusaku Kudo didn't specify the culprit.

38
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:46,097
Wanting to find the similarities between the two cases,

39
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:49,297
we called Officer Takagi who was in charge of this case.

40
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:51,997
Oh, you mean the corpse that was found this morning?

41
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:55,697
I don't know what happened to the corpse after that though.

42
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:57,797
It was concluded to be a robbery case,

43
00:01:57,797 --> 00:02:00,197
and was passed over to the investigation 3rd division.

44
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:04,597
Robbery? It wasn't a homicide?

45
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:05,997
Hey, cut out the joke!

46
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:08,697
What about that case is a robbery?

47
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:11,197
You saw too, didn't you? That word "Death" written in blood?

48
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,697
Well, I thought the same thing too.

49
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:16,497
That this was a bizarre homicide case.

50
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:19,097
But, Inspector Megure who came along

51
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,697
after you all left for school,

52
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:23,397
saw that word written in blood

53
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:25,797
and immediately said, 'this is probably a robbery'.

54
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:29,897
It's not a homicide but a robbery.

55
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,797
It's strange, isn't it?

56
00:02:32,797 --> 00:02:34,497
I'm sure that Inspector Megure was also

57
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:36,997
in charge of the case that occurred ten years ago.

58
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:38,697
It's only natural that he would consider it

59
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:40,597
to be a case of serial murder, and yet...

60
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:42,797
That's true.

61
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,997
Ten years ago, Inspector Megure is sure to have

62
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,997
seen that word written in blood too.

63
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,697
And yet... why?

64
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:53,897
Besides, back then, Dad was talking with the boy

65
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,797
who first found the corpse.

66
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:58,397
Moreover, he was smiling too.

67
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:00,897
I wonder why.

68
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:05,197
I wonder why Dad declared that it was not homicide.

69
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:07,897
Why?

70
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:10,497
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

71
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:12,297
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

72
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:13,997
The cold case mystery that father handled.

73
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:15,897
What is the mystery behind the common word?

74
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:17,397
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,497
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:22,397
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:09,504
"Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 2)"

78
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:12,432
Don't tell me that the police know who the culprit is

79
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:15,632
and are hiding it?

80
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:18,532
You mean like what we see in the movies or dramas.

81
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:19,732
Because the culprit is from

82
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:20,832
a distinguished family of the police force

83
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:21,932
or the political and business circles?

84
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:25,032
That although it's frustrating, no one can lay a hand on them!

85
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,832
I mean you're the daughter

86
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:28,732
of the Suzuki Financial Group yourself too, aren't you?

87
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:30,032
But...

88
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:32,332
It's hard to believe that Shinichi's father

89
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,032
would pull out of a case for such a reason.

90
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:37,132
That's true.

91
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:41,032
Then, why not ask for advice?

92
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:45,232
From your deduction loving classmate, Kinichi.

93
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:46,632
Kinichi?

94
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:50,032
Huh? Oh, yes. I guess so.

95
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:52,232
Huh? Just what're you talking about?

96
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,232
If you're going to ask for advice on the case,

97
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:55,932
it would be Shinichi Kudo, right?

98
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:57,232
He's a high school detective

99
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,632
as well as your boyfriend, isn't he?

100
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:03,432
Although it seems that he's pursuing a case right now

101
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:05,932
and isn't at home!

102
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:11,532
Oh. So, the master of this house is that high school detective.

103
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:14,132
Don't tell me that you were living here

104
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:15,732
not even knowing something like that?

105
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:19,932
No, because Ran told me that the Shinichi who lives here

106
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:23,432
is a plain, nothing special high school student.

107
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:24,732
And, besides.

108
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:28,732
Rumor has it that the high school detective Shinichi Kudo

109
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:31,432
passed away when investigating a case

110
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,432
and disappeared from the stage of solving mysteries,

111
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:34,732
from what I heard.

112
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:37,332
Is such a rumor going around?

113
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:39,832
Yes. That's why I thought that

114
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,032
the person, Shinichi that pops frequently in your conversations

115
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:43,132
was a different person.

116
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:45,332
There's no way that he's dead.

117
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:49,632
I've been involved in two cases with him already, you know!

118
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:53,332
Well, although it was only by phone both times.

119
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:55,232
Right, Conan?

120
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:58,232
Yep... right.

121
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:01,732
Then who is Kinichi?

122
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,932
Oh, since Shinichi told me

123
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:07,832
to not tell you too much about himself.

124
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:11,132
I... sort of... I'm sorry.

125
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:15,532
But, I wonder why there's a rumor going around that Shinichi died?

126
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,032
That's probably because

127
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:18,732
he's always telling the people involved in the case

128
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:21,432
to keep under cover the fact that

129
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,232
he's handling the case, I guess?

130
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:25,532
It seems to be that he does so

131
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,232
to keep the culprits of the cases off guard.

132
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:31,332
Does he think he's a ninja or something

133
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:33,232
that's in hiding on enemy grounds or what?

134
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:35,032
Ninja?

135
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:38,932
Then, how about calling him now?

136
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:41,332
I'd like to hear his deduction too.

137
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:45,132
Oh. But I already text mailed him at sundown

138
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,332
on the outline of the case.

139
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,932
But, you haven't told him yet that the police

140
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:51,832
are trying to close the case as a robbery, right?

141
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:53,632
True.

142
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:56,832
Besides, you should directly talk to him, Ran.

143
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:59,032
-Huh? -While you're at it,

144
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:01,532
you might well tell him how you feel about him too.

145
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:03,332
What?

146
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,432
I got to use the restroom!

147
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:08,032
Rats. No joke?

148
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,532
Come on, quick.

149
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:16,632
Oh, if you're going to call him,

150
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:18,432
can you relay a word to him for me?

151
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,332
Huh?

152
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:24,432
Oh, Shinichi?

153
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:27,032
It's me, Ran.

154
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:29,832
May I talk to you now?

155
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:32,032
Yeah. What is it?

156
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,932
If it's about the case you saw this morning,

157
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,932
the glasses boy already texted me about it.

158
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:41,132
That the police is trying to close it as a robbery case.

159
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:42,432
Right.

160
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:46,832
And about that other stuff that has nothing to do with the case.

161
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:48,532
Other stuff?

162
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:51,732
Go on and tell him that you like him.

163
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,632
What is it? What other stuff?

164
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,632
Oh. So... you know...

165
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:58,832
I like you so very much. I like...

166
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:03,732
-I super... -I like...

167
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,132
Su...

168
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,532
Subaru said!

169
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,932
-Huh? -What?

170
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:16,632
Subaru said that

171
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:20,932
you're just like a ninja! Saizo Kirigakure!

172
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:22,332
Oh, give me a break.

173
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:25,332
He wanted me to relay this to you.

174
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,432
Saizo Kirigakure?

175
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:30,332
Oh. Is it because he's in hiding?

176
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:32,132
Yes! Most probably.

177
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:35,032
But, why are you talking about that at a time like this?

178
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,332
Saizo Kirigakure

179
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:40,832
used to be one of the Sanada Ten Braves, I think?

180
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:43,532
If I remember correctly, legend has it that

181
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,432
he was a fictitious Iga Ninja who served under warlord,

182
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:47,232
Yukimura Sanada.

183
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:50,232
Wait a sec. Yukimura Sanada.

184
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:53,132
Sanada maru (Sanada Barbican). Sanada himo (braid).

185
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:55,332
Sanada...

186
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,032
Sanada!

187
00:09:57,032 --> 00:09:59,832
I see! I got it! The truth of the case!

188
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,932
-Huh? -Go right away to the crime site

189
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:02,932
you saw today!

190
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:04,932
What? Hey, Shinichi?

191
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:08,532
If it's as my deduction goes, it should fit right in!

192
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:14,232
I see. So, that's the story.

193
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:17,232
Hey, Shinichi? What's going on?

194
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,732
Shinichi? Shinichi?

195
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:22,132
No. He hung up.

196
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,332
What?

197
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,532
When you still haven't told him how you feel about him?

198
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:28,032
And? What did he say, Shinichi?

199
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,932
He said that he figured out the truth of the case

200
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,632
so to go right over to the scene of the crime

201
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,732
we went to this morning.

202
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,832
He said if his deduction is correct,

203
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:37,932
things will fit right in.

204
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:41,232
Then, he probably figured out why his Dad

205
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:46,132
gave up on the case ten year ago too.

206
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:49,032
He didn't give up on the case.

207
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:54,132
Shinichi said that he knew, but didn't tell anybody about it!

208
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,932
Conan?

209
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:58,232
You talked to Shinichi?

210
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:01,332
I was on the phone with Shinichi till just a while ago, you know?

211
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,732
Oh, so right after that phone call,

212
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,532
really just now, I got text mail.

213
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,832
Then, why didn't he tell Ran about it.

214
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:10,632
Huh? Oh, that's because...

215
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:14,132
Conan, do you have a bow tie attached to your smart phone?

216
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,832
Rats. I forgot to detach the voice changer.

217
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:19,032
Oh, this is...

218
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:22,932
It's the "in" thing in school right now, you see.

219
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:26,232
At any rate, if going to the crime site

220
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:29,332
is going to prove whether his deduction is right or wrong,

221
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:32,132
there's no reason why we shouldn't go there.

222
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,232
Don't you think so?

223
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:39,032
High school detective, Shinichi Kudo...

224
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:48,732
After all, is saying so.

225
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:53,632
Right. Let's go! Ran!

226
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:55,032
Yep!

227
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:00,832
Come on, Conan, let's go!

228
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:03,432
You got text mail from Kudo about his deduction, right?

229
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,932
Oh. Yep.

230
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:22,885
Just as I thought, there're no police officers here at all.

231
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:25,385
No joke. I guess they concluded it as a robbery

232
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:28,285
and withdrew from this place all together.

233
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:30,285
But, normally, if somebody is found dead

234
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:31,485
with a word written in blood that

235
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,685
he couldn't possibly have written himself.

236
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:36,285
More so, if a word such as "Death" is left behind like this,

237
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:39,685
it's only natural they would think of it as a homicide, and yet...

238
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:40,785
Yep.

239
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:43,485
Ran, do you have your coin purse with you?

240
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,985
Huh? Yes.

241
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:47,285
Hey, you. Don't tell me that

242
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:48,785
you're planning to buy beer or something, brat?

243
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:50,885
No.

244
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:55,585
It was written in Shinichi's text mail!

245
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:57,385
If you do this, that is,

246
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,785
line the coins up like this on the blood word...

247
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:02,285
See, it fits right in, right?

248
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:05,885
No joke. How come?

249
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,585
This isn't a word that a person had written,

250
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:11,785
but blood dripped onto to the scattered coins like this,

251
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:13,885
and coincidentally turned out this way, he said!

252
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:18,985
But... what about that narrow space and all?

253
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:21,985
Are you saying that the blood intentionally avoided that area?

254
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:25,985
No. The cigarette was probably on the ground there.

255
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:28,585
The cigarette was smeared with blood, you know.

256
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:31,085
And besides, if the coin purse with the coins inside it,

257
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:33,485
dropped to the ground surrounding the coins then,

258
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:36,485
it's likely that this word "Death" would be made.

259
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,285
In other words...

260
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,285
The man that we found dead this morning,

261
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,685
came to buy sake here last night,

262
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,485
but because his varix burst due to cirrhosis of the liver,

263
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:47,985
he spit blood, and slumped down.

264
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:50,085
Back then on top of the coin purse, coins

265
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:51,285
and cigarette that he dropped,

266
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,585
blood dripped from his mouth.

267
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:56,285
After the man passed away,

268
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:59,885
a passerby took his coin purse and coins,

269
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:02,285
so only this word written in blood was left behind.

270
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:04,185
So, that's the story.

271
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:06,285
But, isn't there a possibility

272
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:09,285
that the one who took his money killed him?

273
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:11,585
I don't think so!

274
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:15,185
A blood written word like this wouldn't show up so clearly

275
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,085
unless the coin purse and money were taken

276
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:18,585
after the blood totally dried.

277
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:21,585
Then, it was a case of robbery, after all!

278
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:22,985
Yeah!

279
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:28,585
But, Conan! It's amazing how you realized it!

280
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:32,785
I'm not the one who realized it, it's Shinichi who did!

281
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,685
He said that Subaru's words rang a bell!

282
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:39,485
Oh, the phrase that he told me to tell Shinichi,

283
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:44,685
"You're like a ninja, Saizo Kirigakure."

284
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,085
Then, could this be the blood word that

285
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,285
ninjas used to use a lot?

286
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:53,685
No! Saizo Kirigakure was one of the Sanada Ten Braves!

287
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,585
The emblem on the banner of the Sanada family

288
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,285
are the six coins, right?

289
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:58,885
That's how I figured it out.

290
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:01,085
That this blood word was not written

291
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:04,985
but was made from six round coins, that created the shape.

292
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:06,185
Oh.

293
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:10,085
Of course, Shinichi told me this!

294
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:13,785
But, the case ten years ago was an accident, wasn't it?

295
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,285
The principal of a nursery school

296
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,685
tripped over a cobbled road in the park and fell.

297
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,885
And, the fishbowl that he was carrying at that time cracked,

298
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,585
then a shattered piece of debris

299
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:23,385
poked into his chest killing him.

300
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:27,885
Was that a case of robbery too?

301
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,785
But, in the picture of the site of the crime ten years ago,

302
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:33,485
the flowers of the park that was offered by the boy,

303
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:35,485
who was the first to find the corpse was shown,

304
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:37,685
but there was no cigarette shown.

305
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:39,985
Besides, Shinichi said nothing about

306
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:41,885
a coin purse being stolen either.

307
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:44,985
Then, the case ten years ago was a homicide after all?

308
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,385
No, that case indeed was due to the six coins!

309
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:49,385
Huh?

310
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:51,285
See, the boy called Ryosuke Nishimura

311
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,085
that was the first to find the corpse.

312
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:55,985
When he found the principal immobile in the park

313
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:58,385
lying on the ground, he thought that he was dead,

314
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:01,385
and therefore, put flowers and coins near the body

315
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:03,285
as offering!

316
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:06,785
The six coins were to be used to cross the Sanzu River!

317
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:08,885
Sanzu River?

318
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,985
He was only five years old kindergartener, you know?

319
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:13,685
But, he was the son of a monk, wasn't he?

320
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:16,685
It's likely that he heard about it from his parents, no?

321
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:19,585
That if the deceased doesn't have the six coins

322
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:20,885
to cross the Sanzu River,

323
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:23,685
an old lady near the river

324
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:25,185
will rob him of his clothes

325
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,885
and he will plunge into hell!

326
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:31,085
The boy who probably heard about this,

327
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:34,785
offered six coins near the corpse of the principal

328
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:39,285
and covered it with flowers so that they wouldn't be stolen.

329
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:42,385
But, no matter if he was the son of a temple,

330
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:45,185
I wonder if he'd be carrying six coins on him all the time.

331
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:46,385
He didn't have any,

332
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:49,185
so he used something that looked similar as a substitute!

333
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,685
A substitute?

334
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:54,785
Remember, the thing that the boy was holding in the picture?

335
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:58,985
The candy drops with a whole in the center!

336
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:02,385
Right! He used them in place of the six coins

337
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:04,485
and placed them near the left hand of the corpse

338
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,385
and covered them with the flowers

339
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,485
but from the space between the joints of his thumb,

340
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,385
the blood that flowed out of the corpse flow in,

341
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:15,785
and coincidentally shaped that ominous blood word!

342
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,485
That's why until the body was moved,

343
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:20,485
nobody noticed the word "Death" formed by blood!

344
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,285
Before the body was moved,

345
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:25,085
the blood word was merged with the left hand,

346
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,685
so in the picture there was no blood under the left hand,

347
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:30,985
but blood was found on the palm of his hand and fingers!

348
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:32,085
I see!

349
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,285
The thumb of the corpse served in place of the cigarette

350
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,385
to form a long narrow space!

351
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:40,785
But, there were no candy drops in the picture.

352
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:43,885
The dog that the boy was taking care of in the park,

353
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:45,885
probably took it away!

354
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:47,785
It also scattered the flowers too.

355
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,685
That dog in the picture wasn't wearing a collar,

356
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:54,885
and three candy drops were found in his dish!

357
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:57,385
Then why didn't Shinichi's father

358
00:17:57,385 --> 00:18:00,385
publicize the truth of the case?

359
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:03,285
Because such a fuss was made over the blood word

360
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:06,285
being the start of bizarre serial killings.

361
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,785
Depending on how you look at it,

362
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,985
it may be mistaken for a distasteful mischief of a child.

363
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:12,785
If that were to be publicized,

364
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:15,485
the boy could be criticized for his act!

365
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:19,185
That's why I think he decided to say nothing.

366
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,485
Well, after seeing the blood word this time,

367
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,485
from the fact that Inspector Megure

368
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:26,685
instantly saw through what happened after seeing the round coins,

369
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:29,785
I'm sure that Yusaku had explained everything to him already.

370
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,285
He not only told the Inspector.

371
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:36,085
Back then, Dad was talking to that boy.

372
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:37,485
Smiling.

373
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:40,285
That's why back then, Dad probably...

374
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,385
Thanks to you,

375
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,285
it seems that the principal was able to go to heaven!

376
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:45,485
Really?

377
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:47,885
But, next time you make an offering,

378
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:50,485
I think it's better that you tell your parents about it first.

379
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:52,785
Okay! I understand!

380
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:56,185
And, don't tell anybody about what happened, okay?

381
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:58,085
Because we don't want anybody to find out that

382
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,585
you're the one that made the old lady by the Sanzu River get cavities

383
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:01,985
thanks to your candy drops, do we?

384
00:19:01,985 --> 00:19:05,585
Said something to that affect or something.

385
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:07,885
Well, as for me, I was relieved to find

386
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:11,585
that Dad didn't pull out of the case.

387
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:26,585
Co...

388
00:19:26,585 --> 00:19:29,985
Conan, right?

389
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:32,585
Yep.

390
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:39,185
Oh, I just happened to read Shinichi's text mail, you see.

391
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,285
Really, don't scare me like that.

392
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:44,685
I mean you guys already look alike too, you know!

393
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,985
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,885
But, too bad, don't you think?

395
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,885
We solved the case this time

396
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:55,585
and yet we don't know who stole the money.

397
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,885
If we need a clue,

398
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:58,585
I found this blood smeared 10 yen coin

399
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:01,685
from under this vending machine!

400
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:03,585
If there's blood on it, it means...

401
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:07,085
Yeah. I'm sure that when the culprit picked up the loose change,

402
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:10,385
the coin that he failed to pick up went under the vending machine,

403
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:13,985
but if the fingerprints on it are of someone with a record...

404
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:15,985
I have a record.

405
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:17,085
Assault and battery.

406
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:20,185
-Inflicting bodily injury. -Blackmailing.

407
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:25,285
We have been arrested on three previous convictions.

408
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:29,885
If you include robbery, that'll make four!

409
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:33,485
So, won't you lend us, you know what?

410
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:36,385
10 yen won't hurt, will it?

411
00:20:37,685 --> 00:20:42,185
We'll give you three a good time later, so you see...

412
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:43,885
Okay.

413
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,485
Take this!

414
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,185
Hey?

415
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,085
Darn! What do you think you're doing?

416
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:00,685
Darn.

417
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:02,485
You brats!

418
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:14,385
How dare you guys, cut out the joke?

419
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:26,585
Case closed! One down!

420
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:30,285
That ball... Conan?

421
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:32,885
Yep.

422
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:08,385
Huh? Aren't you going to the police, Sera?

423
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:12,785
No. I'm sorry, but you guys go and get interrogated.

424
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:14,985
I've got urgent business to attend to,

425
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:16,985
so I've got to go.

426
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:18,885
Okay.

427
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,585
Hey, Conan?

428
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:29,185
You scraped your elbow!

429
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:31,385
Oh, I scraped it when I fell a while ago.

430
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:33,685
Come on. Be careful, will you?

431
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,385
What're you going to do if it gets infected?

432
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:38,085
Yep. I'm sorry.

433
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:49,285
I'm a bad person, after all.

434
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:03,185
Yeah. The Nihonbashi post office, eh?

435
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:05,585
M is heading down south on Chuo Boulevard.

436
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:08,485
Well, shall we start off then?

437
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:11,285
Well, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

438
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,885
The cruiser that M is on board have set off.

439
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:20,785
What's the matter, Ran?

440
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,585
No, it's nothing.

441
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:24,885
Next Conan,

442
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:28,985
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 1)"

443
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:46,985
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,885
"Surveillance Camera"

445
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:50,485
I may lose to Sera.

446
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:51,685
You're stronger.

447
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,310
I don't want these two to fight against each other.
