00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:07,785
"Susan Trummelperman (22), Arisa Nakashima (23), Office Worker"

2
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,585
We are extraterrestrials (ET).

3
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:25,484
In memory of this encounter,

4
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,684
if you would take a picture of me with you

5
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:31,684
and publicize it, I wouldn't be happier.

6
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:35,084
He's tapping under his chin just as promised to.

7
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:39,284
He says "we" but he's alone.

8
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:42,385
This is hilarious!

9
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,285
Okay, stand side by side!

10
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:51,584
We are ET.

11
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,684
Cool!

12
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:56,484
It's an ET!

13
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:59,385
It's an ET! Help!

14
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:05,685
-What? -He fell!

15
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:08,984
Ambulance!

16
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,484
Are you all right?

17
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:11,984
"Yasuo Hanzaki (42)" -Hey, are you all right?

18
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:14,184
Get a hold of yourself! Are you all right?

19
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,084
Are you all right? Hey!

20
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,285
-No way. -No way.

21
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:21,885
No...

22
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:25,584
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

23
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,684
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

24
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:31,284
The sudden appearance of an ET leads to an unexpected case.

25
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:32,884
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,684
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult

27
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:37,085
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:24,193
"A Disappointing And Kind ET"

29
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:28,041
I doubt he has common sense.

30
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,641
To lead somebody to die by mimicking an ET.

31
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:33,641
What a hopeless adult.

32
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:36,541
You can say that again. I wonder what he's thinking.

33
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:38,241
Wrong.

34
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:41,041
Don't talk bad about Mr. Takedera.

35
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:44,541
"Kota Matsumoto (6)" -It's my fault. I'm sure.

36
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,541
Who are you?

37
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,241
I'm Kota Matsumoto.

38
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:52,141
What do you mean it's your fault?

39
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:55,341
Mr. Takedera always plays with us

40
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:59,641
at the recreation center on his day off.

41
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:02,741
So, the ET came to earth not to invade us

42
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,041
but because he wanted to be friends with us.

43
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:08,741
"Hitoshi Takedera (26)" -They want to be friends with earth people, right?

44
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:11,241
Yes. That's why earth people should...

45
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:13,641
He's lying again.

46
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:16,941
There's no such thing as an ET, right?

47
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:20,142
There is! My father who died told me so!

48
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:31,141
So, maybe...

49
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:32,841
I see.

50
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:36,841
They wanted eye-witnesses to cause a rumor.

51
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,241
Yes.

52
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:41,341
He wasn't a hopeless adult, was he?

53
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:43,941
He was a kind good person.

54
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:46,641
I'm sorry for talking bad about him.

55
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:50,141
But he did cause an accident after all.

56
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:52,641
I'll bet he'll regret it for the rest of his life.

57
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:55,342
What'll happen to Mr. Takedera?

58
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:06,941
Hey, miss.

59
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:11,441
Are you the ones that were together when the accident happened yesterday?

60
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:12,741
Yes.

61
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:14,341
You are?

62
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:17,341
I'm Mr. Takedera's friend.

63
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:18,841
I see.

64
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:21,441
May I ask you about last night?

65
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:24,841
Sure or would you like to take a look at this instead?

66
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:25,942
What?

67
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,441
Is this the ET?

68
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:33,541
And this video too.

69
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,542
It's an ET!

70
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:40,242
It's an ET! Help!

71
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:48,941
May I see that picture again?

72
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:50,341
Yep.

73
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,641
Do you think this ET can scare anybody?

74
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:56,841
It looks no better than a Halloween costume to me.

75
00:05:56,842 --> 00:06:02,341
We only found out that he was an ET because he claimed to be one, right?

76
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:06,241
He said "We are ET".

77
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:08,341
I'm sure.

78
00:06:08,342 --> 00:06:12,342
But Mr. Hanzaki who died...

79
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:18,341
came down from above and just about here on the street below,

80
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:21,341
he saw the ET that appeared so he was surprised,

81
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:24,042
tried to flee then he fell.

82
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:31,541
But how did Mr. Hanzaki know it was an ET?

83
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:33,841
Because he said so, right?

84
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:37,941
He said "We are ET".

85
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:43,141
Do you think he could hear in a voice like that, all the way over here?

86
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:45,141
True, it's strange.

87
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:46,341
And while I'm at it,

88
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:48,141
I wonder why that man called Hanzaki

89
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:51,341
was in a place like this at that time?

90
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:54,341
He couldn't have come to the temple to pray.

91
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:56,841
It's been long abandoned.

92
00:06:56,842 --> 00:07:00,441
There must be something behind what happened last night.

93
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:02,941
I don't think that it was just an unfortunate accident.

94
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:06,541
-I guess it's show time for us! -Yep!

95
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,841
First of all, we've gotta check on the man called Hanzaki.

96
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:12,641
Who are you guys anyway?

97
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:13,642
We are...

98
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:14,941
Together the five of us...

99
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:17,342
The Youth Detective Squad!

100
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,641
You mean Hanzaki who lives next door?

101
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:26,341
Yep, we asked the person below

102
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:29,941
and was told that you were good friends with him.

103
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:33,241
We were both unemployed and had a lot of time on our hands.

104
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:35,341
What kind of person was he?

105
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:37,141
"Tsuneyuki Tamai (40)" -An unlucky guy.

106
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:40,841
He was laid off from the factory where he worked six months ago.

107
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:43,241
Even last night, he was supposed get a hold of some cash and yet...

108
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:45,541
Oh, bummers.

109
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,741
What do you mean?

110
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:52,141
Well, who cares? You're only kids.

111
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:56,941
I think he was blackmailing somebody to raise money for making a living.

112
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,241
What?

113
00:07:58,242 --> 00:08:00,841
Blackmail, is it?

114
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:02,441
Yeah. And even last night,

115
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,641
it seems he was called out by the other party,

116
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,442
saying that he'd be given money.

117
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:13,841
That's why he went to Beimyoji?

118
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:16,841
And Mr. Hanzaki died.

119
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:20,341
So, X who was being blackmailed must've been relieved.

120
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:24,241
Does it mean that X killed Mr. Hanzaki?

121
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:27,541
Who was the person being blackmailed?

122
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,541
How would I know?

123
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,441
We can go check if you like.

124
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:35,441
Because he never locks his room anyway.

125
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:36,442
-What? -What?

126
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:38,541
He doesn't lock the door?

127
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:42,242
No. He said there's nothing inside for anybody to steal.

128
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,141
There's no clue to X.

129
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:51,041
Geez, this room sure smells of cigarettes.

130
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:53,941
Well, he was a heavy smoker after all.

131
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:56,441
I wonder what characters they are? There are so many of them.

132
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,341
Giveaways from the karaoke shop.

133
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:00,342
He used to frequent the shop.

134
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,742
"Medicine"

135
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:10,641
The guy he was blackmailing could've been from the factory.

136
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,341
I think it was last month, he...

137
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:17,041
I'd rather work than going on blackmailing on and off.

138
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:19,941
Please work something out so that I can go back to work again.

139
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:23,741
If you help me, I'll forget about the incident.

140
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:28,741
You mean he wanted to be re-hired at the factory that laid him off?

141
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,341
Probably.

142
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,941
If the person had the power to do so...

143
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:35,741
He could've been a previous boss at the factory.

144
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,841
What?

145
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,641
Did Mr. Hanzaki work at Sanko Heavy Industries

146
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:42,841
It's a super top rate company!

147
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,741
No way.

148
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,441
Hanzaki was working at a subcontractor company

149
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:49,542
for Sanko Heavy Industries.

150
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:56,141
-I'd like to go check out the identity of X, -I feel refreshed.

151
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:59,341
but the factory's closed on Sundays.

152
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:01,641
Let's check on something else.

153
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:06,142
I've something that I'd like to confirm directly from him about the ET too.

154
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:16,342
"Beika Police Station"

155
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:22,341
I know you want to do it for Kota

156
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:27,141
but how did you come about the idea of wanting to become an ET?

157
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:30,142
It's not me who came up with the idea.

158
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:34,941
I discussed it over with my friend

159
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:37,741
who was in the children's literature club with me in my university days,

160
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:41,041
called Akira Omi.

161
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,041
He's a good boy with a pure heart.

162
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:47,341
Then, why don't you become an ET?

163
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:49,541
And then you should be witnessed by somebody,

164
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:53,541
take pictures with that person and gain publicity,

165
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:56,141
making everybody think that ET existed after all!

166
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:57,541
Sounds good!

167
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,941
"Akira Omi (26)" -The sooner the better.

168
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:00,741
Let's get to it tomorrow.

169
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:02,341
Okay!

170
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:05,441
I'm glad I discussed with you, Omi.

171
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:08,541
I just jumped at his suggestion.

172
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,941
That Mr. Omi really thinks up interesting things, doesn't he?

173
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,841
I acted out a play

174
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,942
in which we both played the role of ET too.

175
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:23,741
We are ET.

176
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:27,741
That outfit was one that we made back then.

177
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:30,241
That's why it looked so dorky.

178
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:32,541
It was made for children to begin with after all.

179
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:37,041
In order not to scare them.

180
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:38,641
I'm sure that Omi is concerned

181
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:41,841
about the incident that happened last night.

182
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:44,741
Because he was the one that suggested that around 8 pm

183
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:47,142
would be a good time to make an appearance too.

184
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,341
He also told me that site had the atmosphere and setting

185
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,841
that fit the situation.

186
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,942
But, that all turned out for the worst.

187
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:00,741
I'd like to confirm once again.

188
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:03,841
Your friend Omi was the one who suggested that

189
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:09,741
the ET should appear below the steps of Beimyoji at 8 last night?

190
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:10,941
Yeah.

191
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:14,441
Omi knows that area well.

192
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,441
He used to live there

193
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:20,341
until he was hired at Sanko Heavy Industries and entered their dorm.

194
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:22,142
Sanko Heavy Industries?

195
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,041
Can we see Mr. Omi if we go to that employees' dorm?

196
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:31,041
He was saying that he goes to the gym on his days off.

197
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,142
Why do you want to go see him?

198
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:41,354
"Sanko Heavy Industries Beika Dorm"

199
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:46,353
It seems that Mr. Omi went out around 7:30 last night.

200
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:49,853
If from here, it takes about 20 minutes to get to Beimyoji

201
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:53,853
He'll make it way in time for the appearance of the ET at 8 pm, won't he?

202
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:56,953
He seems to be in the production administration division.

203
00:12:56,954 --> 00:13:00,153
Moreover, he seems to be the adjustor for subcontracting companies.

204
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,553
Therefore, he also has a say in the hiring of workers.

205
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:07,054
So, X is Akira Omi.

206
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,953
It's natural for him to have some kind of connection with Mr. Hanzaki.

207
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,553
It's possible that he was blackmailed

208
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:16,253
because Mr. Hanzaki had something on him.

209
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,653
But, there's one thing I can't figure out.

210
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:20,553
What one thing?

211
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:22,954
There's no doubt about anything anymore, is there?

212
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:32,053
Lying that he would pay cash,

213
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:36,253
Mr. Omi tells Mr. Hanzaki to come to Beimyoji at 8 pm last night.

214
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:40,753
Then, he lures Mr. Hanzaki into going down the steps together with him.

215
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:43,253
Hey, that's an ET!

216
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:44,953
What?

217
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:49,353
He makes Mr. Hanzaki witness the ET that he made Mr. Takedera act out.

218
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,153
Run for it, or he'll get you!

219
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:54,454
It's an ET! Help!

220
00:13:57,054 --> 00:13:58,853
He surprised him, got him to panic

221
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:02,153
and contrived it so that he would fall down the steps!

222
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:04,353
That would explain why that man called Hanzaki saw it

223
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:07,953
and thought it was an ET.

224
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:10,453
Because Mr. Omi, who was with him, said so.

225
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:15,753
In other words, this was a planned murder schemed by Mr. Omi,

226
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:20,053
who wanted to shut blackmailer, Mr. Hanzaki up for good.

227
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:21,654
But...

228
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:25,853
It's a gamble whether he would panic or not.

229
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:28,353
Or rather, do you think that an adult would be surprised over

230
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:30,453
such a dorky character to begin with?

231
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,253
-True. -Right.

232
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:35,353
But, it's probably true that he was surprised too.

233
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:36,553
Because he screamed.

234
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:39,653
That's the part I don't understand.

235
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:42,453
There's no reason why he'd be surprised, and yet...

236
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:45,354
That's where I sense Mr. Omi's undesirable intention.

237
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,453
I'd never be able to understand something as difficult as that.

238
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:54,153
-Genta! -Genta!

239
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:56,153
Are you all right?

240
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:57,954
"Beika Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic"

241
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:01,354
"Medicine"

242
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:09,553
Maybe.

243
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:11,853
"Beika Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic"

244
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:13,853
Bull's eye!

245
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:16,453
Now we can corner the perpetrator.

246
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,753
He left the concrete evidence behind for us too.

247
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,753
But only if his next door neighbor told us about it,

248
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:26,953
we would've figured out how the perpetrator did it even faster.

249
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:30,753
I'm sure he knew, right? About Mr. Hanzaki.

250
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:31,754
I don't think so,

251
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:35,853
because they didn't say that he screamed even on the news.

252
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:40,153
But when I borrowed the restroom at his house, I told him, you know.

253
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:44,054
In a loud voice, "It's an ET! Help!"

254
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:49,453
So, I'm sure that back then he already realized something wasn't right.

255
00:15:49,454 --> 00:15:50,654
This is bad!

256
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,653
I don't know what the heck you're talking about.

257
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:59,354
Okay, then I'll just go tell the police about it.

258
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:05,553
Don't.

259
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:07,653
Cut it out, stupid!

260
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,453
People will think that you came back to the crime scene

261
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:12,854
and fell off the steps by accident, the stupid perpetrator!

262
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:21,853
We won't let you do anymore than you already did!

263
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:25,053
You realized that this was a homicide when you heard my story, right?

264
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:28,753
And, you followed us to get an idea of who the perpetrator was...

265
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,253
You tried to blackmail him, right?

266
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:33,953
I'm unemployed so I just got the urge.

267
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:36,553
And if you're almost killed just because of that, it's not worth it.

268
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:39,053
You're right.

269
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:41,553
What did you guys want with me?

270
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:43,153
Omi?

271
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:44,753
Why are you here?

272
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,553
I was called by these children of the Youth Detective Squad.

273
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,053
The Detective Squad?

274
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:53,453
You were acquainted with Mr. Hanzaki, who died, right?

275
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:54,753
You worked together, didn't you?

276
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:57,453
Is that right?

277
00:16:57,454 --> 00:17:00,153
Mr. Omi who was being blackmailed by Mr. Hanzaki

278
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:02,253
succeeded in shutting him up.

279
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,354
What?

280
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,953
Excuse me?

281
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:09,453
As proof of that he even tried to kill me, who found out about it.

282
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:10,454
What?

283
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:14,053
I was just trying to give him a taste of his own medicine

284
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:16,253
because he was being unreasonable.

285
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:17,853
There's no way I would seriously try to kill him, right?

286
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:20,453
You were dead serious! You think so too, right?

287
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:22,253
Be quiet, will you?

288
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:23,853
You were saved after all,

289
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:25,753
so why don't you scoot off to a doctor or something already?

290
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,254
You're right.

291
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:36,853
He died last night of an accident. Right?

292
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:39,253
Because he was surprised by my ET disguise.

293
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:42,653
The women who witnessed it together also testified to it.

294
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,453
But Mr. Takedera...

295
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:49,653
Nobody would think that you in that outfit would be a real ET.

296
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:52,353
So long as you don't say so yourself.

297
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:55,453
"We are ET".

298
00:17:55,454 --> 00:18:00,154
But, Mr. Hanzaki couldn't have heard your voice from here.

299
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,553
There are only four people in this world

300
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:05,653
who could identify that as an ET.

301
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:08,053
Mr. Takedera who acted it out,

302
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,553
the two who were nearby and heard him identify himself

303
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:15,053
and Mr. Omi who was the one who suggested it to begin with.

304
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:18,953
But, it can't be helped because that man called Hanzaki also thought so.

305
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:20,453
That's why he was surprised and screamed.

306
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:22,553
That doesn't work out.

307
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:24,953
Your reasoning is reckless.

308
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:27,853
Nobody but the person himself would know how he feels at seeing something.

309
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:31,053
Mr. Hanzaki had a sore throat.

310
00:18:31,054 --> 00:18:32,753
A while ago, the next door neighbor

311
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:34,953
as well as Mr. Hanzaki himself

312
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:38,053
thought that he had a cold at first

313
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,053
but it turned out that because he used his throat too much.

314
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:42,753
He had acute chorditis.

315
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,753
He wasn't even able to talk normally.

316
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:48,453
There's no way he could've screamed!

317
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:51,153
Then, what was that scream that we heard?

318
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:55,553
That would be the man who knew that Mr. Takedera was acting as the ET,

319
00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:58,953
as well as the one who was here together with Mr. Hanzaki.

320
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:02,454
Mr. Akira Omi! None other than you, right?

321
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:05,654
You...

322
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:11,654
Last night Mr. Omi called Mr. Hanzaki out here.

323
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:24,254
You passed him out and then waited for Mr. Takedera to act out the ET.

324
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:30,053
It's an ET!

325
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:33,454
It's an ET! Help!

326
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,954
You pushed Mr. Hanzaki down and killed him.

327
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:44,554
By making it look as if he was surprised by the ET and fell by accident.

328
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,753
It was not good just to make it look as if he fell and died,

329
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:54,853
because that may call upon a thorough investigation for murder.

330
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:57,453
In order to make it look like an accidental fall,

331
00:19:57,454 --> 00:20:02,253
you needed Mr. Takedera and the other witnesses to testify for you.

332
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:04,553
Isn't that right, Mr. Omi?

333
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:06,954
Omi, don't tell me that you...

334
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:13,153
They're just imagining things.

335
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:17,353
You know how imaginative children can be, don't you?

336
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:20,554
It seems you don't know anything about the concrete evidence.

337
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:26,053
The women who encounter Mr. Takedera last night

338
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:28,553
took a video of the scene back then.

339
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:32,453
If we do a voice analysis of the scream,

340
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:35,854
it'll be easy to tell whose voice it was.

341
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:43,254
I didn't know he had vocal chord problems.

342
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:45,253
I like the money too,

343
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:49,653
but please work it out so that I can go back to the factory, Mr. Omi.

344
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:53,353
That hateful hoarse voice...

345
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:56,953
I thought it was an act to scare me.

346
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,153
Then, don't tell me that you, Omi...

347
00:20:58,154 --> 00:20:59,654
You did it, after all.

348
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:05,653
Hanzaki, who knew me, saw me when I was tempted to shoplift

349
00:21:05,654 --> 00:21:08,753
and went through with it, at a convenience store.

350
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:11,453
For I, who work at the great Sanko Heavy Industries,

351
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:14,853
just merely shoplifting means I could be in serious trouble.

352
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:17,753
Just when I was thinking of how to shut him up,

353
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,353
you came to discuss your problem over with me.

354
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:21,453
So I came upon the idea.

355
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,853
This guy who was satisfied just working for a third rate company

356
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:26,253
and was still seriously taking on kids.

357
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:28,253
What a happy-go-lucky idiot.

358
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:31,053
That's why I decided to take advantage of you.

359
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:33,353
What do you mean by "Happy-go-lucky idiot"?

360
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:36,953
He also said mere shoplifting.

361
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:39,753
Why don't you tell him, Tsuburaya?

362
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:42,453
Yes. Mr. Akira Omi!

363
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:45,054
You're a hopeless adult.

364
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:13,753
We are ET.

365
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:17,053
Really, you don't look at all like an ET.

366
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:19,153
You think so.

367
00:23:19,154 --> 00:23:22,353
Real ET look more awesome, don't they?

368
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:23,853
Yep.

369
00:23:23,854 --> 00:23:26,853
I mean, if they exist, that is...

370
00:23:26,854 --> 00:23:28,053
Yes, that's true.

371
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:29,853
They're more good looking them him.

372
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:31,853
-I'm sure. -Yes...

373
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:33,554
-Yeah. -Right?

374
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:41,254
Would an ET call himself an ET?

375
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:49,753
"Next Episode" -She said that the movers would be coming to get her things.

376
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:53,353
They took all her things with them.

377
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:56,353
I'm Detective Mouri.

378
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:57,853
A detective?

379
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:02,353
I'd like to ask you something about Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi.

380
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:07,253
Terakado was having a tough time with that person called Kawaguchi.

381
00:24:07,254 --> 00:24:09,454
I've figured it out, all of it!

382
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:15,354
