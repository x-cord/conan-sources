1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:03,374
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,074
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:06,974
A murder is committed using the illusion that is the talk of the town!

4
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:09,574
A mystery on stage. A double trick mystery!

5
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:10,974
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:12,574
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:14,475
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:57,038
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show."

9
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:59,015
This looks amazing, doesn't it?

10
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,258
The sign looks like a haunted house

11
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,058
which you really like!

12
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:06,758
What? No way, Conan!

13
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,258
Well, Genyo Fuyuki's magic show is unlike Sanada Kazumi's cheerful one.

14
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,758
It is known for having a dark feel to it.

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,158
Why would Mr. Fuyuki want to see you immediately, Dad?

16
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,758
Anyway, let's go and see.

17
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,659
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show."

18
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,658
"Trick Versus Magic (Part 1)"

19
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:35,358
"Genyo Fuyuki."

20
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,658
Yes. Please come in.

21
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,059
Excuse me.

22
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,558
Hello, Mr. Mouri.

23
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,458
Please forgive me for having a renown detective like you.

24
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,458
"Genyo Fuyuki (35)" -come all the way here.

25
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,358
I'm Fuyuki.

26
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,058
I'm Mouri.

27
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,658
She's my daughter.

28
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:53,358
Hello. I'm Ran Mouri.

29
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,658
And this is the freeloader Conan.

30
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,658
Freeloader?

31
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,358
Talk about rude.

32
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:00,758
Hello.

33
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,258
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:05,958
When I told them that you called, they insisted on coming along

35
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,358
and wouldn't take no for an answer.

36
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,858
That's perfectly okay.

37
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:10,858
Do you both like magic?

38
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,958
Yes, I love it!

39
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,858
We often go to see magic shows, too.

40
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,259
But those were only little demonstrations.

41
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,959
Okay then.

42
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,959
You can see the trick by changing the base angle.

43
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,459
Fantastic!

44
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,359
Well, I guess he's got technique.

45
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,658
By the way,

46
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,558
I asked you to come here, Mr. Mouri,

47
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:12,359
because there is someone in this troupe that is after my life.

48
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,358
I would like you to figure out who it is, Mr. Mouri.

49
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,358
Were you blackmailed or something?

50
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,458
Recently, twice when I was rehearsing,

51
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,558
equipment came falling from above and I barely made it.

52
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,858
If it only happened once, I would've thought it was just a coincidence.

53
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,858
But when it happened consecutively...

54
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:35,058
Was anybody near you at that time?

55
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,158
No. I was alone.

56
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,958
How many troupe members are there other than you, Mr. Fuyuki?

57
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,759
Hey, just what are you doing asking questions?

58
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,858
I'm sorry. And how many are there?

59
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:49,659
There are five of us besides me.

60
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,758
First, my assistant Misa Uehara.

61
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,858
"Misa Uehara (26)" -She's my ex-girlfriend

62
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:04,358
that I one-sidedly broke my marriage engagement with three years ago.

63
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,358
She still has a grudge against what I did.

64
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,358
One-sidedly?

65
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,558
Yes.

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,358
And likewise, another assistant Chiaki Nakagawa.

67
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:17,158
"Chiaki Nakagawa (24)" -She is my ex-wife that I divorced by consent.

68
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:21,558
However, she hates me to this day for my repeated extra-marital affairs.

69
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:25,558
And next is Kazuma Ishida, who is in charge of filming videos.

70
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,458
"Kazuma Ishida (19)" -He's my disciple

71
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,258
and I'm making him take videos deliberately so that he can study magic.

72
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,658
In charge of taking videos?

73
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,658
He has the talent for becoming a magician

74
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,458
on top of being an obedient nice boy.

75
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,658
He's the only one I trust.

76
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,458
Beside him is the stage director, Mr. Shingo Shoji.

77
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,258
"Shingo Shoji (37)" -He used to once be my disciple,

78
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,858
but he lacked talent as a magician, so I hired him as our stage director.

79
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:53,258
He does not agree with me with my stage performance,

80
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,858
so I'm thinking of having him quit after the performance today.

81
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:57,558
You mean you're firing him?

82
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,058
That's right.

83
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,058
The last one is the crane operator, Minoru Hasegawa.

84
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:05,358
"Minoru Hasegawa (45)" -He loves to gamble and he owes me a lot of money.

85
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:08,259
So if I die, all his debts will be gone.

86
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,958
In other words, those who have the motive to come after my life...

87
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,758
Are four people leaving aside Mr. Kazuma Ishida.

88
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,359
Yes, that's right.

89
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,558
Mr. Mouri.

90
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,758
Yes?

91
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,258
Here.

92
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,258
These are tickets for tonight's show.

93
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,858
Oh, I see.

94
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:31,558
I don't think anything will happen during the performance,

95
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,658
but I will be doing life endangering magic, too.

96
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,658
Let's decide what the signal will be in case of emergency.

97
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,058
Signal?

98
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,958
When I show you this signal,

99
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,758
please come up on stage even if I'm still performing and save me.

100
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,758
But why don't you just cancel the performance?

101
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,558
I can't do that.

102
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,259
I have pride as a professional magician.

103
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,058
Okay.

104
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:02,858
I'll do the best I can as a professional detective, too.

105
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,258
Please do that

106
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,958
and please make sure that none of the members find out about this.

107
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,359
I understand.

108
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:13,658
There's still some time before the show starts.

109
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,359
Why don't you guys go somewhere till...

110
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,559
What's the matter, Ran?

111
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:23,759
Ran, I bet that you're disappointed about Mr. Fuyuki, right?

112
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:29,858
Well, him saying things like he broke his marriage engagement one-sidedly,

113
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:32,358
or he got divorced because of his repeated extra-marital affairs.

114
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,458
He says it like it means nothing.

115
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,758
Well, a lot of things happen in the adult world.

116
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,159
Just like you and Mrs. Kisaki.

117
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,459
Conan!

118
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,058
-That hurts... -You keep your mouth shut!

119
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,958
I've got to work.

120
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,059
So you guys can go somewhere and kill the time! Understand?

121
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,759
Conan, are you all right?

122
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,958
Huh?

123
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,658
If something were to happen during the show,

124
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:04,359
it would be when the magic trick is performed.

125
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,958
What are you doing here?

126
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,558
So this is how it is.

127
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,858
Hey, you!

128
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,658
Hey, stop ignoring me!

129
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,658
-Somebody is coming. -What?

130
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,958
This is not good. Let's hide, Conan.

131
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,758
-This side! -Okay!

132
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,858
Lie down on this. I'll put the lid on for you.

133
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,159
Okay, will do!

134
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,358
Hey, Conan.

135
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,558
Don't tell me that this is the beauty slicing box?

136
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,458
Don't worry.

137
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,858
Your body parts will be connected again.

138
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,758
No! That's not the point.

139
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,558
-Put your feet inside! -Yes!

140
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,559
Quiet. Somebody's coming.

141
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,058
Is Kogoro Mouri a detective?

142
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,458
Yeah, I think he hired him.

143
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,058
I heard him on the phone.

144
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:51,758
Hey, who do you think dropped it?

145
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,858
Beats me.

146
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:55,658
But if you plan on doing anything, you've got to use your head a bit more.

147
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:56,858
True.

148
00:08:56,859 --> 00:09:00,559
If both of us work together, it'll be easy and unfailing.

149
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,658
Hey!

150
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,658
Cut out that stupid talk!

151
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,958
It's true that the troupe leader has a personality flaw,

152
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,958
but we're making a living

153
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,558
thanks to him.

154
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,258
Yes. We've got to be grateful to him.

155
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,758
Just what are you talking about?

156
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,458
The only reason why you're sticking up for him

157
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,959
is because you're borrowing money from him, right?

158
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,858
Shut up.

159
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:25,258
Even you, Kazuma.

160
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,858
I know that deep down inside you hate him

161
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:32,458
because he won't let you be on stage as a magician yet.

162
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,558
I don't hate him or anything.

163
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,058
Then, let's go.

164
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,458
Yeah.

165
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:40,858
I don't care what you're doing, but why don't you at least shave?

166
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,459
You look like a vagabond.

167
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,659
Please wait!

168
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,959
Just who do you think you are?

169
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:58,959
Darn it!

170
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,759
Are you okay, Pops?

171
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,159
Of course I'm not okay.

172
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,958
What a bummer.

173
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,058
Pops, to do that magic,

174
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:16,458
you're supposed to lie on your back and hold your knees with your hands.

175
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:19,759
What? Lie on my back and hold my knees with my hands?

176
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,758
Then, you'll be okay even if the box were cut into two, right?

177
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,458
I see.

178
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:32,758
Now we know that all the troupe members have a motive to kill Mr. Fuyuki.

179
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,458
I've got to be very careful in handling this case.

180
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,758
All right!

181
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,159
Did you check what kind of trick was used for the magic?

182
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:42,158
I couldn't tell even if I did check.

183
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,258
Come on, let's go!

184
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,459
Oh, I see.

185
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:54,259
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show."

186
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,258
Ladies and gentlemen,

187
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,258
thank you for coming to "Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show".

188
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,158
Please enjoy the magical world of mysterious illusion tonight

189
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,459
to your heart's content!

190
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,459
It seems that she is enjoying herself.

191
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,159
Oh, no.

192
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,559
Oh, no.

193
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,359
Impossible!

194
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,859
I'm glad.

195
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,058
Fantastic, isn't it, Dad?

196
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,058
Yeah, he's indeed a master of knife throwing.

197
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,558
All Mr. Fuyuki is doing is pretending to throw knives.

198
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,658
What?

199
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:43,158
But the knives really poked in.

200
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,858
It only looks that way

201
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,358
by using a special trick.

202
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,258
I saw them do it a while ago,

203
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:51,059
at the warehouse backstage.

204
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,658
While I was hiding together with Pops.

205
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,259
Dad?

206
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,759
Look! The next one is about to start.

207
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,758
Those needles are real.

208
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,959
You don't have a chance if you're skewered with something like that.

209
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,358
That belt is just fixed on using magic tape.

210
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,158
After he is covered with the curtains,

211
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,059
he escapes to the small space besides the table.

212
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,558
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

213
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,758
What?

214
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,959
It looked that way to me, too!

215
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,059
Wait!

216
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:07,693
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

217
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:08,793
What?

218
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:10,193
It looked that way to me, too!

219
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:11,294
Wait!

220
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:20,494
Mr. Fuyuki!

221
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:23,194
Conan!

222
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:30,494
Mr. Fuyuki!

223
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:49,893
Well, well.

224
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:53,694
Aren't you the famed detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

225
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:58,793
And? Did something happen?

226
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:00,293
No, well...

227
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,893
It seems that Mr. Mouri

228
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:07,293
has ran up here thinking that these two beauties here have killed me.

229
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:09,193
But please don't worry,

230
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:12,593
because as you can see, I am alive.

231
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:14,194
It seems so.

232
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,293
But I have to be on guard,

233
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:23,993
because there's more life risking magic during the second half of the show.

234
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:26,293
I'm counting on you.

235
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:27,894
Well, sure.

236
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:30,194
Ladies and gentlemen,

237
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:32,893
please give Mr. Mouri a big hand!

238
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:34,894
Thank you, thank you.

239
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:39,893
"Genyo Fuyuki" -I am so sorry for the trouble.

240
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:43,893
I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of my signal,

241
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:46,093
so I decided to try it out.

242
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:48,793
There are things you should and should not do.

243
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:51,493
Thanks to you, I've been greatly embarrassed.

244
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:55,993
I'm sorry, but what I said on stage is true.

245
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:58,394
There will be danger on the start of the second half show.

246
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:02,993
Fuyuki, what was that magic all about?

247
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,593
Nothing in my stage directing plans

248
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:07,993
call for such screaming and blood splattering out.

249
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,593
I thought that up.

250
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:14,194
Thanks to that, I was able to deceive a famed detective, right?

251
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,893
That's a different story.

252
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:22,193
I thought you were taken by a demon or something.

253
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:23,593
Kazuma.

254
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:24,694
Yes, sir.

255
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:33,193
From now on,

256
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:36,393
I will not only perform a flamboyant or elegant stage,

257
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:40,193
but rather an even more exciting stage performance.

258
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,293
Yes, that's what I'll do.

259
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,393
Okay, suit yourself.

260
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:46,893
Your performance is not exciting,

261
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:48,294
but just grotesque!

262
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:54,794
I'm sorry for the unpleasant confrontation.

263
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:01,694
Do you want anything?

264
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:05,894
It's nothing.

265
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:22,793
I wonder where Conan is?

266
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:25,493
He hasn't come back from the restroom.

267
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:26,693
Never mind him.

268
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:29,493
Keep your eyes on Mr. Fuyuki though.

269
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:32,294
For some reason, I have a strange feeling about this.

270
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:39,894
From here, I can immediately see if something goes wrong.

271
00:18:56,794 --> 00:18:59,793
Sonny, you shouldn't be watching from here.

272
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:01,993
Go back to your seat.

273
00:19:01,994 --> 00:19:03,693
But...

274
00:19:03,694 --> 00:19:04,993
Now.

275
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,294
All right.

276
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,894
Dad.

277
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,793
No, that's his performance.

278
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:00,094
He's not giving any signal.

279
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:32,293
Hey, it's taking too long.

280
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:35,593
Don't worry, it's that kind of magic.

281
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:36,993
I think.

282
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:38,993
When the curtain goes up again,

283
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:41,694
Mr. Fuyuki should be standing on top of the aquarium.

284
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:00,094
What the...

285
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:05,194
Shoots!

286
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:07,394
Shoots!

287
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:19,593
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

288
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:20,793
Just what are you doing?

289
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,594
Hurry and unlock the lid!

290
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:28,293
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

291
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:30,394
Hasegawa, pull up the lid!

292
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:43,493
Did something happen?

293
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:44,693
The ambulance!

294
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:46,693
-Call the ambulance! -Yes, sir!

295
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:51,293
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

296
00:21:51,294 --> 00:21:53,893
-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

297
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:55,294
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

298
00:21:58,094 --> 00:22:00,494
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

299
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:10,793
Leader...

300
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:12,493
-Mr. Fuyuki... -Leader!

301
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:13,994
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

302
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,093
Mr. Fuyuki!

303
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:18,093
-Leader! -Get a hold of yourself, Fuyuki!

"Next Episode" -It doesn't matter if it's for investigation purposes,

306
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:03,194
we can't reveal how the magic is performed.

307
00:24:04,494 --> 00:24:07,893
Well...

308
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:10,793
We can't tell you from our side.

309
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:13,094
Try to remember that magic.

310
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:18,893
This latch...

311
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:20,193
I got it.

312
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:21,394

In the next episode, the trick is revealed!

317

Is it murder or is it magic?

I'm not telling you.
