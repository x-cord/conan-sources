It's so cute!

"Kyoichi Kusumi (50)" -Please push the remote control button.

4
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:11,472
Okay.

5
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,372
Amazing!

6
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:21,572
Let me.

7
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:22,673
Let me try!

Suspicious person identified...

Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

10

He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

11
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:49,672
A super high-tech factory downtown.

12
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:52,072
Deduction challenges cutting edge technology.

13
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:53,772
He sees through the one and only truth.

14

I'm sorry.

18

It's a robot to be used by women as a self defense.

19
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,272
This is the research lab.

20
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,473
I see.

21
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:04,273
Mouse!

22
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:08,873
It's fast.

23
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:16,173
Please don't!

"Takeshi Tanizaki (45)" -It's my robot.

25

What?

26
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:24,372
I'm sorry about that.

27
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,872
But... Why?

28
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,372
"Fumika Horiuchi (32)" -You can say that again.

29
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:31,372

"Kazuomi Isshiki (25)" -I think he wants to surprise girls.

31

What?

32
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,572
Why do we have to use our company's high technology skills

33
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,572
to make such prank item?

34
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:48,472
A bad one at it too.

35
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:51,172
Right?

36
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,672
I'm sorry, president.

37
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:55,572
I've got something urgent to talk to you about.

38
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:57,372
That's a problem.

39
00:03:57,373 --> 00:03:59,272
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri,

40
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,672
I'll be right back, so please wait for me.

41
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:04,372
-Hello? -I understand.

42
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:06,372
Tonight?

43
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:08,372
I can't make it tonight.

44
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,973
Can we postpone it?

45
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:14,072
Sure.

46
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:16,972
You're not making fun of me anymore after today.

47
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,873
Just wait and see.

"Kusumi Machinery"

49
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,272
No way.

50
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:28,872
Isn't there something you can do?

51
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:33,272
I already told you not to get too involved in online auctions.

52
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,073
No advance payment of salary for you anymore.

53

What's with you acting so big shot?

54
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:47,972
This company should just go bankrupt.

"President's Office"

56
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,472
I'm sorry I asked to come along.

57
00:04:51,473 --> 00:04:53,472
If Mr. Mouri, who is famous, came by himself,

58
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,072
people would get suspicious.

59
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:56,772
No problem.

60
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:59,072
And, what do you think?

61
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:02,772
Who looks most suspicious at this point?

62
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:05,773
I think it's Mr. Tanizaki.

63
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,572
Tanizaki?

64
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:13,072
Actually before coming here,

65
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:15,172
I tried checking on Myojo Technics

66
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,972
since they're under suspicion of information leaks

67
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:19,173
and...

68
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:24,772
Darn it.

69
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,572
I felt sorry for him since he was laid off

70
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:30,872
and this is what I get.

71
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,872
I should just turn him into the police.

72
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:35,773
Even if you do, he's just going to play dumb.

73
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:38,772
Then, what should I do?

74
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:41,772
It's best to catch him red-handed.

75
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:44,972
Genuine parts were stolen, correct?

76
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,272
Yes.

77
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:49,272
But I wonder how he took it?

78
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:52,172
There's a metal detector at the doorway,

79
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,572
and since it's a precision device,

80
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:56,272
it'll break if thrown out the window.

81
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,072
What if the first floor window were used?

82
00:05:58,073 --> 00:06:00,472
There's no window on the first floor.

83
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:03,573
Direct sunlight is bad for precision devices.

84
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:18,172
Why are you dressed like that?

85
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:20,272
Like they say, if you want to hide a leaf,

86
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:22,872
hide it in the woods.

87
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:27,372
We can keep an eye on both the entrance and the stairs from here.

88
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:29,872
But, why tonight?

89
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,372
It seems they're going to have an important presentation

90
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:33,872
at the other company.

91
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:37,673
Things are stolen routinely on the night before.

92
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:42,673
What is it?

93
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:47,072
I guess something just fell.

94
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,872
Okay, I guess we'll start heading home then.

95
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:50,873
Okay.

96
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:52,072
What?

97
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:53,472
What's the matter?

98
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,073
Don't you smell gas?

99
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:02,873
Gas is leaking!

100
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:08,572
It won't open?

101
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:11,072
I think it's locked from the inside.

102
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:12,572
Mr. Mouri?

103
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:13,972
Do you have a spare key?

104
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,372
Spare key?

105
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:18,472
It's an internal lock so a locksmith has to be called.

106
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:20,473
We don't have time for that.

107
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:32,072
Everyone, what's wrong?

108
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:33,872
Please break the door down.

109
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:35,473
All right!

110
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:04,472
Isshiki, turn off the main gas switch.

111
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,172
Horiuchi, call the ambulance.

112
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,173
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

113
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:11,372
The gas pipe is broken.

114
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,273
I'll go close off the main gas power switch.

115
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:16,273
How is he?

116
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:20,073
Call the police.

117
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:22,973
All right.

118
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:59,372
The victim, Mr. Tanizaki, died of suffocation.

119
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,472
Suffocation, not gas poisoning?

120
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:06,172
Yes, strangulation marks were found on his neck.

121
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:08,172
He must've really struggled.

122
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,072
There were rope marks on the palm of his hands too.

123
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:14,672
On the other hand, in the bushes below the window,

124
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:18,672
a rope about 30 m was found.

125
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:20,772
Although we're waiting for forensic results,

126
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:24,472
it is thought to be the murder weapon.

127
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:28,472
There were other wounds such as bleeding from the back of his head too.

128
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:30,972
Which means he was murdered?

129
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:32,372
Yes.

130
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,772
I heard something fall

131
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,772
just before the gas leak alarm went off.

132
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:39,872
You all heard it too, didn't you?

133
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:40,972
Yes.

134
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:42,272
We heard it.

135
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:45,072
Judging from the shoe prints on the floor and the broke gas pipe,

136
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:48,473
there seems to have been a violent struggle.

137
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:55,372
By the way, we found this among Mr. Tanizaki's belongings.

138
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:57,173
Do you know what it is?

139
00:09:58,373 --> 00:09:59,472
It's the parts of a new robot

140
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,972
that we are currently in process of developing at our company.

141
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,672
To steal...

142
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:06,272
No.

143
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,572
Rather it is more to help steal.

144
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:12,272
Just what do you mean?

145
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:16,372
The door was locked from the inside,

146
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:18,372
and a person from the outside was invited in.

147
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:20,872
I think that's what it was.

148
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:24,872
But trouble came up and Mr. Tanizaki was murdered.

149
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:28,172
He's a traitor so it serves his right.

150
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,972
And who is this person from outside?

151
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,572
A man called Makita.

152
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:37,272
He works at Myojo Technics.

153
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:38,672
Check on it, will you?

154
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:39,773
Yes, sir.

155
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:46,672
Just in case, please tell me where you were on when it happened?

156
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:49,772
I was in the president's room on the third floor.

157
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:52,872
I was in the research lab on this floor.

158
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:55,772
I went home at the usual time,

159
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:59,572
but forgot something and came back.

160
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:04,672
Didn't you see any suspicious people on your way back here?

161
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:07,772
No, I didn't.

162
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:10,972
You mean the perpetrator came in from outside?

163
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:13,872
The door was locked from the inside.

164
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,372
But, the window was unlocked.

165
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:18,972
We may be able

166
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:23,672
to solve this case faster than expected.

167
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,572
Just as expected of you, Mouri!

168
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:28,473
I hope so.

169
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,573
That's the crime scene?

170
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,373
The president's room.

171
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:00,673
What's this?

172
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,173
It's not just a plain soiled thing.

173
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:10,072
This is...

174
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:12,473
Come to think of it...

175
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:19,673
It's my robot.

176
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,272
You're not making fun of me anymore after today.

177
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:26,273
Just wait and see.

178
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:45,673
"Robot Mouse"

179
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,872
I see.

180
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:49,373
So, that's the story.

181
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:53,673
"Spare Prototype Components"

182
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:02,301
What?

183
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:04,002
Mr. Makita is innocent?

184
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,701
According to Officer Takagi's report,

185
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:10,801
Makita is assigned to the general affairs division

186
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,901
that has nothing to do with technological development.

187
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:16,001
But even the general affairs division wants information, don't they?

188
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:18,201
Moreover, he also seems to have an alibi.

189
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:19,202
What?

190
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:21,702
As for the alibi...

191
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:25,202
Hey!

192
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:26,801
Mouri?

193
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:29,701
Inspector, the mysteries been solved.

194
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:31,801
Please call everyone over here.

195
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:34,402
Okay!

196
00:13:37,002 --> 00:13:39,001
Mr. Mouri!

197
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:41,901
You've figured out who the perpetrator is?

198
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:42,902
Yes.

199
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:45,701
You've figured out who the killer is, right?

200
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,001
Because you just said a while ago,

201
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:50,001
that the one who leaked information was Tanizaki.

202
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:52,801
Actually, it wasn't so.

203
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:53,901
What?

204
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:55,601
On the contrary,

205
00:13:55,602 --> 00:14:00,201
Mr. Tanizaki was trying to catch the information leaker with his own hands.

206
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:01,601
What did you say?

207
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:07,502
Mr. Tanizaki's mouse robot was actually a security equipment.

208
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:09,902
No way!

209
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,902
What?

210
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:19,901
This was indeed a well-made robot,

211
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:23,101
that it could recognize the perpetrator with its sensor.

212
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:24,901
That's impossible!

213
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:28,001
No AI could possibly recognize a perpetrator.

214
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,901
She's right. This is no time for jokes.

215
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:32,902
It sure can, though.

216
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:51,001
You're the perpetrator, aren't you?

217
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:52,602
Mr. Kazuomi Isshiki.

218
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:55,301
Ridiculous.

219
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:58,501
Mr. Mouri, you operated the mouse, didn't you?

220
00:14:58,502 --> 00:15:00,501
No, I didn't.

221
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:04,001
The sensor on the robot reacted to a certain thing

222
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:06,301
that is stuck to your shoe.

223
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:09,901
What's on my shoe?

224
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:13,302
That ink on the tip of your shoe!

225
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:16,302
I'm back.

226
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,702
What seems to be the matter?

227
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:30,401
Mr. Isshiki, didn't you notice?

228
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:32,801
That the same thing happened to you

229
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:35,301
when you snuck into the room.

230
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,801
I got this at home.

231
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:43,301
Did you have the special ink that reacts to the sensor at home?

232
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:45,801
Mr. Tanizaki thought it out

233
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:48,302
so that the perpetrator wouldn't be able to get away with it.

234
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:53,901
Okay. I confess.

235
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:56,301
I'm the one who stole information.

236
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:59,101
Is the person that you gave the information

237
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:01,301
that you stole Mr. Makita of the general affairs division

238
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:02,901
at Myojo Technics?

239
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:07,101
No. I gave it to Hiraguchi of the development section.

240
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:08,901
This was for the money.

241
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,001
For him, it was to get promoted.

242
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:13,601
So, who was Tanizaki seeing?

243
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:15,101
According to Mr. Makita,

244
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:18,501
he was asked when the next presentation would be held.

245
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:21,501
He wanted to know in order to trap the perpetrator

246
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,801
who leaked the information.

247
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:27,801
That's why I told him to postpone it

248
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:30,201
and yet...

249
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:31,501
Darn it!

250
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:33,901
But, I didn't kill him.

251
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:36,301
We got into a struggle and I hit his head.

252
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:38,401
But, I didn't strangle him.

253
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:39,801
It's true.

254
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:41,601
Then who did?

255
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:44,201
One of the two, who are over there, right?

256
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:45,301
What?

257
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:46,901
I was outside.

258
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,701
If it were someone from outside, I would've seen the perpetrator flee.

259
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:51,501
But I didn't see anybody.

260
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,501
That doesn't make us the perpetrator, though.

261
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:57,201
She hated Tanizaki.

262
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:59,801
Just because I didn't like him, it doesn't mean that I would kill him.

263
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:01,801
Then, it's the president.

264
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:05,201
He thought that Tanizaki was the one who leaked information

265
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:07,601
and figured he was betrayed. Therefore, he killed him.

266
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:09,901
I'd never do such a thing.

267
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:14,501
At any rate, Mr. Mouri, please tell us who the killer is.

268
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:15,901
Sure.

269
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:20,101
I will explain what happened in chronological order.

270
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:22,201
Mr. Isshiki, before leaving the company,

271
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:25,201
you hid the parts in this room.

272
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:29,402
You chose this room because nobody usually uses it.

273
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,401
In order to make it possible to come in from outside,

274
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,401
you unlocked the window.

275
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:38,401
Next you got ready the rope that you would hang outside.

276
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:40,901
Where was the rope hooked onto?

277
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:44,501
There is nowhere he could've hooked the rope onto on the outside fence.

278
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:47,101
So, he hooked it on inside the room.

279
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,201
On the gas pipe.

280
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:50,201
What?

281
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,601
He wound the rope around under the gas pipe,

282
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:54,101
and then he pulled the to edges of the rope

283
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:55,601
through the space in the ventilation fan

284
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:57,101
right above the hot water heater

285
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:59,501
and made the rope hang outside.

286
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:03,301
That's why he needed a 30 m rope.

287
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:06,501
This way, after everything is completed,

288
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,601
he can retrieve the rope from below

289
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,901
by just pulling it.

290
00:18:11,902 --> 00:18:13,601
There would be no evidence left behind

291
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:16,401
and he could steal repeatedly.

292
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:19,501
So after all preparations has been completed,

293
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:22,401
Mr. Isshiki leaves the company once.

294
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,101
Then after he sneaks back to the company again,

295
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,901
he hides below the window and wait.

296
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,301
When the time is right,

297
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:31,201
he climbs up the wall,

298
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:35,202
and enters through the window.

299
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,201
Mr. Isshiki didn't notice the robot

300
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:44,802
because he was surprised by something.

301
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:49,402
It was, Mr. Tanazaki, who was in the room.

302
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,501
Mr. Tanizaki, who realized that you'd come in to steal

303
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:56,401
because the presentation is tomorrow,

304
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,501
found the parts that you had hidden

305
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:01,201
and was waiting for you in hiding.

306
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:03,101
He locked the door from inside

307
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:05,601
so that the perpetrator couldn't flee.

308
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,401
Then Mr. Tanizaki and Mr. Isshiki got into a struggle.

309
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:11,301
Mr. Tanizaki, who was struck,

310
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:14,201
bled from the back of his head.

311
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:17,101
Mr. Isshiki, who was flustered,

312
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,502
fled the room.

313
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,901
At this time,

314
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:26,301
the gas pipe that supported the rope repeatedly,

315
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,102
finally gave out.

316
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,502
Mr. Isshiki almost fell.

317
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:40,202
But, he miraculously made it through safely.

318
00:19:41,902 --> 00:19:44,501
Mr. Isshiki who made it to the ground,

319
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:47,701
pulled the rope towards himself

320
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,702
and into the thicket where he hid it.

321
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:55,501
You decided to go back to the company

322
00:19:55,502 --> 00:20:00,001
because you were worried about Mr. Tanizaki, who you strucked.

323
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:01,701
Exactly.

324
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,502
But, I had no idea that a murderer was in the company.

325
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:09,301
What kind of trick was used?

326
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:11,701
What was the murder weapon?

327
00:20:11,702 --> 00:20:13,501
Mr. Isshiki.

328
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:15,101
What is it?

329
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:19,801
Didn't you think of what prevented you from falling?

330
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,401
What do you mean?

331
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,401
You didn't fall

332
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:26,502
because Mr. Tanizaki grabbed the rope.

333
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,801
But unable to endure the weight,

334
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:42,702
the rope got stuck on Mr. Tanizaki's neck.

335
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,002
And he was suspended into the air.

336
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:51,601
That's a lie!

337
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:55,501
I'm sorry but it's true.

338
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,301
The footprints on the floor.

339
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:58,701
The hot water heater

340
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:01,701
and the rust that was found on Mr. Tanizaki's back,

341
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,101
as well as the blood that was found on the ventilation fan

342
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:05,902
is evidence.

343
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:12,501
Mr. Isshiki, Mr. Tanizaki lost his life

344
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:14,902
because of the series of crimes you committed.

345
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,601
Please forgive me!

346
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:26,802
Forgive me!

347
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:30,102
Forgive me!

348
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:12,702
It doesn't look like a robot at all.

349
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:18,102
It even feels real.

350
00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:27,001
Then, the one on my head is...

351
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:28,702
Stupid.

352
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:33,201
Just who are you calling stupid?

353
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:36,302
I'm the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri, you know?

354
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,202
Then why can't you tell the difference?

355
00:23:42,702 --> 00:23:45,201
"Next Episode" -Yeah, you got a bump...

356
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:49,001
I'm going to get that guy and turn him in to the police.

357
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,001
Of course we'll help.

358
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:53,401
It hurts...

359
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:55,301
Darn it.

360
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:58,002
How'd I get here?

361
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:01,501
You don't even remember your name?

362
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:04,401
No, not at all...

363
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,702
Don't tell me he's the robber on the run?

364
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:12,702
