1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,155
There.

2
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:09,054
-Hey. -Genta, you're supposed to kick it into the goal.

3
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,854
Sorry. I'll go get it.

4
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:13,054
Are you okay?

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,355
I can't keep going...

6
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:20,355
Huh? Is no one home?

7
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:27,154
Doc, you're a mess.

8
00:00:27,155 --> 00:00:31,854
We're going to resume playing as soon as Genta comes back.

9
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:35,854
Don't you think he's taking a while to get the ball?

10
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:38,455
He's probably having trouble finding it.

11
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:42,454
That voice...

12
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:43,955
Was that Genta?

13
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:49,054
Genta, are you okay?

14
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:50,055
What happened?

15
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,055
That...

16
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,854
This is...

17
00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:59,654
Is he...

18
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:00,854
Hey!

19
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,554
You guys...

20
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:04,454
Good. You're all right.

21
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:05,855
Hold on.

22
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,954
Doc, call an ambulance.

23
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,854
Someone inside has collapsed.

24
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:13,855
What?

25
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:17,454
I don't think anyone's there.

26
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:20,154
I rang the doorbell earlier.

27
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,455
Then we'll have to break a window.

28
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:27,254
What's all this noise?

29
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,354
What?

30
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,555
Wait, son.

31
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:45,654
Son.

32
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,354
What?

33
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:48,854
Well?

34
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:53,154
Doc, call the police, not an ambulance.

35
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,854
You mean...

36
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:59,154
Yeah. They're both probably dead.

37
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:00,455
Both?

38
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:07,454
When the countdown reaches zero,

39
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,955
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

40
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:14,254
The police are called to a wealthy man's study!

41
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,154
What happened to the two collapsed figures?

42
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:17,654
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:19,554
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,855
His name is Detective Conan.

45
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:05,418
"Result of the Draw"

46
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:10,717
There are two victims.

47
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:13,017
The large man

48
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:16,417
"Shinzo Kawai (55)" -is Shinzo Kawai, the resident of this home.

49
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:18,817
He was stabbed in the stomach,

50
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,517
but the cause of death

51
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:24,117
is blood loss from the ice pick in his chest.

52
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:27,517
The weapon was an object kept in this room.

53
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:32,217
The smaller man on the floor is Kensuke Shibata.

54
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:36,117
"Kensuke Shibata (38)" -His cause of death is a head injury.

55
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:38,017
There's not much blood,

56
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:44,417
but he most likely struck his head on the armrest of the sofa.

57
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:50,617
Also, the blood on Shibata's sweater matched Kawai's.

58
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:54,417
The blood must've gotten on him when he stabbed him.

59
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:57,417
When did they die?

60
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,817
About two hours ago.

61
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:03,817
The bodies were discovered about an hour ago.

62
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:05,217
I see.

63
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:08,917
And they're the ones who found the body.

64
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:10,117
Also,

65
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:15,017
they're the president and former employee of a real estate company.

66
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:16,217
Several months ago,

67
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:21,817
Shibata was fired for embezzling company funds.

68
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:23,917
Money troubles, huh?

69
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:25,717
Who is she?

70
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:28,217
Kawai's wife, Yuko.

71
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:30,317
She was sleeping in the second floor bedroom

72
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:33,317
"Yuko Kawai (48)" -when the incident occurred.

73
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:35,017
Sleeping?

74
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:38,517
This room shows signs of a struggle.

75
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:41,017
It must've made a lot of noise.

76
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:44,517
Yes. I asked her about that.

77
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:48,717
She said she'd been looking after her mother all morning,

78
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:51,417
and was too exhausted to notice.

79
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,018
The bedroom's far away from this room.

80
00:05:57,218 --> 00:06:01,717
Ma'am, I'm sorry to question you when your husband's dead.

81
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:02,917
Yes?

82
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:08,317
Had your husband arranged to meet Shibata here?

83
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:11,817
Yes. Today was his repayment date.

84
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:13,917
Repayment date?

85
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,417
Shibata was using the money he embezzled

86
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,917
to pay for his sick family's hospital bills.

87
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:24,017
My husband agreed to rehire him

88
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:28,217
if he returned the money by today.

89
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,417
I see.

90
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:33,417
So that's why Shibata came.

91
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,217
By the way, do you know how much he owed?

92
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:40,618
I believe it was about a million yen.

93
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:47,717
Conan, you can't just enter the crime scene.

94
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:49,517
Sorry.

95
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:51,417
Unbelievable.

96
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:54,517
Huh? You have a foot injury.

97
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:56,617
Oh, this?

98
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:59,717
I sprained it the other day.

99
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:03,617
You went to care for your mother with an injury?

100
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:05,517
That must've been difficult.

101
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:10,417
My mother's in far worse shape than I am.

102
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:12,717
This is nothing.

103
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:15,917
She seems tired.

104
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,317
Maybe she's not getting much sleep.

105
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:22,017
Her foot's injured, and her husband's dead.

106
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,517
I feel bad for her.

107
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:26,817
Caring for her mother must be hard.

108
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:29,317
If I'd been awake...

109
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,717
If I'd noticed something was wrong,

110
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,117
this wouldn't have happened to my husband.

111
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:36,018
It's my fault.

112
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:42,317
By the way, you weren't answering the door even though we kept calling.

113
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:44,218
Did the sound of the intercom wake you?

114
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:52,317
No. That large boy's scream woke me.

115
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:54,017
Large boy?

116
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:56,417
The biggest boy.

117
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:58,217
Genta.

118
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:01,317
And the intercom's not working right now.

119
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:03,217
It doesn't always work.

120
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:04,518
Sorry.

121
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,518
Hey, Conan.

122
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:11,617
Let's step outside.

123
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,118
Let's go, Conan.

124
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:23,317
Shibata didn't embezzle the money to pay for hospital bills.

125
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:25,917
How do you know that?

126
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,917
The sweater he was wearing was from a pretty high-end brand.

127
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,317
If he was strapped for cash, he couldn't have bought that.

128
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:38,317
Really? It didn't look expensive to me.

129
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:43,017
You don't know much about fashion, Mr. Detective.

130
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,218
Sorry about that.

131
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:47,517
This bag was on the sofa.

132
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,417
There was money inside.

133
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:52,617
She said Shibata owed a million yen.

134
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:55,017
That looks like the right amount.

135
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,517
So he raised the money.

136
00:08:57,518 --> 00:09:01,418
In that case, why did they get into a fight?

137
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:04,717
Hello?

138
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,417
I see.

139
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:08,817
Yeah, got it.

140
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:09,917
What is it?

141
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:12,817
According to the employees of Kawai Real Estate,

142
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:18,717
Kawai said he didn't intend to rehire Shibata.

143
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:21,718
It was just an excuse to make him return the money.

144
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:28,117
So he failed to fulfill his promise after the money was returned.

145
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:30,317
If that was the reason,

146
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:33,117
then Shibata became hostile,

147
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:36,518
grabbed a weapon from the desk...

148
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,818
And murdered Shinzo.

149
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:48,017
Looks like she wasn't lying about the intercom not working.

150
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:49,018
Yeah.

151
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:52,317
There you are.

152
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:56,317
Let's go back to the park and keep playing.

153
00:09:56,318 --> 00:10:00,017
Genta, make sure you aim for the goal this time.

154
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:01,818
I know!

155
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,017
What do you think?

156
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,217
About what?

157
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:07,617
The case.

158
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:09,217
At first glance,

159
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:14,717
it seems like one man was stabbed and immediately pushed the other.

160
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:17,618
The other suffered fatal injuries...

161
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,517
and died.

162
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:24,117
Doesn't that explain it?

163
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:26,017
Well, yeah.

164
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:27,917
You don't sound like you believe it.

165
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,917
What is it then? Did you notice anything strange?

166
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,417
No, not really.

167
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:36,617
Like you said, I think that's probably what happened.

168
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:40,018
Then why not let the police handle the rest?

169
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,717
Conan!

170
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:45,418
Let's go!

171
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:49,117
Genta, do you have a cold?

172
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:53,117
No. I think I hurt my throat when I screamed earlier.

173
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,217
I was so surprised.

174
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:58,317
We suddenly heard a weird voice.

175
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:01,217
Was my scream that weird?

176
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:04,017
Based on the direction it came from,

177
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:08,017
we knew immediately that it was you.

178
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:09,818
The direction of the scream?

179
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:14,118
Based on the circumstances, it could only have been Genta.

180
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:16,518
Wait a minute.

181
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:20,017
Sorry. You guys go on without me.

182
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:22,317
What? Why?

183
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:26,617
Doc has something he hasn't told the police.

184
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,017
Right, Doc?

185
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:31,517
What? I don't remember saying that.

186
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:34,617
Well...

187
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:35,618
That's right.

188
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:39,418
I completely forgot to tell them that.

189
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:47,718
Come on. Let's go.

190
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:56,117
What is it, Shinichi?

191
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:58,717
Is there something bothering you?

192
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,717
Yeah. I don't think this case is as simple as we think.

193
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:05,217
Really?

194
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:06,817
You saved me though.

195
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:10,017
Now, I don't have to exercise in the park.

196
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:11,318
Seriously?

197
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:18,217
So we should assume Shibata was pushed forcefully and fell,

198
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:22,417
and not that he slipped and hit his head.

199
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:26,917
The room's windows and the front door were locked.

200
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:30,017
It seems unlikely that they were killed by an outsider.

201
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:34,217
Were you able to confirm what the wife said?

202
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:37,617
Yes. She's telling the truth about her foot injury

203
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:39,317
and caring for her mother.

204
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:40,517
I see.

205
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,717
Even if she was awake,

206
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:48,317
it's hard to imagine an injured woman could have pushed Shibata.

207
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:50,717
He might be right.

208
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:53,217
But what is it?

209
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:55,617
Something's bothering me.

210
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:59,317
Shinichi, how'd you hurt your hand?

211
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,318
Huh?

212
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:05,718
I probably hit the door too hard when we came here.

213
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:14,617
Inspector, we found this button in a potted plant on the shelf.

214
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:17,417
It's Shibata's.

215
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:18,517
I see.

216
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:23,618
His button must have flown off during their tussle.

217
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:29,017
The sweater he was wearing was from a pretty high-end brand.

218
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,218
The biggest boy.

219
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:46,417
Hey, Conan!

220
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:49,917
Sorry. I dropped something.

221
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:52,218
But it's not here.

222
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:54,817
Come on.

223
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:57,117
You can't just enter a crime scene.

224
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:58,617
Do something about him.

225
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,417
This isn't a playground.

226
00:14:01,418 --> 00:14:04,118
Sorry.

227
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:08,917
There you go again.

228
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:10,517
I can't help it.

229
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:12,917
Anyway, that was a bold move.

230
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,117
I nearly missed it.

231
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:16,817
What do you mean?

232
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,917
I finally figured out the truth

233
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:23,918
about this case that was hidden behind the veil.

234
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,567
They're so late.

235
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:34,967
Inspector, can we safely assume

236
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:40,267
they killed each other after getting into a fight over money troubles?

237
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:44,267
I think so.

238
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:45,567
Yuko.

239
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,367
We'd like to ask you more questions

240
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,267
about their relationship and the case.

241
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,367
Could you come with us to the station?

242
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:53,368
Yes.

243
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:55,167
Hold on.

244
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,667
Agasa, what is it?

245
00:14:57,668 --> 00:15:02,967
I thought I'd give you an accurate version of the events.

246
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:08,467
What? But we just investigated the case and concluded that...

247
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:14,567
Don't you realize there's no way Shibata could have killed Kawai?

248
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:16,567
Couldn't have killed him?

249
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:17,867
What do you mean?

250
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:22,267
It should be obvious when you consider the difference in their height.

251
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:23,868
Difference in height?

252
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:28,667
Kawai was 185 centimeters.

253
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:30,867
Shibata was 160 centimeters.

254
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:33,767
They do have contrasting builds.

255
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,367
That's it.

256
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,567
If the smaller Shibata

257
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:42,467
tried to stab the much taller Kawai in the chest,

258
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:46,267
he would use a reverse grip.

259
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:50,368
Wouldn't the blood end up on his pinkie finger?

260
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,167
There are other things that don't make sense.

261
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:56,567
Like what?

262
00:15:56,568 --> 00:16:00,367
Like Shibata's button.

263
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:02,767
Conan told me

264
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:05,367
he saw that Shibata's third button was missing

265
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:09,467
when he looked under his sweater.

266
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,767
Even if the button came off in the struggle,

267
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:15,967
it's hard to believe an unexposed button

268
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:20,167
could have ended up inside the pot on the shelf.

269
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:22,567
You're right.

270
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:25,467
And there's one more thing.

271
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:30,967
Yuko, you were in this room until we arrived, weren't you?

272
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:34,167
No. I was in the second floor bedroom.

273
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:37,967
Then how did you know it was Genta who screamed?

274
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:41,768
The second floor doesn't have windows facing the yard.

275
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:47,967
You couldn't have known which child screamed just from the sound.

276
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:50,167
But you knew.

277
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:56,167
That's because you were watching Genta from this room when he screamed.

278
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:58,367
It's the only explanation.

279
00:16:58,368 --> 00:17:00,467
Am I wrong?

280
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:02,067
I...

281
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,467
The ice pick and the blood on his hand.

282
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:07,567
The button in the potted plant.

283
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,267
And at the time, this house was locked.

284
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:13,667
When you put it all together,

285
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:16,167
the only person who could have killed Shinzo

286
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,967
was the person who was inside the house at the time.

287
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:22,567
It's you, Yuko.

288
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:23,867
What?

289
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:26,567
But how did she stab him?

290
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:31,967
She's not very tall, and her foot's injured.

291
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,467
What if Kawai had been stabbed in the stomach by Shibata

292
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:37,867
and was sitting in a chair?

293
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:43,667
A woman with a foot injury could stab a badly injured victim.

294
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:46,367
Then it could have been Shibata

295
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:50,267
who stabbed my seated husband, not me.

296
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:55,067
That doesn't explain how Shibata fell and died.

297
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:57,767
It's hard to imagine he pushed him hard enough

298
00:17:57,768 --> 00:18:02,667
to kill him from a seated position.

299
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:08,267
Shibata was most likely dead when you looked in the room.

300
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:12,867
I don't know what happened between you two then,

301
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:16,267
but you decided to kill him, grabbed the ice pick,

302
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:19,367
and finished off your gravely wounded husband.

303
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:20,867
Am I wrong?

304
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:23,867
You're making it all up!

305
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:26,767
I knew about the scream

306
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:30,767
because I overhead Genta telling the police about it!

307
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,867
There's no proof I did it.

308
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:34,868
Stop acting like I did.

309
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:38,167
It's the button.

310
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:39,367
The button?

311
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,067
What does that prove?

312
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:45,767
Are you saying I picked it up and put it in the pot?

313
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:50,967
No. The button flew into the pot while they were fighting.

314
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:55,968
But you panicked and didn't notice it had fallen off.

315
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,767
I didn't notice?

316
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:01,967
What are you talking about?

317
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:03,367
Hold on.

318
00:19:03,368 --> 00:19:06,367
If the button came off while they were fighting,

319
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:09,467
how did it get into the pot?

320
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:11,467
The answer's simple.

321
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:15,768
Shibata wasn't wearing a sweater.

322
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:25,567
Yuko, the sweater he was wearing belongs to you, doesn't it?

323
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:27,967
What do you mean?

324
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:34,667
Not knowing what to do with your bloody clothes,

325
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:40,467
you realized Shibata was about the same height as you.

326
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:43,367
To make it look like he'd done it,

327
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:45,767
you put your clothes on him.

328
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:50,467
Fortunately, it was a color that a man might wear.

329
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:56,567
It may have been missed if they were assumed to have killed each other,

330
00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:58,367
but a quick investigation

331
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:01,768
should reveal if you were wearing the sweater.

332
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:10,567
Yuko Kawai, can we ask you again what happened?

333
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:12,268
It was what he said.

334
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,168
Darling!

335
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:28,867
Shibata thought he'd be able to return to work

336
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:31,867
if he apologized and returned the money.

337
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:35,168
What? But isn't that what you promised?

338
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,967
His family in the hospital died.

339
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:43,567
Shibata and his family got what was coming to them.

340
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:44,967
That's awful!

341
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:46,267
Don't just stand there!

342
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:48,067
Call an ambulance!

343
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,567
You said you'd handle it!

344
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:53,467
You told me not to worry!

345
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:55,267
Shut up!

346
00:20:55,268 --> 00:21:00,467
This happened because you took sympathy on that trash!

347
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:05,268
Both of you are wasting money on helping useless old people!

348
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,468
What?

349
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:13,968
What are you doing?

350
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:25,367
I'd put up with my arrogant husband for so long.

351
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:29,667
But his callous words

352
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,968
brought me to my senses.

353
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:38,168
I even tried to frame Shibata.

354
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:06,367
Conan, you're late!

355
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:07,867
Sorry.

356
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:09,967
We only got to play a little soccer

357
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,367
to help Doc lose weight.

358
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:13,867
It's too bad.

359
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:14,967
I know.

360
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:18,367
Next time, let's start in the morning, for the Doc's sake.

361
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:20,867
But I'm fine.

362
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,867
I'm so excited.

363
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:23,967
Right, Doc?

364
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,867
But I'm not...

365
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:27,067
That's great.

366
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:29,567
Now, you'll lose weight soon.

367
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:34,767
I should help by restricting your portion sizes.

368
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:37,168
You've got the wrong idea.

369
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:41,368
Good luck, Doc.

371
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,667
What? No way!

372
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:50,067
The Prince of Beer?

373
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:52,267
What's that symbol?

374
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:53,567
Oh, this?

375
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:57,567
"Masked Comet Byun" -It's the symbol of Masked Comet Byun.

376
00:23:57,568 --> 00:23:58,868
It was...

377
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:02,467
pretty cool.

378
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,668
No!

379
00:24:07,368 --> 00:24:12,668
