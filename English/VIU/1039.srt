1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,900
We barely made it to the last train.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,300
But I have the day off tomorrow, so it's fine.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,500
Lucky you.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,900
I have to start early tomorrow morning.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,600
The wind is kind of strong tonight.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,300
Watch out for the step underneath.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,700
Thanks for your hard work.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,400
The wind is strong tonight, isn't it?

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,300
What the heck is this?

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,100
It's a bit unsettling.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,200
There's going to be a jack-o'-lantern competition

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,400
in the shopping district on Halloween.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,300
Look at that.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,400
I see.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,100
-What's wrong? -It looked like...

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,500
What's that?

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,400
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,500
unravelling mysteries that come before sleep!

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,100
A paranormal occurrence on Halloween!

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,800
What is the truth behind the jack-o'-lanterns in the sky?

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,400
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,200
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,500
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,900
"The Jack-O'-Lantern In The Sky"

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
"Cafe Poirot. We are open in the afternoon."

26
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm sorry, but we're only open in the afternoon today.

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Huh?

28
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, it's you, Conan.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,100
Both Uncle Kogoro and Ran are out,

30
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,400
and they told me to stay here.

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
It's all right. Come on in.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Here's your usual seat.

33
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
You'll have milk tea, right?

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,200
Yes. Thank you.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,900
Are those pumpkins for Halloween?

36
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,900
I knew you'd figure it out, Conan.

37
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,600
That's right. I asked a farmer I know

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,900
to get them for the holiday.

39
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,800
Here you go.

40
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,300
Now that you're all warmed up by the milk tea,

41
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,800
can you help me out?

42
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,900
Halloween is originally a religious festival

43
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,100
celebrated by the ancient Celtic people, isn't it?

44
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,000
The thirty-first of October was their harvest festival,

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
and it is said that the ghosts of ancestors

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,300
and evil spirits come on that day.

47
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,200
Previously, they used turnips to drive away evil spirits.

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,400
And when the tradition came to America,

49
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,700
it was changed to pumpkins

50
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,400
because they were more easily available, right?

51
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Here. I'm all done.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,900
Thank you.

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,200
Conan, you sure know a lot about Halloween.

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,300
It was on television a while ago.

55
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,900
In that case, I'm sure you know that

56
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,700
these pumpkins are called jack-o'-lanterns.

57
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,700
A man named Jack who only did bad things

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,100
made a deal with the Devil so that he wouldn't go to Hell

59
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,100
no matter how many times he died.

60
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,800
When Jack died, Heaven wouldn't accept him

61
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,500
because he did so many bad things in his life.

62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,600
And because he had his deal with the Devil,

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,700
he couldn't go to Hell either.

64
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,300
So Jack didn't have a choice but to wander this world

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,800
while holding a lantern that the Devil gave him.

66
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,700
Did you know, Conan?

67
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,800
There were jack-o'-lantern ghosts in the area last night.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
What?

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah!

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,600
-Look! What's that? -What?

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
What is that?

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,100
"Jack-O'-Lantern Ghosts!" -It's scary.

73
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,200
Aren't they jack-o'-lanterns?

74
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,600
There were quite a few people

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,400
who saw them in the middle of the night.

76
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,500
They're easier to make than I thought.

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,300
Maybe I shouldn't have closed the shop this morning.

78
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,600
Come to think of it, where's Mr. Amuro?

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,900
He called me a few days ago,

80
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,100
telling me that he'd like to take some time off.

81
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,100
How could he just leave the shop for me to manage alone?

82
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,900
I almost want to put a collar on him

83
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,500
to make sure he actually manages the shop.

84
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,400
Hey, Conan.

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,400
You seem to get along well with Amuro.

86
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,500
Yes.

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,400
Is something the matter?

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,800
Is Amuro... you know...

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,000
Azusa, something terrible has happened!

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,500
Calm down, Ms. Tamie.

91
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,800
They've been stolen.

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,700
"Cafe Poirot. We are closed today."

93
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,900
Here you go.

94
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,200
These three are our regular customers.

95
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
This is Ms. Tamie.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
She's a nursery school teacher

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,900
"Tamie Kohno (50)" -who was hospitalised for half a year

98
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,100
and she was only discharged last week.

99
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,800
I'll be returning to the nursery school next week.

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,200
I just can't wait to see the children's smiles once again.

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,100
Did you all know each other from coming here?

102
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,700
"Tomomi Kashiyama (29), homemaker" -No.

103
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,400
We just happen to live next to each other in our neighbourhood.

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,500
"Satoshi Mizunuma (60)" -Our houses are all in the same row,

105
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
so we got along with each other.

106
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,400
The three of us thought we could carve jack-o'-lanterns together

107
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
and submit them for the shopping district's competition.

108
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,600
So I asked Azusa if we could have three of the pumpkins she got.

109
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,400
And they were stolen.

110
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,300
That's right. Yesterday afternoon,

111
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,900
just after we got the pumpkins,

112
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,900
we gathered at my house to carve the jack-o'-lanterns.

113
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,000
Tomomi and I are first-timers,

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
so we asked Tamie to teach us.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,900
Ms. Tamie is well-known for winning

116
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,500
the jack-o'-lantern competition three years in a row.

117
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
So, the incident was that your jack-o'-lantern was stolen.

118
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
It wasn't just my jack-o'-lantern that was stolen.

119
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,900
Even the others' were stolen as well.

120
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,100
I'd understand if Tamie's pumpkin was the only one that was stolen.

121
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
But mine and Tomomi's jack-o'-lanterns being stolen

122
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,700
isn't a good thing by any means.

123
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,500
I feel it's a prank made in poor taste.

124
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,100
I would always take the jack-o'-lantern

125
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,400
that won the competition to the nursery school.

126
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,500
The children would be so delighted to see it.

127
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,300
I was happy to make it out of the hospital in time

128
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,500
to carve the jack-o'-lantern this year.

129
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,400
There were three stolen jack-o'-lanterns.

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,200
If I recall, there were three ghosts spotted nearby, too.

131
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,900
I've also heard about it.

132
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
Jack-o'-lantern ghosts appeared last night, right?

133
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,800
Ghosts?

134
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Are they even real?

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,400
Jack couldn't go to Heaven or Hell,

136
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,100
so he wandered the world

137
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
while holding a lantern given to him by the Devil...

138
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,600
Conan?

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,100
And he has continued to wander the world to this day.

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,300
Miss Azusa, let's investigate.

141
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,200
This is Ms. Tamie's house.

142
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,100
The house on our right is Tomomi's,

143
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,200
and the one on our left is Mr. Mizunuma's house.

144
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,300
I live with my husband and daughter.

145
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,700
My daughter goes to Ms. Tamie's nursery school.

146
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,900
She's looking forward to seeing you again, Ms. Tamie.

147
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,500
I'm also looking forward to it.

148
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,200
I was a university professor,

149
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,500
but I reached retirement age last year.

150
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
My wife died two years ago,

151
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
and my only son lives at his company's staff housing.

152
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm living a relaxed life by myself.

153
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,200
Where did you place your jack-o'-lanterns

154
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,800
before they were stolen?

155
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I put mine on top of my gatepost.

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,300
Mine was also on the gatepost that led to the entrance.

157
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,300
My jack-o'-lantern was on top of a table in front of the entryway.

158
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,700
When was the last time you saw your jack-o'-lanterns last night?

159
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,200
I saw it at 10 p.m. last night

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,000
when I locked the front gate and entered the house.

161
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,200
My husband came home after 8 p.m. last night.

162
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,500
That was when I saw it.

163
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,200
I went to bed with my daughter after that.

164
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,700
Last night, my son suddenly came with some of his co-workers.

165
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,000
I saw it when I invited them inside.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm quite sure it was before 7 p.m.

167
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,300
After that, I spent the entire night awake.

168
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,600
My son's co-workers went back just a little while ago.

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,900
So, the jack-o'-lanterns were definitely

170
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,300
still there until 10 p.m. last night

171
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,200
when Ms. Tamie went out to lock her front gate.

172
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,800
I wonder how the culprit got away with all the jack-o'-lanterns.

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,300
I'm sure it would be hard to carry three large pumpkins at once.

174
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
Maybe he or she used a car.

175
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
That wouldn't have been possible.

176
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,900
There were gas pipe works at that corner yesterday.

177
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,200
I saw a notice saying that

178
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,700
cars won't be able to go through after 10 p.m.

179
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,200
In that case, would the culprit have used a bicycle or motorcycle?

180
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,500
No, I didn't hear any motorcycles passing through yesterday.

181
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,000
But didn't we have strong winds last night?

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,500
The wind was rumbling so much that it scared me.

183
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,000
Even the jack-o'-lantern competition poster was blown away.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,100
Do you think we can find the culprit

185
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,500
if we could watch the footage from that camera over there?

186
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,000
You're right. Let's ask the owner if we could.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm sorry. I'm starting to feel a little tired.

188
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,800
Ms. Tamie, are you all right?

189
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,700
You mustn't force yourself.

191
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,600
It's better to take a rest for now.

192
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,900
I'll stay with Ms. Tamie.

193
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,500
The rest of us can go there together.

194
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Yes, let's go.

195
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,700
"Masashi Kokubo (35), Jack-O'-Lantern Competition Committee Member"

196
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,900
All right. You can watch it now.

197
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,400
Someone graffitied my fence recently,

198
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
so I had the camera installed.

199
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,900
Could you show us footage from after 10 p.m. last night?

200
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,600
Here you go.

201
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Have a look.

202
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,600
A few people were passing by.

203
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,100
People walk here from the train station, after all.

204
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,700
Now everyone looks like they could be suspicious.

205
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
You would need a large bag or something

206
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,800
to hide the three jack-o'-lanterns.

207
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
But I didn't see anyone carrying such a thing.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
Rewind the footage a little!

209
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,400
Sure.

210
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
It's them.

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,900
That's Kajiyama and Kuwano.

212
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,200
They live in the apartment building over there.

213
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
They look like they're running away from something.

214
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
It's like they're in a panic.

215
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Last night...

216
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,000
I was so shocked.

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,700
Was it because of the jack-o'-lantern ghosts?

218
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,800
That's right. I was walking with my co-worker Kuwano

219
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
when they appeared all of a sudden.

220
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,100
How many jack-o'-lantern ghosts were there?

221
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,200
What? Three of them, I guess?

222
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Yes, there were three of them.

223
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,300
Where did the ghosts come from, and where did they go?

224
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,400
Actually... That was all I remember.

225
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,300
I drank quite a bit last night.

226
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,200
Where's the co-worker who was with you?

227
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,500
He's at work today.

228
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,200
I talked to him on the phone this morning,

229
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,800
but he said he didn't remember anything from last night.

230
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,200
While you were running from the ghosts,

231
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,900
did you see any of the jack-o'-lanterns

232
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
that were in front of those houses?

233
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,500
Sorry, I just can't recall.

234
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,200
We still don't know the truth

235
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
behind the jack-o'-lanterns in the sky.

236
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
It seems so.

237
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,000
That's...

238
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,600
The wind is strong today,

239
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,500
so hold on tight or you'll lose your balloon.

240
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,600
-Thank you! -Thank you very much.

241
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Hello, Mr. Kokubo.

242
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,200
It's you guys. Have you met with Kajiyama?

243
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,300
Where can I get that balloon?

244
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,800
Oh, that?

245
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,300
We give them out to people who shop in the shopping district.

246
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,700
They're pretty popular.

247
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,900
We quickly ran out of the stock we had for yesterday.

248
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,400
And you're the one who prepared the balloons?

249
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,900
I'm on the committee for this year's jack-o'-lantern competition.

250
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,400
I've been hard at work putting up posters

251
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,700
and preparing the balloons.

252
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,800
I see.

253
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,800
I was putting up posters in the area last night,

254
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,200
so I didn't get home until it was late.

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,900
I thought about going around in my car to put them up,

256
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,900
but I couldn't go through one of the streets because of gas pipe works.

257
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,900
I had to walk to finish putting them up,

258
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,600
so I was pretty tired afterwards.

259
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Did you put up the poster in front of Ms. Tamie's house as well?

260
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,900
Yes, I did.

261
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,300
But if I recall, it wasn't there the next morning.

262
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,700
The wind probably blew it away somewhere.

263
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,100
And when did you put up those posters?

264
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,300
Between 10 and 11 p.m., I guess.

265
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Can I get one of those balloons?

266
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,000
As I said, they're really popular,

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,100
so we've run out of today's stock as well.

268
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,800
Do you mind coming back tomorrow to get one?

269
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,400
Where are the balloons you prepared?

270
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,600
In the car at my house.

271
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I see. So, that's how it is.

272
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I have some things to take care of for tomorrow.

273
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
See you again soon.

274
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,900
Miss Azusa and Mr. Mizunuma.

275
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,100
I've figured out the culprit behind the stolen jack-o'-lanterns.

276
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

277
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,900
Ms. Tamie isn't feeling well,

278
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,100
so I think she's still resting at home.

279
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,400
I see.

280
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,600
So, Conan, did you really figure out who the culprit was?

281
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Yes. The culprit really was after the jack-o'-lantern

282
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,200
carved by Ms. Tamie.

283
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,000
Isn't that right, Mr. Mizunuma?

284
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
What's the meaning of this, Conan?

285
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,400
Why would Mr. Mizunuma be after Ms. Tamie's jack-o'-lantern?

286
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,300
To be honest, I'm still not sure what the motive is,

287
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,900
but considering what happened before

288
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,600
and after the jack-o'-lanterns were stolen,

289
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,300
it's likely that Mr. Mizunuma is the culprit.

290
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,000
First, where did the culprit escape to?

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,100
The jack-o'-lanterns were stolen after 10 p.m.

292
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,600
If one were to head that way,

293
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
the people handling the gas pipe works

294
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,400
would have seen his or her face.

295
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,500
On the other hand, if he or she headed this way,

296
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,100
it would be picked up by Mr. Kokubo's security camera.

297
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,800
Next are the jack-o'-lanterns.

298
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Where would the culprit hide the three jack-o'-lanterns?

299
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,200
At first, Mr. Mizunuma would have planned

300
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,700
to hide them at his house.

301
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,100
You live alone, so it would've been easy to do so.

302
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,200
But something unexpected happened yesterday.

303
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Your son came home with his co-workers.

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,300
You would look suspicious carrying the jack-o'-lanterns inside.

305
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,000
That's why you had to find a new hiding place for them.

306
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,100
On the other side of Mr. Mizunuma's fence

307
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
is Mr. Kokubo's garage.

308
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,700
There were two cars in that garage,

309
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,500
and the jack-o'-lantern balloons are packed in them.

310
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,800
I see! They wouldn't be easily seen from the outside.

311
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,000
So, that's how it is.

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,700
The balloons in the cars would be given out the next day.

313
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,400
All there was to do was to wait for the right time,

314
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,200
take the jack-o'-lanterns out, and carry them home.

315
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Isn't that what you're thinking, Mr. Mizunuma?

316
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,500
But there was no way I could get over that fence!

317
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,300
You could do it as long as you have a foothold, right?

318
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,000
Like the table in your garden.

319
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,100
I could see someone's footsteps on it earlier.

320
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,800
You must have used that table to get over the fence.

321
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
Of course, the culprit could do it

322
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,200
if he or she wasn't holding anything, but boy...

323
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,600
Wasn't the culprit carrying three jack-o'-lanterns?

324
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
In that case, the culprit's hands must have been full,

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,400
and it would've been impossible for him or her to get over the fence.

326
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,500
But it would be possible if he or she had an accomplice.

327
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,900
That's right.

328
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,100
What?

329
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
If you asked Ms. Tomomi for help, then it would be possible.

330
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No... I didn't do anything.

331
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,600
What are you basing this on?

332
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,700
Ms. Tomomi, you said you fell asleep

333
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,900
after you put your daughter to bed at 8 p.m. last night,

334
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,700
but that was probably a lie. Isn't that right?

335
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,700
There was a poster for the jack-o'-lantern competition

336
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
on that utility pole,

337
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,700
but it was blown away by the wind.

338
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,500
Mr. Kokubo was the one who put them up.

339
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,000
The work on the gas pipe started at 10 p.m.

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,800
Mr. Kokubo put up the poster a little while after that.

341
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,200
But the poster was gone with the wind by morning.

342
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
If you had slept at 8 p.m., Ms. Tomomi,

343
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,800
there was no way you would see the poster

344
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,500
in front of Ms. Tamie's house.

345
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,700
In that case, how did you know that

346
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,800
there was a poster for the jack-o'-lantern competition?

347
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,900
It's likely that when Mr. Mizunuma took the pumpkins from you,

348
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,300
he took out three of the jack-o'-lantern balloons

349
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,300
from Mr. Kokubo's car

350
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,000
and swapped them with the three real jack-o'-lanterns.

351
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,900
And when Mr. Mizunuma stepped down from the fence,

352
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,600
a strong wind blew

353
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,700
and the balloons flew away.

354
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,900
I believe that's what Mr. Kajiyama and his co-worker saw

355
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,600
and though them to be jack-o'-lantern ghosts.

356
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,600
But why would you steal the jack-o'-lanterns?

357
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,300
All three of them, including your own.

358
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,800
It's probably because of that thing over there.

359
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,400
The surveillance camera?

360
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
They must have thought of the possibility

361
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,600
that the camera would be checked.

362
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
If it were only one pumpkin,

363
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,800
you can put it in a bag, right?

364
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,900
Could it be because they were trying to prevent

365
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,500
the people who were passing by from being suspected?

366
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,100
Mr. Mizunuma, you said that your son and his co-workers

367
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,800
left a little while ago.

368
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,900
So, are the jack-o'-lanterns still in Mr. Kokubo's car?

369
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,000
We're sorry.

370
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
It's just as you said.

371
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Mr. Mizunuma and I were the ones who hid the jack-o'-lanterns.

372
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,800
But we have reasons for doing that.

373
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,100
Could you tell us?

374
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
Coming.

375
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,700
Who is it?

376
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,000
Happy Halloween...

377
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,500
Surprise...

378
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,300
Oh, my... For me?

379
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,600
So, that's why you did it.

380
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,400
You've heard that Ms. Tamie's jack-o'-lanterns are very popular.

381
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,400
But since she was hospitalised this year,

382
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,200
we all thought that she wouldn't be able to carve one.

383
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,500
So, all the kids at the nursery school thought about

384
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,500
carving a jack-o'-lantern to present to her.

385
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,500
It so happens that Tamie was discharged early

386
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,300
and she was so fired up about carving one

387
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,500
that she even made Azusa promise her to give her a pumpkin.

388
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,800
We decided to hide them

389
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,900
so that the kids won't be disappointed.

390
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,700
I didn't think it would turn out like this.

391
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,800
We're ashamed of what we did!

392
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,600
We're sorry.

393
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Miss Azusa and I will take care of the jack-o'-lanterns you hid.

394
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,100
You can leave it to us.

395
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,000
We couldn't...

396
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,300
Sorry about that.

397
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,700
Please take care of it.

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm glad that this Halloween is a happy one.

399
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,400
The shopping district's Halloween jack-o'-lantern competition

400
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,200
was a success.

401
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,400
But around that time,

402
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,700
we were involved in a fearsome scheme that took place in Shibuya.
