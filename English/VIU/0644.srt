1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:02,864
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:06,064
-I'm here. -What?

3
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:07,464
Hey, Ran!

4
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:10,664
What do you mean you'll be sleeping over at school tonight?

5
00:00:10,664 --> 00:00:14,264
Sorry. The karate championship is drawing near,

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,264
so everyone's pumped up.

7
00:00:16,264 --> 00:00:18,364
Since there's no school tomorrow,

8
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:22,364
we decided to stay overnight and practice.

9
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:24,564
We just got permission from our teacher.

10
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:28,464
Hey, hey. What about our dinner?

11
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:30,664
I'm so hungry, I could collapse any minute.

12
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,364
Just go to Poirot downstairs.

13
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:34,964
Get your breakfast there too.

14
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:36,464
-Hey. Listen. -All right,

15
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:38,164
I'll be back at noon tomorrow.

16
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:40,164
So take care of Conan for me.

17
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:43,164
Wait.

18
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:50,264
So said to eat at Poirot for dinner.

19
00:00:50,264 --> 00:00:52,664
Guess we'll be having boxed meals

20
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:53,864
from a convenience store tonight.

21
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:57,464
Because today, Poirot is...

22
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,464
"We'll be closed from 4th to 5th due to circumstances. - Poirot's owner"

23
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:10,764
That's right, Poirot's owner.

24
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:12,764
He did say he'd invited the neighborhood association guys

25
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:15,264
to a hot spring trip today.

26
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:20,464
I know. There's that Iroha Zusi.

27
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:22,864
"Iroha Zusi"

28
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:25,864
"Closed today - Iroha Zusi"

29
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,664
And they're closed too?

30
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:29,964
Looks like he invited a lot of people.

31
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,664
Since there are a lot of shops with their lights off.

32
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,664
Oh, no.

33
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:42,264
Every single eatery in the neighborhood is blacked out.

34
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:46,264
As it is, there won't be food delivery tool.

35
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:48,064
Just in case, I bought the flyers

36
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:51,864
from all kinds of eating places that were in our mailbox.

37
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:54,064
Shall we try them?

38
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:56,264
Anything that looks good?

39
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,564
Specialty Pizza "Colossoo",

40
00:01:58,564 --> 00:02:00,564
Miso cutlet "Tsubouchi",

41
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:03,464
Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki "Kondo"...

42
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:05,864
None of which I'm in the mood for.

43
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:09,464
It's a bit of a distance,

44
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:11,164
but why don't we give this a try?

45
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:33,364
If all cases were men,

46
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,264
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

47
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:36,864
The good old style ramen shop,

48
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,664
I can feel something reeking around there.

49
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:40,364
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:42,264
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:44,464
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

52
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:13,551
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For (Part 1)"

53
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:14,951
"Delicious"

54
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,351
"Ramen"

55
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:17,751
"To Die For"

56
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:22,651
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

57
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:26,451
It's quite a venerable shop isn't it?

58
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:29,551
The picture on the flyer was a lot nicer, right?

59
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:31,651
Should we look for another shop?

60
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,051
Idiot.

61
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:36,951
This kind of unvarnished shop is what we call a "hidden gem",

62
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:39,251
it must be super tasty and well-loved.

63
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,251
Plus, on a cold day like this,

64
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:43,851
it's best to eat some ramen and warm up.

65
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:50,851
Darn it.

66
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,451
Guess you have a point.

67
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,351
Welcome.

68
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:01,851
It's cold.

69
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,151
-Chilly today, ain't it? -Yes.

70
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:10,651
And no other customers.

71
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:15,751
Sir, anywhere but that seat please.

72
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,851
It's the seat of one of our loyal customers.

73
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,251
"Katsumasa Ogura (49)" -Well, although he was a loyal customer,

74
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:23,751
he passed away last month.

75
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,851
It's just my desire to reserve the seat

76
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,151
in memory of him until the 49 days of mourning are up.

77
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,751
If you say so...

78
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,751
Sorry about that.

79
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,351
So that's why flowers have been left on the table.

80
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:43,951
A customer... Two even?

81
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:46,551
Guess I won our bet then, Sayo.

82
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,751
Geez.

83
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:50,751
"Sayo Ohasi (28)" -My part-time pay is low enough already.

84
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,851
Cut me loose once in a while.

85
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,951
Anyway, give our guests some water.

86
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:56,951
Fine.

87
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:01,751
What kind of bet were you talking about?

88
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,151
It's about whether the number of gusts today

89
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:06,251
would go into double digits or not.

90
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:11,451
Dinner time's almost over,

91
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,051
and we just finally helped them make it ten customers on the day?

92
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:16,551
May I take your orders please?

93
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,051
Any recommendations?

94
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,651
Your best bet is, our pride and joy,

95
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:24,051
that's so delicious it's to die for is "The Death Lord Ramen."

96
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,351
We do have the plain miso or

97
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,051
dipping ramen on the menu just in case.

98
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:30,751
But if you somehow want anything other than...

99
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:32,551
"The Death Lord Ramen."

100
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:34,451
We'll still serve you as you wish.

101
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:40,251
Well, then w'll try some of that Death Lord ramen.

102
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,651
Me too.

103
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,051
Two orders of the Death Lord ramen.

104
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:45,351
All right.

105
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,651
So cold.

106
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:56,351
It's a good thing

107
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,451
we chose ramen like pops suggested.

108
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,851
Scumbag, what are you doing here?

109
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:04,551
Screw off. We don't serve ramen to the likes of you.

110
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,751
What's with using that manner of speech to a customer?

111
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:13,051
"Tokumori Saizu (51)" -I made a special effort to come

112
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:15,051
to this seedy shop where business is so slow,

113
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:19,051
just to give you fine folks some much needed profit.

114
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,351
We're losing customers

115
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:24,451
only because those young jackasses from your place

116
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,951
are always causing trouble in my shop.

117
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:31,051
My bad, they're all brainless, energetic grunts.

118
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,851
But we should've already properly compensated you

119
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:36,651
for the tableware my boys broke.

120
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,751
That's not the problem!

121
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,251
Well, I did give these boys an earful.

122
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:45,151
Telling them they should've made sure

123
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,551
to seriously hurt the owner while they're at it.

124
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,351
The did you say?

125
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:53,051
I'm joking, joking.

126
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:55,351
All right, then...

127
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:57,051
That seat...

128
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:59,451
Oops, my bad.

129
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,451
I knocked it over.

130
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:02,851
Wipe it for me, will you?

131
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,251
You're the one who spilled it,

132
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,551
so wipe it up yourself.

133
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,051
My, what an insolent shop.

134
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:12,051
It's your fault for putting out shabby flowers

135
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:14,151
as decoration in a spot like this.

136
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:18,851
Your order?

137
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:22,251
If you're not ordering anything, please go home.

138
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,451
Immediately!

139
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:28,151
Then, I'll have that "so good it's die for" thing.

140
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:32,951
Well...

141
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:37,751
Have you made up your mind yet, master?

142
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,151
Well...

143
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,751
If you ask me, I won't sell this shop.

144
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,951
Since we and the Haido Shopping Street proprietors

145
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:45,951
have joined forces

146
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:49,551
and made an unwavering pact recently.

147
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:52,351
A great example of "ignorance is bliss".

148
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:56,351
Your own shop is being called the black sheep, you know?

149
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:57,551
What?

150
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:01,451
Before I came in here,

151
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,851
I got a haircut from Barber Taninaka next door, and...

152
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:07,451
The owner of that barbershop was complaining too.

153
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:09,951
He was saying he'd like for this beat up ramen shop

154
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,551
to be run out of this stylish shopping street

155
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,251
since it just didn't fit.

156
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,851
Is that for real?

157
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:20,451
My, spewing nonsense, are you?

158
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,951
I only said, "If he remodeled once in a while,

159
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:28,651
his business would've been more prosperous."

160
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,051
"Atsusi Taninaka (47)" -My shop and yours

161
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:33,451
opened on this shopping street at the same time twenty years ago.

162
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,451
My shop has remodeled three times already,

163
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:39,451
yet this place has been the same, right?

164
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,551
Yes.

165
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,251
I've been thinking about doing it,

166
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:46,451
but things are a bit tight over here.

167
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,551
I understand perfectly.

168
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:51,051
Instigating a falling out between friends

169
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:53,151
in order to wreck this shopping district

170
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,851
was Mr. Land Shark's aim all along.

171
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:00,551
I'll have the Death Lord ramen.

172
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:01,751
All right.

173
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:06,751
Here. Thanks for waiting.

174
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,051
Your Death Lord ramen.

175
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,151
What is this?

176
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,451
Bamboo shoots are piled sky high?

177
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:16,851
I see.

178
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,951
It's a pun on "Enma" (Death Lord) and "Menma" (Bamboo shoots).

179
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:22,851
Let's see... the chopsticks are...

180
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:26,951
Mister, could you pass those chopsticks?

181
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:30,051
Here you are.

182
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:31,351
Thanks.

183
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:34,251
Well, anyway, give it a try.

184
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,951
Yes.

185
00:10:36,951 --> 00:10:38,351
Okay, I'll get right to it.

186
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,651
Let's eat.

187
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,651
Here goes...

188
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,951
-So Good! -So Good!

189
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:08,051
-I've never tasted anything like this before. -Yes.

190
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:09,651
Right? Right?

191
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:12,351
These bamboo shoots are especially delicious.

192
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:13,751
Right, right.

193
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:16,751
The secret to its tastiness is in these bamboo shoots.

194
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:19,451
The recipe is a trade secret, of course.

195
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,051
You're right.

196
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,751
I could get used to this flavor all the time.

197
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,651
Thank you.

198
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:32,651
We should invite Ran, Dr Agasa and the others here next time.

199
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,351
A run-down shop with a top-notch taste?

200
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:40,451
Guess it won't be closing down anytime soon.

201
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:41,651
No.

202
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:44,551
Cheap, fast and tasty is our motto.

203
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:47,451
We're definitely going to keep on track.

204
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:49,951
Well, that's good to hear.

205
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:53,351
In contrast, my company is going down in flames.

206
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:56,151
It makes me feel as if I want to die.

207
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,451
Then, why don't you fold up your fishy business,

208
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,651
and start a new trade instead?

209
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:07,151
It's not that easy to make it in this world.

210
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:12,851
Mister, you're left-handed?

211
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:13,951
Yes.

212
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,551
But earlier you wiped up the water on the table using your right hand?

213
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,951
I was corrected by my parents when I was a kid,

214
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,851
so I'm ambidextrous.

215
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:27,551
But I still use my left hand whenever I eat,

216
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,551
or else I feel uncomfortable.

217
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:37,151
"Ramen so good it's die for"?

218
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:41,351
If only someone could die after eating this for my sake,

219
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:44,951
then this shop would go out of business immediately.

220
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:52,051
Why don't try poisoning this stuff?

221
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,051
Look here you.

222
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,351
I've been listening this whole time,

223
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,351
but you're just spewing bull shit and being disprespectful.

224
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,051
Darn.

225
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,251
Hey. Let's take it outside.

226
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:11,251
I'll give you a piece of my mind.

227
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:12,651
Sir!

228
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:21,351
Hey, are you even listening? Hey?

229
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:49,851
Call an ambulance!

230
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:52,551
Hurry, call an ambulance. Hurry!

231
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:53,551
Okay.

232
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,551
Screw him.

233
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,751
Idiot.

234
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,551
Do you think we're going to fall for that same trick, again?

235
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:04,651
What? Hold on, what are you saying?

236
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:07,151
I know this guy's game.

237
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:09,151
But he's just faking a collapse in my shop

238
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,551
to raise a big fuss about having gotten food poisoning.

239
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,051
What?

240
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,551
Taninaka, give me a hand.

241
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:20,151
We'll throw this punk out onto the street and wake him up.

242
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,451
Sure.

243
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:23,151
You can't touch him!

244
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:26,051
It'll be best if everyone returned

245
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:29,851
to where they originally were without touching anything.

246
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:34,551
Also, in addition to the ambulance,

247
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:35,551
call the police as well.

248
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,451
The police?

249
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,051
This man...

250
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:41,151
I'm pretty sure he'd already dead.

251
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:51,586
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

252
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:55,286
"Ramen so good it's to die for"?

253
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:58,086
And immediately after eating it,

254
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,186
he collapsed in agency and passed away?

255
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:01,186
Yes.

256
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:04,186
Well, the ramen certainly was good, but...

257
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:06,386
Who would've thought he'd really die for it?

258
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,886
Don't be stupid.

259
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:10,586
People don't just drop dead from food that's too delicious.

260
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:15,686
And? What's the victim's name?

261
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:18,486
Tokumori Saizu, 51 years old.

262
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:20,186
He was apparently the president

263
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,486
of the real estate business he managed in Haido City.

264
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,886
It seems he had wanted to buy up

265
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:26,886
and raze the entire Haido Shopping Street,

266
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:30,986
and build a large shopping mall instead.

267
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:35,886
The people of this area considered him to be a major nuisance.

268
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:38,186
He was considered a nuisance?

269
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:41,586
Yes, in order to destroy this shopping street,

270
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:44,486
it appears that he would frequently use his employees

271
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,386
to purposely disrupt the businesses.

272
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:47,386
Yes.

273
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:49,886
When they came here,

274
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:51,686
they'd find some reason to pick on one of our customers

275
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,386
and start a fight.

276
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,186
Can't even count how many of my ramen bowls they've broken.

277
00:15:57,186 --> 00:16:00,786
It was the same at your shop, wasn't it, Taninaka?

278
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:01,986
Yes.

279
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:03,486
Purposely shifting while getting a shave

280
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:06,186
and causing their cheeks to get cut

281
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,486
and then raising a huge fuss

282
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:10,386
and demanding we pay for the medical bill, it's their rutine.

283
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,286
How did it go today?

284
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:16,086
Saizu said he had gone to your shop to get a haircut

285
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:19,986
before coming here to eat ramen, right?

286
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:22,686
Yes, today, it went fine.

287
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:26,086
So this guy was a so-called land shark?

288
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:30,286
Yes, it seems the whole shopping street got together

289
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:33,086
and planned to file a lawsuit over his outrageous behavior, but...

290
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:36,186
The attorney representing them died last month,

291
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:37,986
and the lawsuit was dropped.

292
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:39,686
He didn't just die.

293
00:16:41,386 --> 00:16:43,386
You could say he was murdered.

294
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:47,186
Because my dad trying to stop a fight here

295
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,786
while eating his ramen,

296
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:50,586
and a heart attack struck him due to his chronic disease.

297
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:53,486
He was taken to the hospital and died there.

298
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:57,486
By "dad", you mean you're the attorney's daughter?

299
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,486
-That's right. -From when she was little,

300
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:03,886
that attorney would often bring her along to this shop.

301
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:08,086
She used to say she'd also open a ramen shop once she grew up.

302
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,286
But I never thought she'd really come

303
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:14,286
and ask me for any job, even a part-time one.

304
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:16,686
Incidentally, what was your dad's chronic disease?

305
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,586
Hypertension.

306
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:20,286
His death of cerebral hemorrhage

307
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,886
was probably due to his over-agitation

308
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:25,686
from dragged into the fight, the doctor said so.

309
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:29,386
But isn't it bad for people with high blood pressure to eat ramen?

310
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:33,386
My father took medicine to control his blood pressure.

311
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,486
And he was even told by his doctor

312
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:38,186
that it was okay to eat ramen as long as he didn't drink the soup.

313
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:39,986
I understand.

314
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:42,786
The victim's cause of death was poison, right?

315
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:46,486
Yes. According to the coroner,

316
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,186
he probably ingested the hydrocyanic poison

317
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:51,886
through his mouth as he was eating ramen.

318
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:52,986
So in short,

319
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:55,786
having been in this shop at the time of the incident

320
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:58,186
and possession sufficient motive,

321
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:03,786
the three of you had the opportunity to poison the victim to death.

322
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:06,086
Please wait a moment.

323
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,586
Are you joking?

324
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,686
Are you saying there was poison in our ramen?

325
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:13,086
We shall investigate that now.

326
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:17,386
So, if you all would submit to body searches

327
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,986
and wait outside until we finish our investigation inside the shop.

328
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:21,686
But...

329
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:25,186
is it wise to restrict it to only the three of us?

330
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:27,486
What do you mean?

331
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,486
Before Saizu collapsed,

332
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:33,786
that customer grabbed him by the collar.

333
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:35,486
Me?

334
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:36,986
That did happen.

335
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:38,986
Is that really true?

336
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,386
I was just thinking I'd give him a good talking

337
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,186
to since he was talking nonsense.

338
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:49,186
Then, you'll undergo a body search too, and then get out.

339
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:51,486
Yes, sir.

340
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:57,186
Geez, on such a cold day,

341
00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:00,186
why did I have to be shut out too?

342
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:03,886
Pops, do you know how ramen is made?

343
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:08,186
Why don't you ask the expert for that sort of thing?

344
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:11,286
But...

345
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:12,686
I see.

346
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,986
If he had laced poison somewhere during the cooking process,

347
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:18,486
there's no way he'd answer you.

348
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:20,386
Let's see.

349
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:23,786
What I usually see on TV is to boil the noodles

350
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:25,786
upon receiving an order from the customer.

351
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:29,786
And then add the sauce and stuff like seasoning in the ramen bowl.

352
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:32,186
Then, after that was...

353
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:34,986
You'd put soup into the bowl.

354
00:19:37,286 --> 00:19:40,686
Next, you drain the noodles and put them into the bowl.

355
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:44,086
And then finish it off with garnishes such as roast pork,

356
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:45,486
eggs, bamboo shoots and long green onions.

357
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:46,986
Well, in the case of my shop,

358
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,186
Sayo is the one who does the garnishing.

359
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:52,386
Yes.

360
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:55,086
In short, if it had been you or Sayo,

361
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:58,486
either one of you could have laced it with poison at your leisure, right?

362
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:00,686
Well, I guess that'd be the case.

363
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:03,686
But we never laced anything with poison.

364
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:05,486
Really?

365
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:08,686
Never!

366
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,586
Say, say, mister.

367
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,086
Did you eat ramen with the late Saizu often?

368
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:17,686
Well... every once in a while.

369
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:21,786
In that case, is there anything Saizu really likes

370
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:25,386
that he'd definitely eat up before he even touched the noodles?

371
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:27,886
Like bamboo shoots or eggs...

372
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:29,286
Beats me...

373
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:31,886
I've never actually looked at how he ate.

374
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:36,286
Then, what about any habits he has when he eats ramen?

375
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:37,486
Habits?

376
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,486
Like, I was thinking if he always touches something out of habit,

377
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:43,386
it'd be easy to just apply the poison there.

378
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:46,786
Why are you asking me that?

379
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:49,086
Because you were the only one, mister...

380
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:53,386
The only person who didn't get close to Saizu nor Saizu's ramen.

381
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,286
You're right.

382
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:58,886
Since you guys were sitting in the seats between me and him.

383
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:03,786
Yes, and if I recall, the closest you ever got to Saizu,

384
00:21:03,786 --> 00:21:06,986
was when you hold out the chopstick stand to us,

385
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:09,986
but Saizu didn't use those chopsticks at all.

386
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,086
Yes.

387
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:15,386
But, I wonder why we didn't have

388
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:17,486
any chopsticks in the stand in front of us?

389
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,486
Because there was a customer who dropped that stand,

390
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,286
and scattered the chopsticks all over the floor.

391
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:24,386
-What? -And before I could refill it

392
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:27,286
with some replacement chopsticks, you guys came.

393
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,586
Unsurprisingly, the customer was one of Saizu's subordinates.

394
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,286
We made sure to charge him for the chopsticks.

395
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:37,986
Then, is refilling the chopsticks your duty, Sayo?

396
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:40,886
Yes, that's me all right.

397
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:44,486
But, I never touched the chopsticks that man used.

398
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:47,786
Since that seat was my dad's reserved seat.

399
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,686
There weren't really any customers who sat there.

400
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,686
Then, that means the loyal customer who died last month was indeed...

401
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:57,686
Yeah, it was that attorney.

402
00:21:57,686 --> 00:22:01,086
Saizu sat in that seat without taking no for answer,

403
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,686
does he always do that?

404
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:06,186
Almost always.

405
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:08,486
After he found out it was the lawyer's seat,

406
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:11,686
he'd purposely sit there as a form of harassment.

407
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:15,286
In short Saizu sitting at that seat

408
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:17,886
was something that could've been foreseen to some extent.

409
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,486
If that's the case...

410
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:30,986
Among those three who were in the shop at that time

411
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:34,586
and had the chance to poison Saizu.

412
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,886
Who on earth did it?

413
00:23:58,086 --> 00:24:01,386
Then, I'll go back inside and continue with the investigation.

414
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:03,986
Hold on, wait.

415
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:07,386
I still have questions to ask you...

416
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:10,786
Mr. Saizu did have someone pulling his strings.

417
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:12,786
To apply poison to his own fingers,

418
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,586
and then bring it to his mouth.

419
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:19,786
Just as the culprit among us expected.

420
00:24:22,186 --> 00:24:23,786
Next Conan,

421
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:27,686
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For (Part 2)"

422
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:45,586
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,786
"The Glasses".

424
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,086
Conan, once you takes off your glasses,

425
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,386
you just look like Shinichi when he was a child.

426
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:52,686
Indeed I am.
