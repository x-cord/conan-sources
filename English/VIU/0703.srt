1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:03,736
I participated in the Bell Tree Express event

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:05,336
with the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

3
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:07,436
Ran and the others.

4
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:12,236
Suspicious passengers are gathered in car number 8.

5
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:15,736
The deduction quiz that is held on the train,

6
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:19,536
in the wink of an eye turns into a locked room murder.

7
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:25,236
In the mean time, the dark shadow of the Organization

8
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:28,036
closes in on Haibara.

9
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:31,336
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:33,736
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:35,836
A mysterious character and queer trick.

12
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,936
Destiny closes in on the speeding train.

13
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:39,436
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:41,536
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult!

15
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:44,036
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:29,888
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Crossing)"

17
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:32,296
The fire five years ago?

18
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:36,096
What does that have to do with me?

19
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:38,696
No use playing dumb.

20
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,096
We confirmed just a while ago

21
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:41,196
with the Shizuoka Prefectural Police

22
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,196
that was in charge of the incident.

23
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,696
We found your name among the people who were rescued.

24
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,296
Isn't that right?

25
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,996
Kendo friends with a rich ex-member of the Self-Defence Force

26
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,196
who died in the fire, aren't you Mr. Taisaku Noto?

27
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:55,296
Oh, yeah.

28
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:58,096
The scar on my cheek is what I got back then.

29
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:00,096
But, it's not that I was hiding it.

30
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,696
Come to think of it, you...

31
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:02,996
when we first met,

32
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,896
you were carrying something over your shoulder, weren't you?

33
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:07,396
Maybe you had the tool that you used

34
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,896
for the locked room murder trick in there?

35
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:12,896
That's just a mere bamboo sword!

36
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,596
Bamboo sword?

37
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,696
See. Only the bamboo sword is inside, right?

38
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:23,796
I promised to have a match with a friend of mine

39
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:25,596
in Nagoya later!

40
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,696
At any rate, if you're done...

41
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:29,796
Then, sir.

42
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:32,096
Will you run along the corridor for me?

43
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,296
Run?

44
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,296
Yep!

45
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:38,396
We may have seen the rear view of the culprit when he fled.

46
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:42,796
I'd like to take a movie of you running.

47
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:46,696
I, indeed am Ando

48
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,896
who was rescued along with Mr. Murobashi

49
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,796
from the fire back then.

50
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:53,796
I didn't mention it because you didn't ask.

51
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:58,296
By the way, what is that big bag you have in your room?

52
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:02,296
Oh, that's a picture that I was asked to appraise.

53
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:04,796
Unfortunately, it was fake, though.

54
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:06,896
May take a look at it?

55
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:08,696
Yes.

56
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,596
It's sure is heavy.

57
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:17,896
The frame is pure gold, you see.

58
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:21,096
I see, pure gold, eh.

59
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:23,096
By the way, what was your relationship

60
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,396
with the rich man who died in the fire?

61
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,796
He was a collector of fine arts,

62
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:31,196
so I introduced a lot of masterpieces to him.

63
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:35,996
But, almost all of them burned in the fire.

64
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:39,396
But, it's so very heavy. You're pretty strong

65
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:42,396
being able to carry something like this alone.

66
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:44,596
Huh? Oh, well, sort of.

67
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:48,396
Then, will you run along the corridor for me, sir?

68
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:54,496
Yes. I can't forget about that fire.

69
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:57,396
Because thanks to that fire,

70
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:01,596
I need this wheelchair to take care of me.

71
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:03,496
You hurt your legs in the fire?

72
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:08,096
Yes. That's why I can't run along the corridor

73
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,596
like the others.

74
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:13,196
But your maid Ms. Sumitomo can, can't she?

75
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:18,996
All... all I have to do is run?

76
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:22,296
Yeah. Like you always do.

77
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:27,296
It's hard to believe that the culprit can be specified

78
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,996
doing something like this, though.

79
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,796
Granny,

80
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:34,396
your maid runs pretty fast,

81
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:38,096
was she into sports or something?

82
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,796
Please answer me.

83
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,796
Granny.

84
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,196
It's true that I was the fiance

85
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:54,696
of the grandson of the rich man who died in the fire,

86
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:55,996
and it's also true that

87
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,296
I was rescued from the burning flames too.

88
00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:00,296
But, what does that have to do with me

89
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:02,896
running along the corridor for you?

90
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,096
Just to be safe.

91
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:09,396
Please just unlock your door and let me into your room.

92
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:12,696
If you insist on coming in, bring a search warrant!

93
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:14,396
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:16,896
Then, did that wristwatch that you said

95
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:20,396
you found in your room, has it rung since?

96
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,096
Wristwatch?

97
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:27,496
As you can see, it's left where it is, but it hasn't rung.

98
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:29,396
Huh? Where?

99
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:32,496
See! It's on the sofa.

100
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:35,396
I can't see from just this space.

101
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,996
Huh? Wait a sec.

102
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:41,896
I got a glimpse of it when Mr. Murobashi's body was found.

103
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:44,196
From between the space of the door,

104
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,596
the trace of the bullet on the sofa that was beyond the corpse.

105
00:06:54,596 --> 00:07:00,296
I somehow convinced her run through the corridor,

106
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,896
but I wonder if there was any meaning to it?

107
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:06,596
I'll go show the children the movie I took anyway!

108
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:07,596
Okay!

109
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,596
Hey! Are you listening, kid?

110
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:15,396
Hey?

111
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,496
Who are you?

112
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,896
I'm asking you, who are you?

113
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,596
You haven't changed.

114
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,796
Masumi...

115
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,896
Shu...

116
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:29,196
Big Brother Shu?

117
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:31,396
Are you really Big Brother Shu?

118
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:32,496
But, why?

119
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:34,296
I heard that you died, Big Brother Shu...

120
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:40,396
I wanted to hear that from you.

121
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,196
Is something the matter?

122
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:43,596
No need to worry.

123
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,796
My little sister's anemic.

124
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,896
Oh, is that so...

125
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:56,996
"Proceed with the plan. Obstacle taken care of."

126
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,763
What's the problem?

127
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:13,163
Why did you call us out to the corridor?

128
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:15,363
It seems they've come up with something.

129
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,763
Oh, no. We're still in the midst of investigation.

130
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:21,663
But, that boy came to get us.

131
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,163
He said that you'd be starting

132
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,263
the Sleeping Kogoro Deduction Show.

133
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:29,263
But, you said so, right, Pops?

134
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:32,063
That you've figured out what went on!

135
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:35,563
Idiot! I was just speaking of an example.

136
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:45,763
It's come!

137
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:47,463
The Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:51,163
Now that Mr. Mouri's taken that pose.

139
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:53,863
He's solved the case.

140
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:56,063
The truth of the locked room murder

141
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,663
that was committed in room B.

142
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,363
Who are you?

143
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:02,563
Oh, I'm sorry,

144
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:06,263
I'm Mr. Mouri's number one disciple, Amuro.

145
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:09,263
Ai's not there?

146
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:10,563
No.

147
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:13,963
I looked in the restrooms of the cars nearby too, but...

148
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:19,263
Oh, it's mail from Ai.

149
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,563
I'm okay so don't worry about me.

150
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,163
That's what's written.

151
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:27,463
It's definitely Ai's mail address, but...

152
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:30,163
Maybe she's with Conan?

153
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,563
I'm sure!

154
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:33,963
We wanted to go there too, right?

155
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:37,663
If she did, she should've said so first!

156
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:44,263
Right. The locked room murder...

157
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:46,263
That mystery was solved

158
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:49,663
the second time we visited Ms. Idenami's room E.

159
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,463
Hey, what's this about?

160
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:53,663
Are you saying that I'm the culprit?

161
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:56,163
I realized after I looked into your room

162
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:59,863
from the space between the chain locked door of your room.

163
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:01,963
If the door is chain locked,

164
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:03,863
no matter how much we look inside,

165
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,063
we can't possibly see the sofa that's on the other side!

166
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:11,563
But, when Conan found Mr. Murobashi's body in room B,

167
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:14,363
despite the door having been chain locked,

168
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:17,863
he said that the sofa to the right was in view.

169
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:20,763
Maybe that boy mistook what he saw?

170
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,063
That's probably...

171
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:24,963
because that room's chain lock

172
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:28,663
had more number of loops than the other rooms, no?

173
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:31,063
Therefore, the space between the door opened wider.

174
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:32,563
So, the range of vision that could be seen from outside

175
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,263
also expanded!

176
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:37,163
Is that a problem?

177
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,063
A great problem.

178
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,763
A chain lock is usually made

179
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:42,863
so that even if a hand were to be inserted

180
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:45,063
between the door from outside,

181
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:46,763
it cannot be opened, but...

182
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:49,963
If there is one chain loop more, making the chain longer,

183
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,363
it would be possible to lock the room

184
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:53,563
even after leaving the room, you see.

185
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:01,163
Oh, hey!

186
00:12:01,163 --> 00:12:03,863
No! You can't look at the name list!

187
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:05,263
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:08,763
I thought I saw an acquaintance on board, you see.

189
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:12,063
Please call me, if you need such information!

190
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:13,563
Excuse me.

191
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:25,463
There are six, as you say!

192
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:27,563
The chains of the other rooms only have five loops

193
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:29,863
but only the chain of room B here has six loops!

194
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:32,763
So, the locked room mystery has been solved.

195
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:35,563
But, if someone were to be doing something by the doorway,

196
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:37,663
wouldn't the conductor have noticed?

197
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:39,163
That 's true.

198
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:41,863
And he said he was in the corridor the whole time.

199
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:43,963
I did see somebody who was looking this way

200
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,563
through the door, though.

201
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:48,063
Hey! Who was that?

202
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,463
I didn't have a good view.

203
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:53,163
We were in the tunnel and it was dimly lit too.

204
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,763
Then, that person must be the culprit

205
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,763
who fled to another car.

206
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:00,063
Someone from the outside could've committed the crime.

207
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:02,063
Since the conductors who knew our faces

208
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:03,563
were in the corridor,

209
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,063
none of us in this first class car

210
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:07,563
would've committed such a crime.

211
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:09,763
But, if that risk were to be worth taking

212
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:11,963
because of this sound, then what?

213
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:13,063
Huh?

214
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,463
This is the call bell.

215
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,263
But who on earth?

216
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:20,563
Me!

217
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:25,563
I played the sound of the bell of room B that I rang

218
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:27,763
and recorded in my cell phone a while ago!

219
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:30,063
You heard the bell ringing,

220
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:32,063
but none of the lamps were lit,

221
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,663
so you went to room A, right?

222
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:37,163
Yeah! Because the bulb for room A was burnt out.

223
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:40,263
That's why I thought that Mr. Noto was calling.

224
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:43,163
That's why Mr. Murobashi of room B

225
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:44,963
was looking out of his room,

226
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:46,963
watching the conductor and Mr. Noto

227
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:48,463
arguing with each other, right?

228
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:50,063
Yeah.

229
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,263
He was on the phone with someone, though.

230
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:55,263
I see. It was back then, wasn't it,

231
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:57,763
that the culprit entered room B?

232
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,063
The corridors on this train

233
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,463
are narrow enough that opening a door

234
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,863
blocks most of the passageway.

235
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:05,063
If the door of room B were opened,

236
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:08,463
the figure of the culprit coming from the other side of the door

237
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:10,263
wouldn't be visible from the conductor

238
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:11,763
who is in front of room A.

239
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,063
Yes.

240
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,163
I'm sure that the culprit called Mr. Murobashi and asked him

241
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:16,863
if anything was wrong

242
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:20,063
because there was a commotion outside.

243
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:23,063
Moreover, it was when the train was inside the tunnel.

244
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,863
If the culprit called Mr. Murobashi

245
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,263
just before the train entered the tunnel,

246
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:28,563
and what if the culprit who was on the phone

247
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,063
were to come to room B

248
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:32,063
saying that the reception is bad,

249
00:14:32,063 --> 00:14:33,763
so they'll continue the talk in the room.

250
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:36,163
This is also a thinkable circumstance.

251
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:39,663
But, what did the culprit talk to Mr. Murobashi about?

252
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:42,163
About the deduction quiz that is being conducted

253
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:45,563
on board the mystery train.

254
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:47,763
The culprit passes out fake instruction cards

255
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,763
designating Mr. Murobashi to play the role of the victim,

256
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,663
the culprit to act as the culprit,

257
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:53,463
and my daughter and her friend

258
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:56,663
to play the role of accomplices.

259
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,763
He made the girls and Mr. Murobashi switch rooms

260
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:04,063
saying that it was to carry out the missing body trick.

261
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:07,063
Of course, Mr. Murobashi would've reserved

262
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:09,863
room B of the first class car this time too,

263
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:12,263
so that instruction card was something that was prepared

264
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:13,963
to deal with any trouble that may come up.

265
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,563
And just to be safe, he chose the children

266
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:17,963
to play the part of detective.

267
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:20,063
If someone playing the role of the detective

268
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,363
comes to room B of car number 7,

269
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:25,563
the girls would have to stay in that room for a while

270
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:28,663
in order to play the role of accomplices.

271
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:30,163
Although it looks to be

272
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,063
that the trick was seen through right away,

273
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:34,263
and the girls and the children returned to room B in first class

274
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:36,763
where the murder was committed.

275
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:38,963
And? I understand up to the point

276
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:42,263
where the culprit moved Mr. Murobashi to room B,

277
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:43,663
but when did the culprit come out?

278
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:46,463
Right! If the culprit killed him after entering room B,

279
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:48,363
and came out immediately,

280
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,763
then the conductor who was in front of room A

281
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,263
would've seen something, right?

282
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:52,863
But, he didn't see anything.

283
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:56,063
If so, the one to be suspected is the one

284
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:58,863
who was looking out through the door that the conductor saw...

285
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:00,663
Which door was it?

286
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:04,063
The door to the very end of the corridor.

287
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,363
I saw it when I was in front of room E.

288
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,863
I think it was Mr. Noto's room A.

289
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:09,863
Hey!

290
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,663
Cut out the unreliable talk!

291
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:15,763
I know the identity of that person!

292
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,763
That's you...

293
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:19,063
Conductor!

294
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:24,163
Me, the suspicious character?

295
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:25,863
I'm the culprit?

296
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:26,963
No.

297
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:32,763
What you saw was yourself in front of room E...

298
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:36,063
A mirror. Correct?

299
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,463
Exactly!

300
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:41,363
The culprit had placed mirrors entirely

301
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:43,663
onto the inside of the door of his room,

302
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:45,863
and when the conductor, called by Ms. Idenami

303
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,763
came in front of room E,

304
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:50,463
the culprit opened the door of his room

305
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:52,963
so that the conductor wouldn't see him coming out of room B.

306
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:56,363
But, if the culprit was in room B at that time,

307
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:59,063
how did the culprit open the door to his room?

308
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,263
He tied a fishing line to the door knob

309
00:17:01,263 --> 00:17:03,663
and pulled it through the railing of the corridor window,

310
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,963
then pulled it into room B.

311
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,063
He then after waiting for the right time,

312
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:10,463
pulled the line and opened the door.

313
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,563
Yes.

314
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,063
This trick

315
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:14,963
will not work if the mirror is positioned

316
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:16,463
too close or too far.

317
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:20,463
Which means that, out of the rooms A, B, C, D and E,

318
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:21,563
the passenger staying in the room

319
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:23,963
right in the middle, in room C.

320
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:29,163
Mr. Ando, is the only one who could've carried this out!

321
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:33,763
Strange.

322
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,363
I can't get through to Ai, Conan, Dad

323
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:39,163
and even Sera on the phone.

324
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:40,763
I wonder what's going on?

325
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,963
I'm going over to check out the first class car after all!

326
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,263
Oh, hey!

327
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,363
They seem to be right in the middle of the deduction show now,

328
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:53,563
so I don't think you should intrude.

329
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:00,563
Mirror?

330
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:02,963
Just how am I supposed to have carried a large mirror

331
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:06,663
big enough to cover the entire door onto this train?

332
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:10,363
That picture that you said you were asked to appraise.

333
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,563
If you stick about three mirrors

334
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:15,263
between the canvases of that picture,

335
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:18,263
it seems to be just enough to cover the entire door.

336
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,063
That picture was very heavy too.

337
00:18:21,063 --> 00:18:23,463
The frame of the picture is pure gold.

338
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:27,163
No, it's a gold plated wooden frame.

339
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:29,763
What's heavy is the picture...

340
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:32,863
Inside the picture, just as Mr. Mouri said...

341
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:37,963
are three mirrors...

342
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,963
Judging from the fact that one mirror

343
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,463
is painted with the same color as the door.

344
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:44,163
The mirror seems to have been rigged

345
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:46,163
so that it wouldn't look like one.

346
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:48,463
Because if left as is, the sign on the door

347
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:53,063
designating room E would reflect on the mirror.

348
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:54,963
So, Mr. Ando,

349
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:58,863
how do you plan to explain the three mirrors?

350
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:03,363
Please don't say that the mirrors were there to begin with

351
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:04,963
before you were asked to appraise it,

352
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:07,363
and you didn't realize that

353
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,863
the picture was abnormally heavy.

354
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:12,463
If need be, we could ask the client

355
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:16,163
who asked you to appraise the picture.

356
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:20,463
That is, if there really is such a person.

357
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:39,163
My. How dare you?

358
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,763
It was my favorite, you know?

359
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:49,263
The one piece that I put into that trunk.

360
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:57,363
Why don't you stop doing things like this already?

361
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,763
Sharon?

362
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:08,163
Nobody would've guessed.

363
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:11,263
That the boy would get you, his mother,

364
00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:14,063
involved in our battle.

365
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:16,063
I was the one who initiated it.

366
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:18,263
If he is the star of the silver screen,

367
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:22,963
I told him to cast the legendary actress of Japan, me!

368
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:24,963
But, how disappointing.

369
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,763
I was hoping to learn how to use make-up

370
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:30,563
to keep glowing even after aging.

371
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,363
However, to find that the great actress

372
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:35,163
Sharon Vineyard was just wearing an old lady's make-up.

373
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:38,263
Oh... It's actually pretty painstaking, you know?

374
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:41,163
To routinely act as if I'm old.

375
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,463
Never mind that, but the remark that you made

376
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:45,863
when we passed each other in the corridor.

377
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:48,463
If we outdo you,

378
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:52,063
you'll promise to back away from her once and for all...

379
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:54,163
Just what did you mean by that?

380
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:56,563
Just exactly that.

381
00:20:56,563 --> 00:21:01,063
According to Shinichi, Ai is already on our side.

382
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:04,163
How stupid.

383
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,763
Do you actually think you can outdo us?

384
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:08,063
Did you know?

385
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:11,563
That Shinichi's team is a step ahead right now?

386
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:12,763
A step ahead?

387
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:15,463
That girl called Sera who passed out in your room

388
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:17,463
and was left sleeping,

389
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:20,563
has already been carried back to her previous room.

390
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:23,763
You work quickly, don't you?

391
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:25,263
But, how strange.

392
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,863
The boy's in the midst of the deduction show.

393
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:30,563
I wonder if he has other people to help him?

394
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:33,163
Beats me. I wonder?

395
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:37,163
We could have a special guest on our side, you know.

396
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:59,363
Big Brother Shu.

397
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:02,963
Big Brother Shu.

398
00:23:42,563 --> 00:23:44,663
You don't have a chance.

399
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:46,363
Oh, yes, we do!

400
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:50,363
Because Shinichi has a hold of Sharon's weak point.

401
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,363
Fire? Fire!

402
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:56,763
Haibara's nowhere in sight.

403
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:06,063
Ai!

404
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,163

-drank in chronological order. -What?
