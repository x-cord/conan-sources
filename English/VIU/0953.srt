1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:04,265
"Cafe Poirot" -Pops brought me and Ran,

2
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:05,780
along with Amuro,

3
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:09,180
to meet a client who received a threatening letter

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:12,681
at a Black Bunny Club called Black Bunny Restaurant.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,980
The client was a wealthy man named Gunzo Morooka.

6
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:21,380
He brought his butler, Atsufumi Fukamachi, with him.

7
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:23,180
The threatening letter stated,

8
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:24,280
"If you want to live,"

9
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:27,881
"stay away from the Black Bunny Restaurant."

10
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:32,680
Well? Seen anyone suspicious?

11
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:35,280
Not in particular.

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,780
What about you, Amuro?

13
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:41,081
I don't detect any murderous intentions.

14
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,081
"Yuri Asakura (25), Employee."

15
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,481
-What? -What?

16
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:06,380
You found arsenic in Ms. Yuri's drink?

17
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:09,280
-Yeah. -It was me.

18
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:13,180
Someone was trying to poison me

19
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,880
but Yuri drank it instead.

20
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:17,180
"If you want to live, stay away from the Black Bunny Restaurant"

21
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:19,480
I see.

22
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:22,280
So you received this letter.

23
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:26,680
Yeah, but Yuri was poisoned instead of me.

24
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:33,580
But your glasses were totally different shapes.

25
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:34,980
What?

26
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,280
Ms. Yuri's glass was a skinny champagne glass,

27
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:41,080
and yours was a standard highball glass.

28
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,680
I don't think they'd mix them up.

29
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:47,781
Then Ms. Yuri really was the culprit's intended victim.

30
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:51,280
It could only have been poisoned by Mr. Morooka,

31
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:53,580
who passed by Ms. Yuri as she held her glass

32
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:57,680
before she left the table.

33
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:00,280
Or Mr. Fukamachi, who was sitting next to her

34
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:03,180
when she placed her glass on the table

35
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:07,280
when she was startled by the phone alarm.

36
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:11,680
Or Ms. Murakami, one of the restaurant employee,

37
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:15,180
who spilled red wine on her white cuffs

38
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,180
and created a reason for her to leave the table.

39
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,880
As far as I can recall,

40
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:26,581
only those three could've poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass.

41
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,780
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

42
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:31,780
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

43
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,180
As he determines how the glass was poisoned,

44
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:35,280
a strange memory emerges in the back of Amuro's mind!

45
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,880
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,580
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,781
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:27,710
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 2)"

49
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:33,141
You went to your car to get his glasses?

50
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:36,941
You, the master of your butler, Mr. Fukamachi?

51
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:40,541
Yeah. I'm the one who accidentally stepped on

52
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:43,842
and broke his glasses that had fallen beneath the table.

53
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:47,841
Glasses?

54
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:51,842
The sauce for the rolled omelets was next to Fukamachi.

55
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:55,141
These rolled omelets look delicious.

56
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:57,541
Let's eat.

57
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,441
Let's see...

58
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:03,241
Fukamachi, could you pass the sauce?

59
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:05,141
Huh? What?

60
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:06,841
Fine.

61
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:10,441
But when I tried to get it, they snapped.

62
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,741
Right?

63
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:16,341
-Yes. -But why were your glasses under the table?

64
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:17,741
I remember wiping the lenses

65
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:21,941
and setting them on top of the table.

66
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:26,841
I'm not sure where to look in this type of establishment.

67
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:29,141
I probably bumped them with my elbow

68
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:31,441
and knocked them off.

69
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:34,841
I said it was dangerous for him to get his spare glasses

70
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:37,141
when his eyesight is so bad.

71
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,741
I'll get them for you.

72
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:41,341
Thank you.

73
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:45,341
They're in the glove box.

74
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:48,241
I see. So that's why.

75
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,741
You have strange tastes though.

76
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,641
Sauce on rolled omelets?

77
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:54,841
What? It's good.

78
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,741
Come to think of it,

79
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:59,641
Yuri put sauce on her rolled omelets too.

80
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:03,241
She said she picked up the habit from someone else. See?

81
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:05,341
"Sauce."

82
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:08,441
Huh. Other people do it too.

83
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:13,241
In any case, I don't have a single reason to poison her.

84
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,341
She was my favorite.

85
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,141
That's what you say

86
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:22,641
but maybe she was pressuring you to marry her.

87
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:23,941
What?

88
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,441
Maybe she put sauce on her rolled omelets

89
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:29,541
because she picked up the habit from you, her lover.

90
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,341
I...

91
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:34,641
You fabricated the threatening letter yourself too.

92
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:35,941
Was your plan to make us believe

93
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,041
she was poisoned in your place

94
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:41,441
and murder her

95
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,041
before your wife found out you had a mistress?

96
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,841
You can't be serious!

97
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:50,241
How far apart in age do you think we are?

98
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:53,641
And besides, my wife passed away six months ago.

99
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:54,941
She was sick.

100
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,042
What?

101
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:04,241
I see. You accidentally triggered the phone's alarm.

102
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:07,741
Everyone in the restaurant, including the victim,

103
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,641
believed it was an earthquake alert,

104
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:12,641
so they set their glasses down to check their phones?

105
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:13,941
Yes.

106
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:16,941
I was trying to check my messages

107
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:19,942
while my master was getting my glasses.

108
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,642
No way.

109
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,142
An earthquake?

110
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:28,541
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,441
It suddenly starting ringing

112
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:33,041
while I was checking my messages.

113
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:34,242
Let me see that.

114
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:40,141
Which means you weren't wearing your glasses then?

115
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:43,941
No, so I couldn't see clearly.

116
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:49,141
I couldn't tell who set their glass on the table.

117
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:51,741
Besides, they're all dressed similarly.

118
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,641
That's what you say

119
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:57,241
but maybe you had surgery to improve your eyesight.

120
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:58,341
If that's what you think,

121
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:01,642
try putting on my glasses.

122
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,942
These are intense!

123
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:09,441
In fact, I'm surprised you can see anything wearing these.

124
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:13,141
I've never worn contact lenses or anything like that either.

125
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:17,241
Even if I were, those lenses would be on my person

126
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:20,141
or somewhere around me.

127
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:23,641
You're welcome to look for them.

128
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:26,141
In the first place, like my master,

129
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:27,741
I don't have a motive.

130
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:31,541
We only ever come here while we're waiting.

131
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,441
While you're waiting?

132
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:39,041
The master patronizes the clothing store next to this one.

133
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,941
We only come here to pass the time

134
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:45,341
while the suits he purchased are being tailored.

135
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,941
Isn't that right, sir?

136
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,142
Yeah.

137
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:53,541
I told you I just bumped into her

138
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,541
and spilled a little wine on her.

139
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,041
"Sana Murakami (28), Employee" -I'm not some super spy.

140
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,841
I couldn't have poisoned Yuri's glass

141
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:02,642
in that fraction of a second.

142
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,941
Oh, I'm sorry.

143
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:09,141
In that case, neither could I.

144
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,841
I couldn't have poisoned her glass

145
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,741
when I passed by her.

146
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:16,941
Well, we weren't there when it happened.

147
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:18,241
We can't speak on the matter.

148
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:22,441
Besides, how would I benefit from poisoning Yuri?

149
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,041
If there is one, tell me!

150
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,341
Well...

151
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:28,241
You didn't want to lose the number one spot to her.

152
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:29,242
What?

153
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,641
The other bunnies told me.

154
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:32,741
Every six months,

155
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:36,141
the highest earning bunny girl is chosen

156
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:41,241
and she receives a large bonus.

157
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:44,941
For the past two years, you've been number one,

158
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:47,041
but lately you'd been worried

159
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:49,141
since Ms. Yuri was catching up.

160
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:53,341
Maybe you already bought something expensive

161
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,041
assuming you'd get the bonus

162
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,241
and felt like you had to poison her.

163
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,641
What?

164
00:09:58,642 --> 00:09:59,941
In that case,

165
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:04,242
tell me what expensive "something" I already purchased!

166
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:09,441
Conan, do you know who did it?

167
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,341
Wait, what? He was here a second ago.

168
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:18,241
That boy just asked where the parking lot was and went outside.

169
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,741
With that dark handsome man.

170
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:23,041
With Amuro?

171
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,541
Yes, the boss did come

172
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,241
to get his butler Mr. Fukamachi's glasses.

173
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:32,741
He was with the detective Kogoro Mouri.

174
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:37,541
Did you notice anything unusual then?

175
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:38,841
Like what?

176
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:41,041
Like them watching the restaurant

177
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:44,041
or checking their watches.

178
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,942
Not particularly.

179
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:49,941
Speaking of unusual,

180
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,541
the boss's weight has been strange, right?

181
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:55,041
Yeah. He'll suddenly lose a bunch of weight

182
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,641
and then gain it back.

183
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:59,041
Maybe there's something bothering him.

184
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,741
And he's been getting injured a lot recently too.

185
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:05,141
Yeah. He said he tripped on a step.

186
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,441
An injury?

187
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:11,341
I can't treat you next time even if you get hurt, you know.

188
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:13,841
Because I'll have to move far away.

189
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:15,641
It's bye-bye time,

190
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,441
Rei...

191
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,741
Amuro...

192
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:21,142
Amuro!

193
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:26,041
What's wrong? You were spacing out.

194
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,942
It's nothing.

195
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:35,842
Why am I thinking about her now?

196
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:48,450
According to Amuro's testimony,

197
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:52,250
the victim, Yuri Asakura's glass, could've only been poisoned by.

198
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,550
Mr. Gunzo Morooka, who broke his butler's glasses

199
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:58,250
when left his seat after he stepped on them,

200
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,750
to get his spare glasses from the car and passed by Ms. Yuri

201
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:04,250
while she was holding her glass

202
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:07,850
or Mr. Atsufumi Fukamachi, who triggered his phone alarm accidentally

203
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,750
and was sitting next to Ms. Yuri's glass

204
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:14,150
when she set it on the table

205
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:19,450
to check for an earthquake report on her own phone

206
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,850
or Ms. Sana Murakami,

207
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:23,650
who later spilled red wine on Ms. Yuri's cuffs

208
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:27,950
and encouraged her to leave her glass

209
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:30,150
in order to get new cuffs.

210
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:33,650
But it took only a moment for Mr. Morooka to pass by her

211
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:37,450
and Ms. Murakami to spill red wine on her cuffs.

212
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:40,650
They didn't have time to poison her drink.

213
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:43,350
And Mr. Fukamachi wasn't wearing his glasses

214
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:45,150
when he triggered the alarm.

215
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:49,751
He says he couldn't tell who put which glass where.

216
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,350
We'll have to wait for Ms. Yuri

217
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:55,350
to regain consciousness after all.

218
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:57,050
Inspector Megure.

219
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:58,051
What is it?

220
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:01,250
Apparently the restaurant staff want to talk to you.

221
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:04,151
They remembered something.

222
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:08,651
What?

223
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:12,350
The butler, Mr. Fukamachi, came to this store alone?

224
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:13,551
-Yes. -Yes.

225
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:19,350
Was it to see Ms. Yuri?

226
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:24,150
Yes. At first we thought he came to make a reservation.

227
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,450
He said he needed to talk to Yuri

228
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,451
and they headed out back together.

229
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:27,451
What?

230
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:31,251
At first, Yuri was smiling while talking to him.

231
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:35,250
But the moment the butler produced an envelope,

232
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:38,350
things became awkward.

233
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,450
An envelope?

234
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,750
Do you know what was in it?

235
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,350
I don't know.

236
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:47,950
He was paying her to cut ties.

237
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:51,150
You know, as in, "Break up with my master".

238
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:55,050
And she said, "I won't take your money!"

239
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:57,450
and rejected his offer.

240
00:13:57,451 --> 00:14:00,950
Does that mean she was Mr. Morooka's lover

241
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:03,050
and was pushing for marriage?

242
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:08,250
But why would he come here to drink if she was here?

243
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:10,650
Then maybe it was the opposite

244
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:14,550
and he came to ask her to be his lonely master's lover

245
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,650
in exchange for money?

246
00:14:16,651 --> 00:14:19,550
So he retaliated by poisoning her because she refused?

247
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,651
That doesn't sound very likely to...

248
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:26,750
Stay out of adult conversations, kid!

249
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,550
Dad!

250
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:33,350
So, when did Mr. Morooka start coming to the store?

251
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:37,050
About six months ago.

252
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,950
That's exactly around the time his wife passed away.

253
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:40,951
Yeah.

254
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:46,350
But he doesn't seem like the type to have a lover.

255
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:49,751
No, he was quite the ladies' man.

256
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:56,650
He probably messed around a lot when he was younger.

257
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:59,050
Come to think of it, he often said

258
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:01,950
he was a troublemaker in his 20's.

259
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,450
I knew it!

260
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,650
A troublemaker?

261
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,050
There was a girl he liked.

262
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:10,350
They ran away together

263
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:13,650
and lived in Tottori for about four years.

264
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:16,050
He eloped?

265
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,350
Not bad, old man.

266
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,550
But his parents dragged him back home,

267
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:23,950
and he married the woman he was engaged to.

268
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:26,350
The butler, Mr. Fukamachi,

269
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:28,750
came along with that wife.

270
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:32,250
He originally worked for the wife's family,

271
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,850
but the wife insisted that he come with her

272
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,950
to the Morooka family.

273
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:41,050
So, what happened to the girl he eloped with?

274
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:44,950
Who knows? She probably received a ton of money to break up with him.

275
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:49,050
Morooka family has been wealthy for generations.

276
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:50,350
Oh, right.

277
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:52,450
Yuri's from Tottori too.

278
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,850
That's why the two of them got along.

279
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:56,950
Come to think of it,

280
00:15:56,951 --> 00:16:00,350
I think Sana's family is from Tottori too.

281
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:01,450
That's right.

282
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:05,651
She tries to hide it, but sometimes her speech...

283
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,550
My father's calling.

284
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:12,850
Is it all right if I answer?

285
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,950
Uh, sure.

286
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:16,850
Hello, Pop?

287
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,650
Sorry, I'm a bit busy at the moment.

288
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:22,050
What? What do you want?

289
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:23,550
Didn't I tell you?

290
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,350
Don't worry about the money.

291
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,751
Just focus on getting better.

292
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,950
I'll do something about the money for the surgery.

293
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,050
Don't worry.

294
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:37,450
You won't die that easily, pop.

295
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:41,651
We've got the same hard-as-nails red blood flowing in us.

296
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,951
The same red blood.

297
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:47,651
Red...

298
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,650
Blood?

299
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:54,450
Amuro, what's wrong?

300
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:56,650
You've been acting strange.

301
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,551
Oh, sorry.

302
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,150
Her again.

303
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:03,751
But why now?

304
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:18,550
"Information on Shinichi Kudo. Hurry!"

305
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,551
"Time is money!" -"Rum".

306
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:24,750
Yes...

307
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,551
I know.

308
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:39,250
By the way, Ms. Murakami,

309
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:42,650
when Mr. Fukamachi triggered his phone alarm

310
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:45,950
and Ms. Yuri set her glass on the table,

311
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,150
where were you?

312
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,750
I was at a different table.

313
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,150
Everyone was making a huge fuss

314
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,850
over the weird sound he made with his phone,

315
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,550
so I came to check it out.

316
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:59,650
That's when I bumped into Yuri and spilled wine on her.

317
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:01,750
Isn't that right?

318
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,350
Well, I...

319
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:06,950
I was out getting Fukamachi's glasses, so...

320
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:08,950
I remember Ms. Yuri went to replace her left cuff

321
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:11,850
that had wine spilled on it

322
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:16,450
shortly after the alarm sounded.

323
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,350
I can't recall

324
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:20,750
if you were standing next to her when the alarm sounded.

325
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,950
I told you, I wasn't there!

326
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:26,550
I'm not saying you're lying.

327
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:30,251
But if it's a question of whether or not you were there...

328
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:32,650
It's true!

329
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:35,650
I really was at a different table!

330
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:37,751
You have to believe me!

331
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,050
What? Concerns?

332
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:45,350
You're saying Mr. Morooka was worried about something?

333
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:50,250
Yes. That's what his bodyguards in the parking lot told me.

334
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:53,550
Lately he has been acting strange.

335
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:56,550
He'd suddenly lose and gain weight

336
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:59,950
and was frequently tripping and injuring himself.

337
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,450
Of course he was worried.

338
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:04,350
He received a threatening letter.

339
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,351
But, Mouri...

340
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:06,351
An injury?

341
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:11,050
"Miyano Clinic" -Injury, injury! Injured person here!

342
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:13,250
Mom, I brought you a patient!

343
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,450
Let go!

344
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:16,750
-Thank you. -I told it you it was no big deal.

345
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:18,650
"Elena Miyano (29), Doctor" -But you're bleeding.

346
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:21,550
All this needs is a little spit.

347
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:24,450
-But... -You again?

348
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,150
You sure do love to fight.

349
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:27,550
That's not it.

350
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:31,350
They won't stop making fun of the color of my hair.

351
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:36,650
Even though I'm Japanese, born and raised...

352
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:40,050
Is one of your parents a foreigner?

353
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,650
What's wrong with that?

354
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:46,750
Then tell your friends you fought with this.

355
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:49,450
Even if people look different,

356
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:50,950
when you peel back our skin,

357
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:54,250
we're all just lumps of blood and flesh.

358
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:58,150
To prove it, every race in the world

359
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:00,450
has red blood flowing through them,

360
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:03,751
just like yours.

361
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:07,750
Got it?

362
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:08,751
Yeah...

363
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:11,251
Then let's get you treated. Come in.

364
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:15,651
"Atsushi Miyano (35), Doctor and Scientist."

365
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:18,550
All done.

366
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,550
Akemi, put a bandage on him.

367
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,650
Okay. Come with me.

368
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,850
Okay.

369
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,550
How unusual.

370
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:27,850
Honey.

371
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:32,450
You're normally shy and speak the bare minimum with patients,

372
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,550
-but you're so friendly with that boy. -Hold still.

373
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:36,650
-It hurts! -That boy is special.

374
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,750
He's half, like me.

375
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:40,050
I see.

376
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:42,550
Anyway, how'd it go?

377
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:47,650
Are we transferring to that facility that'll back up your research?

378
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:50,550
I'm thinking about turning them down.

379
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:51,751
Why?

380
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,250
I'd hate to leave you guys behind

381
00:20:56,251 --> 00:21:00,050
and your sister said it seemed a little suspicious.

382
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,450
But isn't the Karasuma Group sponsoring them?

383
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:06,550
Yeah, but I've heard unfavorable rumors about them.

384
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:11,250
I don't want to be called a mad scientist again.

385
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:16,950
But your research can't be done part-time as a GP.

386
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:19,950
If the pay's good, then it's too bad for our patients

387
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:23,050
but I don't mind closing this clinic to help you.

388
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:24,250
It's fine.

389
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:28,050
The three of us are doing just fine as is.

390
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:29,250
It's four.

391
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:31,151
Huh? What?

392
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,550
I'm three months along.

393
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,550
Really?

394
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:39,250
Then maybe I'll reconsider their offer.

395
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:40,850
It's your dream.

396
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,850
You shouldn't give up on it so easily.

397
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:44,650
Yeah.

398
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:45,651
Well...

399
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,651
Well, I'm leaving now.

400
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:52,650
Can I come back if I get hurt again?

401
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:55,950
No. We don't treat boys who fight.

402
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:56,951
What?

403
00:21:56,952 --> 00:22:00,850
But if it's an honorable injury suffered

404
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,950
while making up with the friend you fought with,

405
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:05,251
then I'll at least put a bandage on you.

406
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:11,350
I see.

407
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:13,151
So that's how it is.

408
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:45,351
"Next Episode" -I found a fake nail.

409
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:52,450
That's why the culprit was able to poison Ms. Yuri's glass.

410
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:53,950
I heard you're struggling

411
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:57,150
to pay for your seriously ill father's surgery!

412
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:59,950
What? At least I'm not an old man who was trying to pay her

413
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:02,250
to stop contacting him!

414
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:06,751
Please don't make your wife sad anymore.

415
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:12,651
