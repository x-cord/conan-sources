1
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:06,572
What's that?

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,272
Bombing, again?

3
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:10,073
Shiratori!

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:14,773
Shiratori!

5
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:17,373
Shiratori!

6
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:19,972
It's dangerous.

7
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:22,772
Get out of here, quickly.

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,772
Are you all right, Shiratori?

9
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:33,272
Yeah. I couldn't run as you did.

10
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:37,172
Takagi! Block off this road and get an ambulance.

11
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:38,972
I will.

12
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:43,472
But he can speak, that means he's okay.

13
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:46,872
No. He's bleeding at the side of his head,

14
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:49,172
with paralysis in the left limbs.

15
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:50,572
This could be...

16
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:53,173
Accute subdural hemorrhage.

17
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,772
We'd better take him ASAP to the hospital.

18
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:57,773
He's in critical condition.

19
00:00:57,774 --> 00:00:59,572
Oh, no.

20
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:01,772
Anyway, if the gas catches fire,

21
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:03,772
it might cause secondary explosion.

22
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,272
Let's move Inspector Shiratori away from the car

23
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,472
until the ambulance gets here.

24
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:09,573
Yes, let's do that.

25
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,172
This is terrible. Really terrible.

26
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:18,972
Yeah. Who on earth would do such a thing?

27
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,972
I don't know the bomber,

28
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:23,872
but I'm sure that he's after a police officer.

29
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:24,873
What?

30
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:28,172
He gave false lead saying that he set up a bomb in the restaurant,

31
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:29,972
and lured the police into the restaurant.

32
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:32,572
While the officers were looking for the bomb,

33
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:36,172
he planted the real bomb into the car,

34
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:38,072
hiding himself among the customers

35
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:41,072
who were lead out of the restaurant.

36
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:42,572
From what I saw,

37
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:44,272
the trigger mechanism seems to work

38
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:47,372
in a way that the safety pin goes off when the door is first opened.

39
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,972
And when the door is opened again in order to exit,

40
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:51,573
then it explodes.

41
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:53,373
The question is,

42
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:56,773
why did Inspector Shiratori try to get out immediately?

43
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:01,072
This...

44
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,172
What's that?

45
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:05,573
I wanted to show this to you as soon as possible.

46
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:10,272
The memory that you harbor within you and cannot erase...

47
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:13,873
This is a chance to get rid of it.

48
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:20,072
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter.

49
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,572
Now, this is the beginning of an extended game.

50
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:25,472
The game starts at noon tomorrow.

51
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:27,872
It ends at three in the afternoon.

52
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:31,572
No use getting ready a good stopper.

53
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:33,872
Because I will win in the end.

54
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:37,772
And if you want to stop the game, come to me.

55
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:39,472
I will be waiting for you

56
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:45,772
to climb up the bloody mound in the steel batter's box."

57
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:47,572
What?

58
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:48,872
It's...

59
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,772
Hey.

60
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:52,272
Could it be...

61
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,072
This is...

62
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,272
I am a knight of the round table.

63
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:59,372
Let the foolish, cunning police know that...

64
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:01,673
Let a pro handle work like this.

65
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:10,372
It's him.

66
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,273
It's him again.

67
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,572
Really?

68
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:29,072
Did Shiratori get involved in an explosion?

69
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:30,272
Yes, sir.

70
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:34,172
He was taken by an ambulance to a nearby hospital just now.

71
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,672
He has been seriously injured.

72
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,572
What is the situation over there, sir?

73
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:42,472
The same fax with the same words you just told me.

74
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,172
The same faxes have been sent to

75
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,072
all the police stations in the metropolitan district.

76
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:48,472
They are all upset over the fax.

77
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:51,172
There's a possibility that it is the same one

78
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:54,672
responsible for the bombings 7 years ago and 3 years ago.

79
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:58,172
No doubt about it. It's from the bomber.

80
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:00,573
Please tell Director Matsumoto about it, sir.

81
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,572
In the incident of three years ago,

82
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,672
only the first portion of the warning notice

83
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:06,572
was released to the public.

84
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:09,773
An imitator couldn't have made up such a detailed warning notice.

85
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:15,472
Sato, I brought your car here.

86
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:17,372
Thanks, Chiba.

87
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:20,272
Now, I will go join the investigation team, sir.

88
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:23,873
Hey, Sato! Sato!

89
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:28,073
He's not getting away. Not this time.

90
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:31,573
I'll take him in myself.

91
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,457
Emergency, emergency.

92
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,603
From MPD to all stations.

93
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:42,003
We haven't specified where yet,

94
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:44,903
but we received a bomb threat warning.

95
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:46,403
There are two bombs.

96
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:51,303
Time of explosion is at noon tomorrow and at 15:00 the same day.

97
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:55,103
As the past incidents show, this warning is very credible.

98
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:57,003
Keep strict watch and be on the alert.

99
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,304
Continue investigation and don't let the suspect get away.

100
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,403
Extended game?

101
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,203
He's toying with us.

102
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:09,103
-Megure! -Yes, sir.

103
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,803
No extension is allowed.

104
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:15,103
Settle the case once and for all, understand?

105
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:16,604
I'll do my best, sir.

106
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,003
It's your chance to...

107
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:26,803
The memory that you harbor within you and cannot erase...

108
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:28,903
This is a chance to get rid of it.

109
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:31,803
Yes. I have to get rid of.

110
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:35,303
I've got to arrest the bomber and forget about the past.

111
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:36,704
Forget?

112
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:42,803
Keepsakes of your father who died on duty,

113
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:45,003
and you wear it as a charm.

114
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:47,303
Give it back to me!

115
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,803
I know what you want to say to me,

116
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:53,003
throw it away to go on forward, forget about it.

117
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,903
No. You don't have to forget.

118
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:57,403
What?

119
00:05:57,404 --> 00:06:01,003
Whether you move on forward or not depends on you.

120
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:05,604
If you forget him completely, your father will be really gone.

121
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:08,104
Matsuda.

122
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,904
Matsuda.

123
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,504
Will you tell me something?

124
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:20,603
Why does this bomber hold a grudge against the police?

125
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:22,203
Conan!

126
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:24,103
When did you get in the car?

127
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:26,404
Tell me, please.

128
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:34,203
In the bombing incident of 7 years ago,

129
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:36,404
there were two bombers.

130
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:41,304
They planted the bombs in two separate condominiums.

131
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:44,403
They demanded a billion yen,

132
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,503
and said that they will blow the bomb up

133
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:48,704
if even one resident escapes from the condo.

134
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:53,403
We disposed of one bomb in time

135
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:55,603
but failed with the other.

136
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:59,503
We had to accept their demand.

137
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,303
They stopped the time counter

138
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:04,103
for triggering the bomb through their remote controller.

139
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,303
All the residents evacuated

140
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:08,803
and it seemed as if all was over.

141
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:13,903
But 30 minutes later, one of the bombers calls the police.

142
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:18,503
He said, "The timer is still counting down, what's going on?"

143
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:24,003
He probably made the mistake of watching the TV news

144
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:26,003
and reviewing what happened through VCR.

145
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:30,303
The police thought it a good chance to secure the bomber.

146
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:33,003
They talked him into conversation and succeeded in tracing his phone call.

147
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:35,604
We found the bomber in a telephone booth.

148
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:39,604
But unfortunately...

149
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:50,404
The bomber fled and was run over by a car and killed.

150
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:57,903
Then, how did you figure out there was the other bomber?

151
00:07:57,904 --> 00:07:59,204
It's because...

152
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:03,503
Later, the timer that was supposed to stop counting

153
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:07,203
started counting again and the bomb blew up.

154
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,703
Run, everybody!

155
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:10,304
The timer started counting again!

156
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:24,703
We found the address of the bomber who was killed.

157
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,503
But all we found out was that he was living there with another guy.

158
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:32,503
The other bomber probably thought

159
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:36,303
the police gave false information through TV

160
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,804
and set a trap, which killed his pal.

161
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:45,103
They're blaming their faults on the wrong people.

162
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,003
It's their fault, because they set the bomb

163
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,903
and tried to get the money in the first place.

164
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,403
That's right.

165
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:54,503
You heard me, it's time to get off now.

166
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:57,003
We're going to help you.

167
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,503
The more the merrier.

168
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,603
Well, but if they find out

169
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:04,603
I'm making investigations with kids in my car...

170
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:07,703
Well, kids have more advantage

171
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,603
in solving this kind of childish codes.

172
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:14,203
Or, is it that you're not satisfied having just us

173
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:16,003
and Conan not around?

174
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:19,903
Not satisfied?

175
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:22,803
No, that's not it.

176
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:25,103
But, why did the bomber go out of his way

177
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:28,303
to send the coded note to the police?

178
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,004
If he didn't do anything, he wouldn't be caught.

179
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,203
Suppose you hide a treasure

180
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:36,903
and somebody comes trying to find it, what would you do?

181
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:40,103
I'll be watching him with my heart beating fast.

182
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:44,503
Suppose you hide the treasure in a pitfall with a trap?

183
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,603
Then of course, we will...

184
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:48,803
We'll give them clues little by little.

185
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:51,503
That's it! That's why he's started to give clues.

186
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:55,003
You're right. The bomber's acting like a child,

187
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,203
playing with a toy called the bomb.

188
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:58,904
He's a wicked brat with a wicked toy in his hands.

189
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,319
Hey, Ran! Telephone!

190
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,319
Gosh. Dad, answer the phone, will you?

191
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,019
Both my hands are full, so I can't pick up the phone.

192
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,720
Gosh.

193
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,419
Hello. This is Mouri.

194
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,119
It's me.

195
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,519
Dr. Agasa!

196
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,919
Ran, it's about Conan.

197
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,819
He insists on staying here tonight.

198
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,519
What? At your place, Dr. Agasa?

199
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,119
Yes. The kids really liked the game I made

200
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,619
and they just can't quit.

201
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,219
Are Ayumi and the others there, too?

202
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,819
That's right.

203
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,319
The Winter holidays will be over,

204
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,919
so they will be back by tomorrow evening.

205
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
But...

206
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,320
Well then, goodbye.

207
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,220
Ayumi's home next.

208
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,119
Please, Doc.

209
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,219
We want to get back at the bomber for what he did to Inspector Shiratori.

210
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,119
Right, right!

211
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,719
Please, Dr. Agasa.

212
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,920
I'll make sure to keep them out of danger, Doctor.

213
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,320
Gosh. I'll be in trouble if anyone finds out.

214
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,619
And I cooked Conan's favorite dish.

215
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,419
That's good, you know.

216
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,219
You're taking the national test tomorrow, aren't you?

217
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,519
You don't have to take care of the kids,

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,120
so you can prepare yourself for the test.

219
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,119
By the way, Ran, I'd like another bottle, please.

220
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,419
What? You are going to drink more?

221
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,419
It won't hurt, will it?

222
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,820
It's more of hassle taking care of a drunkard.

223
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,419
What does this note mean?

224
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,919
The only thing we're sure of is the time.

225
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,919
Anyway, the guy's a foreigner.

226
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,119
He's a major league baseball player.

227
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,119
Not exactly a foreigner.

228
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,619
There are Japanese major league players too now a days.

229
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,419
That's right.

230
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,219
But he set bomb to a baseball ground somewhere, I'm sure.

231
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,119
Yeah. It says "mound" and "Batter's box".

232
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,819
It's South Haido station.

233
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,819
You mean, South Haido station?

234
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,419
Of Toto Central Line?

235
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,519
That's right.

236
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,119
What are you talking about?

237
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,219
There's no baseball ground near South Haido Station.

238
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,019
It's a code.

239
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,619
It isn't literally referring to a mound or batter's box.

240
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,819
So, you mean you deciphered the code?

241
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,119
Yes.

242
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,719
Three years ago, bombs were set to

243
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,519
the Big Ferris Wheel of the Haido Shopping Mall

244
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,919
and the Beika Central Hospital.

245
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,819
South Haido Station of the Touto Chuo Line

246
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,820
is located where the roads facing the two places.

247
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,419
But that's just a play on words extended game and extended lines.

248
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,819
Slow, aren't you?

249
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,819
If a station is located where the roads intersect,

250
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,219
there would most naturally be a stopper there, right?

251
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,519
A stopper?

252
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,719
Stopper?

253
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,119
What's that?

254
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,119
I see! I got it!

255
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
What?

256
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:39,019
The crossing bar of a railroad crossing, isn't it?

257
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,319
Then, the steel batter's box could be...

258
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,619
Box of steel, or the car of the train.

259
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,819
And, to go climb the bloody mound,

260
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,219
could mean a red colored train that goes up to the center of the city.

261
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,219
Good heavens! I have to let Sato know about this.

262
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,919
It's all right. I heard you.

263
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,419
We virtually agree.

264
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,419
One bomb will be set up on the Toto Central Line train

265
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,819
that goes from South Haido Station to Tokyo.

266
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,419
I will contact the Inspector to dispatch investigators.

267
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,219
And Takagi, you arrange for the bomb disposal squad.

268
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,320
-Hurry! -Yes, right away.

269
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,419
What? South Haido Station?

270
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,819
Really?

271
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,019
Yes. And then?

272
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,519
Okay, I see.

273
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,820
We will arrange for it immediately.

274
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,820
Everybody, please evacuate calmly!

275
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,619
What? It's just trash.

276
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,519
What's this?

277
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,219
This... this is...

278
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,219
A bomb?

279
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,319
Get off, everybody. It's a bomb!

280
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,020
What?

281
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,520
What the heck is this?

282
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,819
What? False?

283
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,019
It wasn't a real bomb, you say?

284
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,119
And then?

285
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,819
I guess the bomber expected

286
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,419
the investigators go there to search.

287
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,319
Right. He is a smart-aleck mischievous brat, I guess.

288
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,719
-Besides, he's not after money. -Yes.

289
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,519
Yeah. The guy probably just has a grudge against the police,

290
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,620
and is holding hostage 12 million people who live in the city of Tokyo.

291
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,936
"Tohto Line, South Haido Station."

292
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:21,805
"Fail."

293
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:25,135
What? False bomb again?

294
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:27,535
Did you check all of them?

295
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:30,235
Is there no real bomb?

296
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,435
No, sir.

297
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:36,735
We have checked all the red trains that go through the city,

298
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:41,135
but all the suspicious ones have been false or pranks.

299
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:42,635
I see.

300
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:46,635
The bomber's probably trying to throw off our investigation.

301
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,435
Anyway, be patient and continue your investigations.

302
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:50,935
Yes, sir.

303
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:52,435
Director Matsumoto.

304
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:53,436
What is it?

305
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:56,835
Report from the Ozaki team, sir. They are at the ballparks.

306
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:59,035
-And, what did you get? -Yes, sir.

307
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:03,635
They have finished checking all the major ballparks in the city

308
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:06,035
but nothing came up so far.

309
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:11,136
They say they will continue investigation covering smaller ballparks.

310
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:16,335
We don't have to check the ballpark anymore, I guess.

311
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:20,535
All right. Stop all the red trains in the city.

312
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:22,635
Get all the investigators out of the ballparks

313
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:25,235
and dispatch them to all the stations to conduct investigations.

314
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:27,635
We still have five more hours

315
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,535
till the first explosion expected to go off at noon.

316
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:33,935
He can outfox us and try setting up a bomb from now.

317
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,236
Yes, sir!

318
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:44,035
Five more hours, huh?

319
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:49,435
I wanted to say we have only five hours left for us.

320
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,736
Yes.

321
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:03,136
I'm sleepy.

322
00:18:10,036 --> 00:18:11,435
Isn't it strange?

323
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:12,835
From this note, you would think that

324
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,835
he expected somebody to come kooking for it to the ballpark,

325
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:17,436
but nothing happened.

326
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:22,135
He thought nobody would come.

327
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:25,535
It's off-season and no big game is scheduled.

328
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:27,035
Oh, yeah?

329
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:28,935
If he wanted to play pranks on the police,

330
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:33,735
he could have set a false trap or two.

331
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:37,736
At any rate, we can't keep those kids with us anymore.

332
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:40,535
You're right.

333
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,035
By the way, how is Shiratori? Did you ask how he is?

334
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,835
Yes, I did.

335
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:49,635
Yumi is taking care of Shiratori,

336
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:51,335
and she told me that the operation was successful.

337
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:54,735
They are waiting for him to regain consciousness.

338
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:57,436
That's good. I'm relieved.

339
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:02,335
Listen here, Takagi.

340
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:04,935
Make sure Miwako stays out of dangerous situations.

341
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,935
If the bomber is the same bomber

342
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:10,435
that killed Matsuda with a bomb,

343
00:19:10,436 --> 00:19:12,735
who knows what she might do

344
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:16,535
and there will be no one but you who will be able to save her.

345
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:20,335
What? Why me?

346
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:25,135
You're so much like Mr. Matsuda.

347
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:29,135
But that's only because I happened to be disguised like him.

348
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:34,235
Of course, he's five to ten times better in looks or attitude.

349
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,535
Ten times, is it?

350
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:39,035
But something about you reminds me of him.

351
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:42,435
It may be your heart, feelings or whatever...

352
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:45,135
Something resembles Matsuda.

353
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:49,235
I guess Miwako came to realize that lately.

354
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:50,735
Hey, Takagi.

355
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,635
Takagi!

356
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:56,835
What were you thinking over so seriously?

357
00:19:56,836 --> 00:20:00,035
Did you find out where the bomb is?

358
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:01,735
No, I didn't.

359
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:03,035
Then, what?

360
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,336
It's nothing important.

361
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:08,736
Okay, for now.

362
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:16,235
I'll continue the investigation.

363
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:19,435
You send the kids home.

364
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:22,535
Then you return to the MPD to get some sleep

365
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:25,135
and stay there to help Inspector Megure.

366
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:27,135
But I can keep investigating.

367
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:30,635
Don't be silly. An officer who is unsteady from lack of sleep

368
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:33,336
will only get in the way of the investigation. Got it?

369
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,636
Yes.

370
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:43,035
No.

371
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:45,036
I won't let you take him from me.

372
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,635
Not anymore.

373
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:49,936
Never.

374
00:20:57,936 --> 00:21:00,535
Taking a test right after new year holidays

375
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:03,035
makes me feel like I'm living a gray life of a prep.

376
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:04,036
Yeah.

377
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:06,635
New year days are meant for everyone to enjoy!

378
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:08,735
So, you enjoyed yourself, didn't you?

379
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:10,836
Sure. I didn't want to regret not doing what I wanted to do.

380
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:16,435
Well, only thing I can depend on is this.

381
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:19,936
What? Isn't it... Could that be...

382
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,735
No.

383
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:23,736
Look!

384
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:29,035
Gosh. It's the photo of Kyogoku.

385
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:33,135
Yeah. This photo gives me energy when I look at it.

386
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:35,835
Even if my test results aren't good,

387
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,335
I won't get depressed.

388
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:40,835
As long as I have Makoto's love,

389
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:43,235
I don't need to score 100 on my test.

390
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:46,435
Oh, I'm so ashamed of myself for being so bold!

391
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,036
Sure, sure.

392
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:59,836
"I have stolen your sleeping face."

393
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:12,235
Okay, kids. I'll take you home.

394
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:14,935
Tell me where you live, will you?

395
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,035
What?

396
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:18,735
Are you taking us back home?

397
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:22,435
We may be able to solve this code in a moment.

398
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:24,935
You haven't slept for a long time.

399
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:30,435
I can't keep you, school kids, with me any longer.

400
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,436
What?

401
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:37,735
Say! Where's Officer Sato?

402
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:40,035
She's investigating on the case.

403
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:45,035
I see. Officer Sato told you to send us home.

404
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:47,635
You do everything she tells you to do, don't you?

405
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:52,635
I have to. She's two years older and my senior as well.

406
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:55,535
And you think you'll do fine after marrying her, too?

407
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:57,135
Marry her?

408
00:22:57,136 --> 00:23:01,936
I won't be. Because she just dumped me the other day.

409
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:05,535
Sato.

410
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:07,135
Yes?

411
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,136
You said you have something to say to me.

412
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:13,236
Oh, that.

413
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,736
Sato.

414
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:24,735
Let's forget about the date. The date we were gonna have.

415
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,736
What?

416
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,735
I'm cursed.

417
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:30,235
Cursed?

418
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:33,435
All the people that I care dearly for,

419
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:36,335
seem to disappear from me.

420
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:40,935
My father, the P.E. teacher in school,

421
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:43,735
my senior in the baseball club,

422
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,136
and...

423
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:50,936
him too.

424
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:59,235
I don't want to have to go through that kind of pain anymore.

425
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:00,536
Sato.

426
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:04,035
We have been good friends and police officers,

427
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:06,236
and I want us to stay that way right through.

428
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:11,636
Sato.

429
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:14,836
Takagi.

430
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:20,035
Yes...

431
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:24,935
You're right. We are not well-matched in the first place.

432
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:29,935
Yeah, you deserve a prettier cuter girl.

433
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,536
Really?

434
00:24:33,736 --> 00:24:36,035
See? I'm not getting married.

435
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:38,235
So you gave her up?

436
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:40,235
What a chicken!

437
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:42,035
No guts at all.

438
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:45,735
I don't want to give her up, but...

439
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:48,435
But what?

440
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:50,935
But...

441
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:56,435
Officer Matsuda risked his life to save the people in the hospital,

442
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:59,735
but I can't be his equal. Right?

443
00:24:59,736 --> 00:25:01,035
Where did you learn that?

444
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:03,536
Officer Takagi. Ahead! Look ahead!

445
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,035
We heard about it from the lady on the mini-patrol car.

446
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:08,036
You mean Yumi?

447
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:10,936
She told us in detail.

448
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:14,135
Then, Officer Matsuda decided at that time

449
00:25:14,136 --> 00:25:19,035
to risk his life to tell us where the other bomb was planted.

450
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:20,935
Yes, yes.

451
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:25,535
Well, time's up. I have to hang up now.

452
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:27,735
Wait, Matsuda!

453
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:30,436
Matsuda...

454
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:37,735
You can't listen to it or tell it without tears.

455
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,236
Yeah.

456
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:42,335
Oh, yeah?

457
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:45,236
I wouldn't blame you for giving up.

458
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:51,335
The memory of one who's gone is sealed

459
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:55,235
and will be kept in the heart for a life time.

460
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:56,835
Like someone I know.

461
00:25:56,836 --> 00:26:00,236
Hey! I'm not dead yet.

462
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,535
How did you do on the math test?

463
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:16,136
Bummers.

464
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:22,335
Unlike you, I have nobody to help me in my difficulties.

465
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,635
Help me?

466
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:25,535
You can't fool me, Ran.

467
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:31,135
You were often looking at Shinichi's desk for the right answers.

468
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,935
"Help, Shinichi!

469
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:37,635
I have trouble solving this derivative, integral problem."

470
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:38,636
Be honest about it.

471
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:41,735
No, you're wrong! I looked at Shinichi's desk because...

472
00:26:41,736 --> 00:26:43,835
Because? Keep on!

473
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,036
Because...

474
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:58,135
You're blushing crimson.

475
00:26:58,136 --> 00:27:01,035
Red is a sinister color during test time.

476
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,036
Speaking of red,

477
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,535
there has been so many police sirens since this morning.

478
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:07,535
True. You're right.

479
00:27:07,536 --> 00:27:09,836
What's happened?

480
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:19,535
Red, red...

481
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:21,135
What's the matter with red?

482
00:27:21,136 --> 00:27:23,135
Something does not fit.

483
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:26,235
This "climb up the bloody mound" means.

484
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:29,035
You mean that it's not a red train?

485
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:32,935
It's kind of... not right.

486
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:37,035
Now, wait. If it's like the case 3 years before,

487
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:38,435
the first bomb is set in a place

488
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:42,736
that's rather easy for the police to find.

489
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,035
I have to think more simply.

490
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:47,436
The simpler the better.

491
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:51,435
Something that reminds you of red?

492
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,635
Mailboxes, fire engines...

493
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:56,035
Red demon, little red riding hood...

494
00:27:56,036 --> 00:28:00,435
Tomato, strawberries, watermelon, apple,

495
00:28:00,436 --> 00:28:04,335
cherries, hot chili pepper, red salmon and red lobsters...

496
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:09,335
Red... climb... steel... box...

497
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:12,035
Genta, you only think about food.

498
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:15,035
I've used up my brain, now I'm hungry.

499
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:17,735
I'm kinda thirsty.

500
00:28:17,736 --> 00:28:22,036
Well, then we can go and stop at some parking area.

501
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:26,435
Red, you say. There's another red over there.

502
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:28,635
Look, you can see it over there.

503
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:30,236
Yeah.

504
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:36,435
I see.

505
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:40,036
Red, climb up, box of steel...
