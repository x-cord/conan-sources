1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,519
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,519
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,919
The client is a famous child star.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,919
Search for mother ends up in a hot spring dive.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,519
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,219
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,320
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:57,975
If I get married,

9
00:01:57,976 --> 00:01:59,975
what are you going to do, Kanichi?

10
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:01,275
So, you're going to get married after all.

11
00:02:01,276 --> 00:02:02,875
I try so hard to stop you,

12
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,975
but you just won't listen.

13
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:06,475
Dad.

14
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,476
Why you...

15
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:11,175
Pops...

16
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,975
Dad.

17
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:15,375
Hey, Dad, are you listening to me?

18
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:18,175
Shut up. Be quiet, will you?

19
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:21,075
This is Yoko's best scene, you know.

20
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:25,275
Kanichi, I will never forget you.

21
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:26,875
This is the scene of the beach in Atami

22
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:30,175
where Kanichi and Omiya appear in the story "Konjiki Yasha", right?

23
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:32,375
Just how many times are you going to watch that video?

24
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:35,176
I, Kanichi will go mad of extreme grief...

25
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:37,775
Hey, Ran!

26
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,675
Never mind the video.

27
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,475
Tell me why you refused Mom's invitation

28
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,875
to go eat together!

29
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:48,475
Oh, yeah. That day's inconvenient for me.

30
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:49,875
May I ask in just what way is it inconvenient for you?

31
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:51,275
Who cares?

32
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:53,475
I mean, it's not that she's dead or anything

33
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:55,775
and we get to see her anytime.

34
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,375
"Konjiki Yasha" was never completed

35
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:02,076
because the author died while he was still writing the story.

36
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,375
So the two characters in the series

37
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:07,875
lost their way to happiness forever.

38
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:09,675
In our case, we're going to see it through

39
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:13,176
and make it no matter what.

40
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,175
I hope you're not thinking

41
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:19,675
of trying to get Eri and me back together again, are you?

42
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,175
Of course I am!

43
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:23,275
It's only natural for kids

44
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:26,175
to want to live happily with both their parents, isn't it?

45
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:27,876
That's nonsense.

46
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:36,175
There are people who abhor even looking at their parent's faces.

47
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:37,875
"Kazuki Kinukawa (7), Talent."

48
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:40,175
And I'm one of them.

49
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,975
What's with this brat?

50
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:43,575
Huh?

51
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:45,676
You sure look familiar.

52
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,475
Are you by any chance,

53
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:50,575
Kazuki Kinukawa, the popular child actor

54
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:52,975
who acts in dramas and movies?

55
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:54,676
Yeah, I am.

56
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:58,075
You're even cuter than you look on TV!

57
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,675
And? What does that famous brat

58
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:03,275
want with our detective office here?

59
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,676
I want you to look for somebody.

60
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:08,875
A woman called Atsuko who keeps sending me

61
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,676
postcards like these.

62
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:16,476
"The Little Client (Part 1)"

63
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,275
It's true that all there is here is the name of the sender

64
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,175
and no address.

65
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:29,175
Wait a minute. Aren't these fan letters?

66
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:30,575
It's full of comments

67
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:33,375
about the dramas and movies that you acted in!

68
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:35,775
She seems to be a really great fan of yours.

69
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,075
She's sent you postcards

70
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,475
once every month from spring two years ago

71
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,375
to winter last year.

72
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:44,375
But all of them are stained and wrinkled up.

73
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,875
You should put these away nicely if they're fan letters.

74
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,275
I can't help it, can I?

75
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:51,975
They gave me the creeps, so I just kind of left them lying around.

76
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,275
Give you the creeps?

77
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:56,776
Because they're not fan letters.

78
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:00,875
They're postcards from my mother.

79
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,175
Your mother?

80
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,176
Yeah.

81
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,375
They're postcards from a stupid lady,

82
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,975
who abandoned me in front of the door of a church

83
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,175
as if I were a piece of trash six years ago.

84
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,775
I see. That's why you mentioned

85
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:14,375
not wanting to see your parent's face.

86
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:16,675
But if you want us to look for her,

87
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:19,075
it means that you want to see her after all.

88
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:20,476
Don't get me wrong.

89
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:25,275
I just want to see the lady and give her a piece of my mind.

90
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:27,175
I want to tell her not to claim being my mother

91
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,876
at this point just because I'm famous now!

92
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,875
But it's amazing how you figured out it was your mother.

93
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,375
It doesn't say so anywhere.

94
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:38,675
I can tell.

95
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:39,775
Because the name and the handwriting on the postcard

96
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,775
are the same as they were on the memo

97
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,575
that was left with me when she abandoned me.

98
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,275
Looking for her is not going to be easy though.

99
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:47,975
The postcards are stamped from different places,

100
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,875
all the way from Hokkaido to Okinawa.

101
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:54,276
You can tell that she really likes to travel.

102
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,876
Never mind then.

103
00:05:57,976 --> 00:06:00,775
I'll go look for another detective that will search for her.

104
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,775
I think that your mother's in a hotel or inn

105
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:06,375
some place in Atami.

106
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:08,975
Where is it written?

107
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:11,275
Look at this postcard.

108
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:12,675
There is something that looks like the hand

109
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:15,475
and head of a statue on the bottom part, right?

110
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,776
Doesn't this statue look familiar?

111
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:21,976
Now that you mentioned it, it does look familiar.

112
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:24,776
I see!

113
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:27,975
It's this!

114
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,075
It looks just like this pose

115
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:31,775
which means it's probably the statue of Kanichi and Omiya

116
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:33,875
at the beach in Atami!

117
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,475
She probably used the top part of the postcard set

118
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:39,176
which was made up of four postcards.

119
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,175
It could be that she used something that she bought as a souvenir too.

120
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:46,875
But there are three other postcards like it too.

121
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,375
And they're all the upper left ones.

122
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,175
If she's rich enough to travel to inns throughout Japan,

123
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:54,375
I think she would send all four types of postcards.

124
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,975
And I'm sure that postcards of other places

125
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,575
would be mixed among them, right?

126
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,875
I get it! I think your mother

127
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:03,375
didn't want you to know where she was,

128
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,575
so she sent only the postcards on the top left

129
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:06,775
because it's the hardest to tell from these

130
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:09,475
that it's the statue of Kanichi and Omiya.

131
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:11,675
She probably used postcards that remained

132
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:12,676
after everything else was sold out

133
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,475
from the shop at a hotel or an inn.

134
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,375
Then she probably gave it to the guests that came to stay,

135
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:18,675
asking them to send the postcard out

136
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:20,575
after they returned to their homes.

137
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:21,675
I see.

138
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:24,775
People from all over Japan come to hotels or inn,

139
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:26,375
so if we check the hotel roster,

140
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:27,575
we can figure out where they came from.

141
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,775
Which means your mother is

142
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:33,175
an employee of a hotel or an inn.

143
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:35,875
Why don't we take a drive to Atami either way?

144
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,776
Well, I don't see why not.

145
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,575
But you're going to pay the fee if we find her, right?

146
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:44,275
Yes, a whole lot.

147
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:47,176
Unlike that lady, I'm rich.

148
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,775
Come on, let's go and get it over with.

149
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:56,475
My schedule's open only today and tomorrow.

150
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,275
What a nasty kid.

151
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:01,375
You're kind of like Conan.

152
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,676
How dare you...

153
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:09,375
No, I have no idea.

154
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:12,575
We don't carry postcards like these here.

155
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,775
I see.

156
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:15,176
Thank you very much.

157
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:23,075
We came all the way to Atami

158
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:24,675
and we're sweating it out here

159
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:27,675
without even going to a hot spring.

160
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:31,276
Maybe a postcard doesn't suffice as a lead after all.

161
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,675
Ran.

162
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:40,976
Carry me please!

163
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:45,375
If you're tired, I'll piggy back you.

164
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,575
I want to be carried!

165
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:48,475
I want to be hugged, not be piggy backed!

166
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:49,776
Hey, you...

167
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:52,776
Talk about being spoiled.

168
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:56,175
-Hey. -I think this is the spot

169
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:58,375
where that lady had a mole.

170
00:08:58,376 --> 00:08:59,376
Huh?

171
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:04,075
I remember going to sleep

172
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,776
and seeing the mole in front of my eyes.

173
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,875
But I was much smaller back then,

174
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:12,875
so maybe it was further down.

175
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,476
Hey, if it was further down...

176
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:20,475
Well, will you carry me one more time?

177
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,075
Okay.

178
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:24,075
You don't have to do that.

179
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:26,075
We already have an idea on where it is.

180
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,275
But I want to be sure...

181
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,876
You don't have to. We already know.

182
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,675
What? You used to sell it?

183
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,075
Do you mean this postcard?

184
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,175
Yes.

185
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,975
It was a limited product that was only sold here,

186
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:44,775
but these sets of four postcards didn't sell too well.

187
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:46,075
"Mitsu Kusano (34)" -Having no other choice,

188
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:48,775
"Female employee" -we divided them among ourselves

189
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,675
since we couldn't return them to the publisher either.

190
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:53,575
Amazing! It's just like you said, Conan.

191
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,475
Please excuse me for asking this inappropriate question.

192
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,475
Is there a woman

193
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:02,275
by the name of Atsuko working here?

194
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:05,575
No, there's no one by that name here.

195
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:07,476
Is that so?

196
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,075
By any chance, are you that famous...

197
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:16,575
Yes. I'm the famous Detective Mouri.

198
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:19,175
Kazuki Kinukawa?

199
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,475
Yes.

200
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:22,475
Oh, my. Just as I thought!

201
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:24,075
Come over here, Ms. Bessho!

202
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:25,575
It's Kazuki!

203
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,375
"Toshika Bessho (29), Female employee."

204
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,976
Hello...

205
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:33,575
That's strange.

206
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:35,975
She's a fervent fan of yours.

207
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,576
I wonder if she's shy.

208
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:40,675
So? What's up today?

209
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:43,275
Did you come to spend the night here?

210
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,876
Well, the thing is...

211
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:48,275
I'll bet you came to look for her.

212
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:49,975
"Yasuhiro Kamoshita (37)" -Your mother...

213
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:51,275
"Freelance writer" -who abandoned you.

214
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,575
Hey, who are you anyway?

215
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,575
A guest. I'm just a guest.

216
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:59,875
I'm Kamoshita, the one who reserved room 205.

217
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,275
I came here just to check things out,

218
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,276
but I guess it's my lucky day

219
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:05,275
to have the entire cast out here.

220
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,476
This is surely going to make a great story.

221
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:11,876
How come he knows about the kid's mother?

222
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:15,376
Will you be spending the night here?

223
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,875
Why don't we stay?

224
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:21,175
Maybe Kazuki's mother

225
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:23,976
is working here under a different name.

226
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:26,575
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

227
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:28,175
I was planning to stay anyway.

228
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:29,575
That's great!

229
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:32,476
Then, I can stay a while longer with Kazuki.

230
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:35,575
Okay, then.

231
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:36,975
Ms. Saegusa.

232
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,875
"Tomoka Saegusa (28)" -Please show them to room 308.

233
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,275
"Female employee" -where we had a cancellation.

234
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:41,276
Yes.

235
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,775
This is room 308.

236
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:46,675
The yukata and mattresses are in the closet,

237
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,075
so help yourselves.

238
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,775
Hey!

239
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,875
Can't you be a bit more explicit?

240
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,575
Quiet. We're so busy as it is

241
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:57,975
that we can't be bothered with extra guests, you know.

242
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:00,676
Don't push your weight around just because you're a bit famous!

243
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:10,576
Is that the right attitude towards their guests?

244
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:15,175
You gave me your word, editor.

245
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:18,475
Keep a page open for me, okay?

246
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:21,876
If this isn't duff gen, the book will sell well.

247
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,375
Because it's about the number one kid actor,

248
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:28,175
Kazuki Kinukawa's father

249
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:32,176
being a killer.

250
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:40,397
I'm really full.

251
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:45,063
Thanks to you, we end up taking a bath so late.

252
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,164
You drink too much beer.

253
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,764
What's the matter?

254
00:12:56,464 --> 00:12:59,163
Oh, it's the cap of a camera lens.

255
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:02,263
Could this belong to the Kamoshita guy we saw a while ago?

256
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,963
Now that you mentioned it...

257
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,963
I'll go give it to him.

258
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:09,064
I'm sure he said he was staying in room 205.

259
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:13,963
Hey, Ran! Let him be! He's so weird!

260
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:17,464
I tell you. She doesn't give a hoot about anything I say.

261
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,764
Guys and girls get to go in together?

262
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:24,863
I hope somebody's inside!

263
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:25,963
How silly.

264
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:28,564
At this time of night, I doubt anybody is inside.

265
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:33,063
Gosh!

266
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,464
Oh, good evening.

267
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:38,063
Excuse me.

268
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,163
Please help yourself.

269
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:40,963
Being able to take a bath with Kazuki

270
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:43,463
will be a memory of a life time!

271
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:44,763
But...

272
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:47,163
Quit being a prude.

273
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:50,863
Oh, I just noticed that all three of you

274
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:54,764
have such attractive moles.

275
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:01,963
Do you always take a bath at this time?

276
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:07,263
Yes. We wait till all the guests are done.

277
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:11,063
By the way, where's the girl that was with you?

278
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:13,663
My daughter, Ran, went to Mr. Kamoshita's room

279
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:14,864
to deliver something he dropped.

280
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:17,364
Ran?

281
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:24,663
Ran!

282
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,264
Don't tell me that guy had the nerve to touch her!

283
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:29,764
Hey, what's wrong?

284
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:32,564
That...

285
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:45,763
Did he drown?

286
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:47,763
No. The trace on his neck

287
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:49,563
shows that he was strangled.

288
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:52,663
Hey, look. There's a cell phone on the floor.

289
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:54,063
What?

290
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:57,063
A picture seems to have been saved just a while ago.

291
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,063
Don't tell me the killer's picture is...

292
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,263
This is...

293
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:03,764
a mole on a woman's chest?

294
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:10,563
I see.

295
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:13,763
So you picked up Mr. Yasuhiro Kamoshita's camera cap in the corridor

296
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:15,863
and delivered it to his room,

297
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,563
where you found Mr. Kamoshita dead.

298
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:20,063
Is that right?

299
00:15:20,064 --> 00:15:21,064
Yes.

300
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:25,063
Just as Mr. Mouri had said,

301
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:27,763
it seems he was strangled

302
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:30,263
with a thin string-like thing.

303
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,263
If so, was the body put inside the bath tub

304
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:36,163
to complicate our job of determining the estimated time of death?

305
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:41,063
But the killer could not deceive me, Kogoro Mouri!

306
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:42,163
Just what do you mean?

307
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:44,963
It's in this camera.

308
00:15:44,964 --> 00:15:46,963
Inside Mr. Kamoshita's cell phone...

309
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:48,163
Wait.

310
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:51,864
I don't think you should say that yet.

311
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:55,163
Why not?

312
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,863
Oh, my.

313
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:59,763
You're the one who appears on TV a lot.

314
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:01,963
I'm Kazuki Kinugawa.

315
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:03,263
He came with us to this inn

316
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:05,463
because of some personal matter.

317
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,963
I see.

318
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:09,863
All right. You kids go back to the room.

319
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:11,064
Inspector Yokomizo.

320
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:14,563
According to the people of the inn,

321
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:17,463
Mr. Kamoshita called one of the waitresses

322
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:19,463
and said something weird.

323
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:20,863
Something weird?

324
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:22,563
He said, "If 20 million yen sounds familiar to you,

325
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,363
then come to my room.

326
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:28,163
If you don't, I'll disclose everything."

327
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,663
I have no idea what the 20 million yen is about,

328
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:32,363
but Mr. Kamoshita must've had hold

329
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:37,263
of something the waitress wanted to keep secret.

330
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,663
If so, it's seems like we already have the killer.

331
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:42,263
We can look at the picture in his cell phone.

332
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:43,863
All we have to do is find a waitress

333
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:48,463
who had no alibi at the time the picture was taken here.

334
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:51,563
This is indeed a picture of the murder site!

335
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:54,363
See. It's shown below, isn't it?

336
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:56,764
It says 11:48 pm.

337
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:59,463
There is a mole on the chest of the woman

338
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:02,563
who was choking Mr. Kamoshita's neck from behind.

339
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,663
Bummers.

340
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:04,863
There's no doubt about it!

341
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:08,763
The killer is a woman with a mole on her chest, Mr. Mouri!

342
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:09,764
True.

343
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,963
That means the killer is...

344
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,564
The killer is my...

345
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:17,664
Kazuki?

346
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,164
Wipe yourself.

347
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:43,764
Kazuki, where are you?

348
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:54,463
You came to this inn to look for Kazuki Kinukawa's mother.

349
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:55,464
Yeah.

350
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,163
The clue to his mother

351
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:59,963
was that she has a mole on her chest.

352
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,763
But I didn't think that there'd be a mole

353
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:03,563
on the chest of this killer too.

354
00:18:03,564 --> 00:18:05,363
It's obvious, isn't it?

355
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,263
I wonder if Mr. Kamoshita is the one

356
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,663
who really took this picture.

357
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,363
The picture is static

358
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:14,263
and conveniently, the face of the killer was not taken.

359
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:17,763
It could be that the killer took this picture deliberately

360
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,263
and rigged the time and date on it

361
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,963
to create an alibi.

362
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:23,764
I don't think so.

363
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:27,163
Not him again.

364
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:30,663
Because the killer had the string around the man's neck

365
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:32,963
and was pulling the string with both hands, right?

366
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:34,263
The killer couldn't have pressed the shutter

367
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:36,663
with both hands full!

368
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:38,463
Besides, if the killer took the picture,

369
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,663
I think she would wear some clothes

370
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:42,663
so that you can't tell if it's a man or a woman.

371
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,163
You're right.

372
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,863
The killer probably didn't know that a picture was being taken.

373
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:49,563
Right, Pops?

374
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:50,863
Yeah.

375
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,063
Why did Mr. Kamoshita have his cell phone on him

376
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:56,063
when he was being attacked by the killer?

377
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:58,363
Maybe he was talking to somebody?

378
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:01,063
Then, why don't you try the re-dial button?

379
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:02,964
Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

380
00:19:05,164 --> 00:19:06,763
It seems he was talking to someone

381
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:09,063
10 minutes before he took the picture.

382
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,663
"Tohto Publications."

383
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:12,863
What? Kamoshita was?

384
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:14,163
Are you serious, officer?

385
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:16,263
Yes. If you don't mind,

386
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:18,563
I'd like you to give me your name and tell me what you do.

387
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:21,863
I'm Izumiya, the editor of "Weekly Hot" magazine.

388
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:23,463
Kamoshita is a writer

389
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,863
who brings us a lot of scoop articles.

390
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,263
He called to tell me

391
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:29,263
that the woman with the scoop story

392
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:31,063
came to his room a little after 11:30 pm.

393
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:34,763
He said that the woman wanted to take a shower in his room

394
00:19:34,764 --> 00:19:37,763
to wash off her sweat before the interview.

395
00:19:37,764 --> 00:19:39,163
He also told me not to worry

396
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:41,563
because he'd make sure that he took a picture of the woman

397
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:43,064
with his cell phone.

398
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:46,463
And who is this woman with the scoop?

399
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:48,563
The mother called Atsuko, who left the kid actor, Kazuki Kinugawa,

400
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:52,163
in front of the door of a church when he was a baby.

401
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:55,563
She seems to be a devil threatening Kazuki's agency

402
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:57,263
to dish out 20 million yen

403
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,963
if they didn't want her to publicize the fact

404
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:03,063
that his father is a fugitive for killing somebody.

405
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:06,363
Although the agency didn't really believe her story at first,

406
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:07,863
she knew the name of the church

407
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,563
as well as the characteristics of Kazuki's body in detail,

408
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:13,763
so they deposited the amount into her account.

409
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,163
Since all their dealings were carried out by e-mail,

410
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:19,763
he had no idea of what she looked like or how she sounded.

411
00:20:19,764 --> 00:20:22,063
Kamoshita, who smelled that there was a scoop,

412
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:25,863
went to interview her in person.

413
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:28,263
That's why he brought up the 20,000,000 yen

414
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:31,263
to see if anybody would come up front.

415
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,863
Inspector.

416
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:37,764
The waitresses that have no alibi after 11:48 pm are here.

417
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:44,163
What? You are...

418
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:45,863
Hello again.

419
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:48,063
So? What do you want from us?

420
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,663
Did something happen?

421
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:51,763
There was a murder.

422
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:54,063
A man called Mr. Kamoshita, who was staying in this room

423
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:55,663
was strangled to death.

424
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:56,664
What?

425
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:58,864
-No way. -Are you serious?

426
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:05,163
I'll have to check your bodies a little bit

427
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,963
and see if any one of you has a mole like this on your chest

428
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:10,163
like the killer whose picture was taken

429
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:12,963
when she killed Mr. Kamoshita.

430
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:14,163
Wait a minute.

431
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,963
Are you telling us to strip naked right here?

432
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:17,263
What?

433
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:20,063
No, of course a female police will be here

434
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:22,363
and you'll be checked in another room.

435
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,063
Okay then.

436
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:26,163
Then hurry up and get on with it.

437
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:28,263
We still have work left to do.

438
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:30,763
There's no need for that!

439
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:33,564
See! I have no mole.

440
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:39,063
Hey, Ms. Bessho.

441
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,064
Right. It's not like we're going to lose anything.

442
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:46,963
Go on, Ms. Kusano.

443
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:49,263
They're going to suspect you if you don't.

444
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:50,264
All right.

445
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:55,064
Cool it, Pops.

446
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,363
You have a mole on your chest!

447
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:01,063
Take a good look, will you?

448
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:03,663
My mole is on the opposite side when compared to the picture.

449
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:04,664
Oh, yeah.

450
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:06,463
Rather than checking on our moles,

451
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:08,563
why don't you go check the fingerprints on the murder weapon?

452
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:10,063
You found it, didn't you?

453
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:12,963
The black string that was in the picture a while ago.

454
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,964
Well, we've been looking for it for a while,

455
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:20,663
but we can't find it anywhere.

456
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:22,763
The black string that is estimated

457
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:24,663
to be over a meter long.

458
00:22:24,664 --> 00:22:28,163
Right. The problems are the murder weapon

459
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:31,064
and that mole.

460
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,663
"Next Episode" -What? He went in?

461
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:03,564
Don't tell me you peeked into the women's bath!

462
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:08,964
I see. I get it now.

463
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:13,963
Kazuki?

464
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:15,663
The sound reminds me of my mother.

465
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:16,863
Huh?

466
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:18,463
So that's the story.

467
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:19,663
That means the most suspicious person

468
00:24:19,664 --> 00:24:22,863
would be the one who tried to hide it.
