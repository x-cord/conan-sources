1
00:00:01,188 --> 00:00:03,687
Kazuha Toyama and Heiji Hattori came to invite us

2
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:07,488
to see the holiday lights everyone's talking about.

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:11,787
While waiting for Ran and Kazuha to finish making dinner,

4
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:15,387
Hattori and I went to kill time at Poirot,

5
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:17,488
the cafe below the agency.

6
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:22,387
That's when Beika University drama club members,

7
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:24,987
"Meisuke Ozumi (21), Beika University Third-Year" -Meisuke Ozumi,

8
00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:27,187
"Yui Yamashita (21), Beika University Third-Year" -Yui Yamashita,

9
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:29,287
"Tengo Anzai (20), Beika University Third-Year" -Tengo Anzai,

10
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:32,987
"Minoru Nagatsuka (20)" -and Minoru Nagatsuka arrived.

11
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:35,287
Have a seat.

12
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:37,988
Let's watch Yui's birthday video together.

13
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:40,987
You finished filming your part, right?

14
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:44,887
Yeah. I just sent it to your laptop.

15
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:45,987
Oh, yeah?

16
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:48,687
But Ozumi's not here yet.

17
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:52,187
He's in the bathroom.

18
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:55,087
Oh, we're going to make some noise.

19
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,488
Don't mind us.

20
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:02,987
It's not turning on.

21
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:05,087
Is the battery dead?

22
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,587
Hey, miss.

23
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:08,187
Could we borrow an outlet?

24
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:09,388
Sure.

25
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:13,887
Here you go.

26
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:14,888
Thanks.

27
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,087
No way. A blackout?

28
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:25,387
I... I just saw a spark.

29
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:27,687
Yeah, from the outlet.

30
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,987
Azusa, check the breaker.

31
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:30,988
Okay.

32
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:37,988
What?

33
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,587
Azusa, hurry.

34
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:40,588
Okay.

35
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:48,788
What's all this noise about?

36
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:54,787
"Coffee Poirot"

37
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:57,287
There's no need to call the police.

38
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:59,187
When he was stabbed,

39
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,187
some blood flew onto my face.

40
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,687
And onto my glasses, too.

41
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:08,387
His blood must've gotten

42
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:11,688
on the culprit's hands or sleeves.

43
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,488
You can't be serious.

44
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:20,487
Why isn't there any blood on anyone?

45
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:24,587
Listen, detectives, you seem to think we did it.

46
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:27,287
Couldn't it have been an outsider?

47
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:30,287
Maybe someone was waiting outside the store

48
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:33,587
for the blackout and came inside to stab him with night vision goggles?

49
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,288
That seems unlikely.

50
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:39,087
Why do you say that?

51
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:42,887
Immediately after that man was stabbed and screamed,

52
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:46,387
I stood in front of the entrance

53
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:50,887
so no one could get out.

54
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:51,987
Really?

55
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:54,187
That's why you were standing next to the door

56
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:57,287
when the lights came on.

57
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:58,887
Yes.

58
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,787
You must have pretty good night vision.

59
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:02,887
No.

60
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:05,887
I just happened to be using my phone to...

61
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,487
listen to music.

62
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,187
I used that faint light.

63
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:13,587
Music?

64
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:18,087
Come to think of it, you haven't told us your name yet.

65
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:20,087
My name?

66
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,187
I'm Shinichi Wada.

67
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:24,187
I work in medicine.

68
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:27,188
Shinichi Wada?

69
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,587
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

70
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,987
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

71
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:38,787
A case at the Poirot Cafe is tackled by Heiji, Amuro,

72
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:40,387
and the mysterious Shinichi Wada.

73
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:41,987
He sees through the one and only truth.

74
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,887
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

75
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:46,488
His name is Detective Conan!

76
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:31,861
"Solving Mysteries at the Poirot Cafe (Part 2)"

77
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:37,460
He's got the same name as you.

78
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,160
Huh?

79
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:41,861
Conan, isn't your name Conan?

80
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:48,960
No. He meant to say "your favorite Shinichi".

81
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:53,060
Heiji can be unclear sometimes.

82
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,460
Sorry.

83
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,561
I see...

84
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:00,860
Anyway, Kudo, do you know who did it?

85
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,760
No, not yet.

86
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:07,260
I thought of a trick to avoid getting blood on yourself, though.

87
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:09,460
You, too?

88
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:12,960
But the person who could've used the trick...

89
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,960
Couldn't have committed the crime.

90
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:19,061
Darn. I gotta solve this quick so we can go to Kinza.

91
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,560
Hey.

92
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,660
Yui Yamashita.

93
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,560
What is it?

94
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:33,660
You said you and Anzai are just childhood friends,

95
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,361
but that's not true, is it?

96
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,161
If there's something going on, could you tell me?

97
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,160
It might help us solve the case.

98
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,461
Sorry, but I can't say.

99
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,261
But...

100
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:48,261
It's...

101
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:52,061
a secret I have to keep to protect someone.

102
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,560
When I was your age,

103
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:58,560
I didn't think I had any secrets either.

104
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,861
Is that so?

105
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:08,960
Honestly, I have way too many secrets at the moment.

106
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,961
Hey, Kudo.

107
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:14,560
You know how late the Kinza lights are staying on?

108
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:16,261
No.

109
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:24,360
"From between long clouds blown by the fall wind,

110
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,260
the moonlight shining through is beautiful indeed."

111
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,761
One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets?

112
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:33,760
I see.

113
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:36,560
So that's how it is.

114
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:39,461
I know exactly what happened.

115
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,060
Hey, detectives.

116
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,261
Can't we go now?

117
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,060
I'm sorry that Anzai got stabbed,

118
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:55,760
but none of us did it.

119
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,060
There's no blood on anyone.

120
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,960
I don't think we could've stabbed anyone

121
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,960
in the pitch blackness of the blackout.

122
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,760
You'd need night vision goggles.

123
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,260
I was in the bathroom since before the blackout,

124
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:10,460
so I couldn't have stabbed him.

125
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:14,360
The peephole in the bathroom door is made with frosted glass.

126
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:18,260
I couldn't have known who was sitting where.

127
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:20,261
"From between long clouds..."

128
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:26,760
"From between long clouds blown by the fall wind,

129
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:30,760
the moonlight shining through is beautiful indeed."

130
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,660
Where did that come from?

131
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,960
One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets?

132
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:39,260
It's a poem by Sakyo no Daibu Akisuke.

133
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:43,260
It means the moon seen through clouds blown

134
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:47,060
by the fall wind is super pretty.

135
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,660
And the culprit also saw

136
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:52,561
who was sitting where through a gap.

137
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,760
What are you doing?

138
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,760
Oh, nothing. Don't mind me.

139
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:01,660
Right?

140
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:03,060
The man who was hiding in the bathroom

141
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,560
and secretly watching through the peephole.

142
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:09,161
I'm asking you, Meisuke Ozumi.

143
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:11,361
What?

144
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:13,660
Hey, Ozumi.

145
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:16,361
Is this true, Ozumi?

146
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:19,460
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,960
Didn't you hear me?

148
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,060
The peephole's made of frosted glass!

149
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,160
Hey, Azusa.

150
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:27,060
Do you have any tape?

151
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:28,061
Yes.

152
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,060
But what do you need this for?

153
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,560
My science teacher told me

154
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:37,860
that if you put tape on the rough side of frosted glass,

155
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,261
it's like normal glass.

156
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:42,860
Really?

157
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:45,561
Try putting some tape on the peephole and look through it.

158
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:47,861
Okay.

159
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,560
You're right.

160
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,261
I can see through the spot covered by the tape.

161
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:04,260
Can you see me?

162
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:05,860
You're right.

163
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:07,860
I wouldn't call it totally transparent,

164
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:11,660
but you can see who's sitting where.

165
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,460
But why?

166
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:18,160
It's difficult to see through the frosted glass because tiny scratches

167
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:20,760
on its surface reflect light,

168
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,060
making it appear cloudy.

169
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:25,460
By putting tape over it,

170
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:28,960
the adhesive on the tape fills the scratches in the glass,

171
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,260
flattening the surface and making it transparent.

172
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:36,660
But I don't have any tape on me.

173
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:41,360
There was tape on the birthday present you got for Yui.

174
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,860
After looking through the frosted glass,

175
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:46,360
you could've put it back on the present.

176
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:49,760
Even if I could see the others through the peephole,

177
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,260
I couldn't have stabbed anyone in the darkness.

178
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:53,561
So you practiced, didn't you?

179
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:58,760
You arranged chairs and tables in your room

180
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,660
in the same layout at this Cafe

181
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,160
so you could stab someone in the dark.

182
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,460
If you built a set of identical

183
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:08,160
to this Cafe for your play last year,

184
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:12,661
those measurements must still be in your drama club room somewhere.

185
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,260
Even if I knew the exact layout,

186
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:19,260
it'd still be hard to stab someone.

187
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,261
Yes.

188
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,260
From the front, their hands would get in the way,

189
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,060
making it difficult to stab them.

190
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:25,860
But from their blindside,

191
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:28,861
as long as you knew where they were sitting, it would be possible.

192
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:31,960
That's why you came first

193
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:35,560
and put your bag on the booth seat,

194
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:39,360
knowing your girlfriend, Yui, would sit next to it.

195
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,760
I see.

196
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:42,860
If the booth seats were occupied,

197
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:47,160
the victim would be forced to sit in either of the chairs opposite them.

198
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:49,160
But... but what about the blood?

199
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:52,261
Even if I could stab him, I would've gotten blood on me!

200
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:58,761
You made sure you wouldn't.

201
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:02,460
Using something

202
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:04,361
you found in the bathroom.

203
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:24,910
It's so pretty!

204
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,110
It's like Tinkerbell's gonna show up any minute.

205
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,811
I know. It's like a dream world.

206
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,911
Hey, Kazuha.

207
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,710
Kazuha?

208
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,910
I'm glad

209
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:58,010
it's just the two of us.

210
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,011
What?

211
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:03,211
If I saw this in person with Heiji,

212
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:07,411
I might've felt something crazy.

213
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:12,511
What a relief.

214
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:20,711
Seriously.

215
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,311
Kazuha!

216
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:31,811
I love you, too, Kazuha!

217
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,010
Heiji doesn't talk like that.

218
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,310
Oh, sorry!

219
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,811
But thanks, Ran.

220
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:53,810
Anyway, I wonder what Heiji's doing.

221
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:56,210
He's not answering his phone.

222
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,310
-Yeah. -You're late.

223
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:00,910
Sorry, sorry.

224
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:04,410
Anyway, you shouldn't have suddenly changed where we'd meet.

225
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,510
I wanted Poirot's sandwiches.

226
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:08,810
You haven't heard?

227
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:10,910
There's something crazy going on at the Cafe.

228
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:13,310
Apparently there was a murder.

229
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,610
Seriously?

230
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,910
Yeah. Some guy was stabbed

231
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:18,811
and taken to the hospital.

232
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:23,410
Toilet paper?

233
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:26,310
He used toilet paper to prevent blood from getting on himself?

234
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:27,311
Yeah.

235
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:29,110
He wrapped it around his arms

236
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:31,710
like a mummy.

237
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:33,010
You idiot.

238
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:36,910
You couldn't block all the blood just by covering your arms.

239
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:39,611
No, that's all you need.

240
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:44,910
You held the cardboard tube around the knife

241
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:47,610
against his back as you stabbed him.

242
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:50,110
By holding the tube in place as you pulled the knife out,

243
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,411
you could avoid getting any blood on yourself.

244
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:57,510
That's why you chose a long knife.

245
00:14:57,511 --> 00:15:01,310
Otherwise you couldn't have stabbed him through the tube.

246
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:05,510
A little blood's bound to come through the tube,

247
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:08,810
but as long as you don't point the opening towards yourself, you're okay.

248
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:11,210
Instead, those of us sitting in front of the tube

249
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,810
got blood all over us.

250
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:15,310
Then you returned to the bathroom

251
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:17,110
and waited for the lights to come back on,

252
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:20,510
flushed the toilet paper wrapped around your arms,

253
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:21,910
and stuck the tube you used

254
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:25,510
back inside the toilet paper.

255
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:28,110
Then you removed the tape from the peephole

256
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:30,410
and stuck it back on the gift

257
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:33,611
and came out of the bathroom.

258
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:38,711
No, you may have removed the tape before the lights came on.

259
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,510
By folding the end of the tape over

260
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:43,210
and making it easier to grab,

261
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:45,610
you could've removed it in the dark.

262
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:50,510
If the bathroom lights came back on first

263
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:53,910
and someone saw the peephole,

264
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,610
they might have noticed that

265
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:59,011
there was something stuck to it.

266
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,010
Either way,

267
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:06,410
the middle of the toilet paper was sticking out slightly.

268
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:10,111
That's a sure sign the tube was forced inside it afterwards.

269
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,910
Therefore,

270
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:16,010
I think the police

271
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:19,211
would find Anzai's blood...

272
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:22,211
and your fingerprints on it.

273
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,210
This can't be true, Ozumi!

274
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:27,611
Ozumi, you'd never stab Tengo.

275
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:30,510
It annoyed me.

276
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:33,310
Why do you call your boyfriend "Ozumi",

277
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,910
when you call Anzai by his given name?

278
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,011
Because we're childhood friends.

279
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,110
You're not just childhood friends, are you?

280
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:44,511
There must be some reason for it!

281
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:47,810
I...

282
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:50,310
See? You can't say it!

283
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:52,110
I'm sure he's your ex or something!

284
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,711
But I had to hurt him because you were keeping secrets from me!

285
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:04,210
Honestly, I was scared since the knife went deeper than I expected.

286
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:05,610
You're wrong.

287
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:07,211
They're probably...

288
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:11,811
half-siblings.

289
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:14,610
What?

290
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:19,610
Yui, you said you were keeping the secret to protect someone,

291
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:23,511
and that you didn't think you had any secrets as a child.

292
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,910
The reason you said "someone" instead of Tengo

293
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:30,110
is because you meant someone related to Anzai,

294
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,810
or in this case, Anzai's father the Dietman.

295
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:37,110
If it wasn't a secret when you were kids,

296
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:40,511
but became one when you grew up,

297
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:44,610
it means it would be a career-ending scandal for a Dietman.

298
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:48,411
In other words, Yui is his lover's secret lovechild...

299
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,411
It's what Heiji said.

300
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:56,111
Yeah, that's right.

301
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,810
Is this true?

302
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:01,110
Yes.

303
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,610
While my parents argued overcompensation,

304
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:08,910
they would leave me and Tengo to play together.

305
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,411
We became close.

306
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:13,310
You're lying.

307
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:15,310
I don't believe this.

308
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:18,511
You're not all pulling my leg, are you?

309
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:24,911
"Incoming Call, From Public Phone" -A phone call?

310
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:29,210
-Who is it? -That hurt, darn it!

311
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:31,011
I'm gonna kill you the next time I see you!

312
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,610
Well, my behavior was hardly worthy of praise.

313
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:39,210
I can see how you got the wrong idea.

314
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:43,810
In any case, I sent Yui's birthday video to your phone.

315
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,410
Check it out.

316
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:48,810
I was going to turn up the volume

317
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:51,410
so you could hear it in the bathroom.

318
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:52,411
Later.

319
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:54,411
You'd better come to visit me.

320
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:59,010
Birthday video?

321
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,910
I have an announcement to make.

322
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:04,210
Yui and I are actually half-siblings.

323
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,410
Yeah.

324
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,410
Since our dad's election is coming up,

325
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,910
Yui said not to say anything,

326
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:12,410
but I don't care!

327
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:16,110
So take good care of my sister, Ozumi.

328
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:18,710
I mean, brother.

329
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:20,511
Later!

330
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:25,911
No...

331
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:30,411
No.

332
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:40,511
Seriously. You should've tried talking to him before stabbing him.

333
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:45,210
Wait, I don't have time for this!

334
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:47,710
I've gotta get to Kinza Block 4!

335
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:49,710
We're not going to Kinza.

336
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,010
We're going to Tokyo Station.

337
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,211
Kazuha!

338
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:57,610
If we don't hurry, we'll miss our train home.

339
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:00,410
Wait, Hattori!

340
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:03,810
We still need to question him about the case.

341
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:07,810
Well, I guess we can interview the people who are still here.

342
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,410
Wait, what?

343
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:12,710
Shinichi Wada is missing.

344
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,010
Shinichi Wada?

345
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:17,010
He was here until a moment ago.

346
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:19,210
There was a strange man by that name

347
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:22,010
claiming to be a medical professional.

348
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:25,910
That may have been a fake name.

349
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:29,010
Shinichi told me once that the translations

350
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:32,410
from the Meiji Era of the Sherlock Holmes stories

351
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,210
were set in Japan.

352
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:38,810
Both Holmes and Watson were Japanese.

353
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:43,410
Watson was an army surgeon named Shinichi Wada.

354
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:46,210
But it's just a possibility.

355
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,110
That's right. And since he called himself Shinichi Wada

356
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:53,710
instead of using Tairoku Komuro, Holmes' Japanese name,

357
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,110
does that mean a Holmes-Esque individual

358
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:59,411
is standing behind him, that feed him hints...

359
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:05,011
in the form of poems?

360
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:35,310
His reasoning skills lived up to his reputation.

361
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:36,910
I was impressed.

362
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:38,710
That wasn't a deduction.

363
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,110
You could hear the sound of something

364
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,010
being ripped off under the man's scream.

365
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,510
A sound?

366
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:49,811
Now that you mention it, I thought I heard something.

367
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:55,110
Anyway, I'm glad

368
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:58,511
that my hint helped Heiji.

369
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:04,210
Though as his future wife,

370
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:06,810
it's only natural.

371
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:10,210
Your recitation of the poem

372
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:12,210
melted my heart.

373
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:14,610
I'm sorry I didn't do a better job.

374
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:20,110
So, what did you think of Heiji?

375
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:23,310
It's no wonder he caught your eye.

376
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:25,610
His appearance, personality, and reasoning abilities

377
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:27,510
leave nothing to be desired.

378
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:30,510
There does seem to be a girl he's interested in,

379
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:33,111
but she's no match for you, Miss Momiji.

380
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,310
I, Iori,

381
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:39,610
shall do everything I can to support you.

384
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:51,911
All the books in the study were donated.

385
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:54,511
I keep them here in this room.

386
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:57,710
It looks like an ordinary box to me.

387
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,010
Yes.

388
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:00,610
It's exactly the kind of thing

389
00:24:00,611 --> 00:24:03,411
that moonlit magician-thief goes after.

390
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,911
