1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,359
I think I overate a bit from morning.

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,859
I guess I'll run home then.

3
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,259
Good morning.

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:15,659
Good morning, sir!

5
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,359
Good morning, you're out early.

6
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,159
I'm not anyone suspicious.

7
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,259
Did somebody drop it?

8
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,259
It looks to be so.

9
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,359
My!

10
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,259
I won't steal this.

11
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,459
It's exactly 30,000,000 yen!

12
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,259
Nobody's reported anything missing yet?

13
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:04,359
No.

14
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,259
But, I'm glad that you're the one who picked it up, Mr. Takagi.

15
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,459
So, you're a police detective.

16
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,659
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

17
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,959
So, you're running that course every morning, Ms. Sasamoto?

18
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,159
Yes, but I sure hope that it's returned

19
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,759
to the person who dropped it as soon as possible.

20
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:23,959
Yes.

21
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,759
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

22
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,659
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

23
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,259
30,000.000 yen is in the bag that is picked up.

24
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,359
What was the real purpose of the owner?

25
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,959
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,059
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,559
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:25,131
"Officer Takagi Picks Up 30,000,000 Yen"

29
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:29,131
If I know a person who was carrying a brown bag.

30
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:31,131
Yes, although it's not even certain

31
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:34,131
that the one who dropped it lives around here either.

32
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,331
I'll try asking the neighbors for you too, then.

33
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,731
Thank you very much.

34
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:40,631
You did it, Officer Takagi!

35
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,731
I heard you picked up a huge sum of money?

36
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:45,331
You folks, why do you know about that?

37
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:48,431
After all, we're members of the Youth Detective Squad.

38
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,831
If the person who dropped it doesn't appear,

39
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,531
then six months later it's going to become yours, isn't it?

40
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:55,531
You'll be a billionaire!

41
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,931
No, it won't turn out that way.

42
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,531
Because it's the duty of a police officer to turn in lost and found goods.

43
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:05,731
Shoots, you mean I can't get you to treat me eels over rice?

44
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:07,631
I told you so.

45
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:11,631
We'll help you look for the person who dropped it too, then.

46
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,631
We don't have school today so we've got a lot of time too.

47
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,631
Okay!

48
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:17,131
You picked it up early this morning, is that right?

49
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,231
Yes, about 6:00 am.

50
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:20,531
Since today is my day off,

51
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,731
I slept over last night at my friend's house near here.

52
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:29,031
Then while I was jogging along with a woman called Ms. Sasamoto,

53
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:31,331
I found it right about here.

54
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,131
Right in the middle of the road?

55
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,131
Yeah.

56
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:40,331
What an idiot, to drop a bag full of cash.

57
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,631
Takagi, let's me and you join hands.

58
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,631
If we tell them that I, a civilian picked it up...

59
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:49,131
Hello.

60
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:51,531
Yes. That's right.

61
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:53,531
The person who dropped the bag appeared?

62
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:56,131
So, if you're ever in trouble again,

63
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:58,031
just holler.

64
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,931
I wonder what he came for?

65
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:04,231
"Toshiyuki Hiranuma (45)" -Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma.

66
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,331
He's the one who dropped the bag, correct?

67
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:07,731
Correct.

68
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:11,831
It seems that Mr. Hiranuma's wife recently passed away of an illness,

69
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,231
and the 30,000,000 yen was money from the life insurance.

70
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,631
I see.

71
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:20,431
But, Mr. Hiranuma, how did you happen to drop that money?

72
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:23,531
Well, it's an embarrassing story but...

73
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,231
I have a friend in Beikacho

74
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,031
and I was going to show it to him.

75
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:32,231
You mean you took 30,000,000 yen just to brag about it?

76
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,831
Yes, sort of.

77
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:36,931
So, I drank up and came back in a good mood.

78
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,331
When I got up this morning,

79
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:40,931
I realized that the bag was gone and went pale.

80
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:44,731
Which means that you dropped it not this morning, but last night?

81
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,131
Yes.

82
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:47,531
I understand.

83
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,931
However, because the cash amount is large,

84
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:52,431
we can't give it back to you right away.

85
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,031
I see.

86
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,131
Is that paint?

87
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:01,131
Thank you. I wonder where I got it on?

88
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:04,431
Okay, then, after preparations to give the bag back to you are made,

89
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,131
the station will contact you.

90
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,131
Thank you.

91
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:09,931
It's not that I'm in a rush so that's fine.

92
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:15,231
The person who dropped the bag came out quite easily.

93
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,131
We, the Detective Squad didn't get a chance to help.

94
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:19,631
No fun.

95
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:26,331
Officer, I was just about to go to the police box now.

96
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,931
Granny that I saw this morning.

97
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:30,831
It wasn't there?

98
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:34,231
Yes. I think it was about 5:00 am.

99
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:37,631
When I passed there to deliver newspaper,

100
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,031
there was nothing like that there.

101
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:43,031
Which means that Mr. Hiranuma probably dropped it

102
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:45,231
after the newspaper delivery man passed there.

103
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,031
Creepy.

104
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,631
Is there anything there, Conan?

105
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:59,031
I can't tell yet but...

106
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:04,231
Could this be the traces of Mr. Hiranuma's shoe prints?

107
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:08,431
It's true that Mr. Hirnuma's shoes were dirty.

108
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,831
And besides...

109
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,031
The trace of this paint...

110
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:16,031
is the same one that was on Mr. Hiranuma's shoulder.

111
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,631
Ouch.

112
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:25,931
Then, Conan, are you saying that Mr. Hiranuma was here this morning?

113
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:30,631
Yes. And he put the bag here just before you came, Officer Takagi.

114
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:31,631
Put it here?

115
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:33,531
Because it's hard to believe that no one passed by here

116
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:35,831
between nearly an hour's time that the newspaper delivery man passed here

117
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,131
to when you passed by,

118
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:42,331
no matter how early it was in the morning.

119
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,031
I see.

120
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,831
If he dropped it right before I got there,

121
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,831
I should've seen Mr. Hiranuma when I picked it up.

122
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:50,931
Right.

123
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,431
In other words, back then, Mr. Hiranuma was...

124
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,631
In order to make someone pick up the bag

125
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:57,231
he checked the time using his watch,

126
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,431
put the bag in the middle of the road,

127
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:02,531
and was checking things out from this dilapidated building.

128
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,031
Did somebody drop it?

129
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:07,831
It looks to be so.

130
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:13,131
But, why did he want Officer Takagi to pick it up?

131
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:16,131
I see! Ms. Sasamoto!

132
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:18,631
I passed here by coincidence,

133
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,531
but Ms. Sasamoto said that she jogs here every morning.

134
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:24,331
Then, does it mean that he was trying to make

135
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:26,831
Ms. Sasamoto pick up the 30,000,000 yen?

136
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:30,131
But, it still strange, being that it's such a large sum.

137
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:31,431
Right.

138
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,331
"Hideko Sasamoto" -If so, you can return it to the person who dropped it?

139
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:38,631
I'm glad.

140
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:41,631
It's a man called Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma,

141
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,131
but don't you know him, Ms. Sasamoto?

142
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:45,831
Mr. Hiranuma?

143
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:48,131
No, not that I know of...

144
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:49,731
What about him?

145
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,631
Who is that man?

146
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,231
It seems he's from the police or something.

147
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,631
Police?

148
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,731
It didn't look as if she was playing dumb.

149
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,531
Officer.

150
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:05,931
Yes. What is it?

151
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:08,231
"Kunitaro Oba (50)" -Did you find the culprit?

152
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:10,731
Culprit?

153
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,531
That's not what you're here for?

154
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,531
My name is Oba.

155
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:21,131
I'm the floor chief for this supermarket.

156
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:24,531
And, what's this about Mrs. Sasamoto's husband's case?

157
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:29,831
Mrs. Sasamoto's husband was killed.

158
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:33,131
It's been 15 years already after the 30th of last month,

159
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:36,731
and the culprit still hasn't been caught.

160
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:37,831
If it were in the past,

161
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:39,531
the statute of limitations would've already run out.

162
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,431
Yes.

163
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,631
She's become cheerful now,

164
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:46,431
but back then she would hardly smile

165
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:48,831
and was always looking down.

166
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:58,231
The fact is, I'm getting married with Hideko.

167
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,531
She turned me down when I first proposed to her

168
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:04,031
saying that she felt apologetic to her late husband

169
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:07,231
if only she alone became happy.

170
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,031
But, that's strange, don't you think?

171
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:18,031
Only recently, she has begun to think about her own happiness.

172
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:22,531
The other day, we both went to her husband's grave

173
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:26,731
to ask him to set her free.

174
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:31,031
But it doesn't work out that easily, does it?

175
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,931
If that culprit were to appear...

176
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:37,431
To think that we have to continue hating him again...

177
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,431
Chief!

178
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,531
Sorry, I'll be right there.

179
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:50,031
15 years and still unsolved?

180
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:52,931
That case and the 30,000,000 yen...

181
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:55,331
I wonder if there's no connection.

182
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:57,031
That's too outrageous.

183
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,931
How would they be connected?

184
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:01,231
I still don't know yet but...

185
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:03,531
I get it.

186
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:06,431
I'll try checking on that case then.

187
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:09,631
The case occurred on a certain night 15 years ago

188
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:13,331
on the 4th floor of an office in a multi-functional building.

189
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:15,831
He was probably afraid of the surveillance camera

190
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:17,531
because the culprit climbed up to the 4th floor

191
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:20,131
using a pipe connecting one building to the other.

192
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:22,331
And broke into the office from the veranda.

193
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:26,031
Then, killed Mr. Akio Sasamoto who was working over time alone

194
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:29,131
and stole 5,000,000 yen in cash.

195
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:31,731
But, since the shoe prints of the shoes

196
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:33,831
that the culprit was wearing was left behind,

197
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:36,531
the purchaser's list of the sneaker was made

198
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:40,231
and a thorough investigation was carried out.

199
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:44,931
Mr. Hiranuma's name was also on the purchaser's list.

200
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,731
I see, so that's the story.

201
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:49,231
What do you mean?

202
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,831
For compensation of that case,

203
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:56,431
he tried to give the 30,000,000 yen to Mrs. Sasamoto, his bereaved wife.

204
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:57,931
He wanted her to pick it up.

205
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:00,531
He figured that if he didn't appear as the one who dropped it,

206
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:03,331
it would become hers in 6 months.

207
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:07,931
Then, are you saying that Mr. Hiranuma is the culprit of that case?

208
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,331
No.

209
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:12,531
I thought the same thing at first,

210
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:17,031
but, Conan, Mr. Hiranuma wasn't the culprit.

211
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:21,509
It was impossible for Mr. Hiranuma to commit the crime.

212
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:22,709
What do you mean?

213
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,809
When the investigators visited him,

214
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,409
Mr. Hiranuma had a broken leg.

215
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,709
They confirmed at the hospital that he commuted to

216
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,809
and found that his broken leg was put into a cast

217
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,409
three days before the incident occurred.

218
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:41,309
He couldn't have climbed up to the 4th floor with a broken leg.

219
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,309
With a cast on,

220
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:44,109
he wouldn't have been able to wear sneakers either.

221
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,809
Yeah. The case that occurred 15 years ago

222
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:50,609
and Mr. Hiranuma's 30,000,000 yen isn't connected after all.

223
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:53,809
Thinking that Mr. Hiranuma wanted her to pick it up,

224
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,909
was just an incorrect assumption, I guess.

225
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,209
Telephone. It's from pops.

226
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,409
Hello. Pops, what is it?

227
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,809
It seems that Pops Kogoro was also concerned about that 30,000,000 yen.

228
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,709
When I told him about what I heard just now,

229
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,209
he said for me to tell you Officer Takagi to check on something.

230
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,309
He said he wanted you to check to see

231
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:22,009
if there was someone else who also had a broken leg back then.

232
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:26,409
If Mr. Mouri says so I'll try and check but...

233
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:29,409
He asked if the Youth Detective Squad would help out too.

234
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,709
He wants information on Mr. Hiranuma,

235
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,209
no matter what it may be.

236
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,109
We're going to help the famed detective?

237
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,509
-Aye! Let's start investigation! -Aye!

238
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:42,909
See you later, then.

239
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,409
"Store Closure Notice"

240
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,509
"Organic Food Store, Hiranuma"

241
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:50,009
It seems like this store closed about a month ago.

242
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,309
It seems that his wife who was sick all the while,

243
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:53,609
passed away at around the same time too.

244
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:56,709
It seems Mr. Hiranuma is a very serious and nice man.

245
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,109
Only, there's one strange thing about him lately.

246
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:03,209
It seems he said that he was going to go on a trip for a while,

247
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,709
and yet, it seems he came back that very same day.

248
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,309
It seems to have been about a week ago.

249
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:10,609
A week ago?

250
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:11,609
"Cleaner, Speed Cleaning"

251
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,409
Oh, that.

252
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:16,809
At the end of last month, on the 30th if I remember correctly.

253
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:19,309
But, come to think of it now,

254
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:22,809
Mr. Hiranuma was saying some weird meaningful things

255
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:25,009
from the night before.

256
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:27,709
You really did a good job taking care of her.

257
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,909
But, take it easy from now on.

258
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:35,009
I'm sure your late wife is thinking likewise too.

259
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,309
I would like to if I could I've been planning to do so

260
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,609
since some time ago and yet,

261
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:41,109
when the time comes I get scared.

262
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:43,509
What're talking about?

263
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,509
I... I'm such a wretch.

264
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:53,209
All he did after that was keep saying,

265
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:55,209
"It's not something I can undo with money"

266
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:58,809
And the following morning after that...

267
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:05,609
Mr. Hiranuma, carrying a bag are you going to a hot spring or something?

268
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,309
No, I think I'll go somewhere far away for a while.

269
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,509
Then, you take care too, Mr. Morita.

270
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:18,209
It sounded like he was bidding farewell to this world or something.

271
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,709
In spite of that, at sundown the same day,

272
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,909
he came back saying that he couldn't go on the trip.

273
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,709
What does that mean, Conan?

274
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:32,609
Officer Takagi.

275
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:33,709
Hello.

276
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,409
Kanzaki, drinking beer from daytime?

277
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,109
It's my day off today.

278
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:41,209
-Hello. -Yes, welcome.

279
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,009
-Plain soba, please. -One plain soba!

280
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,409
And?

281
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,909
Well, I missteped on the stairs and broke my right leg.

282
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,809
Back then, Mr. Kanzaki,

283
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,609
I assume you didn't have your health insurance card with you?

284
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:04,909
Who are you? Who told you that?

285
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:10,309
That day Mr. Hiranuma found out...

286
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:13,109
That's why he did what he did.

287
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:21,609
And? What does the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri want with us?

288
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:24,109
I have no idea, either...

289
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,309
Let me introduce you.

290
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,509
This is Mrs. Hideko Sasamoto.

291
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,809
She's the one who picked the bag in question up with me.

292
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,409
Hey, Takagi!

293
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,409
What's with calling me out suddenly like this.

294
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,009
I'm busy too.

295
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,909
What? But, Mr. Mouri, you're the one who...

296
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:44,209
What did I do...

297
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:45,509
It's come!

298
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,409
He fell asleep.

299
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,709
For a Detective as good as I am,

300
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,509
I can see through things just by information

301
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:56,509
that I have heard from others, Mr. Hiranuma.

302
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,309
Just what're you talking about?

303
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,309
Of course, what else but the murder robbery

304
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,309
that you committed 15 years ago.

305
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:06,909
-Don't tell me that... -It's exactly that.

306
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:11,509
But, it was impossible for him to do it, Mr. Mouri.

307
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:13,209
Three days before the incident occurred,

308
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,909
Mr. Hiranuma had broken his leg.

309
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,409
Just because the medical records

310
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,209
and the X-Ray were in Mr. Hiranuma's name,

311
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,509
that's no guarantee that they were really his.

312
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:27,809
Are you saying that Mr. Kanzaki borrowed the health insurance card?

313
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,609
Then, what about the cast?

314
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:33,609
He probably put it together by himself after committing the crime.

315
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:35,809
-But... -There's no proof!

316
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,309
But, Takagi...

317
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:39,809
If Mr. Hiranuma is innocent,

318
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,209
why hasn't he even once retorted since a while ago?

319
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:49,309
I thought it up when Kanzaki broke his leg.

320
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,009
It really hurts.

321
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,009
I'm sure it's broken.

322
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,809
Really, the least you can do is pay your health insurance bill, stupid!

323
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:58,909
I'll lend you mine.

324
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:00,009
I'm not going to get caught, am I?

325
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:02,909
No way. There's no photo on it either.

326
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,309
Right, it's me.

327
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,109
I did it.

328
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:12,309
I'm so very sorry.

329
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:19,109
Back then, I was unreliable, a coward,

330
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:22,209
and a hopeless punk.

331
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,309
But,

332
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:25,809
after meeting a certain woman,

333
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,809
I was reborn.

334
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,809
I married that woman,

335
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,709
and worked with all my might.

336
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:37,909
And, although small, I was able to open a shop of my own.

337
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,909
But the more, we became happier,

338
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:44,909
the more I started to regret the wrongs I did in the past.

339
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:50,909
I thought of turning myself in many times

340
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,409
but, I couldn't.

341
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:57,309
My wife fell ill.

342
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,009
Since my wife was totally alone with no family,

343
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,309
without me caring for her,

344
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,509
she would have no one to look after her.

345
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,909
She passed away a month ago.

346
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:11,409
What I got after that was that 30,000,000 yen.

347
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:14,809
Then, you didn't drop that money after all,

348
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:17,509
but intentionally put it there.

349
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:18,609
Yes.

350
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:21,409
But, why'd you do something so roundabout?

351
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,109
Right! If you felt apologetic,

352
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,909
all you had to do was give it to her directly.

353
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:29,409
I was a coward.

354
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,609
I was scared of being arrested by the police.

355
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,909
Wrong, Mr. Hiranuma.

356
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,609
You came here a week ago, didn't you?

357
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:44,009
And, you were going to give the 30,000,000 yen to Mrs. Sasamoto,

358
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:47,009
then turn yourself in right after.

359
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:49,809
But, you couldn't do so.

360
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:56,909
Back then I heard, when I was here.

361
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:02,709
Mr. Sasamoto, I proposed to Hideko.

362
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:05,509
But, she said...

363
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,309
She feels bad if she alone becomes happy.

364
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,209
She says she feels guilty.

365
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,109
I understand how you feel.

366
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:16,209
But, today already makes 15 years.

367
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:22,109
Please won't you set her free from being the bereaved wife of a victim.

368
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:25,309
It's not that I can forget you but,

369
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,309
I'll put the case behind way deep in the drawer of my heart

370
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:32,309
and try to forget it.

371
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:33,809
Please forgive me.

372
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:36,509
Let's go.

373
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,909
Yes.

374
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,809
I couldn't come up front.

375
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:45,109
Because the bereaved is trying to forget the incident.

376
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,809
You ended up not being able to give her the money for compensation,

377
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:53,109
apologize to her, or even to turn yourself in.

378
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:56,509
If a culprit's that's been on the run for 15 years turns himself in,

379
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:00,209
the media would most naturally avalanche over to the bereaved family

380
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:04,209
when she's trying to make a new start.

381
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,609
But, Mr. Hiranuma...

382
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:11,809
No matter how you may convince yourself,

383
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,009
you can never erase your past.

384
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,209
But, this case is special.

385
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:25,009
Although we cannot erase the fact that it happened,

386
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:27,709
we could bring it to a close.

387
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:30,709
By you serving your sentence, Mr. Hiranuma

388
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:34,309
and by Mrs. Sasamoto accepting that.

389
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,009
And, once you've settled things,

390
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:38,209
there's no need for you to carry the burden of it anymore.

391
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:42,209
Both of you can start off anew.

392
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,909
Right, Takagi?

393
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,009
Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma,

394
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:48,709
please come to the station,

395
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,609
you are charged with homicide robbery.

396
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,609
Yes.

397
00:21:56,209 --> 00:22:00,309
That 30,000,000 yen... won't you please accept it?

398
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:04,309
Please use it when you make a new start.

399
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,009
-Bye. -See you tomorrow!

400
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:34,409
Bye, bye!

401
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:40,709
I forgot!

402
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,909
Where is this?

403
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,509
Sorry, pops.

404
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:56,909
Is anything wrong?

405
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,909
Mr. Tsuge.

406
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,009
I think it's about here.

407
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:08,509
I'll go take a look.

408
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:09,909
Conan!

409
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,409
Is that it?

410
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:17,009
So, that's what the culprit took from the crime scene.

411
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:18,509
Next Conan,

412
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:22,509
"Message from a Client".
