1
00:00:01,594 --> 00:00:03,694
Thanks, Dr. Agasa.

2
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:04,694
Sure.

3
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:15,094
What was Kudo doing here so early on a Sunday morning?

4
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:18,194
He came to get his phone that I repaired.

5
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:23,194
I told him you'd bring it to the soccer game today,

6
00:00:23,194 --> 00:00:25,694
but he said he'd come get it right away.

7
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:35,294
Gosh! 17 received messages?

8
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:38,194
"From Ran: School Trip"

9
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:40,594
They're all from Ran?

10
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:43,694
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

11
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:45,894
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

12
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:47,894
Ran's messages are about the school trip.

13
00:00:47,894 --> 00:00:49,794
I wish I could respond right away.

14
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:51,394
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:53,194
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:55,494
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:42,198
"The Heartfelt Strap (Part 1)"

18
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,798
Yes!

19
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:20,356
Next stop, Beika. Beika.

20
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:23,856
That was amazing!

21
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:26,856
Did you see Hide's long shot?

22
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:27,956
Yes!

23
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:30,756
I can't believe he scored from that far away!

24
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:34,756
BIG Osaka's goalie was surprised, too!

25
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,156
What? A school trip?

26
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:40,056
Yes, for Teitan High School.

27
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:42,056
So, you know...

28
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,856
You want to use the APTX 4869 antidote

29
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:47,756
to restore your body so you can participate, right?

30
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:50,856
I knew you'd understand, Haibara!

31
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,056
No.

32
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,056
What?

33
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:57,656
The effects of the antidote are still only temporary.

34
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:58,956
If you continuously take it

35
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:02,756
in order to remain in your original body during the school trip,

36
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:05,056
there's no telling what kind of side effects there could be.

37
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,256
And besides, when you went to London...

38
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:09,756
What about your passport?

39
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:10,756
What?

40
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:15,956
Oh, crap! I completely forgot about it!

41
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,556
There's one way that you could go, though.

42
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:21,656
You're sure lucky thanks to Ai's great idea.

43
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:24,456
Yeah, I'm grateful.

44
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:27,256
Conan and Doc aren't coming out.

45
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:29,156
Ran!

46
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:30,456
Conan?

47
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:31,856
When did you come out?

48
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,556
Just a while ago.

49
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,656
You didn't see us?

50
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:38,456
The drug didn't wear off for a while,

51
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:41,156
so I had to stay confined in the restroom for 30 minutes.

52
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:44,956
Hello?

53
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:46,756
Sorry, Shinichi.

54
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:49,156
It's me.

55
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,756
Oh, no! It's Shinichi's cell phone!

56
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:57,256
You can hear it, can't you?

57
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,356
The chime of this Big Ben.

58
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,756
This Big Ben...

59
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:06,156
Don't tell me you're here? In London?

60
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:09,856
Shinichi, you can't run away from me anymore.

61
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:13,056
You'd better have a good explanation.

62
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:14,856
Shinichi!

63
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:21,856
Don't tell me you drank the antidote

64
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,456
that you were going to drink upon departure?

65
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:27,456
Shinichi?

66
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:29,056
Sorry.

67
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:31,356
I've come up with an urgent matter,

68
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:32,756
and can't go over there.

69
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:36,556
You've got to really be grateful to Ai!

70
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:37,656
Yeah.

71
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:41,556
And the Shiragami case!

72
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:43,656
I had a local doctor come.

73
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:46,956
I told you, he's fine.

74
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:48,156
But...

75
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:04,256
Haibara! What are you doing here?

76
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:07,156
There's no time to explain.

77
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:09,556
Take this immediately.

78
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,756
Is this...

79
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:16,656
Yes. It's a prototype antidote to the APTX 4869

80
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:20,056
that turned you into a child.

81
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:22,956
The same as the one you took yesterday.

82
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,756
Will it last 24 hours again?

83
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:27,156
You idiot.

84
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:31,456
Just as habitually consuming the same medicine reduces its effects,

85
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:34,956
your body has developed a resistance to that medicine.

86
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:36,556
If you keep using it,

87
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:39,056
its duration decreases, too.

88
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:41,056
If you want to keep your identity hidden,

89
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:45,556
you'll have to say goodbye to them before its effects run out

90
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:47,456
and you turn back into Conan Edogawa.

91
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:51,556
I've saved you countless times with my quick wits

92
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:53,056
when the effects of the medicine expired

93
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,556
and your identity was about to be discovered!

94
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,356
You still haven't learned your lesson?

95
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:58,156
Calm down.

96
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:01,356
I know you're upset because BIG Osaka lost,

97
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:04,456
but you were in a great mood

98
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:07,656
since you got to meet Higo in the stands,

99
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:10,756
who was out of the game due to an injury.

100
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:14,656
I even wore a BIG hat today and cheered for them.

101
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:18,056
You shouldn't have done that.

102
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:19,956
You're the reason they lost!

103
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:23,656
She's still upset over the loss.

104
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:27,356
It's so shiny.

105
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:29,856
I just polished it yesterday.

106
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:32,856
Either way, give up on that school trip.

107
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:42,156
We apologize for the sudden stop due to a red light.

108
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:44,356
-It hurts... -The doors will open

109
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:45,856
once we've confirmed it's safe to exit the train.

110
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:49,056
Are you okay, Haibara?

111
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,056
Yes, I'm fine.

112
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,256
Thanks.

113
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:53,956
You're not hurt, are you?

114
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,456
No.

115
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,756
You scraped your knee!

116
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,256
Do you need me to support you?

117
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,356
The doors are opening.

118
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:06,056
Being nice to me won't work.

119
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:08,756
As expected.

120
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:13,956
You met Higo in the stands?

121
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:15,856
That's great.

122
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:19,156
Yeah. He was really cool.

123
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:22,256
Ai was blushing.

124
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,856
We even got to talk with him a little.

125
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:25,856
Yeah.

126
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:29,856
And you got a Higo phone strap.

127
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,456
It was the last one.

128
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:34,456
I was very lucky.

129
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:38,256
Haibara's mood is improving.

130
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:42,256
BIG might've won if Higo were in the game.

131
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,556
Hey, Genta.

132
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:50,856
Come to think of it, I got a photo of it.

133
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,156
I'll show you.

134
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,356
Yes, please.

135
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:55,956
Wait, what?

136
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,456
What's wrong?

137
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:59,856
It's recording.

138
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:01,756
What? You're right.

139
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:03,556
Since when?

140
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:06,456
It seems to have started while we were on the train.

141
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:07,556
What?

142
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,056
That long?

143
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:12,056
I seem to have pressed the button

144
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:14,856
when I made sure I hadn't dropped my phone

145
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:16,856
after the train suddenly stopped and we fell.

146
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,656
It's because you keep yours in the rear pocket of your pants.

147
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:23,156
Why were you keeping it there?

148
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,456
I saw Haibara doing it,

149
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,056
so I copied her.

150
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:30,556
Ai, is your phone okay?

151
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:33,156
Yeah. It's right here in...

152
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:40,256
What's wrong, Haibara?

153
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:42,356
It's gone.

154
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:48,056
The Higo strap I attached to my phone is gone!

155
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:49,156
No way!

156
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,456
Seriously?

157
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,556
You mean the very last one you got, right?

158
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:59,656
I'm sure you'll be able to buy one online soon.

159
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:01,956
-I can't! -What?

160
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:04,456
That strap is special. Today, Higo...

161
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:06,756
What?

162
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:09,256
It's you.

163
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:14,556
You're the girl from the case at Asuka's restaurant.

164
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:16,656
Yes.

165
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:20,556
What? They're selling that now?

166
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:28,456
It's actually cute, unlike me.

167
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,956
And then he touched it!

168
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:36,956
There's only one strap like that in the world!

169
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:48,156
Ai?

170
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:51,056
But where did we lose it?

171
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:53,656
Probably when we fell on the train.

172
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:56,056
Mitsuhiko.

173
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:59,356
Let me see that video you accidentally recorded on your phone.

174
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:00,556
Okay.

175
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,356
Are you okay, Haibara?

176
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,656
That man next to the train doors...

177
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:12,256
He's picking something up.

178
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,456
Isn't that the Higo strap?

179
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:17,556
You're right. It looks like it.

180
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:19,256
That must be it.

181
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:23,756
Then maybe he delivered it to the station's lost and found.

182
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,156
Call them right away.

183
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:27,656
Got it. For Ai.

184
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,556
What? You have it?

185
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:36,056
Yes, it's a phone strap of a soccer player.

186
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:37,356
Yes, that's it.

187
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:40,156
We'll come by later to pick it up.

188
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:41,656
All right...

189
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:44,156
Ai, they have it!

190
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:47,656
She's still dazed.

191
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:48,756
Yeah.

192
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:53,756
We'll go to Beika Station to pick it up.

193
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:54,956
Yeah...

194
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:56,356
Wait...

195
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:57,356
What?

196
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,856
It's at the station in Chiyari City.

197
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:02,756
Chiyari City?

198
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,356
Isn't that pretty far away?

199
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,656
-What should we do? -I'm out of money.

200
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:11,156
My turbo-powered skateboard is being repaired.

201
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,556
Dr. Agasa, could you drive us there in your Beetle?

202
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:16,456
-Yes. -Please!

203
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:19,856
My bartender friend's borrowing it.

204
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,656
No way...

205
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:23,156
There's no rush.

206
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,756
You can go get it tomorrow.

207
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:30,256
In that case, I'll run there.

208
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:31,956
What?

209
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,356
But it's tens of kilometers away!

210
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,856
What?

211
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,756
Is something the matter?

212
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:41,256
Subaru!

213
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:45,556
Since I was told I hadn't stewed my curry long enough the other day,

214
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,656
I brought a new batch to share.

215
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:53,156
More importantly, Haibara's very important phone strap

216
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:55,456
was taken to Chiyari Station.

217
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:57,856
We're on our way to get it right now.

218
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:00,756
Could you drive us there?

219
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:02,256
I see.

220
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:05,856
She's not going?

221
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:08,856
No. She's pretty shocked about the whole thing.

222
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,956
Unfortunately,

223
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:14,956
I need to use my car after this.

224
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:16,356
What?

225
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:17,856
You can't take us?

226
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:22,056
But I saw a familiar car parked next to this house.

227
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:23,956
Why don't you ask him?

228
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:26,156
A familiar car?

229
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:29,556
A white RX-7.

230
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:38,368
I knew it!

231
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,068
It's Amuro.

232
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:42,468
What are you doing here?

233
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:45,968
I got sleepy while driving in the area,

234
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,968
so I took a nap.

235
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,568
What are you kids doing?

236
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,668
We're going to Chiyari Station

237
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:56,368
to pick up the phone strap our friend dropped.

238
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,268
Could you drive us there?

239
00:13:58,268 --> 00:14:00,168
Please!

240
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:02,768
I'd also like to ask...

241
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:05,668
that you do this.

242
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:10,268
Though if there's some reason you don't want to leave this place,

243
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:12,768
then I suppose it can't be helped.

244
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,568
Yes, I wanted to nap a little longer,

245
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:18,268
but that's too bad.

246
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:22,068
This is a thrillingly good place to nap.

247
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:23,568
"Toto Metro Lost and Found"

248
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:26,068
Thanks for waiting, kids.

249
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:28,468
Here. This is the strap, right?

250
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,968
What? That's not it!

251
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:34,068
That's Sanada.

252
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:37,068
We lost a Higo strap.

253
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:39,668
What? This isn't it?

254
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:43,968
Was this the man who turned that in?

255
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:49,068
No, it was a younger man.

256
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:52,168
What? What's going on?

257
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:53,668
Maybe...

258
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:56,468
Could I see that?

259
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:59,168
This man in the photo appears to be

260
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:02,968
the father of the boy standing next to him.

261
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,568
Maybe he mistook the Higo strap your friend dropped

262
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:10,268
for the Sanada strap his son dropped

263
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:12,968
and picked up yours.

264
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:15,168
Unless you're a passionate fan,

265
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:19,168
"Higo, Sanada" -they probably all look the same.

266
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,268
In other words, someone picked up the Sanada strap his son dropped

267
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:26,368
and turned it in here.

268
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:30,368
Then we need to find the father and son recorded by my phone.

269
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:32,168
But how are we going to find them?

270
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:34,468
We don't even know their names.

271
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:35,768
Yes, I agree.

272
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:40,268
Why don't we think about that once we return to my car?

273
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:41,968
Okay...

274
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:48,868
Oh, right.

275
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:50,168
Excuse me!

276
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:51,168
Yes?

277
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:55,368
Was a badge turned in along with that strap?

278
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,568
A badge?

279
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:58,768
No, I don't think so.

280
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,468
I see.

281
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:02,068
Thank you!

282
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:05,968
Genta, what are you doing?

283
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:07,868
Oh, sorry.

284
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:12,968
I lost my Detective Badge on the train, too.

285
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,568
Your Detective Badge?

286
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:17,168
Dr. Agasa made them for us.

287
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:18,868
We all have them.

288
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:29,268
Now then, how should we find this man with his son...

289
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:33,368
who picked up the Higo strap

290
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:38,068
your friend dropped on the train?

291
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:43,768
Both of them look very tan.

292
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:45,168
You're right.

293
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:47,068
They're so dark.

294
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:49,368
Maybe...

295
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:52,768
they're on their way to go swimming at the beach.

296
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:55,568
No, that's not it.

297
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:57,068
Why not?

298
00:16:57,068 --> 00:17:01,568
This video was taken while we were on the train

299
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,568
after the soccer game that ended at 3 pm.

300
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:06,868
We arrived at Beika Station 10 minutes after that.

301
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:10,968
So if they were going swimming, they would've left earlier.

302
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:12,668
You're right.

303
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:15,868
Then maybe they're on their way back from the beach.

304
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,268
That's not it either.

305
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:18,368
What?

306
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:21,668
We were riding the Shonan Shinjuku train.

307
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:24,968
"Takasaki, Omiya, Shinjuku" -It departs from Takasaki in Gunma

308
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,068
"Odawara, Yokohama, Beika, Ofuna" -and passes through Shinjuku and Yokohama

309
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:30,268
on its way to Odawara in Kanagawa.

310
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:33,068
And the beach doesn't reach Beika Station.

311
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,068
Maybe they went to an indoor pool.

312
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,668
Or bug hunting.

313
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:40,168
Or maybe they just went to an acquaintance's house.

314
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:43,868
In that case,

315
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:47,268
did you overhear any of their conversation?

316
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,368
Their conversation?

317
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:55,068
I was bragging about how I polished my badge.

318
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,468
Come to think of it,

319
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,168
the dad said to his son,

320
00:17:58,168 --> 00:18:02,168
"It's about as long as it takes to watch Kamen Yaiba."

321
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,868
But Kamen Yaiba wasn't on today.

322
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,868
Isn't it on tomorrow?

323
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,868
Before his father said that,

324
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:12,568
did the boy ask him,

325
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:15,068
"How much longer?"

326
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:16,968
Yeah, he did.

327
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:19,968
Which means

328
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:23,368
it's possible he was using the 30-minute Kamen Yaiba program

329
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,368
to explain to his son how much longer it would take

330
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:27,468
to arrive at their destination.

331
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:29,168
I see.

332
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:32,168
Do you know when they said that?

333
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:36,168
Yes. It was after the train screeched to a stop

334
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:38,668
and everyone fell.

335
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:43,068
"Beika, Yokohama" -So it's 30 minutes from Beika Station.

336
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,368
"Chiyari, Ofuna" -That's here around Chiyari Station.

337
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:50,168
That boy seemed to be a first-year elementary school student like us.

338
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:54,468
It's not unreasonable that his father would use Yaiba as an example.

339
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,468
How do you know he's a first-year?

340
00:18:57,468 --> 00:19:03,568
Because he breathed on the train window

341
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,368
and wrote something with his finger.

342
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,968
He said, "It's only hiragana, but I can write it now."

343
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:11,068
"Aren't you proud?"

344
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:14,568
I think he was writing his own name.

345
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:18,468
Unfortunately, I couldn't see what he wrote.

346
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:22,468
Do you remember which car you were riding in?

347
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:26,168
We got on in the middle of the third car from the front, right?

348
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:27,268
Yes.

349
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,368
You really don't remember what he wrote?

350
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:33,568
No.

351
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:38,068
I do remember his pale finger pressed against the window though.

352
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:40,168
Pale finger?

353
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:43,368
They're both really dark from being so tan.

354
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:46,968
But if you look closely at the video...

355
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:49,268
See? It's both of them.

356
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:57,168
They're both pale from the wrist down!

357
00:19:57,168 --> 00:20:01,068
And look at the dad's bag.

358
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,868
It looks like there's something angular inside it.

359
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:07,368
Maybe he put his cooler inside his bag

360
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:09,168
since the strap broke.

361
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,268
Are they going fishing?

362
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:13,568
But they don't have fishing rods.

363
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:17,168
And they're too lightly dressed to go hiking.

364
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,868
Maybe...

365
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,368
Maybe?

366
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:22,968
They could be digging for clams.

367
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:23,968
Dig...

368
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,868
Digging for clams?

369
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:29,268
You go digging for clams in spring.

370
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:31,168
We're on summer break.

371
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:35,068
Actually, you can do it all year round.

372
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,868
What? Really?

373
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,068
Yes.

374
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:44,568
April to May is the best season because the climate means

375
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:47,968
the clams are full of nutrients from spawning.

376
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:50,268
But there are plenty of beaches that are open

377
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:53,768
to digging for clams as late as July.

378
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:57,268
And low tide at Chiyari Beach

379
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:59,868
is at 5:59 today.

380
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:00,968
When digging for clams,

381
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:05,568
it's best to arrive an hour or two before low tide,

382
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:08,568
so it makes sense that they took that train.

383
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,068
Really?

384
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,868
-Then... -If we go to that beach...

385
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:16,268
We'll be able to retrieve Haibara's strap!

386
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:21,268
Once that boy realizes the strap his dad picked up isn't his,

387
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:23,068
I'm sure he'll hand it over.

388
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:25,368
Yeah. And once we get it,

389
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:30,868
we won't let anyone else take it until we return it to Ai!

390
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:33,068
No matter what!

391
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,368
Yeah!

392
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:37,168
Yes! Haibara will be so happy!

393
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:40,568
-This is great! -Yes!

394
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:42,368
I'm so happy!

395
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,068
I'll go settle the bill.

396
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:49,368
You kids head to the car.

397
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:51,068
Sure.

398
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:53,768
Thanks, Amuro.

399
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,968
Thanks for the food...

400
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,268
Kazami.

401
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:46,768
"Next Episode" -She's in that state

402
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:49,468
because she lost the Higo strap?

403
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:51,068
Yeah.

404
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:55,168
It's less likely that it won't be found.

405
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:59,568
Japan's top two inspectors are on the case.

406
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:01,168
Breathe on it.

407
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:02,168
What?

408
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:04,168
Nice one, Amuro.

409
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:06,068
Now that we know that...

410
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:13,268
