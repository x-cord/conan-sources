1
00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:03,661
Hey, Shinichi.

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:06,761
Do you think that Mrs. Wakamatsu is the culprit too?

3
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:10,261
Yeah. I was positive.

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:14,561
Until I went into that study where she was found dead.

5
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:16,161
Me, too.

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,761
It's hard to believe that a person who is contemplating suicide

7
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:23,361
would ask for tea to be served again or use eye drops.

8
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:26,361
Moreover, the signature on the contract was only half written,

9
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:29,561
and the cap of the fountain pen wasn't closed either.

10
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:30,861
Yeah.

11
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:32,961
It's as if a ghost who came in here

12
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:37,161
without anybody noticing.

13
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:40,461
Poisoned her to death while she was signing her name.

14
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,761
Yeah.

15
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:45,061
Like the one who sent the weird letter to you...

16
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:50,561
The warped entity that cannot be seen normally.

17
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:11,961
If all cases were men,

18
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:13,661
all hidden mysteries are women.

19
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:15,361
Don't let what you see deceive you.

20
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,161
The trick that the real culprit used.

21
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,861
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,661
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:23,261
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:53,920
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Illusion)"

25
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:58,591
But nobody came inside the study until we came.

26
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,591
And even if someone were to give Mrs. Wakamatsu orders over the phone

27
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:03,891
wanting to frame her.

28
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:06,791
The four suspects were undergoing voluntary on site investigation,

29
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,291
so they couldn't have done anything like that.

30
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,191
And those slippers with poison on them...

31
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,591
If somebody was planning to frame her,

32
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:18,391
the slippers would have had to been switched somewhere.

33
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:20,291
It would be impossible to do something like that

34
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,191
without being suspected?

35
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:24,791
What's wrong?

36
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,991
What's with these slippers?

37
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,491
They're Kazuha's!

38
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,791
Since there are slippers inside for restroom use,

39
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,591
you'd normally leave yours outside.

40
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,391
That's right! The restroom!

41
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:41,391
It's possible to switch slippers here!

42
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,191
What's going on?

43
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,591
Why are all of you in front of the bathroom that I'm using?

44
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,491
Kazuha. You used the restroom

45
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:50,091
right after you came to this house, didn't you?

46
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:51,791
Huh? Yeah.

47
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,591
And, when you came to the living room where we waiting, you said,

48
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:57,591
"The restroom was so crowded that I had a hard time." Didn't you?

49
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:00,191
Yeah.

50
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,691
I went to the restroom then, too.

51
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:05,791
Then, didn't Mrs. Wakamatsu use the restroom back then too?

52
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,291
No.

53
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,291
The person who was in the restroom before us was...

54
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,591
Ikuro!

55
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:14,591
He went towards the living room as soon as he came out.

56
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:17,391
I heard the voice of Managing Director Shiina

57
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,191
ask us if we bought baumkuchen.

58
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,691
-Is that true? -Yeah.

59
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:25,291
While wiping his hands...

60
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,191
He was in high spirits.

61
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:31,091
If so, the poison that was on the door knob of Ikuro's room was...

62
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,391
Foul play!

63
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:35,491
If so, there should be something after all.

64
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:39,791
A way to make only Ikuro pick up the poison baumkuchen.

65
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,991
But, back then,

66
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:44,291
there were to pieces of baumkuchen on the tray!

67
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,091
How was he directed to pick up a certain piece of baumkuchen

68
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,291
when the pieces were both the same size and same shape?

69
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,891
I hate to say this at a time like this.

70
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:55,791
-But I'm getting hungry. -Yeah.

71
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,691
Talking about baumkuchen is making me want to eat fishcake.

72
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:02,291
Huh? Why fishcake?

73
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,891
The shape, kind of looks alike!

74
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:06,691
They're both somewhat arched, see...

75
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:07,891
I get it!

76
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,091
An eye for an eye.

77
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:16,591
If so, it's understandable why Mrs. Wakamatsu was killed.

78
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:20,291
A similar method of doing it is highly likely!

79
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,291
Hey.

80
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,591
Strange.

81
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,491
Dad said that the case was already closed and yet...

82
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:31,691
No, it's not closed yet.

83
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:34,491
When Heiji turns the brim of his cap to the front,

84
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,391
the investigation's still on!

85
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,091
Huh? Really?

86
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:41,291
Right! And when he turns the brim of his cap to the back,

87
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,791
it means switch off!

88
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,391
It's my turn, that is!

89
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,191
Before Mrs. Wakamatsu passed away,

90
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,991
she was looking at the design of these letters?

91
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:58,891
Yeah. There seems to have been about 50 patterns all together,

92
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,991
and she seems to have been trying to choose

93
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,991
the good ones with Mr. Shiina and the others.

94
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:06,591
I'm sure that you've already know what went on after this.

95
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,391
While she was looking through them,

96
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,191
it seemed that her eyes got exhausted,

97
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,791
so it seems Mr. Fujinami gave her eye drops.

98
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,391
If I remember correctly, right after that,

99
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:18,691
the housekeeper brought tea that she newly made.

100
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,491
Soon afterwards, Inspector and I came in,

101
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:22,391
announced that we would be holding a voluntary on site investigation

102
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,891
and came to get you all.

103
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:27,691
But Mrs. Wakamatsu never once went near the baumkuchen,

104
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,491
so it was concluded that it would be okay for her to remain here.

105
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:32,891
Ms. Satake then asked her to sign

106
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,391
and stamp the contract while she was waiting.

107
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:38,191
And Mr. Shiina lent her his bronze fountain pen.

108
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,691
That's how things went, correct?

109
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:44,491
-Bronze? -Yeah.

110
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,191
It seems he received it from the president

111
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:48,291
in celebration for his 30th anniversary working at the company.

112
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,591
He also mentioned that

113
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:53,891
the other employers were given bronze wristwatches.

114
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,191
During the interrogation,

115
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:59,391
Mr. Fujinami and Ms. Satake were wearing something like that.

116
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,191
I think what they were wearing was the wristwatch they were given.

117
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,091
It's about time we leave!

118
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,791
We'll continue investigations again tomorrow!

119
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,391
Yes, sir!

120
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:11,591
Did that explanation suffice?

121
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,891
Yeah, couldn't ask for more!

122
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,991
I've figured out who the culprit is

123
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,391
as well as the trick with the explanation now, but...

124
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:21,391
There's no proof!

125
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,091
See, you later then.

126
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:28,191
We'll come back for another interrogation.

127
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,891
Yes, sir.

128
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:37,591
It's finally over. My throat is parched.

129
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,291
You haven't even taken a sip of tea, after all.

130
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,691
Then, would you like to have some Oolong tea that I bought

131
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:45,591
when I went to buy the soy sauce?

132
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,491
Poison couldn't possibly be inserted in a PET bottle, right?

133
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:02,791
No joke! It's already after 01:00?

134
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,191
Oh, no. I missed the last train?

135
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:07,891
Then, why don't you have Mr. Fujinami

136
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,191
drive you home together with me?

137
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,291
But she lives opposite from where your house is, doesn't she?

138
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,991
I guess so.

139
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,691
Would you like to spend the night at my apartment then?

140
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,391
It's pretty close from here.

141
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:21,291
All right.

142
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:25,291
It seems that we'll finally get a normal look at things.

143
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,991
Yeah.

144
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:31,691
Of the warped entity that we humans created from our own imagination

145
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:33,991
the proof of it!

146
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:38,291
Hey... Are you serious?

147
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,591
That you've figured out who killed that stupid son.

148
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:43,691
Yeah! We've figured out exactly

149
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:47,891
how that culprit made Ikuro eat the poison baumkuchen!

150
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:51,191
But, didn't the vice-president do it?

151
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:55,091
Right. The vice-president sprinkled poison powder

152
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,891
on the door knob of Ikuro's room,

153
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:59,491
and Ikuro ate the baumkuchen with his hand

154
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,691
that had poison on it, wasn't that the story?

155
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:05,691
Besides you also said that poison was detected

156
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:08,091
from the slippers that she was wearing, too!

157
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:11,291
The poison spilled on the slippers

158
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,191
when she sprinkled poison powder on the doorknob, right?

159
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:14,791
That was to throw us off!

160
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,691
Throw off?

161
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:17,891
Right.

162
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,891
It was a preparatory move to frame her.

163
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:24,291
This case was made to end when she killed herself.

164
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,591
Are you saying that Mrs. Wakamatsu cause of death

165
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:28,191
was homicide and not suicide, then?

166
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:29,391
Yeah.

167
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:31,491
I'm sure the culprit is one and the same person!

168
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:34,791
But, where do you have proof of this?

169
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,791
Ikuro washed his hands in the restroom

170
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,291
right before he picked up the baumkuchen!

171
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,791
Even if poison got on his hands before he left the room,

172
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,291
wouldn't it come off?

173
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,791
-Don't you think so? -Yep.

174
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,391
He wiped his hands using a handkerchief, too.

175
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:53,691
But it not an easy task to make Mrs. Wakamatsu

176
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:55,091
wear the slippers with poison on them, isn't it?

177
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,691
The restroom!

178
00:09:56,691 --> 00:10:00,691
The slippers were switched while she was using the restroom!

179
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,191
The slippers that she was wearing were left outside the restroom

180
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,491
while she was in the toilet,

181
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:06,691
so they were switched with the ones with poison!

182
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,991
If so, how was the stupid son made

183
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:12,091
to pick up the poisoned baumkuchen?

184
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:16,091
If the poison wasn't on Ikuro's hands to begin with,

185
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:18,891
how else could...

186
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:21,291
That's easy!

187
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:25,091
It was placed so that Ikuro who is greedy when it comes to food

188
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,691
would naturally pick it up!

189
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,591
More so, if he was hungry!

190
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:32,591
Idiot! The pieces of baumkuchen then were cut

191
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,591
and divided into eight even pieces and were all exactly the same size!

192
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:36,991
Changing how you place the pieces

193
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,991
wouldn't have done much to change anything at all!

194
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:42,091
Then, you go and try it, Pops!

195
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:46,091
We placed two pieces on the tray just like the culprit,

196
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:49,291
so acting just as starved as Ikuro might've been!

197
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,591
Starved, come on...

198
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:56,991
What's this?

199
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,630
Hey, hold it!

200
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,630
It's obvious that the one on the other side is bigger!

201
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,630
Huh? True!

202
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,130
In this case, anyone who's hungry

203
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,230
would definitely pick the one up on the one farther beyond.

204
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,630
Like I said a while ago,

205
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,130
the size of the pieces of baumkuchen were exactly the same.

206
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,730
They're exactly the same.

207
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,230
We used the pieces of baumkuchen that you the police

208
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,130
used to carry out the voluntary on site investigation

209
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,230
a while ago, you know.

210
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,630
-What? -What?

211
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,330
Don't be ridiculous!

212
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,030
If you put one on top of the other, it's this big...

213
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,730
They're exactly the same size!

214
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,630
What's going on?

215
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,430
Jastrow effect!

216
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,030
When you compare the size of things,

217
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,430
people have a tendency to naturally compare

218
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,630
the length of the adjoining pieces nearest themselves!

219
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,330
So, if arched pieces like baumkuchen are placed in rows,

220
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,430
people tend to compare the short and long sides.

221
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,930
Therefore, although the pieces are all the same size,

222
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,430
people are deceived by the optical illusion

223
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,430
that the ones beyond are bigger!

224
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,330
-Right, Heiji? -Yeah!

225
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,330
It's an optical illusion that a psychologist named Jastrow discovered

226
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,730
more than 100 years ago!

227
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,630
I see. So the culprit placed the poisoned piece

228
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,830
in a position where it would larger to make Ikuro pick it up!

229
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,830
But if this was done,

230
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,730
the housekeeper Ms. Yonehara and Secretary Ms. Satake

231
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,330
who cut and placed the pieces of baumkuchen on the plates

232
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,030
and the ones who were standing near the tray

233
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,930
that the pieces of baumkuchen were on...

234
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,230
Chief Designer Mr. Fujinami

235
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,230
and Managing Director Mr. Shiina, all four of them

236
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,630
could've secretly done it, no?

237
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,230
But only one among them

238
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,130
could've poisoned Mrs. Wakamatsu to death.

239
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,730
Let's go to the study where she was murdered then!

240
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,730
What the heck's going on?

241
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,730
I thought that unraveling the mystery was going to begin

242
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,230
and yet we're suddenly shown something like this.

243
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,530
Watch closely!

244
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,430
Because there are at least 50 patterns.

245
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,230
Mrs. Wakamatsu was watching this with all of you

246
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,630
before she died, wasn't she?

247
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,030
Yes.

248
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,230
Huh? Are you tired?

249
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,530
Of course!

250
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,830
Having to watch all these flashing images one after the other...

251
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,030
Okay, then.

252
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,730
Can you write the kanji "waka" that is included in Mrs. Wakamatsu's name?

253
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,930
Huh? Such a simple kanji character...

254
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,930
Huh?

255
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,730
Let's see...

256
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,630
I think it was...

257
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,830
No cheating!

258
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,530
Mrs. Wakamatsu wasn't used to this computer

259
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,630
and probably couldn't open this file.

260
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,230
Hey, Takagi. The kanji character "waka"

261
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,430
what was written below the radical "grass"?

262
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,730
Don't you know?

263
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,930
You were looking at it repeatedly many times until a while ago.

264
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,730
Because he watched it repeatedly,

265
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,630
he's experiencing Gestaltzerfall!

266
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,630
-Gestaltzerfall? -Yeah!

267
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,130
There are times when a soil on the wall or the shape of a cloud

268
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,630
looks like the face of someone, aren't there?

269
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,430
That's because the face neuron inside your brain reacts

270
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,830
and mistakenly recognizes the shapes as faces!

271
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,430
There's a thing called the kanji neuron

272
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,030
that resembles the face neuron in the brain, too.

273
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,330
If you keep looking at the same kanji repeatedly many times,

274
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,930
it's said that the kanji neuron gets tired

275
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,530
and starts to malfunction!

276
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,130
In other words, even if it's a word that you know really well,

277
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,730
you start wondering was this the way it was written?

278
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,630
And lose track of what once you could do.

279
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,830
This is called Gestaltzerfall!

280
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,030
I get it.

281
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,930
The culprit repeatedly showed "Wakkodo no Sake" to Mrs. Wakamatsu.

282
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,530
And after she experienced Gestaltzerfall,

283
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,630
asked her to sign the contract!

284
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,330
She would've had to sign it "Serika Wakamatsu".

285
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,130
And the vice-president not being able to remember

286
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,030
how to write the character "waka",

287
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,130
took the Japanese dictionary that was on the bookshelf

288
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,030
and touched the "wa" page that was laced with poison,

289
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,930
thus, she ended up licking the poison.

290
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,130
Yeah.

291
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,730
"Waka" is one of the kanji characters

292
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,330
that easily causes Gestaltzerfall.

293
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,830
It seems that Mrs. Wakamatsu had a habit of licking her thumb

294
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,030
when flipping the pages, too.

295
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,830
Which means that the one who thought up this trick,

296
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,330
-and committed the crime is... -Yeah.

297
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,530
The person who showed the kanji character "waka" to her repeatedly

298
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,630
and asked her to sign the contract, too.

299
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,430
Ms. Satake, her secretary!

300
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,930
What?

301
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,630
You're the only one who could've carried out this crime!

302
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,630
Ms. Satake really did it?

303
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,530
I can't believe it.

304
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,230
But...

305
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,230
Could it be that all the disadvantageous evidence

306
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,430
pointed at Ms. Satake?

307
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,530
The fact that Ikuro was hungry

308
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,930
was really because I had coincidentally run out of soy sauce.

309
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,430
I don't think it was a coincidence.

310
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,230
When Mrs. Wakamatsu asked you to serve tea once again,

311
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,330
you asked her what brand she would like you to serve?

312
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,130
You knew where in the kitchen is what in this, right?

313
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,930
If so, I guess it would've been possible for you

314
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,530
to secretly get rid of the soy sauce, no?

315
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,730
Well, since you're the secretary,

316
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,530
you would've known that by the time Ikuro got hungry

317
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,730
the managing director as well as we would get here.

318
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,730
It's a usual thing that the managing director

319
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,630
would buy baumkuchen before coming.

320
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,630
On top of that, if you knew the number of guests you'd be having,

321
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,230
it would've been easy for you to cut it into eight pieces.

322
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,930
You're the one who said to cut the baumkuchen

323
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,530
into eight pieces too, right?

324
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,230
You said because it'd be difficult to cut into six or seven pieces.

325
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,330
Then you pretended to place the cut pieces of baumkuchen onto the plates

326
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,830
and sprinkled poison onto one of the two pieces.

327
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,830
Then, when did she lace the door knob and slippers with poison?

328
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,230
Before we came, I guess.

329
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,230
When we came, Ms. Satake was already in the house,

330
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,630
so I think she had made preparations

331
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,830
to kill Mrs. Wakamatsu in the study to by then.

332
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,030
But I'm the one who recommended that the vice-president

333
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,830
should stay back in the study because she looked tired.

334
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,330
If you didn't say it,

335
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,430
Ms. Satake would've suggested it anyway.

336
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,330
After that...

337
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,730
If it's an official on site investigation,

338
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,930
you need a warrant issued from court on hand

339
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,530
before starting the investigation

340
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,430
and be able to show it at the scene.

341
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,130
They would have to make us understand

342
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,030
the contents of the warrant, too.

343
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,230
She said this deliberately to lead us to the fake poison

344
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,030
on the door knob of Ikuro's room to throw us off!

345
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,030
You're also the one who called me over to the house in Osaka

346
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,230
after getting me interested in the optical illusion and worked it out

347
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,230
so that I would come to this house too, right?

348
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,430
The phrase, a warped entity

349
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,430
that humans created of their own imagination

350
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,430
that cannot be seen normally, also refers to optical illusion, right?

351
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,830
There are people that played the role

352
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,230
of misleads in this trick!

353
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,130
There were the two that used optical illusion

354
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,730
to deceive everyone from the fact that they killed the president,

355
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,530
so as in an eye for an eye,

356
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,330
the two were killed by using optical illusion!

357
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,930
It's true that it would be a trick

358
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,930
you'd like to use in a detective novel,

359
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,230
but circumstantial evidence is all there is!

360
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,730
Where do you have the concrete evidence to support your deduction?

361
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,230
Huh?

362
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,330
Your wristwatch, secretary...

363
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,130
It's glossy here and there. Why?

364
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,030
Well, this is...

365
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,430
That's the immovable concrete evidence!

366
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,530
Most probably when you sprinkled poison powder

367
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,230
onto the Japanese dictionary,

368
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,130
the poison powder spilled on to your left hand

369
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,030
that you were holding the dictionary with too.

370
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,130
Back then the hydrogen cyanide poison

371
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,030
that got caught in between the space of your bronze wristwatch...

372
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,430
most probably went through redox, washing the rust off

373
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,630
when you went to the restroom

374
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,630
and washed your hands or something.

375
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,530
You noticed this only back when

376
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,030
you remarked that you'd miss the last train.

377
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,630
It's about time for the last train.

378
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,430
You were looking at your wristwatch then.

379
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,530
That's why you held the PET bottle

380
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,930
in a strange way, back then, right?

381
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,330
It's understandable if Mr. Fujinami who switched the bottle

382
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,030
he was holding in his hand

383
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,930
in order to look at his wristwatch did so...

384
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,830
Normally, you wouldn't hold the PET bottle

385
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,230
in the same hand you take off the lid with.

386
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,130
I see.

387
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,730
So that's when you realized I was using only my right hand.

388
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,530
If I use my left hand, my sleeve would flip over

389
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,030
and the wristwatch would come into view.

390
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,130
But, how ironic that

391
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,930
this wristwatch I received from my father would give me away.

392
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,130
Father...

393
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,330
Are you the president's daughter?

394
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,830
Yes.

395
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,830
I'm the daughter from my father's first marriage.

396
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,930
I actually entered this company wanting to run it into bankruptcy

397
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,530
because he abandoned my mother.

398
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,730
But after I found out that he was just a workaholic, poor soul,

399
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,430
that wasn't good at expressing love...

400
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,030
I went out for wool and came home shorn.

401
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,330
Moreover, he knew that I was his daughter to begin with.

402
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,630
The fact was that he was planning to announce to everyone

403
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,230
that I was his daughter at his villa in Karuizawa.

404
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,530
What?

405
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,630
I heard so from the president, too.

406
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,330
But, just before that, my father was killed by Ikuro.

407
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,330
And then the vice-president hid the evidence.

408
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,630
I don't know why my father was killed.

409
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,330
Before the time I started to understand him,

410
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,130
I hated him quite a bit, too.

411
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,030
Then, you read the contents of the letter, didn't you?

412
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,230
Yes.

413
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,230
Yet, the vice-president said nothing after that so.

414
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,930
Maybe she gave it to me hoping

415
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,130
that I would kill Ikuro.

416
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,030
It was my mistake that I called Mr. Hattori over.

417
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,430
I meant to mislead him,

418
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,630
but he was way over me.

419
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,130
Or rather, should I say, "they".

420
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,430
Well, it was a crime using the trick of optical illusion,

421
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,930
so I guess the deceitful oft into the snares of deceit

422
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,230
is exactly what this is.

423
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,830
She's pretty good with words.

424
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,330
Heiji turned the brim of his cap behind!

425
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,030
It's your chance! Chance time!

426
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,730
I think I shouldn't, not today, don't you think?

427
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,930
Heiji's tired from using his head on the case, too.

428
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,630
I'm going to borrow Conan for a while, okay?

429
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,630
Kazuha! Give it all you got!

430
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,230
What is it?

431
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,730
I was planning to have a battle with Shinichi

432
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,130
about what he thought about the case from now and then.

433
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,930
Can't you tell?

434
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,130
They went off

435
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,430
so that we could have time to ourselves, just the two of us.

436
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,330
Huh?

437
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,230
Maybe you've already heard about this from Shinichi,

438
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,430
but it seems that he confessed

439
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,730
how he felt towards Ran in London.

440
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,730
And that's not why I'm about to say what I'm going to say,

441
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,530
but the thing is...

442
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,930
The thing is I...

443
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,130
from way before...

444
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,730
really...

445
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,130
I like you a whole lot!

446
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,630
He's gone? Heiji?

447
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,530
He ran off in the middle of the conversation!

448
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,930
About where?

449
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,130
By the part you said, "The thing is..."

450
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,430
What?

451
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,730
Hey, Shinichi!

452
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,430
Don't you have anything you need to tell your best friend here about?

453
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,030
-No, I don't. -Just tell me, I bet you have!

454
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,630
They are really get along, don't you think?

455
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,930
So jealous of Conan.

456
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,730
Don't hide it.

457
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,830
I said, there's nothing.

458
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,030
"Next Episode" -Is Haibara the quiet looking girl

459
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,130
with short hair that lives at Doc's house?

460
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,630
-Have you met her before? -No.

461
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,130
I had a glimpse of her

462
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,530
at Doc's animation site on the Net.

463
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,230
But how strange.

464
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,930
I wasn't supposed to be in that animation.

465
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,630
Don't tell me that...

466
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:29,030
Next Conan, "Doc's Animation Site (Part 1)"

467
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,830
Next Conan's Hint:

468
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,030
"Glasses lens"

469
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,230
Did you already see the movie "The 11th Drunkard"?

470
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,730
Dad! It's "The 11th Striker"!

471
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,430
Own goal.
