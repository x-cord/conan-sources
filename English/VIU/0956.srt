1
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:13,796
So there was nothing left behind that would help us

2
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:16,196
identify the culprit.

3
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:18,996
Their motive was probably a grudge.

4
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:22,296
They hit him once in the head with a metal pipe.

5
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:24,996
You again, Mouri?

6
00:00:24,997 --> 00:00:28,196
I just happened to be passing by,

7
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:29,696
and it seemed like there was a case.

8
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:33,197
And this kid insisted we take a look.

9
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:39,396
Anyway, are they the victim's surviving family members?

10
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:40,496
Yeah.

11
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:44,296
We had them come to confirm the identity of the body.

12
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:47,396
"Yasuko Kadowaki (63)" -His mother, Yasuko Kadowaki,

13
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,997
"Yuichi Kadowaki (28)" -and his older brother, Yuichi Kadowaki.

14
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:54,596
Mom, keep it together.

15
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:57,896
The father died five years ago.

16
00:00:57,897 --> 00:01:01,897
The three of them were living together.

17
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,496
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

18
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:07,396
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

19
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:09,296
A chance encounter with yet another assault case.

20
00:01:09,297 --> 00:01:11,296
The surprising true face of a troubled family.

21
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:12,896
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:14,696
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:16,897
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:03,492
"The Mystery-Solving Water Taxi (Part 1)"

25
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:08,191
"Eiji Kadowaki (23)" -The victim was Eiji Kadowaki,

26
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:09,891
23 years old, who lives down the way.

27
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:13,691
He was killed last night around 10 pm.

28
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:15,691
According to his mother,

29
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:20,691
the victim went out to drink yesterday evening.

30
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:25,391
He was probably attacked on his way home.

31
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:27,091
So unaware of what happened,

32
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:31,491
his family was waiting for the victim to return home.

33
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,791
No.

34
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:36,591
Last night, his older brother Yuichi was staying at a hotel in the city

35
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,391
to work on some documents.

36
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,491
Apparently he works as an official in Kasumigaseki.

37
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:44,991
For the Chuo government office?

38
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,791
So he's an elite.

39
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:51,091
Inspector Megure! Oh, Mouri and Conan.

40
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:53,091
Well? How did it go?

41
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:54,491
Right.

42
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:57,191
The victim Eiji Kadowaki

43
00:03:57,192 --> 00:04:00,791
didn't have a very good reputation in the neighborhood.

44
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,491
Since he dropped out of college three years ago,

45
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:05,291
he hasn't been able to hold down a job

46
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,591
and wanders the area.

47
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:10,691
Last Friday, he got drunk and argued

48
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:13,891
with a bar employee.

49
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:18,091
He spent the night in jail.

50
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:21,391
We also found two interesting pieces of information.

51
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:22,691
Which are?

52
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:25,191
The first is passers-by reported that several days ago,

53
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,791
a well-built man in his 30's

54
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,891
appeared to be watching the Kadowaki family,

55
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:33,491
as though investigating them.

56
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:38,592
He was also questioning the neighbors about the Kadowaki family.

57
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,591
Considering the victim's reputation...

58
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:45,291
It's possible he had some trouble

59
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,791
with that man and incurred his wrath.

60
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,791
Got it.

61
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,991
Keep trying to figure out who that man is.

62
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:53,992
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:58,491
What's the other piece of information?

64
00:04:58,492 --> 00:04:59,591
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,091
According to the neighbors,

66
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,891
it seems the victim Eiji Kadowaki

67
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:08,491
was abusing his mother Yasuko daily.

68
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,591
What?

69
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:14,591
Furthermore, the older brother, Yuichi

70
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:18,791
would always stop his brother's explosive violence.

71
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,591
I see.

72
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:25,391
So the victim was the problem child of the Kadowaki family.

73
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,591
Yeah, but...

74
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:32,991
That woman seems genuinely sad.

75
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:36,491
They say the worse a child is, the more you love them.

76
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:37,691
Indeed.

77
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:39,991
But if that's the case,

78
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:46,692
we'll have to question the older brother again.

79
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,791
No.

80
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,791
There's no domestic violence in our family.

81
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:58,591
That's just an irresponsible rumor!

82
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:03,392
Besides, what does that have to do with Eiji's murder?

83
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:11,591
Yuichi Kadowaki,

84
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:17,491
I'm sorry, but could we talk to you at the station?

85
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:22,591
You think I killed Eiji?

86
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:27,391
No. Yuichi would never do that.

87
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,191
Didn't I just tell you?

88
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,091
I was working all last night!

89
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:33,991
Please calm down, Kadowaki.

90
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:38,692
I know. Around 10 pm, I ran into a woman at the hotel.

91
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,191
She was extremely drunk.

92
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:45,291
In any case, find her.

93
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:48,391
Then this will all become clear.

94
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:52,792
No. Yuichi would never...

95
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:57,691
"Metropolitan Police Department, Beika Police Station."

96
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,091
Are you listening?

97
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:03,491
I would never do something as stupid as kill a person!

98
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:08,292
I see. So, what about Eiji's domestic violence?

99
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:11,291
It's not true.

100
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:14,791
Your father died five years ago, didn't he?

101
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,691
What about it?

102
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:18,291
According to your neighbors,

103
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:24,291
your mother has been frequently injured since then.

104
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:25,791
It's a coincidence.

105
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:30,491
And two years later, Eiji dropped out of college.

106
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,891
You managed to protect your mother until then,

107
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:36,291
but after that, you couldn't handle it anymore.

108
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:37,791
This is nonsense.

109
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,491
Furthermore, you've been busy with work lately,

110
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:45,491
so you've been out of the house a lot.

111
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:47,191
And around that same time,

112
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:50,691
your mother's injuries became more frequent.

113
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,691
I didn't do it.

114
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:56,291
If you didn't do something about Eiji,

115
00:07:56,292 --> 00:08:00,691
he might do something that couldn't be undone.

116
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,691
I didn't do it.

117
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:05,691
So in order to protect your mother...

118
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:06,891
I didn't do it.

119
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:08,691
You had no choice.

120
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:09,991
I didn't do it.

121
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:11,091
But...

122
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:14,691
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

123
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:19,691
I didn't do it...

124
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:21,591
He's become totally stubborn.

125
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:26,391
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

126
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:27,891
Come in.

127
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,791
Inspector Megure, a moment.

128
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,892
What is it?

129
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:34,291
Well, actually...

130
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:38,991
We went to canvas the hotel Yuichi was staying at.

131
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:40,892
What? You found her?

132
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:45,791
Yes. She's still staying at the hotel.

133
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,192
"Beika Business Hotel" -According to her...

134
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:55,692
That hurts.

135
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,391
Excuse me.

136
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:01,891
It's all right. I wasn't looking where I was going.

137
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,691
Here.

138
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:06,691
The time displayed on the phone she picked up

139
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,791
was approximately at 10 pm.

140
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:12,491
Additionally, the hotel employee who happened to pass by

141
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,792
witnessed the scene.

142
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,591
So he has multiple people backing up his alibi.

143
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:19,592
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,691
So I can leave now, right?

145
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:26,591
My alibi has been verified.

146
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:28,791
I'm terribly sorry.

147
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,691
We'll give you a ride home.

148
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:33,591
No, thank you. More importantly...

149
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:37,591
I'll never forget the humiliation I suffered

150
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:40,391
while being treated like a murder suspect.

151
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:41,891
Clear the way, please.

152
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:43,192
Of course.

153
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,391
We came up empty.

154
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:51,291
Yeah, but it's for the best.

155
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,191
Indeed.

156
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,491
It would be tragic if one brother killed the other

157
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:59,091
out of concern for his mother.

158
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:02,391
Anyway, if we were wrong about him...

159
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:05,491
Yeah. It's the guy Takagi is after.

160
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:07,991
Chiba, get in touch with Takagi.

161
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:09,291
Yes, sir.

162
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,592
The well-built man in his 30's.

163
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,291
This guy.

164
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:20,091
Yeah. This is the guy.

165
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:22,091
It's definitely him.

166
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:25,491
He was asking around about Eiji.

167
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:29,691
Excuse me, but could I borrow this video?

168
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:33,391
Sure. I'll get it ready for you.

169
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:34,792
Thank you.

170
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:39,291
Hello? Oh, Chiba.

171
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:41,291
I just finished checking some convenience store security camera footage

172
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,891
for the man's face.

173
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,692
I'm about to bring it to the family.

174
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:48,791
This is him.

175
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,991
Oh, really? This is Takase.

176
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:54,591
What? You know him?

177
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:56,391
Who is he?

178
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,391
His name is Rintaro Takase.

179
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:03,391
He was my student back when I taught grade school.

180
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:05,491
Your old student?

181
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:08,891
Is this him, then? Did he kill Eiji?

182
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:11,091
No. Impossible.

183
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:14,291
We don't know that yet.

184
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:17,592
I was treated as a suspect because of this man.

185
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:23,091
We still don't know if he did it yet.

186
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,491
I don't think he did.

187
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:25,492
What?

188
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:32,291
Rintaro was rowdy and caused a lot of trouble.

189
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,891
But at heart, he was a good kid.

190
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:39,891
He's not someone who could've killed another person.

191
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:41,191
I see.

192
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:45,291
Right? Why would Rintaro kill Eiji?

193
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,091
He has no reason to.

194
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:51,491
So, have you met with Takase recently?

195
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:54,391
Yes, last week at the hospital...

196
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:56,291
in the neighborhood.

197
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,791
What? Did you exchange addresses

198
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,391
or contact information then?

199
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:01,392
No.

200
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:04,791
He just said he was working at a construction site

201
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,492
near Hinode Pier.

202
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:24,491
"Rintaro Takase (32), Construction Site Worker."

203
00:12:24,492 --> 00:12:25,691
Takase.

204
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:26,692
What?

205
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:29,091
You're Rintaro Takase, correct?

206
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:32,391
Graduated from Haido Elementary School One.

207
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,892
What if I am?

208
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:37,891
We're the police.

209
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,491
Could we have a few minutes of your time?

210
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:45,291
Sure. Wait for me at the pier.

211
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:48,792
I'll go ask my foreman for his permission.

212
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:56,491
He wasn't even surprised that the police suddenly showed up.

213
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:00,291
He was smirking.

214
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:04,591
And he didn't even ask why we were here.

215
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:08,292
He must've been expecting the police to come.

216
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:20,716
The water taxi for Asakusa is departing.

217
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:28,015
Mrs. Yasuko Kadowaki?

218
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,215
Yeah, of course I remember her.

219
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:34,615
I was a rowdy kid.

220
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:39,215
She scolded me all the time.

221
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:42,216
Honestly, I hated her.

222
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:47,715
But that was 20 years ago.

223
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:49,815
You've been asking around the neighborhood

224
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:52,815
about the Kadowaki family recently.

225
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:56,215
I think it was last week that I ran into her.

226
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:58,415
I wanted to know how she was doing.

227
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,215
I felt nostalgic.

228
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:05,515
Who suddenly feels nostalgic about someone they hated?

229
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:07,015
What?

230
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:11,415
Takase, did you know that Yasuko Kadowaki's younger son,

231
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:16,415
Eiji Kadowaki was killed last night?

232
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,616
What? Her son was killed?

233
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:26,115
We came to talk to you as part of the investigation.

234
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,615
I see.

235
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,915
So, Takase, where were you at 10 pm last night?

236
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:36,115
I knew it. You think I did it, don't you?

237
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,915
But if I wanted revenge,

238
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,115
wouldn't I go after Mrs. Kadowaki directly?

239
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:45,815
Why would I kill her son?

240
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:48,415
A parent's greatest treasure is their children,

241
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,515
no matter how old they are.

242
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,915
Maybe you wanted to make her sad

243
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,316
by taking the life of her son.

244
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,115
I see.

245
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,915
The police have put a lot of thought into this.

246
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,216
How informative.

247
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:10,216
But I didn't do it!

248
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,415
Last night around 10 pm,

249
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,315
I was in the middle of a three hour

250
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:19,715
all you can drink session in Nebada.

251
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:20,916
What?

252
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:25,715
"Three Hours 3,330 yen All You Can Eat and Drink! Nebada Brewery"

253
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,215
I remember him well.

254
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:30,715
He was sitting in that corner.

255
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:35,015
He was facing the wall and kept shouting about fighting spirit.

256
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,016
Spirit! Spirit!

257
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:42,116
Ten cutlet skewers and a large beer!

258
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:45,215
He probably went to the bathroom,

259
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:48,615
but aside from that, he was eating and drinking the whole time.

260
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,515
Do you know what time that was?

261
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:56,515
I think it was three hours starting just after 8 pm.

262
00:15:56,516 --> 00:15:59,615
Would you like to check our security cameras?

263
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:02,615
They're only installed at the entrance, though.

264
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,915
You said around 8 pm, right?

265
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,615
Yeah. He's here.

266
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,915
It's this guy in the loud Hawaiian shirt.

267
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,115
That's definitely Takase.

268
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:15,915
The time is 8:01 pm.

269
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,716
And three hours later...

270
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,516
He's leaving the restaurant after 11 pm.

271
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:33,615
What? He has an alibi?

272
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:34,915
Yes, sir.

273
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,815
We were able to confirm that he was at a bar in Nebada

274
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:41,215
from 8 pm to 11 pm, just like he said.

275
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,616
I see.

276
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:49,715
I told you so.

277
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,216
I didn't do it.

278
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:56,815
It seems that way. I'm sorry.

279
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:00,815
But then who did?

280
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,815
How would I know?

281
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:07,615
Isn't it your job to figure that out? Right?

282
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:09,516
Mr. Inspector.

283
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,215
Well, I'm leaving now.

284
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:18,815
Good luck with your job.

285
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,516
Wait a minute.

286
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,015
Megure here.

287
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,916
What? A fire at the Kadowaki family residence?

288
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,715
I don't believe it.

289
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:43,415
It's completely destroyed.

290
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:47,015
What about them? Where's the Kadowaki family?

291
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,415
Over there.

292
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,216
They're at that ambulance.

293
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,216
Yuichi.

294
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:00,515
You're all right.

295
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:02,916
What about your mother?

296
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:07,815
They just took her away.

297
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:09,916
They're going to determine the cause of death.

298
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:14,616
Mrs. Kadowaki...

299
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:21,316
So that was your destiny.

300
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:28,616
Hey, what's so funny?

301
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:31,716
Darn it.

302
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,616
Sometimes there's nothing you can do.

303
00:18:42,716 --> 00:18:46,216
Well, inspector, I'll be leaving now.

304
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,815
Yuichi.

305
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,015
I'm terribly sorry to ask at this time,

306
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:58,615
but could you tell us what happened?

307
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:01,815
For your late mother's sake, too.

308
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:02,816
All right.

309
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:06,016
"Haido West Third Street Police Box."

310
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:07,615
When the fire broke out,

311
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:11,015
I was sleeping in my room on the second floor.

312
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,115
Perhaps it's because I'd been questioned by the police,

313
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:15,716
but I had a terrible headache.

314
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,815
So by the time I realized something was amiss,

315
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,116
it was a sea of fire.

316
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:27,015
Mom! Are you there, mom?

317
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:30,716
It was all I could do to save myself.

318
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,415
It may be a coincidence,

319
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:38,415
but I can't believe he lost his mother right after his brother.

320
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,015
About that...

321
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:46,515
Yuichi, can you think of anyone who might have resented you

322
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,516
and the rest of the Kadowaki family?

323
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:55,315
Another one of your family members died today.

324
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:59,415
Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence?

325
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,815
He's not wrong.

326
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,915
But, inspector...

327
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,115
It's a possibility. We should confirm it.

328
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:09,315
Yes, but...

329
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:11,515
Well, Yuichi?

330
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:15,416
No. I can't think of anyone like that.

331
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,515
I know what he said,

332
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:23,815
but check out everyone associated

333
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:26,515
with the Kadowaki family tomorrow.

334
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:30,515
See if anyone hated that family.

335
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:31,516
Yes, sir.

336
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,115
What is it, Mouri?

337
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:36,615
You don't like it?

338
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:40,115
No, that's not it.

339
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:43,015
In any case, inspector, we should get going.

340
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:45,215
-All right. -Let's go, kid.

341
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:46,516
Okay.

342
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,615
That Takase guy definitely did it.

343
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,815
What? But when the fire happened...

344
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,715
The fire is unrelated.

345
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:59,015
I'm talking about Eiji's murder.

346
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:03,615
That fire was just an unfortunate coincidence.

347
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:07,315
It's true that his behavior was unnatural.

348
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:10,915
He wasn't surprised at all that the police suddenly showed up.

349
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,615
Or when he heard Eiji Kadowaki was murdered.

350
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:18,215
What? Her son was killed?

351
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,815
It seemed so deliberate.

352
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,515
Yeah.

353
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:28,215
He knew that Eiji had been murdered.

354
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:29,716
Most likely, yes.

355
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:39,616
"Nebada Brewery."

356
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:44,516
"Three Hours 3,330 yen All You Can Eat and Drink! Nebada Brewery."

357
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,415
"Nebada Brewery."

358
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,315
But he has an alibi.

359
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:56,115
He was taken off the suspect list as a result.

360
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:59,615
He must've used some kind of trick.

361
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:05,715
I, Kogoro Mouri, swear on my name that I'll expose him.

362
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:10,315
But I don't think the Kadowaki family residence fire

363
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:13,415
was a total coincidence.

364
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:18,015
But if that's true, then these two cases...

365
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,516
How in the world are they connected?

"Next Episode"

9:08 pm to 10:35 pm.

368
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,915
That's about an hour and a half.

369
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:54,515
You were just saying how I could've killed him, too, weren't you?

370
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,715
What proof do you have that I did it?

371
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:00,315
You get in trouble at school, too?

372
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:01,715
What?

373
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:04,215
So that's how it is.

374
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:06,416
Which means the fire...

375
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,015
