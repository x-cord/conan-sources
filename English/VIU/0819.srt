1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,279
Pops Kogoro is asked to serve as singer idol Risa Purple's bodyguard,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,979
Ran and I are also invited to her live concert.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,879
At that event, two men mistook Ran for Risa, kidnap and take her away.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,079
Pops and I pursue the kidnappers

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,579
and we figure out their hideout

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,079
but what we find there is

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,079
the plan that the kidnapper and Risa Purple had planned.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,579
"Mr. Takeyama, please save me."

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,779
"Please carry me out of the live concert hall on the day of the event"?

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,779
"Set the fire alarm off and cause a commotion"?

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,379
This is the blueprint of today's event hall.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,279
It seems that Takeyama mailed her back 15 minutes ago.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,779
"Risa, I've mistakenly kidnapped the wrong person."

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,679
"What shall I do?"

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,979
If you made a mistake,

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,079
just release her right away!

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,379
No. Ran most probably won't be set free.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,779
On the contrary,

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,779
it hard to believe that they would let her free

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,379
after she's seen their faces and all.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,479
Those who have no set plan

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,279
are more prone to make irrational moves on impulse.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,480
Even if means taking action that would threaten a person's life.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,079
A canvas stained black with crime.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,279
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,779
Ran Mouri is kidnapped.

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,379
What's the gamble that was used to save her life?

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,979
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,079
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,580
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:18,496
"The Great Pursuit of Enraged Kogoro (Part 2)"

32
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:27,111
Take custody of Risa Purple immediately!

33
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:30,011
If she's the one who schemed this plan,

34
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:32,311
she should know where this place is!

35
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,111
Inspector Megure is interrogating Risa now.

36
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:36,311
Too time consuming!

37
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:39,011
I'll go ask her myself!

38
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,611
Brat, let's go!

39
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:44,311
Hey, the picture on this Face Net is a bit strange.

40
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:45,411
Picture?

41
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:47,011
All her pictures in the posters

42
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:49,711
are facing the left side of her face to the camera, right?

43
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,011
So, what?

44
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:56,011
Risa Purple's charm point is her mole under her left eye.

45
00:03:56,012 --> 00:04:00,811
So she faces her left side to the camera every time.

46
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:03,811
But this picture is taken from the right side.

47
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:07,111
It's strange that she would put a picture like this on the net.

48
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:10,411
Which means Risa's imposter or something

49
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:13,812
was corresponding by mail with Takeyama?

50
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,411
The answering machine.

51
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,511
Come to think of it, there was a message asking for her to call back.

52
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,211
It was written on Takeyama's Face Net.

53
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:31,011
Risa's imposter maybe is planning to insert a message or something.

54
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:33,211
I'm not home right now.

55
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:36,012
Please leave a message after the tone.

56
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,811
The PIN code is being pushed.

57
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:43,411
The perpetrator's trying to listen to the message from outside.

58
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:47,011
-What? -No new message has been recorded.

59
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:49,011
Darn it!

60
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:50,911
Hey, where's Ran?

61
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:52,311
She'd better be all right!

62
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:54,212
Hey, answer me!

63
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:01,411
The perpetrator's found out about us.

64
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:04,611
So, the perpetrator will never call again.

65
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,811
What now?

66
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:10,511
It's him! It's that man!

67
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:13,311
He's the guy that came chasing us from the live event hall!

68
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,611
"Takichi Takeyama (43)" -Yosaburo!

69
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:17,911
We're in this mess because you made a mistake!

70
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:22,711
"Yosaburo Ihara (28)" -But unlike you, I don't care about Risa Purple.

71
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:24,811
I don't even know what she really looks like either.

72
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:27,011
Stop insulting Risa!

73
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,311
What are you doing?

74
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:30,911
If we get caught,

75
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:35,612
we're going to get Risa in trouble.

76
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:42,611
Don't worry about it.

77
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:45,212
They'll never find this place.

78
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:50,212
I... I can't breathe.

79
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:54,811
Dad. Conan.

80
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,212
Help me.

81
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,411
"Risa Purple (21)" -I don't use Face Net.

82
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:06,911
I never sent my fans such comments or messages!

83
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:10,611
Right! I'm sure it's an imposter!

84
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:13,511
Risa's finally starting to gain popularity!

85
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:16,011
She would never gain anything

86
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:17,611
"Ginji Yamane (38)" -from such commotion.

87
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,212
This is nothing more than trouble!

88
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:26,711
"Junichi Sakuta (43)" -Cut it out won't you!

89
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:28,711
Stop filming!

90
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:33,011
But, this is news that everybody's interested about.

91
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:36,711
"Bianca (26)" -It is at top rank on the net too.

92
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:39,211
I'm grateful for your cooperation.

93
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:43,411
But don't forget that we're still in the process of investigation.

94
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:45,511
Are you still suspecting us?

95
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:49,011
Thinking that there's an accomplice among us?

96
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:50,811
I didn't say that.

97
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:53,711
I just have to confirm the facts.

98
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:56,511
Unless someone unlocked the door,

99
00:06:56,512 --> 00:07:01,711
the perpetrator couldn't have pushed the fire alarm.

100
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,911
Mr. Yamane.

101
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:04,611
You said you went out to the corridor

102
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:06,611
just before the live started, didn't you?

103
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:09,511
Yes. Like I said before,

104
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,811
I just went to make a phone call

105
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:14,211
and didn't unlock the door.

106
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:16,811
Who are you calling?

107
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:20,011
At a busy time when the live was about to start,

108
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:22,711
who are you calling?

109
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:25,211
Well...

110
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,811
Mr. Yamane, please.

111
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,412
Tell him the truth without hiding anything!

112
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,311
Inspector.

113
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,612
Mouri! Conan!

114
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:44,012
The manager was calling the perpetrator, Takeyama.

115
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,811
To Takeyama?

116
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:50,611
Hey, you! Stop taking me lightly!

117
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:53,911
I know who you are!

118
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:56,411
Don't you ever make threatening calls like this again.

119
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,411
Because if you do, you, you're not only ever going to come near again!

120
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:02,411
I'm going to beat you to a pulp and turn you over to the police.

121
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:05,011
Understand?

122
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:07,211
Mr. Yamane.

123
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:08,711
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:12,711
I told you not to get rough with my fans, didn't I?

125
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:16,811
I told you time and again not do that and yet...

126
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:21,311
Mr. Yamane, why do you know Takeyama's phone number?

127
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,911
When I got the threat calls,

128
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,911
I registered his number.

129
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:29,411
Of course, I didn't know that it was Takeyama's number.

130
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:33,811
But I didn't want any bomb threat calls coming in before the live,

131
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,511
so I did so, just in case.

132
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:37,611
When you were making the call,

133
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:40,211
was there anybody in the corridor?

134
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:43,311
No, I was alone.

135
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:47,511
I couldn't see the place where the fire alarm was from where I was.

136
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:50,211
Therefore, I don't know if anyone was there.

137
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:51,911
Please try to remember!

138
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:53,811
It's very important!

139
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:56,212
Pops, don't get violent!

140
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:02,311
We've got to specify the place in the picture.

141
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,311
That's right.

142
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:08,111
Ran is probably here.

143
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:09,611
Where is it?

144
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:11,211
I don't know for sure,

145
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,311
but I think it's the place

146
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:15,411
where Takeyama guys are illegally disposing trash.

147
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:19,411
The refrigerator that Ran was locked up in was also disposed of here.

148
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:23,711
We found the area where the perpetrator made the call from.

149
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:27,411
The base station covers a fairly large area, from Beika Mountain Pass

150
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:29,411
to the entire area around Teimuzu Valley.

151
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:32,811
Let's tell them to search from the air on the double using the chopper!

152
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:33,812
Yes, sir!

153
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,311
But a place where trash is disposed of illegally

154
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,311
is usually not in plain sight.

155
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:44,011
I think it's difficult to find the place by chopper at night.

156
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:46,011
Conan's right!

157
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:48,711
Besides if the refrigerator is sealed tight,

158
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:52,611
it would only take a short while for oxygen to start lacking!

159
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:55,212
Ran wouldn't make it out alive by tomorrow morning!

160
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:03,711
We have 500 officers out searching right now.

161
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:06,311
But they have no means of searching

162
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:08,811
unless we can narrow down the search area first.

163
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:12,311
Inspector, I have an idea.

164
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,712
An idea?

165
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:19,411
I'll call out to the perpetrator!

166
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,111
I'll implore the perpetrator to save Ran,

167
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,911
to please not take her life.

168
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:27,711
I'm going to let the perpetrator know how I honestly feel as her father!

169
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:32,111
We have no choice but appeal to the consciences of the kidnappers.

170
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:34,211
I understand how you feel

171
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:37,212
but just how do we call out to the perpetrator?

172
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:40,911
I've got a favor to ask of you.

173
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:42,411
A favor?

174
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:47,611
Will you air my message to the perpetrator on your program?

175
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,711
Our program?

176
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:53,811
I don't mind but we're cable TV,

177
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:56,811
so our viewers are limited.

178
00:10:56,812 --> 00:11:00,911
The chances of your message reaching the perpetrator is extremely low.

179
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:03,111
Even if there's only a slight chance, there's no choice but to try.

180
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:08,212
Just waiting doing nothing isn't going to save Ran's life!

181
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:12,512
All right, I'll get to it right away.

182
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:15,811
Inspector.

183
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:18,311
Ran's life is at stake.

184
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,211
Do whatever it takes.

185
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,311
Thank you.

186
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:24,912
Pops. I'm counting on you.

187
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:39,012
"Rainbow"

188
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:52,811
Conan.

189
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,411
We're starting soon, so they're asking for you to come in.

190
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:56,611
Yep.

191
00:11:56,612 --> 00:12:00,111
Risa originally belonged to a group, right?

192
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:03,511
Yeah. She first belonged to a group of seven.

193
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:07,211
Then, there were several member changes,

194
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:09,812
yet popularity was difficult to achieve.

195
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:18,212
We're going live in three, two...

196
00:12:20,312 --> 00:12:23,611
Ladies and gentlemen, as you may all be familiar with this,

197
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:29,511
a kidnapping case occurred at the live show of Ms. Risa Purple today.

198
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:30,711
This is bad!

199
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:34,711
Risa Purple has been abducted!

200
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,311
Now you're about to see a message

201
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:40,111
from Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the Father of Ms. Ran Mouri,

202
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:44,012
who was kidnapped back then, to the kidnappers.

203
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:52,811
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

204
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:55,311
We already know that

205
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:58,811
you mistakenly kidnapped my daughter instead of Risa.

206
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:02,411
I'm sure my daughter means nothing to you guys.

207
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:06,711
And you probably think that she's just another nuisance to you.

208
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:11,811
But to me, she's a precious treasure.

209
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:14,611
My daughter's still just 16 years old.

210
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:17,911
Although my daughter tells me nothing,

211
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:21,412
I'm sure she's hoping for a happy future.

212
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:25,311
You guys are trying to take that happy future

213
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,911
from my daughter right this minute!

214
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:29,811
My daughter has done nothing to deserve this!

215
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:34,011
Please calm down and at least spare her life, I beg you!

216
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:37,811
I don't want to make murderers out of you.

217
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:40,511
You may be thinking that so long as you shut my daughter up,

218
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:43,911
you can get away with what you did,

219
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:46,011
but you're making a big mistake!

220
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:50,911
Why? That's because my daughter has proof of you, the kidnapper.

221
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,912
Proof of the kidnapper?

222
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,706
My daughter took pictures everywhere of the live hall,

223
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:10,307
just before the performance began.

224
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,806
It is highly likely that in one of the pictures taken,

225
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,806
a person who was in a certain place

226
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:23,106
where nobody should've been was coincidentally taken.

227
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:25,507
A person who wasn't supposed to be there!

228
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:31,506
I don't know who that was either.

229
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,306
But, now that I've said all this,

230
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,106
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

231
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:39,806
If you're the kidnapper, you should also already know that

232
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:42,306
the picture would serve as undeniable evidence.

233
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:44,006
A soon as day breaks,

234
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:47,206
the police will start a search dispatching 500 officers.

235
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:50,906
They will be asking support from firefighters, the mountain rescue team

236
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,706
and even the Self-Defense Force.

237
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,706
But if at that time,

238
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,007
my daughter is found dead, you're finished!

239
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,806
You'll be burdening yourself with a sin so great

240
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:04,606
that you'll never be able to compensate for.

241
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:09,306
Please save my daughter before anything like that happens.

242
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,607
That's my only wish.

243
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,906
That was a fantastic broadcast.

244
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:21,806
I hope it reaches the perpetrator's conscience.

245
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:25,006
I don't know if it reached the perpetrator's conscience.

246
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,906
But if evidence is left in Ran's cell phone,

247
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:34,006
I'm sure they'll make their move tonight to try to get rid of it.

248
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:37,106
Pops set a trap on the kidnapper.

249
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:38,406
A trap?

250
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:41,206
Pops lied saying that Ran took pictures

251
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,706
that would serve as evidence.

252
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,106
Lied?

253
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:46,806
It's a risky gamble,

254
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:49,606
but there's no other way to save Ran's life.

255
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:52,706
But no matter if you tried setting a trap,

256
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:56,606
if the kidnapper isn't watching the broadcast, it's not worth anything.

257
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,506
I'm sure the kidnapper's watching.

258
00:15:58,507 --> 00:15:59,906
Right, Pops?

259
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:02,406
Yeah, I'm positive!

260
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:03,407
Inspector.

261
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,306
The kidnapper's started to move.

262
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:06,407
What?

263
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,806
How did you know that he was the kidnapper?

264
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:30,306
Evidence of it was left in this answering machine.

265
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:31,307
Right.

266
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:33,007
Answering machine?

267
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,706
Am I getting bonus, President?

268
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:46,907
Stop worrying about your bonus and worry about Risa, will you?

269
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,306
Somebody's coming.

270
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,407
Hide.

271
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:07,407
Yes.

272
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:11,407
So that ringtone was your phone's after all, Bianca.

273
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:17,306
When the manager was leaving a message in the answering machine,

274
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:21,706
That ringtone although really slight was heard.

275
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,306
Hey, you! Stop taking me lightly!

276
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:27,606
I know who you are!

277
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:30,206
Don't you ever make threatening calls like this again.

278
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,206
Because if you do, you, you're not only ever going to come near again!

279
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:36,206
I'm going to beat you to a pulp and turn you over to the police.

280
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:37,807
Understand?

281
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:41,507
Understand?

282
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:46,106
Bianca, what're you doing?

283
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,406
We're starting, you know?

284
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,306
I'll be right there.

285
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:53,706
That call was from Director Sakuta, wasn't it?

286
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,606
Yeah.

287
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,506
I got worried because Bianca was nowhere in sight

288
00:17:58,507 --> 00:17:59,806
although we were ready to start.

289
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,806
I, Kogoro Mouri, will protect Risa with my life

290
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:06,306
no matter who attack her.

291
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:08,906
Bianca. Where were you?

292
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,606
I'm so sorry...

293
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,406
Risa!

294
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:15,807
I remember you talking that way.

295
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:22,006
Mr. Sakuta. Did you know this place?

296
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:23,706
No. Bianca said that

297
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:25,806
if it's the place where Takeyama was illegally disposing stuff,

298
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:27,406
she had an idea of the location.

299
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,806
I thought that it would be a scoop.

300
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:33,707
Don't tell me that you're the kidnapper!

301
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:54,407
You can't get away.

302
00:18:57,207 --> 00:18:58,806
Yosaburo, let's get out of here!

303
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,206
Yes, president!

304
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,406
You guys!

305
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,106
Where's Ran?

306
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:08,106
Tell me! Where's my daughter?

307
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,107
Where is she?

308
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,107
At the bottom of the hole!

309
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:14,006
Conan! Let's go!

310
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:23,707
-Ran... -Ran...

311
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,806
Ran!

312
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:30,506
Get a hold of yourself!

313
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:32,807
-Ran. -Ran!

314
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,506
Wake up, Ran!

315
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:41,007
Ran...

316
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:46,407
Ran.

317
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:54,206
Ran.

318
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:55,407
Conan.

319
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:58,906
Dad.

320
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,007
Ran.

321
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:04,707
I made it?

322
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,006
I'm glad.

323
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:12,606
Ran...

324
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:15,106
Dad, it hurts.

325
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:16,207
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:25,406
You came wearing platform sneakers after all.

327
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,506
What?

328
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:30,006
You knew that the live hall would be drenched with water

329
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:31,306
from the sprinklers

330
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:33,807
so you were wearing non-slip shoes, right?

331
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:37,406
You used to wear only platform sneakers

332
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:41,106
since your days as an underground idol.

333
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,906
How did you know?

334
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,206
You were jealous, weren't you?

335
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:49,206
Because Risa, who came in after you became popular.

336
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,506
Right.

337
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:52,806
If Risa was kidnapped,

338
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:55,806
I being the MC at the site would also be given attention,

339
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:58,607
so I thought that I would be able to sell my face and name.

340
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:02,606
I figured that I could fool Takeyama,

341
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:05,907
who always came to Risa's live easily.

342
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,607
But, I guess it didn't work out after all.

343
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:45,706
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

344
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:49,206
I'm sure glad that Ran's perfectly fine now.

345
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:50,406
Thank you.

346
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:56,006
Shinichi seemed worried too and called me at the hospital.

347
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,706
Oh.

348
00:22:57,707 --> 00:23:03,906
More than that, I didn't think that Dad loved me so much.

349
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:07,106
How many times did we watch that broadcast already?

350
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:10,706
Well, but your eyes were super bloodshot.

351
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:13,206
Talk about a great act.

352
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:14,406
What else did you expect?

353
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:18,606
I used to want to be an actor in my younger days.

354
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,306
An act?

355
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:21,606
It was all an act?

356
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:24,706
Oh, no, of course not!

357
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:26,706
Brat, what a thing to say.

358
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,206
Hey, Dad.

359
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,406
Tell me the truth.

360
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:33,606
Oh, I just remembered, I've got a lot of things to do today!

361
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:34,706
See you!

362
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:38,006
Wait. Dad!

363
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,707
My tongue slipped.

364
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:44,006
"Next Episode" -How dare you!

365
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,206
Just how many people did you deceive till now?

366
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,606
I never deceived anyone.

367
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:51,707
I just introduced good value loans.

368
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:55,606
Dad, get up!

369
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:56,806
What is it?

370
00:23:56,807 --> 00:24:00,406
That woman secretary went out alone.

371
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,507
What?

372
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:04,406
A gunshot?

373
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:05,807
What?

374
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:12,107
