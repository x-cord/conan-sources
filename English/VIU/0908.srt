1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,419
Even in Tokyo, there are places like this.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,720
I know. It was worth coming, right?

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,219
The air's clear and the view's excellent.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,619
What a great place to drink sake.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,020
This way, please.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,419
Hey, miss. That watermill isn't working.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,319
That's right. It used to deliver water

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,519
to the wasabi farms.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,419
Now we use it as an icehouse.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,819
An icehouse?

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,519
That's like a natural refrigerator, right?

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,619
Yes.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,619
It's where we keep the natural ice we serve here.

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,920
Excuse me.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,419
"Juri Matsui, Maria Suzumoto, Yuko Akiba (21)" -Are you...

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,320
"Teito University Philosophy Student" -Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,019
Yes, that's me.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,519
May I take a photo with you?

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,019
Of course. I don't mind.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,219
Why don't I take it for you?

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,920
No, thank you.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,619
Over here.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,519
Let's line up in front of the river.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,320
Mr. Mouri, everyone, please.

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,120
Come on, Maria.

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,020
Here.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,819
Wait. Move aside.

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,920
Yuko.

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,519
Here we go.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,619
Okay. Say "cheese".

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,020
Cheese...

32
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,519
When the countdown reaches zero,

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,120
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,119
Taking a commemorate photo by a cool riverbed.

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,519
Do these three women even like each other?

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,019
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,819
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,920
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:34,356
"Friendship Washed Away In The Riverbed"

40
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:40,455
Gosh! I have a blister.

41
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:43,755
I'm exhausted from walking so far.

42
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,655
But you said you wanted to come here.

43
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:48,455
Isn't that because you suggested

44
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:51,555
the three of us go somewhere together?

45
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:53,355
Now, now.

46
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:56,256
We came here to make up with each other.

47
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,156
Maria, do you have any band-aids?

48
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:07,756
Thanks.

49
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:10,556
Excuse me.

50
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:15,855
Here is your appetizer.

51
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,755
This looks delicious!

52
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:19,956
I'll take one, too.

53
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,356
What are they doing?

54
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:27,255
Dad, don't you know?

55
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:29,355
It's popular among girls these days

56
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:32,455
to upload photos made to look cute to the internet.

57
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,456
See? I do it, too.

58
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:39,456
Cute, you say?

59
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,255
Is there a problem?

60
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:44,756
I hear some birds singing.

61
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:51,156
I can't get the right angle.

62
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,356
Look.

63
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:57,056
That's cute.

64
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,455
You're trying too hard to act cute.

65
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:03,055
You never change.

66
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,555
How about mine?

67
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:08,555
Maria showed me a new app.

68
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:09,955
It's all right.

69
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:13,455
But using an app for photo correction feels wrong.

70
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,156
How about yours, then?

71
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,355
What do you think?

72
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:20,355
Getting these shadows was really hard work.

73
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:21,856
It feels cold.

74
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,055
Did you say something?

75
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,855
What? No.

76
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:29,355
Let's have the great detective judge them.

77
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:30,656
I agree!

78
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:34,056
Excuse me.

79
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:37,756
Could you take a look at our photos?

80
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:41,755
We're thinking of submitting them

81
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:44,055
to a publishing company's photo contest.

82
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,555
I know about the contest.

83
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:49,555
The winner gets a book published of their photos.

84
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:50,655
Yeah.

85
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:53,356
Could you give us some advice?

86
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:58,155
But I don't know anything about photography.

87
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,555
Unbelievable.

88
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:02,055
Do you think that's good enough to win?

89
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:03,856
Don't make me laugh.

90
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:06,856
I'll be back.

91
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:14,255
Oh, no. My battery's dead.

92
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:17,355
No. I'm out of storage, too.

93
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:19,255
Should we go now?

94
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:20,455
Yeah.

95
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:24,156
Sorry. The judging will have to wait.

96
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,756
What was that about?

97
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,456
Gosh, Dad.

98
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:44,655
Anyway, those girls sure are taking a long time.

99
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:47,355
It's been a while since they left.

100
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:49,055
Their food's getting cold.

101
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:51,555
She really should try it.

102
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:54,255
I know. Apps are so nice.

103
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:57,855
What? Yuko's still not back.

104
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,355
She was probably busy taking photos

105
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,755
and forgot to keep track of time.

106
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,455
You're right.

107
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,956
Let's start without her.

108
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:09,955
This fish is transparent.

109
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:12,855
It's almost too pretty to eat.

110
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:14,755
Thank you for waiting.

111
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:18,656
This is our special natural shaved ice.

112
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,555
How cute!

113
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:26,556
Let me take a picture first.

114
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:29,856
What is that?

115
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:36,155
What's wrong?

116
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,356
Over there.

117
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:43,755
Yuko?

118
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,755
-What? -It's an emergency!

119
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,855
Wait, Conan!

120
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:47,955
Get a life preserver!

121
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:50,856
-Dad! -Stand back, kid!

122
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,156
Dad!

123
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:56,556
Pops!

124
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,556
Hey, are you okay?

125
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:06,455
She's dead.

126
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:09,055
Ran, call the police.

127
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,156
Got it.

128
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:17,155
-What are these? -Hey, kid!

129
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,755
How many times

130
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:21,555
do I have to tell you to stay out of crime scenes?

131
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:23,255
Go away!

132
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,055
Okay.

133
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,756
-Yuko! -Keep it together.

134
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:30,956
Here.

135
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:41,455
Mouri, did you just happen to be

136
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:42,855
at the scene of the crime once again?

137
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,355
I am ashamed.

138
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:47,355
It's a great detective's fate.

139
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:49,555
In any case, why don't you explain what was happening

140
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:52,055
when the body came down the river?

141
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:54,155
Well...

142
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:56,455
Don't tell me you don't remember

143
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:59,556
because you were passed out drunk in the middle of the day.

144
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:05,556
Of course not, Inspector. You must be joking.

145
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:10,155
We came here to take photos.

146
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:14,555
But Yuko got a text from someone and left.

147
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:17,455
Since she hadn't come back,

148
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,356
we were worried.

149
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:24,055
Then some blood red water suddenly

150
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,455
came flowing down the river.

151
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:29,555
That was when we saw Yuko in the red river.

152
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:30,556
That's right.

153
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:32,955
Awakened by the scream,

154
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:37,255
I leapt into the river and pulled her out.

155
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,655
I see.

156
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,355
So he was asleep.

157
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:43,555
Hey, miss.

158
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,055
What is it?

159
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:48,755
Earlier you said you came here to make up.

160
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,156
What did that mean?

161
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,756
Well, you know...

162
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,655
Inspector!

163
00:09:57,656 --> 00:09:59,855
I have the results of the body inspection.

164
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,555
The cause of death was a cerebral contusion

165
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:04,255
from a blow to the back of the head.

166
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:07,555
Do we know what the red stuff in the water was?

167
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:08,955
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:12,055
It's a fern called Azolla Japonica

169
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:15,655
that grows in lakes, right?

170
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,555
Conan, you sure are knowledgeable.

171
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:21,155
I saw it on TV the other day.

172
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:24,655
Because the plant was small, buoyant and red,

173
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,055
they look like pools of blood

174
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,755
in large quantities.

175
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:30,055
I see.

176
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:32,555
We also discovered what we believe

177
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:36,955
to be the victim's belongings near the watermill.

178
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:40,355
You two. Do you recognize this?

179
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,955
That belonged to Yuko.

180
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,855
There's a label on it.

181
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:47,355
On the phone... Excuse me.

182
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,956
We found this photo.

183
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:53,755
It's possible the victim accidentally fell here

184
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:56,455
while trying to take a photo.

185
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,555
-Let me see that. -Hey!

186
00:10:58,556 --> 00:10:59,656
This is...

187
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:02,555
Don't do that, Conan.

188
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:04,156
Sorry.

189
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:10,655
Hey. What's wrong, mister?

190
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:14,255
I wanted to go to the watermill,

191
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,555
but they won't let me in

192
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:17,155
because of an investigation or something.

193
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:21,255
You mean the watermill converted into an icehouse, right?

194
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:23,956
-Yeah. What about... -Thanks, mister.

195
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:27,855
Like Inspector Megure said,

196
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:30,555
it's possible she fell accidentally.

197
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,255
But what about the photo?

198
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:34,755
"Police, Keep Out"

199
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:39,555
Officer, did my beetle come flying this way?

200
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:41,855
I didn't see one.

201
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:44,255
-There it is! -Wait, kid!

202
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:47,855
You're Ms. Juri Matsui, right?

203
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:50,955
I heard you were away when the incident occurred.

204
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:53,955
Am I a suspect?

205
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:59,155
No. We're just questioning everyone as part of the investigation.

206
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:00,955
I just went to a convenience store to buy extra storage

207
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:02,655
for my phone.

208
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,955
"Receipt" -Why don't you check with the store clerk?

209
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,156
They'll confirm my story.

210
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,956
I'll take that.

211
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:14,055
The three of you came here together, right?

212
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:17,955
The decision to disband our photography club was suddenly made.

213
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:20,755
I got into a fight with Yuko over it,

214
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,356
so we came here to make up.

215
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:38,256
It's cold. This must be the icehouse.

216
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:41,455
Just as I thought.

217
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:44,056
The waterwheel that's supposedly not in use is moving.

218
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:50,656
They put sawdust on it so that it won't melt.

219
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,055
There's no doubt about it.

220
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:58,555
This wasn't an accident.

221
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:00,356
It was murder.

222
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,255
I went to get the charger I forgot.

223
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,555
I ran into the chef on the way.

224
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:08,855
You can ask him.

225
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:12,155
Who decided that you should come here?

226
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:13,355
It was Yuko.

227
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:17,155
She said one of her blog's fans told her to come here.

228
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:22,055
Do you know why she went to the watermill?

229
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:25,955
She probably wanted to take photos there.

230
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:28,256
She could be so egotistical.

231
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,256
Wild roses?

232
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,656
This is...

233
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:59,056
I see.

234
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,656
So that's how it was.

235
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:08,900
Conan!

236
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:11,800
Where did that brat disappear to?

237
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:15,600
Inspector, do we still have to stay?

238
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm so sad.

239
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:19,800
I don't want to be here anymore.

240
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:21,201
Inspector.

241
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,000
This was an accident.

242
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:28,100
Yuko wanted to win a publishing company's

243
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,700
phone photography contest.

244
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:32,000
That's why she stole a march on her friends

245
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,500
and went to take photos of the watermill.

246
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:39,601
While trying various angles with her selfie stick...

247
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:43,300
Conan.

248
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:45,600
Where have you been?

249
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,301
Sorry!

250
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:51,201
Wait, Conan!

251
00:14:57,301 --> 00:15:00,400
Inspector, this wasn't an accident.

252
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,401
It was murder.

253
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,500
What are you talking about?

254
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:10,700
You just said it was an accident.

255
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,500
I was just elaborating based on a common line of thinking.

256
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:17,800
But now it's time for the great detective to shine.

257
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:19,700
Don't you think it's strange?

258
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:23,700
Her selfie stick was discovered in the riverbed.

259
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:28,100
But if she slipped while trying to take a photo,

260
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:31,700
she and her phone should've fallen into the river.

261
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,000
You're right.

262
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,700
In other words, the selfie stick

263
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:39,200
was placed in a way that makes it look like an accident

264
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:42,200
by the person who murdered Ms. Yuko.

265
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

266
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:48,100
The killer lured her out using a free texting service.

267
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,601
I'll be back.

268
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:53,200
Sorry. The judging will have to wait.

269
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,500
Later, she gave her own excuse

270
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,700
and went after the victim.

271
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:00,000
After meeting her at the watermill,

272
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:04,100
the killer asked her for tips on taking good photos

273
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:06,800
and made the victim take selfies.

274
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:10,700
Then, she convinced Ms. Yuko to go into the watermill

275
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,700
after breaking the lock beforehand

276
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:15,500
and struck Yuko with some natural ice

277
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,400
and killed her.

278
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:19,400
In the watermill,

279
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:22,700
there were traces of sawdust being swept.

280
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:27,800
The killer must have erased their footprints.

281
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:29,300
After murdering Ms. Yuko,

282
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,100
the killer used a cart

283
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,900
to transport the body from the watermill.

284
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:37,400
Then she threw her into a pool

285
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,600
and left the selfie stick on the riverbank

286
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:43,700
so it would look like she fell into the water.

287
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:48,500
The person who staged the accident and murdered Ms. Yuko

288
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:50,501
is among us.

289
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:54,901
Hey, listen.

290
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:59,001
What? Mr. Mouri did?

291
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:09,700
But Mouri, when Yuko fell into the river,

292
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:12,700
weren't the two of them with you?

293
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:13,900
That's right.

294
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,400
You also saw

295
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,400
Yuko float down the river with the red water.

296
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:21,800
That was the killer's trick.

297
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,100
What?

298
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:26,000
Officer Takagi, are you ready?

299
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,500
Takagi?

300
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:29,001
Now that you mentioned it, where is he?

301
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:35,301
Allow me to recreate that trick for you.

302
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,301
Ready!

303
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,700
The waterwheel spun.

304
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes. The killer opened a sluice which wasn't normally used.

305
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,800
The river water swept up the Azolla Japonica

306
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,100
that had grown in the irrigation canal

307
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:12,600
and flowed into the pool.

308
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:16,101
Eventually, the water level in the pool rose.

309
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:21,000
We've been waiting a long time now.

310
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,400
Nothing's happening.

311
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,300
The time used

312
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:28,901
was exactly what the killer carefully calculated as part of their trick.

313
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:36,000
Pools are naturally formed when sections of the river curve

314
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,400
and separate from the main river.

315
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:41,400
When a body is put in a pool and water is directed towards it,

316
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,500
it will eventually flow out into the river.

317
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,500
The one who planned all of this

318
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,800
was you, Ms. Maria.

319
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:49,900
Me?

320
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:53,300
There were tiny scratches on the body.

321
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:56,500
She probably got them from the thorns of wild roses

322
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,000
while being carried to the pool.

323
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:00,500
Those same scratches

324
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:03,800
should also be found on the killer's body.

325
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:06,300
Maria, did you...

326
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:09,601
No, Juri. These are...

327
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,600
Believe me!

328
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,200
I really didn't...

329
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:16,700
There's no point in playing dumb.

330
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:18,400
I've already noticed.

331
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:22,200
You weren't wearing band-aids when you first arrived,

332
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:26,400
but you were when you returned from the riverbed.

333
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:27,800
Inspector.

334
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,400
I had the forensics team examine the watermill.

335
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,600
They found what we believe

336
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:36,200
to be Ms. Yuko's blood on one of the blocks of ice.

337
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:38,800
What? Is that true?

338
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:42,000
Why don't you give up already?

339
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,800
That's just your reasoning.

340
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:46,700
Show me the proof.

341
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:49,600
Proof that I killed her!

342
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:53,100
You have it on you, Ms. Maria.

343
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:56,600
The gloves you wore when picking up the ice

344
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:59,300
haven't been found anywhere.

345
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:02,300
I believe those gloves must have Yuko's blood

346
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:06,300
and the sawdust from the crime scene on them.

347
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:08,101
Excuse me.

348
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,101
I found them.

349
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:18,300
She got what she deserved.

350
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:22,700
The three of us were college friends.

351
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,600
If we won the contest,

352
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:27,400
we'd have a collection of our photos published.

353
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:30,100
To leave a lasting memory of our college life,

354
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:33,300
we agreed it would belong to everyone

355
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,100
no matter who won.

356
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,101
But...

357
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,601
"Maria_suzu has uploaded a post."

358
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,600
"What is this? It's terrible." -But that day,

359
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:46,501
I realized the person making those comments was Yuko.

360
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,801
Yuko, thanks for waiting.

361
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:53,901
"Just go away."

362
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,700
No way. Yuko, did you...

363
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:59,900
Oh, no. Have I been found out?

364
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:02,400
But it's true.

365
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:06,201
Besides, I'm going to win the contest.

366
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:10,700
She was insulting everyone in the photography club

367
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,300
who were submitting photos

368
00:21:12,301 --> 00:21:14,300
so she would win.

369
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:18,300
The next day, we were friends as usual,

370
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:22,000
but the slanderous comments didn't stop.

371
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,700
I couldn't take it anymore.

372
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,800
I tested it countless times. My plan was perfect.

373
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:30,400
I anonymously commented on Yuko's blog

374
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:32,901
so she would come here.

375
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:39,400
Why? Why didn't you tell me about it?

376
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,601
Aren't we friends?

377
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,701
Sorry.

378
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:47,601
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm home.

380
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,900
Welcome home, Ran.

381
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:20,300
I found a shaved ice shop in the area

382
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:22,500
that uses natural ice.

383
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,100
Want to check it out sometime, Conan?

384
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:26,700
Sure.

385
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:28,700
It's not like you're penguins.

386
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:31,800
What's so fun about eating ice?

387
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,800
Who cares?

388
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:38,501
Pops, penguins don't eat ice.

389
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,300
"Next Episode" -A nice campground

390
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:45,500
was opened recently.

391
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:49,200
Conan and his friends are going next weekend.

392
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:50,600
I see.

393
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,200
All right!

394
00:23:52,201 --> 00:23:54,300
We pitched the tent!

395
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:57,200
Urushibara, that's going too far.

396
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:58,500
What?

397
00:23:58,501 --> 00:24:02,300
I could crush you anytime I wanted.

398
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:04,600
Just like Danno!

399
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:07,000
You jerk.

400
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,700
Next Conan,

401
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:11,901
"Mystery of the Burning Tent (Part 1)"
