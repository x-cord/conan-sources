1
00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:03,339
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,139
After the tears, a cook is born.

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,639
Officer Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police.

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,239
Breaks through the deduction spinning round and round.

5
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:10,139
And solves the mystery of the missing murder weapon.

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,539
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,239
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:15,539
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:54,952 --> 00:01:57,752
We came along with Doc to go camping

10
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:59,452
during summer vacation.

11
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,852
But, our car got a flat on the way,

12
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:04,652
so we had no choice

13
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:06,352
but to ask an old woman who lived alone in a remote mountain area

14
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:08,152
to let us spend the night at her place.

15
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,852
"Tanaka Iwae, age 74."

16
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:13,852
Likewise, two men and a woman,

17
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,352
"Akane Ouba, age 25" -three people who also get lost,

18
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:18,152
"Raito Adachi, age 29" -spend the night in the same house together.

19
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,352
"Fuga Kahara, age 28."

20
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:24,252
That night, Mitsuhiko who goes to the restroom,

21
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:27,052
witnesses something gruesome,

22
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:31,052
and right afterwards, the girl named Akane Ouba is found murdered!

23
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:37,052
This... granny...

24
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:40,252
was...

25
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:42,352
sharpening a kitchen knife!

26
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:44,552
Her hair was disheveled!

27
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:47,152
And, it was a knife with a bright red handle.

28
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:49,152
She looked like an ogre!

29
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:58,852
"The Knife of The Mountain Crone Part Two."

30
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:02,752
Is it true? What you just said.

31
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:05,152
It's true!

32
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,652
Which means...

33
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:10,152
You're saying that a knife with a bright red handle

34
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:11,452
is not here?

35
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,452
Huh? Yes.

36
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:15,452
You heard what he said.

37
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:18,552
Well, I don't know anything about a knife

38
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:20,352
with a bright red handle.

39
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,952
I'm sure that he was probably freaked out by me

40
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,152
looking like a mountain crone,

41
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:28,152
that's why he saw such an illusion.

42
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:30,552
But I'm sure that I saw her.

43
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:36,652
We're going to start a thorough search of the house right now.

44
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:40,452
So will you all please wait in the room beyond.

45
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,452
Come on, let's go, Yoshida.

46
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,352
Okay.

47
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:51,752
Huh? That's strange.

48
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:52,952
What's strange?

49
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:55,252
The hammer that I brought to hammer in the pegs of the tent

50
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,252
isn't here.

51
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:58,652
Hammer?

52
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:01,752
That bag was left out in the corridor, wasn't it?

53
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:05,252
Hey, don't tell me that the killer...

54
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:09,052
Don't be silly, you can't slash a person's neck with a hammer.

55
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,052
That's right.

56
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,852
I'm going to ask the officer.

57
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:17,952
Oh, I'll go with you.

58
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:22,952
The hammer was found in the forest nearby.

59
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:24,252
A pretty new one too.

60
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:25,852
Huh? Really?

61
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:28,052
Then, you'd better check thoroughly!

62
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,052
The killer may have used it.

63
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:33,152
But, a hammer is not a knife.

64
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,452
What's wrong?

65
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:39,852
That... did you check that box?

66
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:41,052
Huh?

67
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,452
Oh no, not the boxes around here yet...

68
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,552
Hey, boy!

69
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:56,552
Hey, this is a knife!

70
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,252
A knife with a red handle.

71
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:00,452
This is the knife that Mitsuhiko saw.

72
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:03,552
It's well maintained and the blade is sharp.

73
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:07,552
Huh? Below the knife maker's signature named...

74
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:08,652
Shota?

75
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:12,552
Shota is the name of granny's grandson.

76
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:15,252
Huh? Nothing was detected?

77
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:17,352
Luminol reaction wasn't detected?

78
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:20,152
No. None was detected from the knives in this house

79
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,452
or from your camping equipment.

80
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,452
Of course there were no traces on the knife

81
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:26,452
with the red handle either.

82
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:30,352
After you found it and all, too bad.

83
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:33,552
I see. So, that's the story after all.

84
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:35,052
By the way,

85
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:36,252
did you people play with mud or something?

86
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,952
What? Play with mud?

87
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:39,952
We found traces showing

88
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:44,652
that several people walked around this house with muddy feet.

89
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,752
Traces of muddy feet?

90
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:49,252
Of the dead body being moved without permission

91
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,552
and walking around with muddy feet.

92
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,252
I mean what a thing to do.

93
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:56,152
Wait a second, muddy feet...

94
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:58,852
If I remember correctly, back then...

95
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,352
Huh? Okay.

96
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:03,952
Granny was barefoot.

97
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:06,052
Even the man called Fuga.

98
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:08,752
I ran out barefoot too.

99
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:10,252
The man called Raito...

100
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:11,852
Raito!

101
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:12,852
Fuga?

102
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:16,152
He was wearing shoes.

103
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:17,152
Hey!

104
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:18,552
Huh?

105
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,552
Just what're you doing?

106
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:24,152
Because the goldfish looked thirsty and I felt sorry for it.

107
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,752
What?

108
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,252
See. Last night the water was up here

109
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:30,352
to where the water stain is,

110
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,552
but it's decreased quite a bit.

111
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,852
This means that the goldfish was hot

112
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,952
and drank a lot of water, right?

113
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:40,152
I see, that's why the killer used the hammer.

114
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:42,452
That's why I put tap water inside.

115
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,652
That's not good, Ayumi.

116
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:44,752
Huh?

117
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:47,752
You've got to get rid of the chlorine first

118
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:50,052
or it will weaken the goldfish.

119
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:54,252
Besides, the goldfish are keeping watch,

120
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:55,852
so you shouldn't keep them from doing so.

121
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:58,252
Keeping watch?

122
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,752
Yeah, the weapon which has been in use since ancient times,

123
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:03,352
over its location, that is.

124
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:07,752
I will explain from the conclusion.

125
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:12,152
There were no traces of luminol reaction detected

126
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:16,452
from knives and sharp objects in this house nor any of your belongings.

127
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,552
Moreover, after you all ran over to Ms. Ouba who screamed

128
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:23,752
when she was slashed in the throat,

129
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:27,752
and considering that none of you left this house,

130
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:31,752
it would've been impossible to take the murder weapon away.

131
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:35,352
Therefore, all of you cannot be suspects.

132
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:38,852
We means that we won't be interrogated either?

133
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:41,652
No, we'd like to use your testimonies

134
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,852
as reference for further investigation,

135
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:47,852
so we may ask you to come to the station at a later date.

136
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:50,452
Well, if it's not as a suspect, I guess it's okay.

137
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,652
Excuse me.

138
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,552
What about the knife?

139
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:56,152
Yeah, as to that,

140
00:07:56,152 --> 00:08:00,252
Conan found it put away in a wooden box.

141
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:03,552
As to why you didn't talk about that knife,

142
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:06,752
we'll thoroughly hear you out later at the station.

143
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,852
I had just forgotten about it.

144
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:12,252
After all, I'm old, you know.

145
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:15,652
But, how did the killer get away?

146
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:18,752
There were no strange footprints around the house

147
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:20,752
except for by the front entrance, right?

148
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,652
Oh, as to that...

149
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:27,052
I'm sure that the killer used some kind of a trick.

150
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:31,652
No... it's only natural that there are no footprints.

151
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:35,152
Because the killer and the murder weapon is still in this house.

152
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:37,152
What...

153
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:40,952
Hey, tell me first if you're going to use my voice.

154
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,552
You surprised me out of my wits.

155
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:43,852
Sorry.

156
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,552
No offense.

157
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:49,952
We, the police checked the house thoroughly and found nothing.

158
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:54,152
Just where in this house do you claim is the murder weapon?

159
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:56,052
It's not that you didn't find it.

160
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,152
It's just that you haven't checked it yet.

161
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:02,152
Why? Because that murder weapon is something that was in this house

162
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:05,352
to begin with that the killer transformed into a knife.

163
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:08,452
It doesn't look to be a murder weapon at all.

164
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:11,052
Transformed?

165
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,852
Something in this house?

166
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,552
Please wait.

167
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:17,652
Using something that was in this house to begin with,

168
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:19,052
would mean that the killer is someone

169
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:20,452
that knows a lot about this house.

170
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:24,152
Are you saying that the granny who lives here

171
00:09:24,152 --> 00:09:26,052
is the killer after all?

172
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:28,352
No...

173
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:29,552
Huh?

174
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:33,252
There is another person here that has been living in this house

175
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:34,752
for about 20 years.

176
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:36,452
Here?

177
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:37,752
Isn't that right?

178
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:41,552
Grandson of granny, Mr. Fuga Kahara.

179
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:42,552
What the...

180
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,852
Hey, Fuga, is that true?

181
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:48,952
That's ridiculous.

182
00:09:48,952 --> 00:09:50,452
Come to think of it,

183
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:52,752
when asked about the bathroom of this house,

184
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:54,352
you answered right away, didn't you?

185
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:58,052
I remembered because I used it last night...

186
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,152
Then, why did you say those words?

187
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:01,952
Said what?

188
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:06,252
Remember, what you said when you first came here?

189
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:10,052
Boy, do you live here?

190
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:14,252
That means that you knew I don't live here, right?

191
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,552
Oh, well, that's...

192
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:17,552
Is that right?

193
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:22,152
Huh? I was asked by her grandson to do him a favor.

194
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,452
He asked me to check up and see how his grandmother

195
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:26,252
that he hadn't seen for some time is doing.

196
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:29,952
He told me that his grandmother was living alone.

197
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:32,352
Then, why did you know about the goldfish?

198
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:33,952
Goldfish?

199
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:35,852
I remember you saying,

200
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,252
of all the 12 goldfish here,

201
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:41,052
the Tamasaba is a rare species.

202
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:42,952
Didn't I also say back then

203
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:45,652
that I used to keep goldfish as pets before.

204
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:48,152
It's natural to be able to tell goldfish apart by looking at them.

205
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:51,652
No, not the species, but the number.

206
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,452
Number?

207
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,352
No matter how knowledgeable you are with goldfish,

208
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:57,352
to know at a glance

209
00:10:57,352 --> 00:11:00,652
that there are 12 of them swimming around in the tank,

210
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:03,652
no one would know except for the person who owns the goldfish, right?

211
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,752
I see, that's true.

212
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,852
No, that's not it. I...

213
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,252
I...

214
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:17,152
Then, don't tell me that getting lost here

215
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:18,452
and running out of gas were...

216
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:19,852
Yeah, probably.

217
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:22,452
He did it deliberately

218
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:24,852
so that he could check on how his grandmother was doing.

219
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,352
He probably thought that she wouldn't recognize his face

220
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,752
after plastic surgery.

221
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:30,352
I see...

222
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:33,552
Which means, the reason why you didn't want to go through interrogation

223
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:35,452
as much as you did was...

224
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:37,352
You are the killer!

225
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:40,352
No! I didn't do it! It's not me!

226
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:41,752
No, you said what you said

227
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:43,552
only because you wanted to hide your real name.

228
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:44,552
Real name?

229
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,752
When Fuga started to make a fuss,

230
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:50,052
you were about to say something, weren't you, Raito?

231
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:54,152
Oh, I figured I should give my real name at that time.

232
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:57,952
Raito Adachi is the name that I use back at the shop.

233
00:11:57,952 --> 00:11:59,952
A pseudonym?

234
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,752
What's your name then?

235
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,652
Since he was afraid that this would happen,

236
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:07,652
he began making a fuss over the interrogation.

237
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:10,252
What Fuga wanted to hide was the fact

238
00:12:10,252 --> 00:12:15,152
that he was the grandson Shota of Mrs. Iwae Tanaka.

239
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,652
So, when you say he just wanted to hide his name,

240
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:20,752
do you mean that he's not the killer?

241
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,652
Yeah, that's right.

242
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:27,952
But, just a while ago you said that,

243
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:31,752
the killer skillfully used something from this house, didn't you?

244
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,452
So, even if you don't know the details of the house,

245
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,352
it's something that can be used as a weapon

246
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:39,052
so long as you look at it and know what it is.

247
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,252
If that certain thing is used along

248
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:43,052
with my hammer that was stolen.

249
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:45,252
Hammer?

250
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:48,652
Remember? Ayumi seemed to be worried about it.

251
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:50,952
Me?

252
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:53,352
You asked whether the water in the aquarium decreased in one night

253
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:56,352
because the goldfish drank the water.

254
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:59,152
But, that wasn't it.

255
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:02,052
Something that was inside the aquarium was taken out.

256
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:05,652
-Huh? -So, what's that something?

257
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,852
It was used frequently as a weapon

258
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:11,352
during the Jomon Period.

259
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,852
Obsidian.

260
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:19,756
Obsidian, you say...

261
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:21,656
Right. If you shatter it,

262
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:24,756
it becomes quite a sharp piece of knife-like object.

263
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:28,456
The killer used it to slash Akane's throat.

264
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:31,856
You... you say that the obsidian was used as a knife?

265
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:33,456
And...

266
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:36,756
The thing that was used to shatter it was my hammer.

267
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,356
The place it was shattered was in the forest

268
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:41,156
where the hammer was found.

269
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:44,856
But no one would hear the loud sound of the stone being shattered.

270
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:47,615
I'm sure that weapon was made in the middle of the night

271
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:50,115
before it started raining.

272
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:52,615
That's why no footprints were found.

273
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:53,915
I see.

274
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:57,415
And, who is it? The killer that did it?

275
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,715
That's...

276
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:01,715
The one who saw the stone in the aquarium

277
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,415
and immediately took it to be an obsidian,

278
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:05,915
Mr. Raito Adachi.

279
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,715
You're the one who did it.

280
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,615
What...

281
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,715
Please wait a minute.

282
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:16,415
I'm made a killer

283
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:18,515
just because I'm knowledgeable about stones.

284
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:22,915
I'm sure that granny and Fuga also knew that the stone was an obsidian.

285
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,815
And yet, why me?

286
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:28,215
I turned my attention to you

287
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,215
when I saw your shoes.

288
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:30,915
Shoes?

289
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:32,815
If you hear the scream of a woman

290
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:35,315
you know very well from outside,

291
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:38,315
I wonder if there's a person who will attempt to wear his shoes?

292
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:42,115
-Huh? -It's quite troublesome to wear shoes.

293
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,215
The entrance of this house has a step,

294
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,115
so first you have to find your shoes,

295
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:50,215
then put your feet inside and get your heels into them too.

296
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:52,515
In the circumstance back then,

297
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,415
it's most likely that you don't wear shoes and run up to the door,

298
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:57,015
then check what's going on outside.

299
00:14:57,015 --> 00:15:02,515
Just like Conan, granny and her grandson did.

300
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:05,515
But, you had your high-cut shoes on

301
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:08,715
and had your shoe strings tied nicely as well.

302
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:11,415
In other words, you didn't go out to see what was going on

303
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:13,715
but rather was there to begin with

304
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:16,415
and murdered Akane on the site.

305
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,115
That's what your shoes proved.

306
00:15:21,415 --> 00:15:23,315
I can see that he is a probable suspect,

307
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:26,815
but I wonder if his having his shoes on is enough to call him the killer.

308
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:30,115
Like I said, I turned my attention to him

309
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:31,215
when I saw his shoes.

310
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:32,415
Attention?

311
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:35,515
What concluded my deduction as him being the killer is the hammer!

312
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:39,915
Hammer... but we don't know who stole it yet.

313
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:44,115
If granny or her grandson were going to make a weapon,

314
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:46,315
they would most likely use something that is in this house.

315
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:50,215
Say for example something from the tool box that was in the shed.

316
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,315
Although the bag was left out in the corridor,

317
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:55,315
who knows when someone may get up.

318
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,915
Therefore, no one would dare take the hammer out of my bag.

319
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:01,715
I see, very true.

320
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,415
Just as you were saying,

321
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:06,815
the killer most probably decided to commit the murder

322
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,515
despite this being a trip and the number of people being limited,

323
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:12,715
but something happened last night that provoked the murder.

324
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:17,115
And, I don't know what kind of reason he used

325
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:20,315
but he lured Akane outside early in the morning.

326
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:23,915
Since no sound of argument or fighting was heard,

327
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:28,015
Akane probably agreed to leaving her room.

328
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:31,115
They got to the front entrance without anybody noticing them,

329
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,815
completely wore their shoes

330
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:35,915
and just when they were about to go outside, something happened.

331
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:37,415
Something? What was that?

332
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,815
Maybe Akane who came along willingly up to that time

333
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:42,915
realized that it was raining

334
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:45,115
and decided that she didn't want to go out.

335
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:48,315
Or, she may have sensed that something was wrong

336
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:51,315
when she heard Mitsuhiko's footsteps as he ran up the stairs.

337
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:53,215
What makes you so sure?

338
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:56,815
If not, nothing would've happened at the front entrance.

339
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,515
He probably didn't plan on killing her there.

340
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:03,515
You decided to killer there because you panicked.

341
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:06,415
You probably went out struggling with Akane,

342
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,415
slashed her throat with the weapon you had hiding on you,

343
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,415
and killed her.

344
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:18,715
After that you left Akane's body at the site,

345
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:20,715
ran back to the house,

346
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:22,215
after opening the sliding paper door beside the aquarium,

347
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,715
you headed outside once again.

348
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:26,815
You ran over to Akane who was lying on the ground

349
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,215
and carried her up.

350
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,615
He put on an act to make it look

351
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,115
as if he ran out after hearing her scream.

352
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:35,815
Because he had no way of hiding the blood

353
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:37,715
that was on his clothes and body.

354
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,615
Then...

355
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:41,715
where is the weapon?

356
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:43,715
If it hasn't been found yet,

357
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:46,815
it's probably still in the aquarium.

358
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,315
Just before you mentioned that you wanted to go the bathroom

359
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:51,115
to wash off her blood from yourself,

360
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:53,315
you were touching the aquarium,

361
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,515
so you probably put it in there then.

362
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:59,115
You most surely didn't have time to wipe it off,

363
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:02,215
so I'm sure it's still on the murder weapon,

364
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,015
Akane's blood and your fingerprints.

365
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:11,115
Having had it explained like that...

366
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:12,315
How about you?

367
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:17,115
Yes, I feel bad

368
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:18,915
towards those goldfish.

369
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,915
Goldfish?

370
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:22,715
I should be, shouldn't I?

371
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:25,715
I messed up their habitat

372
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:28,915
to kill a worthless woman like her.

373
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,715
But why?

374
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:34,015
Wasn't she one of your important customers?

375
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:38,215
I was planning to quit as a host in the near future.

376
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:39,515
Because my parents finally...

377
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:42,315
were about to repay the entire amount of money

378
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:45,115
they borrowed from the financial institution run by her father.

379
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:47,515
However, last night that woman...

380
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:49,215
Oh, the money that they borrowed

381
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,415
has ballooned to about three times what they originally borrowed.

382
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:53,215
-Huh? -I told your parents

383
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,415
that were some shares that would prospectively go up

384
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:57,415
and they fell for it.

385
00:18:57,415 --> 00:19:00,015
I'm sure that they're looking pale right now,

386
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:03,015
because the shares of that company took a sharp plunge

387
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,715
after the president was arrested.

388
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:09,415
But, I've got to thank God over and over again

389
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,715
because now you'll be at my beck

390
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:15,015
and call for life, Raito.

391
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:21,715
I burst out in rage when that woman said that.

392
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:23,315
I was working as a host

393
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:25,115
because I had no choice having to pay back money.

394
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:27,315
So, I really had it tough.

395
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:31,315
I've always been a very old-fashioned person.

396
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:33,015
So, this job of having to be at the back and call of women,

397
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:35,815
wasn't my cup of tea.

398
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:38,315
But, I didn't think I'd be using...

399
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:41,415
such an outdated weapon to commit the murder.

400
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,815
I'll leave the rest to you.

401
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:49,715
Yes, sir!

402
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:52,915
What about this knife with the red handle?

403
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:55,615
Oh, I'll put that back.

404
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:59,715
Excuse me.

405
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:02,115
May I please take a look at that knife for a minute?

406
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:03,815
Go ahead.

407
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:04,915
Thank you.

408
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:08,415
"Shota."

409
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,515
This is...

410
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,915
Hey, young man...

411
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:16,915
if you know my grandson, please relay this message to him.

412
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,115
Tell him not to worry about me.

413
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:23,315
But, to above all take care of his body

414
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:26,615
and to take good care of himself.

415
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:32,115
Yeah, I'll relay your message to him.

416
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:34,515
So in exchange,

417
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:38,715
may I take this knife with me?

418
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:42,215
Because I'm sure that he'll really be happy if I give it to him.

419
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:46,315
Yeah, do that.

420
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:53,115
Huh? Did that granny know he was her grandson?

421
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:55,415
Yeah, most probably.

422
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:58,215
That's why she kept that knife hidden.

423
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,915
She was probably going to give it to him

424
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:02,415
when he came back a fine chef,

425
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:06,215
and kept polishing it every day very preciously.

426
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:09,115
But, she really looked as frightening as an ogre

427
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:10,615
as she was sharpening the knife.

428
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,915
It's just like the mask of the Hanya.

429
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,515
It looks scary

430
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:16,615
but at the same time you could say it looks sad, right?

431
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:20,515
I'm sure that she was sharpening it with all her might

432
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:23,415
while trying to hold back the pain she was feeling in her heart.

433
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,015
She probably polished the knife with the hope

434
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:29,915
that her grandson whose appearance and intention have changed

435
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,815
to return to where he started off.

436
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:37,315
The glitter of the mountain crone's knife

437
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:39,615
was the sad glitter

438
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:42,315
of the tears of a grandmother concerned about her grandson.

439
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:14,815
A month later,

440
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:17,115
I went to a Japanese restaurant with Ran.

441
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:20,115
I happened to see a young cook being scolded.

442
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,115
Too slow, Tanaka!

443
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:23,515
You still haven't finished cutting it?

444
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:25,015
I'm sorry.

445
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:29,615
The young cook who looked familiar

446
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:32,515
was trying with all his might to fillet a fish.

447
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:35,615
That cook was holding a knife with a red handle in his hand.

448
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,115
I'm sure that one day he will certainly...

449
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:41,915
Conan...

450
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:45,215
Too slow, Conan,

451
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,915
you still can't decide what you want?

452
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:52,315
She looked like a witch.

453
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,815
"Next Episode."

454
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:57,715
Fake police officer?

455
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,915
There are other people who saw him too, aren't there?

456
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:02,015
Let's split up and look for him!

457
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:05,315
-Okay! -Hey! You guys!

458
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:08,115
I've got to find him no matter what, and arrest him.

459
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,315
No, maybe he...

460
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,715
It's too reckless and dangerous!

461
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:15,115
That's it...

462
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,215
Next Conan!

463
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:23,215
"The Police Officer Who Disappeared."

464
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:41,315
Next Conan's Hint:

465
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,615
Last train of the day.

466
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,215
Chief, we'd better get going soon or you'll miss the last train.

467
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:47,115
Who cares, give me another glass of cider.

468
00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:48,115
On the rocks.
