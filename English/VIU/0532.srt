1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,670
All the horses have turned the final corner!

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,870
The last 200 meters,

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,870
-which one's going to come out front? -Come...

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,270
-Will it be the favorite Iron Blade? -Come...

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,870
Please, come!

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,870
For the sake of the future of the Mouri Detective Agency!

7
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:18,262
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

8
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:20,662
Saturday nights are for mystery.

9
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:22,562
The clue is a large scar.

10
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:24,962
Make sure to choose your first love and not the suspect.

11
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:26,462
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,362
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,362
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

14
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,924
"The Scar of First Love."

15
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,361
Half of Iron Blade's head in lane four is in the lead!

16
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:18,661
From outside in lane 6 is Masked Yaiba!

17
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:20,161
-From inside in lane 8 is Black Chaser! -Come...

18
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,561
-It's Devil Typhoon in lane 2! Its come up front! -Come...

19
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:24,961
-Devil Typhoon... It's Devil Typhoon! -Come...

20
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,761
It's over! Devil Typhoon in lane 2 is the winner!

21
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:28,861
There is a loud stir among the spectators...

22
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,361
-at this much too unexpected result! -It's come!

23
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:33,461
No way! You won?

24
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:36,061
Yeah! Super dark horse, 3 million yen!

25
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,961
3 million?

26
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:42,261
God was watching over this agency

27
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:45,261
and knew that we were having in tough this month.

28
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:48,161
We had practically no clients last month.

29
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:51,261
Hold it. The re-judge lamp is on!

30
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:54,961
Did something happen during the final heated competition?

31
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,161
Oh, my. Devil Typhoon in lane 2 slanted out of line

32
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,761
and has been disqualified.

33
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,361
The order of the horses making goal has changed,

34
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:01,361
and the winner is Iron Blade in lane 4!

35
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,361
Isn't God on the side of the needy?

36
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,261
Come to think of it, just the other day

37
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:12,561
I heard on the news that a girl of a prestigious family

38
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:17,261
bought a lottery ticket just for fun and won 1 billion yen!

39
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,561
What?

40
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:20,061
And she was saying that

41
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:23,561
she was planning to give that winning ticket to somebody.

42
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,961
Something about when she was a child and on a trip,

43
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,461
she got into a traffic accident.

44
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,461
And she wants the boy who was badly wounded

45
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:29,961
after trying to protect her to come out front,

46
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,361
so that she can thank him

47
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,561
and give him the 1 million as a token of her gratitude.

48
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:38,061
And? Did that lucky boy appear?

49
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:39,061
I wonder...

50
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:41,761
That girl who was also hurt in that accident

51
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:43,761
has lost her sight because of it.

52
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,861
She said that since that boy was still a child too,

53
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:49,161
she can't tell if it's him from his face or voice.

54
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:53,061
Then, how is she going to be able to tell if it's really that boy or not?

55
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:56,161
It seems that the scar he got during the accident is the key!

56
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,661
She says that since it was a big scar,

57
00:03:57,661 --> 00:04:01,461
the scar should still be there even after he grows up.

58
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:04,161
I also have a scar.

59
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,761
The scar on my shoulder I got when I played sandlot baseball

60
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,861
and did a head slide 2 years ago!

61
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,361
Do you think I can fake it through with this?

62
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:13,561
Fake it?

63
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:16,261
Hey, hey. Come off it, old man.

64
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:18,461
It's not on his shoulder.

65
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,961
I remember clearly that his t-shirt was slashed in a straight line

66
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,261
and blood came seeping out.

67
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:38,061
After that, my eyesight started to fail,

68
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:41,161
but I haven't forgotten what I saw back then.

69
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:44,061
She's the person, you know the 1 billion yen.

70
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:47,561
Which means you want me to use the scar as a clue

71
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,661
and find that boy for you?

72
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:56,561
A person saying that he's the one has appeared.

73
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,761
But there are two of them.

74
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:01,161
Two?

75
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:04,561
I see.

76
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:10,361
So, you want me to figure out which is the real one?

77
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,361
Yes.

78
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:15,361
Because the person who saved me back then was alone.

79
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,961
Which means that one of them is an imposter.

80
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,261
How dare he pose as the boy of your memory

81
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:23,061
just because he wants the money.

82
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:25,161
What a jerk.

83
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,061
Talk for yourself...

84
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:31,061
And, did you see the scars of the two?

85
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:34,661
Yes, sir. I did take a look at it.

86
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:40,961
But the man with the brown hair has a scar on his back

87
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:44,061
and the tanned man has one on his chest.

88
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:46,261
They each have a large scar for sure.

89
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,961
Huh? On the back and chest?

90
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:53,261
You don't know where the scar is supposed to be, Ms.?

91
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,461
No. All I remember is that

92
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:59,661
the scar was a big one that extended from one side to the other.

93
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:02,261
By the way, where did the accident occur?

94
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:06,861
It was during summer vacation some 30 years ago.

95
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:10,361
I went on vacation with my parents to Izu.

96
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:12,661
I became friends with the boy

97
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:15,061
who looked to be the same age as I at the beach,

98
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:18,161
and played with him practically every day.

99
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:21,361
He was very knowledgeable about the ocean and fish

100
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:24,261
and always drank ginger ale.

101
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,061
His white teeth against his tanned face

102
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,461
that showed at times were fantastic

103
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,861
that I fell in love at first sight.

104
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:36,561
However, those dream-like days didn't last for long.

105
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,161
When I cried saying that I didn't want to go home

106
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:40,861
on the last day of summer vacation,

107
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:46,661
he said, "Stay here, then! I'll protect you."

108
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:50,061
How old were you back then?

109
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:52,361
I think I was in the 2nd grade of elementary school.

110
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:55,761
Lovey-dovey in 2nd grade of elementary.

111
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:58,561
And? How did you get into a traffic accident?

112
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,561
I begged my parents to let me stay

113
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:04,261
just one more day in Izu and they approved.

114
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:05,961
I wanted to tell him about this

115
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:09,161
and ran over to him, who was walking along the coast.

116
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,561
But, just then a driver who fell asleep at the wheels

117
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:13,861
came towards us and we were hit.

118
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,261
After that, I was unconscious for 3 days.

119
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:23,561
And I was sleeping on the hospital bed when I got up.

120
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:28,561
Then, you don't know what happened to that boy after that, do you?

121
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:29,761
No.

122
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:32,361
Although I heard that the boy, despite being badly wounded himself,

123
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:37,261
carried me all the way to the hospital.

124
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,061
He seems to have left

125
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:41,361
after saying that he would bring his parents along,

126
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,661
but he never came back since.

127
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:46,861
But you at least know what his name is, don't you?

128
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:50,161
After all, you played with him practically every day.

129
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,761
Gari!

130
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:55,961
I saw you on TV saying that he told you to call him Gari

131
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:58,261
because all his classmates called him that, right?

132
00:07:58,261 --> 00:07:59,361
Yes.

133
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:02,461
Gari gives us no clue to what his name is.

134
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:06,161
And, where are the two that appeared saying they the ones?

135
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:09,061
The two have been staying over at our place since the other day.

136
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:15,761
What a grand mansion!

137
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,361
With a place so big, I'll bet cleaning this place is tough too?

138
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:22,161
Yes. Mr. Hoya and two maids

139
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:24,361
are doing what they can to maintain the place.

140
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:28,461
But since there are only four of us living here including me,

141
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:31,261
we don't mess the place up much either.

142
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,761
Nah, I'm sure it's tough getting rid of dust here too.

143
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:38,461
Four of you? Your parents?

144
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,761
My mother died early because of an illness.

145
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,961
And my father who was looking after me all this time

146
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:45,861
also died 3 years ago because of the same illness.

147
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:49,261
Just before father passed away,

148
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:53,561
Mr. Hoya was hired as the butler and forced to look after me.

149
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:56,961
No, it's not that he forced you on me.

150
00:08:56,961 --> 00:09:01,261
Well... now, including the two men that have come,

151
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,861
including all too, it makes 9.

152
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:09,261
It looks like we're going to be having a gay dinner tonight.

153
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,461
So good, so good!

154
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,661
Having a meal with a lot of people is cheerful after all.

155
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:19,261
I wonder.

156
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:25,761
It seems that there's at least one person who's not fit to be here.

157
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:26,961
Huh?

158
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:32,761
Maybe it's about time you come out and identify yourself, imposter.

159
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:36,061
That's my line, you jerk!

160
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:38,661
Well, as to that, I'm sure Mr. Mouri will see through

161
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,261
who the imposter is a while later.

162
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:43,061
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

163
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:45,661
Well, for the time being,

164
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,161
I would like to hear you all out one at a time in another room.

165
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,061
See you, Mr. Detective.

166
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:56,261
-See you later. -Yeah.

167
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:00,761
Please check them over thoroughly.

168
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:03,561
Both of them could be imposters too, you know.

169
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,661
Yeah.

170
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:07,861
After all, it's something that happened 30 years ago.

171
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:11,861
It could be that the boy is no longer here in this world, too.

172
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,361
No! He's here!

173
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:17,461
That person is unmistakably in this house!

174
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,061
I couldn't help feeling that way,

175
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:23,661
so that's why I called the famous Detective Mouri over here!

176
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,261
I'm a bit tired.

177
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:30,061
I'm going to my room and rest a while.

178
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:34,061
Please let me know as soon as you get the results.

179
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,361
Yes.

180
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,661
Don't tell me that she already knows

181
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:49,761
which of the two is the one she's looking for.

182
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:52,761
Hey, Conan.

183
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:54,061
Conan?

184
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,161
What's the matter?

185
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,861
What do you see outside?

186
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:00,361
Don't you sense it?

187
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:02,961
Like somebody's watching you.

188
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:04,861
That kind of feeling.

189
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:09,761
No, I don't feel anything.

190
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:21,261
Later Pops asked the two about what happened 30 year ago.

191
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:25,461
But all they did was repeat the exact same answer over and over.

192
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,861
And it wasn't surprising that they would do so.

193
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:28,161
What?

194
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:31,561
She talked about the circumstances back then in detail

195
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:33,761
-on a TV interview? -Yeah.

196
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,761
The date of the accident, the model of the car that hit them,

197
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,361
including the hospital that she was hospitalized in too.

198
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:43,261
No wonder they both gave the exact same answer.

199
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:46,061
There's no way I can tell who the real guy is, then.

200
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:49,661
There's someone around after all.

201
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:52,661
And it's not just one or two.

202
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:54,861
Pops, please come here!

203
00:11:56,461 --> 00:11:59,161
What the heck are we doing outside?

204
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,961
Who is it?

205
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:05,461
Officer Takagi and Chiba?

206
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,561
Just what're you guys doing here?

207
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,861
Well...

208
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,661
This is a stake out.

209
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:16,061
The suspect of 15 years ago!

210
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,261
15 years ago?

211
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:20,361
Did you forget, Mouri?

212
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:26,761
The culprit of that incident that's responsible for scarring my face.

213
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:29,661
Superintendent Matsumoto?

214
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:32,461
But, Superintendent...

215
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,561
15 years ago, Mr. Mouri just became a police detective,

216
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,861
so I don't think he knows about it.

217
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:39,161
I see.

218
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:41,261
But, Superintendent...

219
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,961
I think you already had that scar when I was appointed here.

220
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:49,461
Yeah, this scar was made 5 years earlier

221
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,861
with the same sword that the culprit flung.

222
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:55,961
Which makes it... 20 years ago.

223
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:59,361
I cornered the culprit alone at a certain pier.

224
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,861
He took a slash at me so I grabbed the sword

225
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,661
and swung it at him instead.

226
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:08,361
I slashed his body in one straight line!

227
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:11,161
In one straight line...

228
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,261
Then, don't tell me that...

229
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:17,661
Yes, I saw her on the news the other day,

230
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:18,861
and figured that it's possible that

231
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:21,361
the culprit would come here to show his scar.

232
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,661
That's why I came here.

233
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,761
And, where did you slash the culprit with the sword?

234
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,761
In the back or on the chest?

235
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,661
The thing is, I don't remember clearly.

236
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:33,461
I undoubtedly slashed him though.

237
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:35,261
Is that so?

238
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,861
You too?

239
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:39,161
Well, it seems that back then.

240
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:43,161
Superintendent was wounded in the left eye and felt a bit faint.

241
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:46,161
But it seems as though, I was right to have come here.

242
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:47,861
Huh?

243
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:51,461
It's throbbing with pain. This scar on my left eye.

244
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:57,661
As if it's telling me that the culprit is in this house.

245
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:03,735
What?

246
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:07,535
The serial killer of 15 years ago is in this house?

247
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:11,835
He may be here, that is.

248
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:14,835
Then, the thing Conan was saying a while ago

249
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,935
about feeling like being watched by somebody...

250
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:18,835
They were the police.

251
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:20,235
Something about Superintendent Matsumoto

252
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,635
is pursuing that culprit right through.

253
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:27,235
That killer is also the one who scarred Superintendent's face.

254
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:31,235
But I hear that Superintendent back then grabbed the culprit's sword

255
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:35,435
and slashed a straight line across his body, too.

256
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:38,135
In a straight line... Don't tell me...

257
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:41,235
Yeah, the same scar is supposed to be

258
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,835
on the serial killer's body too.

259
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:44,535
A very big sword slash

260
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,435
extending from one side of the body to the other.

261
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:50,435
But why would a murderer come to this house?

262
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:54,335
The culprit's after the 1 billion yen that the lady won!

263
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:57,635
Using the scar that the Superintendent left on his body to his advantage!

264
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,335
In other words,

265
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,435
either the man with the brown hair, Mr. Kusumoto

266
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:05,035
or the tanned man Mr. Banba, is the person she's looking for.

267
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:09,435
And whichever is not, may turn out to be the serial killer.

268
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:14,235
And, just where on the body is the scar of the killer?

269
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,035
If I remember correctly, Mr. Kusumoto's scar is on his back

270
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,635
and Mr. Banba's is on his chest.

271
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:22,835
The thing is, the Superintendent says he doesn't remember very clearly

272
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:26,435
because it was right after he was hurt in the eye.

273
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,435
You mean there's no other clue than the scar?

274
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:32,235
Well, the culprit was wearing gloves,

275
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:33,935
so no fingerprints were found on the sword

276
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,235
that the Superintendent snatched from him.

277
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,835
That sword was the murder weapon for the serial killings

278
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:42,635
and seems to have been smeared with the blood of the victims too,

279
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:46,035
so it seems to have been difficult to pin down the culprit's blood.

280
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:49,035
No one knows what he looks like either?

281
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,335
Long haired, wearing a cap and beard.

282
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:53,935
It's so obviously a disguise.

283
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:56,835
Then, there's no way anything can be confirmed.

284
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:58,935
The whistle!

285
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:00,735
-Whistle? -Yep!

286
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:04,635
There's a tune that the killer was always whistling,

287
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:06,335
so the Superintendent told me to secretly confirm

288
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:09,835
which of the two is doing so.

289
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,735
What kind of tune is it?

290
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,535
I have no idea.

291
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:15,135
He wouldn't tell me because he said

292
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:18,035
he didn't want to give me preconceived ideas

293
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:21,335
that would make me ask questions that would give away the fact

294
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:23,035
that a police investigation is underway.

295
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:25,835
But if such a dangerous person is around,

296
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:29,435
why would he deliberately make Conan come back here?

297
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:32,635
I was the one that forced him to let me stay here.

298
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:36,235
Besides, if I suddenly disappear, the killer may get suspicious

299
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:40,135
and realize that officers are staking out outside.

300
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:43,335
And like I just said, a while ago,

301
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:48,235
it's not that we're 100% sure that one of the two is the killer.

302
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:49,935
True, but...

303
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:53,135
Yes.

304
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:57,035
If you'd like to take a bath, it's ready.

305
00:16:57,035 --> 00:17:00,835
You mean we were served dinner, and we get to take a bath here too?

306
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,935
Well, then, thank you so much.

307
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:06,635
But there's only one bath tub.

308
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:08,435
So if you're going to take a bath,

309
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,135
I think that young lady should do so first.

310
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:12,635
-What? -Go take a bath!

311
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:16,135
You won't get to take a bath in a gorgeous house like this ever again!

312
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,535
I guess you're right.

313
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:22,035
Okay then, Conan, let's take a bath together!

314
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:26,735
It's been a long time since we washed each other's back.

315
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,835
No, I didn't bring any change with me besides.

316
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:34,235
And I took a bath last night, so...

317
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,535
Really?

318
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:39,235
But...

319
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:42,435
if you insist, then!

320
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,635
-See you. -Yeah.

321
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,035
I decided not to take a bath

322
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,635
since it seemed like you didn't want to take a bath, Conan.

323
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,335
Okay.

324
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:56,035
Well, we've got to worry more about the killer

325
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:57,735
than taking a bath right now anyway.

326
00:17:57,735 --> 00:18:01,235
But we don't even know what tune the killer was whistling,

327
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:04,635
so we have no way of checking.

328
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,735
The only thing we can do for now is to figure out

329
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:10,635
which of the two men is the one that the lady is looking for.

330
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:17,435
Pops was talking to Mr. Kusumoto and Mr. Banba a while ago, right?

331
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:19,635
Yes, as to the date the accident occurred

332
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:22,635
and the hospital that she was taken to.

333
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,235
Their answers were exactly the same.

334
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,035
Was it really the same?

335
00:18:27,035 --> 00:18:29,235
Wasn't there anything that was different?

336
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:31,335
My, how unusual.

337
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:34,335
You were close by too, Conan, and you weren't listening?

338
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:35,335
No.

339
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:39,035
I was distracted by the officers who were staking the house out.

340
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,935
Well, if I were to pick out what was different...

341
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:45,135
Mr. Kusumoto repeated time and again that

342
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:46,835
he was skinny when he was a child.

343
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:51,535
And Mr. Banba kept emphasizing the fact that he used to be a bookworm.

344
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:53,735
Is that all?

345
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:55,335
Yes.

346
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,535
Would you like to go ask the lady now?

347
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,535
But...

348
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:02,835
I can't help feeling that the lady

349
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:07,435
already knows who the man of her memories is.

350
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:14,135
I've seen these in dramas and on movies, but...

351
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:15,835
I sure am surprised

352
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:18,335
to find that there is actually a gorgeous bath like this.

353
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,335
Hey there, Mr. Detective.

354
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:25,735
We're going to join you.

355
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:28,035
You're both taking a bath together?

356
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:29,935
You two get along quite well, don't you?

357
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,835
No, it's just coincidence.

358
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:34,035
Since I heard that you were taking a bath,

359
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:38,635
I decided to come and ask you how much you knew.

360
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,235
And? How about it?

361
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:44,235
You already know which one of us is the real one, right?

362
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:47,635
No, that's confidential.

363
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,035
This is great.

364
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:51,635
Now I don't have to go out of my way to ask them

365
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:54,935
about the tune that the Superintendent asked me to check on.

366
00:19:57,635 --> 00:20:00,035
Butler.

367
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:02,235
Are you taking a bath, too?

368
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,835
No.

369
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,935
Kurumi asked me wash the detective's back,

370
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:09,635
that's why I'm here.

371
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:15,435
That's taking things too far.

372
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:18,635
If I knew which of them was the one I'm looking for,

373
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:22,035
I wouldn't do such a thing as to call Detective Mouri over.

374
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:23,435
I guess not.

375
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:26,235
Isn't there anything about that person

376
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:28,335
that you want to meet that you haven't mentioned on TV?

377
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:31,435
I wonder... I think I said everything there is to say.

378
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:34,935
Well, he was a very honest person

379
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:39,235
so I'm sure that Mr. Mouri will also soon find out who he is.

380
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,035
Very honest?

381
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:45,135
Yes. When he went out to buy a pack of sushi for lunch,

382
00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:47,235
he received 100 yen more in change than he should've.

383
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:50,135
He went all the way back to the shop to return it, right?

384
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:53,535
Yes. He said he had to because it doesn't belong to him.

385
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:56,035
He liked sushi.

386
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,235
Yes. The other thing I remember is

387
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:00,135
the fried noodles we both ate at the beach house.

388
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:04,635
I was surprised at the large amount of red ginger he put on the noodles.

389
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:06,935
Maybe this is the first time I heard about this.

390
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:08,135
Is that so?

391
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:11,335
Then, please tell Mr. Mouri about it.

392
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:17,135
Thank you so very much.

393
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:19,435
No problem at all.

394
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:21,835
Taking a bath like this,

395
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:25,935
it make you want to hum a tune, doesn't it, you two?

396
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:28,935
-Yes. -Right.

397
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:31,535
Do you have a tune you like?

398
00:21:31,535 --> 00:21:33,235
Well, yeah.

399
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:36,435
There's a tune that I hum a lot.

400
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:48,535
Superintendent, it's mail from Mr. Mouri.

401
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:49,535
And?

402
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:51,635
The man with the brown hair hums jazz

403
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:54,535
and the tanned man likes soul music.

404
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:56,435
That's all.

405
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:00,335
Send Mouri back mail.

406
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:01,635
The contents...

407
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:05,835
Keep checking?

408
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:10,235
But how do I keep checking when I've already run out of things to say?

409
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:12,335
Are you all right, butler?

410
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:14,435
You're sweating profusely.

411
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:15,835
Yes, well...

412
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,835
The air conditioner of the bathroom

413
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:20,235
has been out of order from the other day.

414
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,435
In view through his shirt that is damp with sweat on his back...

415
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:24,935
He has a scar?

416
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,535
Which means...

417
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:31,535
There are three men who have a scar extending in a straight line,

418
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:34,135
in this house right now.

419
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,535
"Next Episode" -The nickname his classmates gave him...

420
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,035
was "Gari"!

421
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:05,935
It's as if Sherlock Holmes is pretending to be a child.

422
00:24:05,935 --> 00:24:09,235
Natural stuff is delicious after all.

423
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:11,535
No, this is cultivated stuff.

424
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:14,935
Natural or cultivated, you say?

425
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:17,335
Who cares about something like that!

426
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:20,735
A certain letter on the victim's body...

427
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:26,635
Next Conan, "The Scar that Invokes the Past".

428
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:44,535
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:46,235
"Sushi."

430
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,635
Go ahead and order what you want.

431
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:50,235
Okay! Tuna, medium fatty tuna and super fatty tuna.

432
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,835
Two eggs.
