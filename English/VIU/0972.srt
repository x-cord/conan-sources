1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,699
After finishing her shift, Sergeant Miike Naeko sang away her troubles

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,610
over Detective Chiba at a karaoke box with two senior female officers.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,780
On the way home...

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,079
Are you okay? Can you handle her?

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,530
I'll be fine.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,410
Chiba-kun... You big dummy...

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,300
Excuse me.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,429
I've been hearing the sound of a small girl crying in the park bathroom for a while.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,920
Could you go check it out?

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,160
Is someone there?

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,820
I knew it. I'd sensed an odd presence recently.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,989
I'm a cop.

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,150
Looks like you chose the wrong target for your trap.

14
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,140
I didn't choose wrong.

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,500
I didn't choose the wrong target!

16
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,750
The body of Sergeant Momosaki was discovered in the park.

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,629
Next to it was a bent 100 yen coin.

18
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,720
There was also a mark that led us to believe the body had been pointing at something.

19
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,500
And in the direction she was pointing was...

20
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,509
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

21
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,389
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

22
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,919
Risking her life to send a message!

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,809
Stop the chain of assault cases!

24
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,559
Always determining the one truth

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,379
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,700
his name is Detective Conan!

27
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Target: MPD Transportation Department (Part Two)

28
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,530
Please stand back.

29
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:47,882
Yes.

30
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,177
Not yet.

31
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,759
Were the victim Sergeant Momosaki and Lieutenant Yagi close?

32
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,840
Yeah, apparently they were high school classmates.

33
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,979
Weren't you, too, Yumi-san?

34
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,760
You called them a bunch of times while we were at the karaoke box.

35
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,769
You again, Yumi?

36
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,499
If you have time to call, come sing with us.

37
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,520
It'll be just like high school.

38
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,520
Yeah, that's right. You should join us, Yumi-san.

39
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,030
Oh, that.

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,959
That's someone different.

41
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,429
That was their classmate Yumiko.

42
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,059
Yumiko-san?

43
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,659
I think she works as a hostess in Ginza these days.

44
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,290
And they called that friend Yumi?

45
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,300
I told them to call her something else since it's confusing.

46
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,310
So, you really have no idea if anyone resented Sergeant Momosaki?

47
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,700
I can think of way too many people who might have resented her, justified or not.

48
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,429
Oh, but three of the traffic violators

49
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,570
they fined made a bunch of complaints.

50
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,349
When was that? Where did the incidents occur?

51
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,209
It was a week ago.

52
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,489
I think all three were at an intersection on Fifth Street in Beika City.

53
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,580
Fifth Street is right next to the Mori Detective Agency.

54
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,829
Do you remember those three?

55
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,889
Yeah.

56
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,159
Miike and I helped question them.

57
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,840
I wrote their names down.

58
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,239
The first was Aono Kengo-san, who was not only using his phone while driving,

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,850
but didn't have a driver's license.

60
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,159
The second, who was driving a motorcycle against traffic without a helmet on,

61
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,860
was Akamine Manji-san.

62
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,969
The third was Shiroyama Yuzo-san,

63
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,970
who was driving a vehicle with an expired inspection without a seat belt on.

64
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,200
All three seemed to be in a big hurry.

65
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,209
Since they tried to flee before they were issued tickets,

66
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,479
they were forced to arrest them for interference of public duties.

67
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,819
Those three sound suspicious.

68
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,309
According to what we heard earlier,

69
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,380
Sergeant Momosaki felt someone had been following her since about a week ago, too.

70
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,929
Damn.

71
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,699
I thought the old man might have seen something,

72
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,390
but a week ago he was off on a trip with the neighborhood association.

73
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,909
But wait.

74
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,640
Maybe Poirot's Amuro-san saw something.

75
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,520
Hey, Conan!

76
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,649
We're going to school!

77
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,280
O-Okay!

78
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,079
How did it go?

79
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,469
The victim was a female police officer with the transportation department.

80
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,189
What? A policewoman was killed?

81
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,129
This is a serious case.

82
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,789
That's so scary.

83
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,979
Right, Ai-chan?

84
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,670
Yeah...

85
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,570
I find a kid who barges into a crime scene far scarier, Kudo-kun.

86
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,870
Is something wrong?

87
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,510
Not really.

88
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,169
Sounds like we'll have to share what we have on those three traffic violators.

89
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,489
I'll pass the word on.

90
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,129
I'll also see if I can find anything else.

91
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,060
Please do.

92
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,749
Well, we're heading back to our post.

93
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,729
Let us know if there are any developments.

94
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,730
Okay.

95
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,190
Miike!

96
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,220
Incorrect passcode has been entered ten times Reformatting device

97
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,680
Damn!

98
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,320
I'm impressed you found this place.

99
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,339
I asked one of your colleagues from work.

100
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,570
They said you'd be here if you weren't at home.

101
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,419
Japan's police truly are exceptional.

102
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,079
I knew it!

103
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
You're the one who killed Toko!

104
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,419
Well? What do the exceptional police want with me?

105
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,840
Have you come to get revenge on me?

106
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,220
Turn yourself in.

107
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,949
It's not too late.

108
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,799
Turn yourself in immediately.

109
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,670
You'll follow the established rules and accept the judgment of the law.

110
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,239
Exceptional and rigidly follows the rules.

111
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,090
You truly are an insect.

112
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,360
Hold on!

113
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,970
Just one more.

114
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,259
MPD to all stations.

115
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,339
A woman bleeding from the head

116
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,670
has been discovered in an alleyway off Third Street in Haido City.

117
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,009
All officers and patrols in the neighborhood, please head to the location.

118
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,789
That's nearby, Chiba-kun.

119
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,930
Let's check it out.

120
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,940
C-Commissioner Kuroda.

121
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,859
What are you doing here?

122
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,040
I happened to be in the area, so I came to the scene.

123
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,559
But now it's clear.

124
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,450
What? What is it?

125
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,450
One of the officers who arrived knew her.

126
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,090
The victim is Lieutenant Yagi Shiori of the MPD Transportation Department.

127
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,329
And next to her body is a 100 yen coin stuck inside her phone.

128
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,679
Just like the one found next to the body of the officer

129
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,450
discovered in the park this morning, it was deliberately bent.

130
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,540
100 yen coins are engraved with a cherry blossom.

131
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,730
It goes without saying that the cherry blossom is the emblem of the Japanese police.

132
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,740
Th-Then this is...

133
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,640
Yes, without a doubt.

134
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,750
This case is a serial murder of female police officers.

135
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,047
What? Seriously?

136
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:57,766
Someone died at the bottom of an apartment building.

137
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:58,717
No way.

138
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:00,447
Where? Nearby?

139
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:01,397
There's a ton of police here... Apparently someone fell from the building... Crap, someone's dead I happened to be there Someone died...

140
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:02,816
Crap, someone's dead I happened to be there Someone died... Someone's dead in Haido City on Third Street

141
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:03,967
All these cops Something serious is going on

142
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:18,196
The victim was MPD Transportation Department Lieutenant Yagi Shiori,

143
00:11:18,197 --> 00:11:19,487
twenty-eight years old.

144
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:23,936
Judging by the body's condition, she died from the fall.

145
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:28,497
She was probably pushed from this apartment building's external stairs.

146
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:33,746
Not only that, but like the body of Sergeant Momosaki that was discovered this morning,

147
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:36,757
a bent 100 yen coin was left at the scene.

148
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,636
Because 100 yen coins are engraved with a cherry blossom,

149
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:42,936
the emblem of the police,

150
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:47,767
it's extremely likely that these crimes were committed by an individual who resents the police.

151
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:56,176
Naturally, all female officers like the victims,

152
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:59,777
as well as all other officers, should be on their guard.

153
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,856
Don't overlook any illegal activity when you arrest the suspect.

154
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,027
Yes, sir!

155
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:07,506
Let's canvas the area first.

156
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:10,546
Yeah. We'll start with this apartment building.

157
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,287
Let's split up and ask around.

158
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:18,456
Commissioner Kuroda, we'll see you later at the investigation meeting.

159
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:19,297
Yeah.

160
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,136
What is it, Sato?

161
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:24,717
Something on your mind?

162
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:28,887
Nothing. It's just Lieutenant Yagi's face...

163
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:33,376
We believe the wound on her right temporal region

164
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,706
was inflicted when she fell to the ground.

165
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:40,147
In that case, it would be more natural for the wound to be facing the ground,

166
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:43,147
but it's currently facing upwards, in the opposite direction, instead.

167
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:47,407
Then there's this. The victim's hand is reaching towards her phone.

168
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:52,657
It's not standard for a person to use a touchscreen without looking at it.

169
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:56,836
If the victim was trying to place a call,

170
00:12:56,837 --> 00:13:00,076
her head would be facing left, towards her phone.

171
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,667
But she's facing right, preventing her from seeing the screen.

172
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:05,427
Like her head wound, it feels unnatural.

173
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:08,356
Is it possible that it's accidental?

174
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:11,786
Sometimes the shock from a fall can cause a person to face a different direction.

175
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:14,937
It's also still unclear what she was attempting to do with her phone.

176
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,687
True, but look closely at this.

177
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:22,036
There aren't any large visible wounds on the victim's face.

178
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:26,197
But there appears to be some kind of scratch on just the tip of her nose.

179
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:32,236
Similarly, the lipstick around her mouth is smudged as though it was wiped in one direction.

180
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:36,457
It's as if she forced herself to face right while scraping her face against the ground.

181
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:37,916
You're right.

182
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,707
Maybe she followed the direction the suspect fled with her eyes.

183
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:45,717
We'll have forensics examine her phone immediately.

184
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:48,226
If she called someone,

185
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,967
they may have heard something.

186
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:55,416
They didn't hear anything.

187
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,727
I broke it before they answered.

188
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:00,706
But there's one more.

189
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,477
Where's the last one?

190
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:06,166
Aiko... The one who took Aiko's life...

191
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,736
That's right.

192
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:09,696
They tried to run, so we arrested them.

193
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,666
We have to question them now.

194
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,566
We'll be pretty late by the time we head there.

195
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,116
That woman...

196
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:17,666
We'll definitely be there.

197
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,876
Tell her to sing by herself.

198
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,316
Okay.

199
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,457
Where is that woman?

200
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,296
You heard her.

201
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,527
See you later, Yumi.

202
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:34,967
Do the traffic violators from a week ago have something to do with this?

203
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,947
I'm not surprised no one's talking about some traffic violations.

204
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:47,487
I guess I'll go to Poirot to gather information.

205
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:53,867
A week ago?

206
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:57,376
There was a commotion at that intersection over there.

207
00:14:57,377 --> 00:15:00,247
Could you tell me more about what happened then?

208
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:02,087
What is it?

209
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:07,606
Conan-kun wants to know more about the commotion that happened at the intersection a week ago.

210
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:08,587
I see.

211
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:13,997
Two female officers got into a shouting match with some drivers.

212
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:17,847
Apparently there were three traffic violators in a row.

213
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:21,566
They said, "We'll question you all at once, so come down to the station."

214
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:25,357
"We've got your license plate numbers, so there will be hell to pay if you run."

215
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:29,107
Was anyone really angry when they said that?

216
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:33,087
All three of them were angry.

217
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:36,617
They had someplace they had to be right away.

218
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:43,136
The man who was using his phone while driving

219
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:45,756
and forgot his license cried that his neurotic girlfriend

220
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:48,297
was waiting for him and asked to be allowed to leave.

221
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:55,276
The man driving against traffic without a helmet shouted that his ex-wife

222
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:58,077
was being abused by her new boyfriend and demanded they let him go rescue her.

223
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:02,826
The man driving with an expired inspection without a seat belt was panicked

224
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:05,596
because his sister was being stalked

225
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,357
and she'd be in danger if he wasn't with her.

226
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:11,607
What about it?

227
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:16,987
Both of the female officers they were arguing with were murdered.

228
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,307
No way.

229
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:23,876
Did any of those three men participate in sports like baseball

230
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:29,127
or golf or work in the music industry?

231
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,127
What? Why?

232
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:37,137
The first female officer murdered in the park was pointing at a swing set.

233
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:40,137
I thought the "swing" might be significant.

234
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:45,036
Oh, right. We say we swing baseball bats and golf clubs.

235
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,147
And getting into a jazz rhythm is also called swinging.

236
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,276
I see.

237
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:56,026
But I couldn't tell what those three men did.

238
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:57,417
I see.

239
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,657
Call me if you remember anything.

240
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:03,797
Okay.

241
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,976
Conan-kun is just like a detective.

242
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:09,167
It's true.

243
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,927
Not only that, but he's a pretty shrewd private eye.

244
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:26,147
You let your guard down, Akai Shuichi.

245
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:31,147
I could say the same thing to you.

246
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,996
Don't be ridiculous.

247
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:37,527
You lost the moment I saw through your disguise as Okiya Subaru.

248
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:43,537
What if I knew you'd try to sneak in here today?

249
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:48,476
A private eye?

250
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:50,667
Wouldn't that be interesting if it were true?

251
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,186
Is that true, Miwako?

252
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:15,397
Yeah. We just finished the investigation meeting.

253
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:18,777
No. Yagi-san, too...

254
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:22,906
It's likely the suspect is going after female police officers.

255
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:26,506
You two are both in the Transportation Department, too.

256
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:27,787
Be careful.

257
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,297
Yagi-san...

258
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:31,817
Miike.

259
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:35,417
Yes, ma'am. I'm fine. I won't cry anymore.

260
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:38,606
Do they know who the suspect is?

261
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:45,427
They're calling the three traffic violators they arrested a week ago,

262
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,597
but none of them are answering.

263
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:50,196
Is the only clue we have that swing set?

264
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,357
Yeah. About that...

265
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:56,026
Did Lieutenant Yagi have any habits?

266
00:18:56,027 --> 00:19:00,107
Like expressing something by turning her head like this?

267
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:03,936
Who knows? I've never heard anything like that.

268
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:05,156
Her head?

269
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:08,997
I'll send the photo of her to your phone.

270
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:13,506
Contact me immediately if you notice anything after seeing the photo.

271
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:16,757
I'm going out canvassing after this, so I'm counting on you.

272
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:18,007
S-Sure...

273
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,127
Yagi-san...

274
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:28,267
It's true. It looks like she forced her head to turn.

275
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:36,136
This is the alleyway off Third Street in Haido City, right?

276
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:36,817
Yes.

277
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,576
What? Wait a minute.

278
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:42,467
This alleyway and the park...

279
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,017
A number I don't recognize is calling me.

280
00:19:53,197 --> 00:19:55,836
Y-Yes? Hello?

281
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:59,456
Why are you blocking my calls?!

282
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:00,717
Ch-Chukichi?

283
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,306
Sorry, sorry.

284
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:05,456
You kept calling every ten minutes, so I blocked you.

285
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:07,556
Because I'm worried!

286
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:11,477
The news just said another female officer had been killed!

287
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,446
Yeah, thanks.

288
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,227
By the way, whose phone are you calling from?

289
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:19,856
A senior shogi player's phone.

290
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:22,846
He was here today at the shogi hall for an interview.

291
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,196
Aren't you bothering him?

292
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:26,237
Yeah, but...

293
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:32,256
In any case, you should hurry home and only think thoughts about your upcoming title match.

294
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:34,116
O-Okay...

295
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,247
Yumi-tan, you should head home early today, too.

296
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:40,316
You were up all night playing mahjong at my place last night, so you haven't gotten much sleep.

297
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:41,356
All night mahjong?

298
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:43,576
Oh, and don't forget to eat a proper meal.

299
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,692
And if you don't hydrate enough, it's not good for your skin.

300
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:48,416
Yeah, yeah. Got it.

301
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,766
Jeez, he worries too much.

302
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:51,927
Yumi-san!

303
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:54,656
You were up all night playing mahjong again?

304
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:56,616
I told you not to do that!

305
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:57,857
Huh? What?

306
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:01,366
Man, you're all on my case.

307
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,186
Wait, this is no time for that.

308
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:06,066
Wait, Yumi-san! Where are you going?

309
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:10,456
I've got someplace to stop by. You can leave without me.

310
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:13,326
Be careful on your way home.

311
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:14,097
Got it?

312
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,337
Well? Any witnesses?

313
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:25,056
No. At the time of the crime, most of the residents weren't home.

314
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:28,966
The only person who was home was an old man confined to his room.

315
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:31,347
Naturally, he didn't witness the incident.

316
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:34,956
Then we'll canvas the neighboring residents, too.

317
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:37,836
Yes, while their memories are still fresh.

318
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:38,857
Right.

319
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:50,306
I know I took the mini patrol car,

320
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:53,277
but since I'm helping the investigation, go easy on me.

321
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,247
Wh-Who's there?!

322
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:02,507
Oh, just my imagination.

323
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:07,567
Jeez. I'm jumping at shadows.

324
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:15,017
Let's see. This area is...

325
00:23:43,437 --> 00:23:44,796
We may have figured it out,

326
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:48,647

327
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:51,907
M-Miike?

328
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:54,667

329
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:56,537
Yumi-san.

330
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,077
Yumi...

331
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:00,207

What?

333
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:07,457
Damn. I nearly have the answer, too...

334
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:13,017
The next episode of Conan is "Target: MPD Transportation Department, Part Three!"
