1
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:09,076
"Makabe."

2
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,468
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

3
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,468
Love and cases come from the same origin.

4
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,268
A smiling wife suddenly disappears.

5
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:04,268
Will the thoughts of the members of the Youth Detective Squad reach her?

6
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,768
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:07,568
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,069
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:56,249
"The Secret of the Disappearance of the Young Wife."

10
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:59,448
True, it sounds suspicious.

11
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:02,448
Yeah, I'm sure that husband, you know, his wife...

12
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,148
I think so too.

13
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:06,648
I wonder about that.

14
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:09,448
They live right in the middle of a residential district.

15
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:11,548
Do you really think that someone would try

16
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,648
to carry a corpse around in broad daylight?

17
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:14,948
True.

18
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:16,949
You can say that again.

19
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:21,748
Conan! You're going home already?

20
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:23,748
Sorry, I have something to do.

21
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:24,849
See you!

22
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,549
Come to think of it,

23
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,848
today's the day that the "Detective Samonji" Series goes on sale.

24
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,448
Which is more important to him? The book or us?

25
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,248
I'll see you guys.

26
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:39,449
Hey! You too, Ai?

27
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,548
This is the house.

28
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:52,848
It's kind of eerie, isn't it?

29
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,649
Let's go see, anyway.

30
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:01,349
I wonder if nobody's home?

31
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,649
The car's not here either.

32
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,548
The only ones living here are the husband, who's a musician,

33
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,848
and his wife, right?

34
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,948
Yes.

35
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,748
The husband is half Japanese and half American.

36
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:19,949
It seems he's frequently on the road and not at home much.

37
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,849
Hey! Look!

38
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,148
This is...

39
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,348
Looks like traces of blood.

40
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,948
You guys.

41
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:34,048
What're you doing?

42
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,448
"Jun Makabe (38)" -You shouldn't walk into other people's homes

43
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,149
without permission.

44
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:42,648
We were playing and our ball seems to have come into your yard.

45
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,849
Right?

46
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:49,248
You're Yoshida's daughter...

47
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:52,448
Well...

48
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:55,248
Where's your car?

49
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,948
It's out for repair

50
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,349
because I scraped it driving where I'm not used to driving.

51
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:07,549
Oh, that's my wife's blood.

52
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,049
Is... Is your wife okay?

53
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:14,148
Of course.

54
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:18,348
But, she's not feeling well now and is asleep.

55
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,549
So, no need to worry.

56
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,548
Is anything the matter?

57
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,548
Oh, no...

58
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:27,048
Is that right?

59
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:28,649
Well, then no problem!

60
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,048
Gosh, so it was nothing after all.

61
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,948
But, honest, I...

62
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,149
He's lying.

63
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,148
I saw.

64
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:47,848
There was not one shoe of his wife at the entrance.

65
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,048
Then does that mean that his wife is not at that house?

66
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,649
Yes, but that's not enough.

67
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:59,849
Hey, that's that house we just went to, right?

68
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,548
"Happy Everyday!" -A scream?

69
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:05,748
Really?

70
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,548
Yeah. It was yesterday...

71
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:12,349
I think it was a bit earlier than today.

72
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,348
It got quiet right away,

73
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,448
so I didn't really worry about it.

74
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,548
Did you see the wife back then?

75
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,648
Nope.

76
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:29,148
Come to think of it, I haven't seen her recently.

77
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:32,148
Did something happen to her?

78
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:34,249
No, not really.

79
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:41,648
The husband killed his wife after all.

80
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:43,648
The scream was when it happened...

81
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:47,348
Okay! Let's go get him ourselves, then!

82
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,048
But...

83
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,348
He's a killer, you know?

84
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:54,149
Do you think we can handle him ourselves?

85
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,648
Hey!

86
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,848
So, is this the house?

87
00:06:58,849 --> 00:06:59,849
Conan!

88
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,948
Haibara!

89
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:02,948
So, you came after all!

90
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,148
I just coincidentally passed by.

91
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:08,148
Me too, I just happened to be heading over to the bookstore.

92
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,248
I thought the bookstore was in the opposite direction?

93
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,249
-Never mind that, -Never mind that,

94
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,949
-we've got trouble! -we've got trouble!

95
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,748
That's the story!

96
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:26,548
What do you think, Conan?

97
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,449
Convinced, right?

98
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,048
No, I wonder.

99
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:36,048
Why? We even found traces of blood, you know!

100
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:39,348
But, that doesn't mean that she was killed.

101
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:41,448
She could've just gotten hurt.

102
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,848
Same with the scream.

103
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:44,948
Just because you heard a scream,

104
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,648
it's too early to determine that something had happened.

105
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:48,649
As for the wife's shoes,

106
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,049
I'm sure they're just put away in the shoes cabinet.

107
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,949
So, the sun's starting to set, it's about time we...

108
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,749
What's with him? What a way to drive!

109
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:10,049
It's going into that house.

110
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:12,548
Hey!

111
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:13,649
Geez...

112
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,149
You guys, enough already.

113
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,248
I'm sorry,

114
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:24,949
I'm late.

115
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:30,948
Where's Yuri?

116
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,449
Oh... At Yamanonaka(in the mountains).

117
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,349
Who's Yuri?

118
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,249
His wife's name.

119
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,248
What's the matter?

120
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:44,148
Didn't you see some strange kids?

121
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,848
Kids? No?

122
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,748
Oh... Okay.

123
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:53,049
Hey, let's hurry and go. I'm hungry.

124
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:09,948
Edogawa...

125
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:14,548
Yeah... Maybe we've got to think the whole thing over...

126
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:18,748
-Which means... -But, we can't conclude we've got a case yet.

127
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:22,248
It'll be a different story if we find the corpse of the wife

128
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:23,948
or some solid evidence.

129
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:26,848
Then, let's find it!

130
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,948
It's time for the Youth Detective Squad to display how competent we are!

131
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,249
But, how do you plan to find it?

132
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:34,449
Well...

133
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:38,349
Ayumi?

134
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,348
This is the key to the backdoor.

135
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:49,748
We can get into the house with this.

136
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:51,048
But, how do you know?

137
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,448
Never mind, let's go in.

138
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:54,948
We better hurry or they'll come home.

139
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,848
Hold it.

140
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,048
What is it, Conan?

141
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:59,448
I told you, didn't I?

142
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:02,048
It hasn't been concluded to be a case.

143
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,148
If we go in just like that,

144
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,048
we'll be committing a crime.

145
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:06,948
Just what're you talking about at this point!

146
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:09,148
I'm sure he did it!

147
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,748
If so, the more so.

148
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:12,349
It's too dangerous.

149
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:15,848
I agree with Edogawa.

150
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,348
I don't want to die here.

151
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:19,748
Oh, no...

152
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,849
What shall we do, Mitsuhiko?

153
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,548
Hold on! Just what do you think you're doing?

154
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:27,148
You can all go on home.

155
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:29,349
I'll search for her alone.

156
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:32,948
Ayumi...

157
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,549
Why do you insist as much as you do?

158
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:40,048
Until recently...

159
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,248
I've been good friends with Yuri, his wife.

160
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:43,448
Yuri...

161
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:47,749
She cared for me as if I were her own child.

162
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:52,248
"Pansy" -I've been coming over a lot to play to this house...

163
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:55,748
That's why you knew where the spare key is?

164
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:57,048
Yes.

165
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,848
But from about six months ago,

166
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:03,349
Yuri suddenly started to avoid me.

167
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:08,648
I'm sure she had her reasons.

168
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,748
But, I couldn't do anything for her.

169
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:14,149
That's why...

170
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:17,749
-Conan. -Conan.

171
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,948
Okay.

172
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:24,949
Oh, boy. Don't blame me for what happens.

173
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,248
How're things there, Haibara?

174
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:41,148
Everything's fine for now.

175
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:42,149
If anything comes up...

176
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,648
Let you know immediately. Right?

177
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:45,849
Thanks.

178
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:55,348
This must be the bedroom.

179
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,349
See, his wife's not here.

180
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:08,749
What's up, both of you?

181
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:17,548
Come on, it's just a doll.

182
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:18,748
What was that?

183
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:22,348
They don't have a child, do they?

184
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:25,348
And yet why is there a doll here?

185
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:28,549
I never saw that doll before.

186
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,748
Hey, Conan.

187
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:39,248
What's the matter, Genta?

188
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,848
Don't tell me that this is...

189
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:42,449
Blood?

190
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,648
He's back!

191
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:49,749
Hurry!

192
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:53,749
This is bad! Turn off your lights!

193
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,649
What're you doing, Genta?

194
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:11,149
He's headed that way!

195
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,149
"Incoming Call."

196
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:16,348
It's Yuri's cell phone.

197
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:19,748
No! Forget it, Ayumi!

198
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:20,949
Darn!

199
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:24,248
He's already at the front door!

200
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:25,349
Hurry!

201
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:27,949
Ayumi, this way...

202
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,249
This is bad. He's coming this way!

203
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,616
That Genta!

204
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,217
Is somebody here?

205
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:09,517
"Incoming Call."

206
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:34,616
Where are Edogawa and Ayumi?

207
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:36,516
They're still inside!

208
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:39,617
Don't worry, I've got an idea!

209
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,717
Yes... Who is it?

210
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,916
-Hey! -Now!

211
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,016
This way!

212
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,117
Hurry!

213
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,317
Is somebody there?

214
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,417
My Youth Detective Squad badge?

215
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:31,717
Where's Ayumi?

216
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:38,317
Found it!

217
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:50,917
This is bad!

218
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,017
Darn it!

219
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,117
"Shinjuku 301, 82-10."

220
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:14,616
Hey, what's happening anyway?

221
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:15,817
Ayumi's been kidnapped!

222
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,917
I'm going to go after him!

223
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,616
-This is... -Terrible.

224
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:30,416
Don't tell me it's Ayumi's...

225
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,216
Just what're you talking about, Mitsuhiko!

226
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:33,516
But, look at this...

227
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:35,316
Wrong.

228
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,316
This blood is already dry.

229
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:40,016
It's not Yoshida's blood.

230
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:42,216
It's probably his wife's blood.

231
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:46,516
I think Yoshida was kidnapped because she saw this.

232
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:47,616
Which means...

233
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:51,016
Yes. Yoshida's in danger!

234
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,916
Did you hear me, Edogawa?

235
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:55,917
Yeah, you guys call the police!

236
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,117
I'll rescue Ayumi, no matter what!

237
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,117
I...

238
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,117
Darn...

239
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,417
Ayumi!

240
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:52,116
Don't come!

241
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:53,317
Ayumi!

242
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,616
Conan!

243
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,516
Help! Conan!

244
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:58,917
Get down! Ayumi!

245
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:10,917
Conan.

246
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:13,716
Are you hurt?

247
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,616
Oh, it's no big deal.

248
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:19,517
I'm sorry... All because of me...

249
00:18:23,217 --> 00:18:24,616
What?

250
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:27,316
Thanks to you we were able to nab the killer...

251
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:29,317
Are you all right, Mr. Makabe?

252
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:32,116
Are you the one?

253
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:35,117
Who passed out at Mr. Makabe's house?

254
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,716
I got a call from Mr. Makabe a while ago,

255
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:43,216
that there's a girl who's passed out in his house,

256
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:45,017
so to please take a look at her right away.

257
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:50,017
"Yamanonaka (In the mountains) Clinic."

258
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:53,716
So by "in the mountains," he meant...

259
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,616
Are you all right?

260
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:58,716
Yeah. More importantly...

261
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:00,116
Ayumi?

262
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:01,617
Yuri?

263
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:11,717
"Yamanonaka Clnic."

264
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:14,516
-We're sorry! -We're sorry!

265
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,816
It's okay.

266
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:20,216
Your kick was a bit violent, though.

267
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:21,916
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:24,216
What a nuisance indeed!

269
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:30,016
To say that Yuri who was in the hospital to give birth was killed!

270
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:34,516
And on top of that, how dare you mistake me for my brother's lover?

271
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,116
Just why the heck do I have to end up

272
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:38,216
being the lover of somebody like him?

273
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:39,516
Hey...

274
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:43,716
But you were hugging each other and kissing.

275
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,717
Oh, that was just a greeting!

276
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,817
You mean this, right?

277
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:55,316
There's no such custom in Japan, you see.

278
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,416
It's understandable that they would make a mistake.

279
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:58,516
Yeah, but...

280
00:19:58,517 --> 00:19:59,816
Cool it...

281
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:04,816
I'm sorry that I seemed to have scared all of you.

282
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:08,717
But why did you keep having the baby a secret?

283
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:17,616
Well, the fact is I miscarried some time ago.

284
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,816
Back then, I was really hurt

285
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:23,616
and caused everybody needless worry.

286
00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:27,116
That's why this time I decided not to tell anyone

287
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:29,316
until the baby is born healthy.

288
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:31,616
So, my husband and I decided to do so.

289
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:33,616
Then your husband lied

290
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:37,216
and you suddenly stopped playing with Ayumi...

291
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:40,316
To hide the fact that you were pregnant until giving birth?

292
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:41,516
Yes.

293
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:44,416
I'm sorry I worried you, Ayumi.

294
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,417
I'm really sorry.

295
00:20:47,717 --> 00:20:50,616
But, that day which was my due date,

296
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,317
I suddenly started bleeding...

297
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:57,316
So, the blood stain under the bed back then

298
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,416
was because you bled.

299
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:02,016
Yeah, it was in an inconspicuous place

300
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:04,416
and I was freaked out too.

301
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,016
I forgot to wipe it.

302
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:09,816
Then, the scream that the delivery milkman heard was also.

303
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:13,116
It's most likely what he heard back then.

304
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:15,016
And what I saw was...

305
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:18,116
Your husband desperately carrying you over to the car

306
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:20,616
after you fainted.

307
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:22,716
And yet I...

308
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:24,717
I'm really so very sorry.

309
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:32,517
Ayumi...

310
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:38,917
Here, carry the baby, will you?

311
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,116
How cute...

312
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:48,716
Come over anytime and keep me company, okay?

313
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:51,416
Is it okay? Because I...

314
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,417
It's okay.

315
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:55,617
You're her older sister, aren't you?

316
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,017
Yes!

317
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:30,516
"Detective Samonji Series, Intent to Kill."

318
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:34,517
"Sold Out."

319
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:40,017
I completely forgot about it.

320
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:49,516
"Next Episode" -His wristwatch is broken and stopped at 11:50.

321
00:23:49,517 --> 00:23:51,816
Sugiya, I think when I saw him this morning,

322
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:53,716
he was wearing leather shoes.

323
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:57,516
I didn't know he kept that picture.

324
00:23:57,517 --> 00:24:03,716
Somebody must've cornered Mr. Kanbayashi over to the window and...

325
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:07,316
What was Mr. Kanbayashi doing here?

326
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:08,917
Standing on this window?

327
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:15,017
Next Conan, "The Secret of the Lovey-dovey Couple"
