I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:06,434
The whereabouts of Ms. Kobayashi is not known?

1st grade class B, let's all go to do a grand search!

He sees through the one and only truth.

00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:11,834
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:14,034
His name is Detective Conan!

00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,611
It's started to really rain hard after all.

10
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,911
Bummers, rain.

11
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:08,311
We were supposed to play dodge ball fifth period.

12
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,411
But I guess it's cancelled.

13
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:13,911
No way! And I was looking forward to playing!

14
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:17,011
Then what're we going to do on the fifth period?

15
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,611
Beats me.

16
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:22,111
We already finished funfest last week.

17
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,411
Then, maybe it'll be reading time?

18
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,211
That's boring.

00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:35,511
Okay.

21
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:36,711
Done.

22
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:42,411

Everybody.

25
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:53,611
Do you all have a pencil with you?

26
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,811
Make sure you write kanji in the correct order!

27
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,211
Geez.

28
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,511
Honestly, give me a break.

29
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,711
No, Conan.

30
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:06,211
Listen, Conan.

31
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:08,011
The order in which to write the kanji character woman is

32
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:12,811
first write the shape "ku" then "no" and finally "ichi"!

33
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:14,011
Yeah...

34
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:15,711
Oh, no!

35
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:17,911
I forgot to bring my eraser!

Thank you, Ai.

Use mine. She says.

40
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,911
Conan. Please be quiet!

41
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,411
I'm sorry!

42
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:35,011
Haibara, you're gonna get it.

43
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:37,111
Oh? Is something wrong, Conan?

44
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,611
Ms. Kobayashi!

45
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,911
Yes?

46
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:45,111
There's a student that's not writing anything at all!

47
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:47,211
What's the matter, Sakamoto?

48
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:48,911
Do you feel sick or something?

49
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,211
No.

50
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:52,711
The tips of all my pencils broke off.

51
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:55,111
So I can't write even if I want to.

52
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:58,111
Didn't you bring a pencil sharpener with you?

53
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,711
I forgot.

54
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,711
Then why don't you borrow one from somebody.

55
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,611
Somebody, who?

56
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,711
-What? -Come, now.

57
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:08,011
Here you go!

58
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:10,411
I'll lend you my pencil.

59
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,511
Thank you.

60
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:14,611
From next time if you are in a fix, let's not worry on our own,

61
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:16,611
and discuss the problem with everybody, okay?

62
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:17,711
Yes.

00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,111
Next is the long awaited lunch time!

65
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:28,211
You're always so energetic when it comes to lunchtime, Genta.

66
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:29,611
Oh, everybody.

67
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:31,311
What? There's no lunch?

68
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,311
Genta.

69
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:36,911
Please leave the classroom open at recess after lunchtime.

70
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,411
In the meantime,

71
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,011
I will have to meet someone here.

72
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,611
We can't stay in the classroom, no matter what?

73
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:46,611
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:49,711
That person is very shy so...

75
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:51,411
Okay, lunchtime.

76
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:52,611
Yes...

77
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:55,111
"Library" -I wonder what it is.

78
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,511
Ms. Kobayashi's wink.

79
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:00,211
She's surely hiding something.

80
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,611
What's this?

81
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,611
That's our classroom, isn't it?

82
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:10,911
I wonder what's come up.

83
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,611
Did something happen?

84
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:13,811
Bad news!

85
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,211
Ms. Kobayashi...

86
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,511
"I will be taking care of Ms. Kobayashi."

87
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,111
"Can you figure out where she is?"

88
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:24,611
"From the fiend with 200 faces."

89
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:26,211
The fiend...

90
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:28,211
With 200 faces?

91
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:31,411
I see.

92
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,711
So this was the reason for her wink.

93
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:37,911
Cute, isn't she?

94
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:40,011
I tell you that Rampo freak.

95
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:41,311
Then,

96
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,911
does that means the person Ms. Kobayashi was seeing during recess was...

97
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,911
The fiend?

98
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,911
I'll go report this to the principle...

99
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,011
Hold it!

100
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:54,011
I found this piece of paper in my desk.

101
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:55,911
Is it from the fiend?

102
00:05:55,911 --> 00:06:01,511
No. I think this is a deduction game that Ms. Kobayashi set us up with.

103
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,511
Deduction game?

104
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:07,811
In other words, she's going to drop us hints

105
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:11,011
so that we can figure out where she's hiding.

106
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:15,311
Since she sent us out of this classroom during recess,

107
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:18,211
maybe she still has some clue hidden here somewhere.

108
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,511
-Let's look for it. -Let's look for it.

109
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:20,511
Let's go!

110
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:24,711
I found one in my desk too!

111
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,311
Paper number two.

112
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:28,311
Mine is paper number one.

113
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:30,811
I have number five!

114
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:32,211
Number three.

115
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,511
Number two.

116
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:35,011
Number one.

117
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:36,811
Number five.

118
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:38,511
Number four is missing.

119
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:42,011
Then, it should be somewhere in the classroom too, right?

120
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:44,511
Okay. Let's all look for it, then!

121
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,711
-Yeah. -Yeah.

122
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:50,511
I found this paper in my desk too.

123
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,211
All right! It's number four!

124
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,911
Now we've got all the cards!

125
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:57,411
Hey, wait a second.

126
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:59,611
Who are you anyway?

127
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,111
How rude, Genta.

128
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:04,411
She's Maria Higashio who transferred to our school the other day.

129
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:06,511
Maria Higashio?

130
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:09,611
That's right, Genta. Don't tell me you don't remember.

131
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:11,611
My god.

132
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:14,711
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't remember.

133
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:15,711
What?

134
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,711
Because he was absent from school with a cold

135
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:20,911
when she first came to our school.

136
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,311
Oh, I see, no wonder.

137
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,411
Anyway, let's organize the hints that we've gathered.

138
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,111
Okay.

139
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:32,111
The card with number one on it

140
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,711
was in Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya's, that is my desk.

141
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:37,111
Number two was in Ayumi Yoshida's desk.

142
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:39,711
Conan Edogawa had number three.

143
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,111
Maria Higashio had number four.

144
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,611
And Genta Kojima had number five.

145
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:49,011
I wonder why only Genta's number is written in red.

146
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,311
Have you had nose bleeds recently?

147
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,311
No, I didn't have any!

148
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:59,211
Maybe it's in order of grades?

149
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:02,311
See, in Japan, report cards are graded by

150
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:03,911
using the numbers one to five, right?

151
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:06,011
For example, if the grades of the five people here

152
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:09,611
matches the grades for... let's say art,

153
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:12,411
then maybe Ms. Kobayashi is in the art room.

154
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:15,511
One to five grading method?

155
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:18,811
The number two is about me?

156
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:22,411
The first graders at Teitan Elementary are evaluated only by two words,

157
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,111
"good" and "a bit more".

158
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,611
Oh, is that how?

159
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:28,011
I heard that when my big sister was going to school

160
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,311
they were graded on a five number evaluation method.

161
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,511
I guess I misunderstood it a bit.

162
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,111
If I remember correctly,

163
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,211
it seems to have been that way some time ago, but...

164
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:40,211
How many years apart are you from your big sister, Haibara?

165
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:43,211
Haibara, do you have a big sister?

166
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:46,511
Oh, maybe it was mum that said that.

167
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:51,411
Hey. It seems that the hint is not limited to just the five numbers.

168
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,711
See. In the back of the paper that was posted on the blackboard.

169
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,511
-Dice? -Dice?

170
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:04,311
316. (Pronounced as mi-i-mu)

171
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,811
245. (Pronounced as ni-shi-go)

172
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,311
316. (Pronounced as sa-hi-ro)

173
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:09,711
245. (Pronounced as fu-yo-go)

174
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,711
I don't think it has to do with a play on words.

175
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:16,511
But I wonder what these six numbers on the dice are?

176
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:19,111
We only found five numbers

177
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,311
so they seem to have no connection.

178
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,911
No, they are very deeply connected.

179
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,911
There should still be a number six

180
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:30,111
hidden somewhere in this classroom.

181
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,011
The number six?

182
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,211
There was none in my desk.

183
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,011
None in mine either.

184
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:37,111
Me neither.

185
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,511
Same here.

186
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,511
Then, where is number six?

187
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:45,811
It was inside.

188
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:47,911
If it's this meaningless paper you're talking about.

189
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,811
Come on! Why didn't you hurry up and tell us?

190
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,011
It's up to me what I want to do, isn't it?

191
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:57,811
What? Come to think of it, you don't look all that familiar either.

192
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:58,911
Who is he?

193
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:01,811
Come on, Genta! Have you forgotten?

194
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:04,011
He was badly hurt right after we entered 1st grade,

195
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:06,711
and started coming to school finally since October.

196
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,111
His name is Sakamoto...

197
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:11,211
What? What was your first name?

198
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:16,211
Surely it was Sakamoto...

199
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:18,311
Takuma!

200
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:22,211
Your full name's Takuma Sakamoto, right?

201
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,211
Yes.

202
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:24,711
Is that it?

203
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,711
Just as expected of you, Conan!

204
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,311
You remembered?

205
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:32,611
No, I hate to say this but I forgot too.

206
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,111
How'd you figure out his name, then?

207
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:37,711
Thanks to Ms. Kobayashi's code.

208
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:42,511
I deciphered her code and came up with the name "Takuma".

209
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,711
What? Then...

210
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,611
Did you figure out where Ms. Kobayashi is hiding?

211
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,711
Yeah, of course.

212
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:51,411
-Where? Tell me, Conan! -Where? Where is she?

213
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:53,511
Yes. Out with it without keeping us in suspense.

214
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:55,511
Darn it, Haibara!

215
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:59,411
First of all, as to why your number 5 is red, Genta...

216
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:02,911
1st grader, Conan Edogawa of class B.

217
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,511
Please come to the teacher's room immediately.

218
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,911
-I repeat! 1st grader, -You're being paged, Conan.

219
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,811
-Conan Edogawa of class B. -I guess.

220
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:12,611
Come immediately.

221
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:15,211
Looks like I have to go.

222
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:17,211
-What? -Hey, Conan.

223
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:20,711
Go if you have to but tell us the answer of the code before going!

224
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:22,011
Don't worry.

225
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:24,111
You guys can figure it out right away!

226
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:28,411
It's a simple game that every kid knows.

227
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,511
Bye then. I'm counting on "you're" guys!

228
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,311
"You're" guys? Come on!

229
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:33,711
-Hey! -Conan!

230
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,811
"You're"? "Yon (means four)- roku (means six) - shiku".

231
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,111
So, that's what it means.

232
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:56,049
Hey. Do we have to solve Ms. Kobayashi's code without Conan?

233
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,249
You think we should wait until Conan comes back.

234
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,749
Oh come on.

235
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:01,949
If he can solve it,

236
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:05,349
there's no reason why we can't, don't you think so?

237
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:08,849
But, you see...

238
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:11,649
Besides, this is a code that an elementary school teacher

239
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,749
made for the students of her class.

240
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:18,449
It's not a mysterious dying message left

241
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,549
after a murder case or a code for a treasure map

242
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:24,449
so I'm sure it's made so that we can solve it on our own.

243
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:28,649
There's no reason why we should back off even before trying, is there?

244
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,149
Right.

245
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,449
I'm starting to feel like we can solve it!

246
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,549
-Let's give it our best shot! -Then, let's start

247
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:36,649
by attaching the name of the person

248
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,349
that had numbered cards in their desk to the number on the dice.

249
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:44,849
First, it's three, so Conan.

250
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:48,749
Next it's one, so Mitsuhiko, then six is Takuma!

251
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:50,749
Two is Ayumi.

252
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:54,049
Four is Maria and five is me!

253
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:59,249
Conan, Mitsuhiko, Takuma, Ayumi, Maria and Genta.

254
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:01,249
If we take only the first vowel sound of our names,

255
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:04,449
it comes out to CO-MI-TA-A-MA-GE.

256
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:06,349
"Comita amage"?

257
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:07,449
If it's our last names,

258
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,049
it would be Edogawa, Tsuburaya, Sakamoto,

259
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:12,849
Yoshida, Higashio, Kojima.

260
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:16,849
It'll be "E-Tsu-Sa-Yo-Hi-Ko".

261
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,549
Maybe the numbers that were in our desks

262
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,949
and this dice are completely different things.

263
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,549
The fact that only Genta's five was written in red bothers me too.

264
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,149
What's the matter, Ai?

265
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,249
Did you figure something out?

266
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:35,549
Oh, look.

267
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:40,649
One thing that is red among six,

268
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,249
I think there was something like that.

269
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:46,749
One thing that is red among six?

270
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:49,749
As for traffic lights, it's only one out of three.

271
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:54,149
As for playing cards, it's 26 out of 52.

272
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,649
Well...

273
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,349
That...

274
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:02,049
I get it!

275
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,649
Dice, right?

276
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:06,749
Incredible, Maria, you did great to figure it out!

277
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:11,249
Yes! I love playing "sugoroku" (children's dice game)!

278
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,249
You have a Kansai dialect.

279
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:13,949
You love "sugoroku"?

280
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:15,849
There's no need to be ashamed.

281
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:18,549
Dialects are like accessories to words.

282
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:20,449
If you want to talk without it, it's okay,

283
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,249
but you shouldn't get rid of it.

284
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:27,049
Because it carries an important message

285
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,649
of the district you were born.

286
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,849
Yes! That's right!

287
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:37,749
What does my number being red have anything to do with the dice?

288
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,249
In a dice, the only red number is one, right?

289
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:41,449
In other words,

290
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:43,849
it means that aside from the five that was in your desk,

291
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,049
one holds meaning!

292
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,649
If it means that I'm number one of all six of us...

293
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,149
The only thing thinkable is your height or weight.

294
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,849
But when we measured height and weight the other day,

295
00:14:56,849 --> 00:15:01,349
Ayumi and I were just about the same height and weight.

296
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:05,449
Besides, kids this age seem to grow at a fast rate on a daily basis,

297
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:07,349
so I guess it's not this.

298
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:08,949
Incidentally.

299
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:14,049
Takuma, are there any games or sports you're good at?

300
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,349
Why?

301
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,349
Remember Conan saying?

302
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:22,549
That the hint was a game that every kid knows.

303
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:27,249
So I thought maybe it's in order of who's good at some game or sports!

304
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:29,849
Genta is number one, so...

305
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:32,349
Okay, it's baseball!

306
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,949
I can play baseball too.

307
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:37,649
Because I used to play ball with dad a lot.

308
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,049
Then, are you better than me?

309
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,849
Hold it.

310
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:44,549
I mean you're not professional baseball players or anything,

311
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,049
but just 1st graders who are good at sports.

312
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,149
Something like that is too hard to determine,

313
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,349
that it's not something that can be lined out in order, is it?

314
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,049
I guess so.

315
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:55,849
There must be something else, another game that will serve as a hint.

316
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:02,049
"1-B" -Ms. Kobayashi, right?

317
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:05,249
You've been here eavesdropping on everybody's conversation, weren't you?

318
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:08,949
Since I was easily able to solve your code,

319
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:10,949
you used your cell phone

320
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:14,149
and asked another teacher to suddenly page me, right?

321
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:15,649
I couldn't help it, could I?

322
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:18,549
Having you solve it too easily is no fun!

323
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:22,149
It's not only because it's no fun, is it?

324
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,749
You precocious brat.

325
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,749
But it's going to work out.

326
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,149
-Hide-and-seek. -TV game!

327
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,449
Playing house!

328
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,649
None of them sound right.

329
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:37,249
I'm good at musical chair!

330
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:39,749
It's because you have a big rear end, Genta.

331
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,049
Musical chair. Rear end.

332
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:46,549
Doesn't anything cross your mind, Ai?

333
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:48,149
Well.

334
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:52,549
Maybe it's not a physical game.

335
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:54,949
Yes. For example...

336
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:56,149
Word chain game!

337
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,749
The names of all six of us match the word chain game.

338
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:03,049
Word chain game?

339
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:04,349
True!

340
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,249
Genta, Takuma, Maria,

341
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:10,249
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, Conan.

342
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:14,249
Really! You've gotta find the right word and Genta is the first one!

343
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:16,949
It's amazing you figured it out!

344
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,449
It was just by chance.

345
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:23,749
I see. Ms. Kobayashi is hiding in that classroom.

346
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:27,749
But, Mitsuhiko. So what if it's a word chain game?

347
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:32,049
So, match the order of the names to the number on the dice,

348
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,949
and then line out the numbers that were in the desk of the six of us.

349
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:39,549
The third name in line is Maria, so it's four!

350
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,949
First is Genta so it's five.

351
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,149
Sixth is Conan and it's three.

352
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:46,249
Second is Takuma so it's six.

353
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:48,049
Fourth is Ayumi, so it's two.

354
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,449
Fifth is me and it's one.

355
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,249
If we read this in order it goes.

356
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:57,849
Four, five, three, six, two, one.

357
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,449
Yo-ko-sa-mu-ni-i?

358
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,749
It's mumbo-jumbo, isn't it?

359
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,849
Maybe it's not the word chain game?

360
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,349
It has to be!

361
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:10,849
Because the word chain fits in too well to be a coincidence!

362
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:14,949
Come to think of it, Conan was saying that when he deciphered the code,

363
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:18,349
he figured out that Sakamoto's first name was Takuma, right?

364
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:22,749
Yes. If the game is making a word chain,

365
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:27,549
the only name that can come between Genta and Maria is Takuma.

366
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:30,949
But, there's a person called "Tajima" living in the neighborhood!

367
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:32,749
There's a guy called "Tanuma" too!

368
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:35,449
But, they're both last names, aren't they?

369
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:42,549
I think Conan figured out the "ku" part of Takuma's name.

370
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:43,949
-That's it! Right! -That's true!

371
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:45,349
Is something the matter?

372
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:48,049
Takuma's last name is Sakamoto.

373
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,049
The sound "ku" in his name is the sixth letter

374
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,649
from the top if written in hiragana.

375
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:54,349
Everybody's saying that it matches the number six

376
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:57,249
that was found in Takuma's desk!

377
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,949
I see!

378
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:01,449
"Tsuburaya" -So, my name is Tsuburaya and I found number one,

379
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:02,749
so the first letter is "tsu" in hiragana.

380
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:06,649
So, I'm Genta Kojima and found number five,

381
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:07,949
"Genta" -so the hiragana "ge" of my name is to be used?

382
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,449
You mean "n".

383
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,649
"Yoshida" -I'm Yoshida and found number two,

384
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:12,949
so the hiragana "shi" of my name is to be used!

385
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:16,649
"Higashio" -My name's Higashio and I found number four, it's "o".

386
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:20,149
"Edogawa" -Edogawa is number three, so the hiragana used is "ga".

387
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:22,349
So, shall we read the letters just now

388
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,949
in the order of the numbers on the dice that we saw a while ago?

389
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:28,949
The first "three" on the dice is me, so...

390
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:30,749
"O"!

391
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,749
Next is Kojima so...

392
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:34,249
"N"!

393
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:35,849
What about Edogawa that comes next?

394
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:36,849
"Ga"!

395
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,549
Next, Sakamoto.

396
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,149
"Ku"!

397
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:41,249
Yoshida.

398
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:42,449
"Shi"!

399
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,149
Then, Tsuburaya!

400
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,749
"Tsu"!

401
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:48,349
The music classroom (ongakushitsu)!

402
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:54,049
I'm kind of starting to understand how tough things are for Kudo.

403
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,149
Let's all head on over to the music room then!

404
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:58,449
-Yeah! -Yeah!

405
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:01,049
Let's go, Maria!

406
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:08,649
Hey! You're coming too!

407
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:09,949
If the answer's not correct,

408
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:13,849
we've got to think it over again together.

409
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,149
I know.

410
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,149
"Music room"

411
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:21,949
Is Ms. Kobayashi there?

412
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,449
No.

413
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,449
Nobody seems to be here.

414
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,449
No joke!

415
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:34,149
Don't tell me that something was wrong in the way we solved the code.

416
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,649
Maybe it's the dice that I mentioned.

417
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:41,549
I think it's the word chain that was wrong.

418
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,749
It can't be!

419
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:47,449
Look really good before complaining.

420
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,949
I'm sure she's here somewhere!

421
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,549
I mean, you're stretching it out too far.

422
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:02,349
Ms. Kobayashi!

423
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:05,449
Which means that our deduction was...

424
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,749
Yes, of course!

425
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:09,349
You hit the bull's eye!

426
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:15,449
You'd better be grateful!

427
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:16,849
I had a hard time.

428
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:18,449
Sorry.

429
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:21,449
Okay then, Ms. Kobayashi. Give us a reward.

430
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:23,349
I have no such thing for you!

431
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,349
You mean we don't get anything?

432
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:29,049
I lose, you guys are fantastic.

433
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:31,849
Will this do?

434
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:34,149
No way...

435
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:38,149
No, you win, Ms. Kobayashi.

436
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:41,849
A girl who was flustered by the change in environment

437
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,849
because she just transferred to this school.

438
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:47,749
And a boy who was absent for a long period of time from school

439
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:50,349
because of a wound and couldn't quite fit into class.

440
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:52,849
You put their names into the code

441
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,949
and helped everyone remember their names.

442
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:56,649
You set it up so that, like it or not,

443
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,549
they had to participate in solving the code too.

444
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:01,049
And you perfectly helped the two melt in

445
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,549
and get along with the others in class.

446
00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:31,749
Hey, then!

447
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:32,849
For our next extra curricular activity,

448
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:36,349
why don't we go explore the mysterious western style building on Nichome?

449
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,949
You mean the "Etou" house, right next door to Dr. Agasa's?

450
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:42,449
Rumor has it that it's vacant again

451
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:45,349
and that there's an evil spirit living there!

452
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:48,549
Come on, hey. That's my house!

453
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:50,349
Oh? That sure sounds interesting!

454
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:53,349
Yes! Exploration of the mysterious western style house in Nichome!

455
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,349
"Etou..."

456
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:57,449
It's read "Kudo".

457
00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:01,549
"Next Episode" -A stone is definitely here too.

458
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,349
Maybe somebody's just playing a prank?

459
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:05,849
This is pretty audacious.

460
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:08,949
It doesn't look like something a professional would do.

461
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,349
"Advent Stone"

462
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,549
Crab is scissors, scissors. The orange is paper,

463
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:16,949
The green caterpillar is rock. Paper scissors.

464
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:20,249
I'm sure that Tsukasa is at that beach.

465
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,249
Please! We've got to find him!

466
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:28,449
Next Conan, "The missing page"

467
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,049
Next Conan's Hint:

468
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,449
"Photo frame"

469
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:50,149
Next Episode is Kanto Railway.

470
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:51,749
Where has that train run off to?

471
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:53,249
I can't break it to you.
