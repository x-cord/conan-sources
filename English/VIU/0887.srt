1
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:06,447
Happy New Year.

2
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:07,947
Word on the street is the sandwiches

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:12,348
that waiter at Poirot makes are pretty good.

4
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,847
So this year,

5
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:19,447
I'll present my meat and potatoes to the world,

6
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,747
sell a boatload, and make fistfuls of money.

7
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:24,348
Boatloads and fistfuls...

8
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:30,547
Once again...

9
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:33,248
We appreciate your continued support in 2018!

10
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:38,147
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

11
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:39,947
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

12
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:41,447
It's been a while! Happy New Year!

13
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:44,047
I'll be keeping you in check again this year!

14
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,747
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,647
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,248
His name is Detective Conan.

17
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:35,524
"Thief Kid and the Trick Box (Part 1)"

18
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,323
So this is "Mokujin",

19
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:41,623
the trick box made by

20
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:44,923
mid-19th Century tinkerer Kichiemon Samizu.

21
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:47,223
I'm delighted you're giving me this,

22
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:50,523
in addition to all those valuable books.

23
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:54,223
No, I'm not giving you the box.

24
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,523
"Tomoyose Kimika (70), widow" -I want you to open it.

25
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,423
My husband, who passed away last month,

26
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:01,123
left something important to me inside that box.

27
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:03,123
I see.

28
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:06,223
Apparently, my husband stuck the instructions

29
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:10,023
to open the box inside a book.

30
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,423
I'd like you to find that paper

31
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,823
within the books I've given to you.

32
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:17,223
I see.

33
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:20,423
So, what's inside the box?

34
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:24,424
The world's largest moonstone, "Luna Memoria".

35
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:26,623
Yes.

36
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:31,024
It's exactly the kind of thing that Moonlight Magician goes after.

37
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:35,024
A big jewel.

38
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:39,123
"To Thief Kid,

39
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:44,023
tonight the world's largest moonstone, Luna Memoria,

40
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,723
will be on display at the Suzuki Library.

41
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:51,923
The jewel is inside a trick box made by Kichiemon Samizu.

42
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:54,523
If you want to see it, you'll either have to open the box yourself,

43
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:58,523
or find the written instructions in the library."

44
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:02,523
General Adviser to the Suzuki Conglomerate, Jirokichi Suzuki.

45
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:03,723
Gosh.

46
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:07,123
That old man is up to his old tricks again.

47
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:09,723
If you're going, you'd better hurry up.

48
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,923
You've been invited, too, right?

49
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:13,723
After all, you're the Kid Killer.

50
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:16,623
Yeah. I just got a message from Ran.

51
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,223
Wait. What do you mean by "too"?

52
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:22,623
I've been invited by the general adviser as well.

53
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:25,423
Since I'm a professional tinkerer,

54
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:29,623
he's asked me to open the box before Thief Kid arrives.

55
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:34,523
I doubt you'd be able to open a Kichiemon Samizu trick box.

56
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,624
What? Ai.

57
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:40,224
Kichiemon Samizu?

58
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,723
Sounds interesting.

59
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:45,223
Subaru.

60
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:48,724
I was told last time that the vegetables weren't cooked enough.

61
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,223
So I came to share some of this thoroughly

62
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,923
stewed meat and potatoes I made.

63
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:56,623
What? You want to go, too?

64
00:04:56,624 --> 00:05:01,023
No. I'll leave this here and go.

65
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:04,323
I'm not interested in thieves.

66
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:08,623
Though I do have some interest

67
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,924
in those who take lives rather than things.

68
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:17,223
Gosh. He's always wearing those turtlenecks.

69
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:19,024
What's his deal?

70
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:22,423
Maybe he gets cold easily.

71
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:25,523
Turtlenecks are just about the only thing

72
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,324
that cover his choker-shaped voice changer.

73
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,924
"Kudo"

74
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:07,123
Dr. Agasa, what are you doing?

75
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:10,524
Sorry, sorry. I couldn't find my license.

76
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,324
"Suzuki Library"

77
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:14,623
Ran!

78
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,023
You're late.

79
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:18,523
The kids are already here.

80
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,123
Sorry, sorry.

81
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:22,523
Dad caught a cold.

82
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:24,424
We had to stop at the hospital.

83
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:29,023
Is he okay?

84
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:31,823
I told him he didn't have to come.

85
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,923
It's just a head cold.

86
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:36,923
How could I not come

87
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:42,124
afer he offered me front row tickets to an Yoko Okino concert?

88
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,423
Will you even be helpful in your condition?

89
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:55,523
He always comes through at the critical moment.

90
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:59,724
Yeah, right. I actually made it easier for Thief Kid to sneak in.

91
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:03,123
How do front row tickets sound?

92
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,923
I'll be there!

93
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,924
By inviting more people for him to disguise himself as.

94
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:16,023
Detective Mouri, thank you for coming.

95
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:21,023
Come in and examine

96
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,624
the trick box for yourself.

97
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:27,823
Don't worry.

98
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:31,223
Inspector Nakamori and I have agreed that

99
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:34,223
he won't pinch any faces,

100
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:37,624
and that the police will wait outside.

101
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:43,223
What?

102
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:46,223
The inspector's not going inside?

103
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,624
Then there's no point in disguising myself as him.

104
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,123
In that case...

105
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:57,823
My mother said to pick...

106
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:04,624
The very best one and you are it.

107
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,923
I see.

108
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,323
So this is the trick box.

109
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:18,324
It's supposed to open when you push or pull a certain part.

110
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:23,423
It looks like an ordinary box to me.

111
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:26,523
I'll force it open!

112
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:27,524
Don't!

113
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,224
It hurts!

114
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:41,924
"Punished"

115
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,323
I wouldn't expect any less from Kichiemon Samizu.

116
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:50,223
It's like a mini Iron Tanuki.

117
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:52,023
What is that thing?

118
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:55,723
It shoots out needles if you're careless with it.

119
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:58,624
I got these when I touched it earlier.

120
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:04,723
Then why don't we put it in a vice and cut it open?

121
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:07,323
It's just made of wood.

122
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:09,923
You mustn't.

123
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:15,223
That was made by the famous tinkerer Kichiemon Samizu.

124
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:21,124
The box itself is worth as much as the moonstone inside it.

125
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:26,523
But I thought moonstones weren't that valuable.

126
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,523
I see them going for about ten thousand yen online all the time.

127
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:32,323
What are you talking about?

128
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:34,823
My husband went all the way

129
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:40,423
to the source in Sri Lanka to buy the one in the box.

130
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:45,523
Its beautiful moonlight blue luster is a true example of...

131
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:47,524
Adularescence.

132
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:52,823
Moonstones that produce that optical phenomenon

133
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:54,523
are valuable.

134
00:09:54,524 --> 00:09:56,823
Furthermore, at that size,

135
00:09:56,824 --> 00:10:02,023
it may truly be as valuable as a Kichiemon Samizu trick box.

136
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:05,023
I thought you weren't interested.

137
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:07,523
My curiosity got the better of me.

138
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,323
I'm surprised you got in.

139
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:13,023
When I told them I knew Dr. Agasa,

140
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:15,323
they let me in without searching me.

141
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,023
That's how we're doing things this time.

142
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:20,723
We're turning away obvious Thief Kid fans,

143
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:25,323
but we're letting in the general public.

144
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,623
We're also leaving the box on this table

145
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:31,323
without any guards posted.

146
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:35,123
Won't he run away with the box?

147
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:37,023
Don't worry.

148
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:39,423
When I push this switch,

149
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:44,923
the scale embedded in the floor activates.

150
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:48,023
If the weight removed by a person leaving

151
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:51,323
is even a gram off

152
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:53,724
from the weight added when they entered...

153
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,824
This happens.

154
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:07,423
How very Kichiemon Samizu-esque.

155
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:10,223
Naturally, if he quietly opens the box

156
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:12,723
and attempts to take just the jewel inside,

157
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:15,223
the same thing will happen.

158
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:18,423
He won't be able to open it quietly.

159
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:21,623
When the box is opened, the music box inside it

160
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:24,224
plays a beautiful melody.

161
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:30,023
I heard a music box playing in the middle of the night,

162
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:32,723
and found my husband in the study opening the box,

163
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:34,723
admiring the contents,

164
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:38,324
and then winding the key before putting it back together.

165
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,623
What song does it play?

166
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:45,623
The last time my husband opened the box

167
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,323
was more than a decade ago.

168
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:49,323
I can't remember.

169
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:52,223
It's a famous melody everyone knows.

170
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:55,624
I think it may have been a nursery song or something similar.

171
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,823
Even if he slips through the bars

172
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:03,923
with the box and jewel,

173
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:09,423
the steel shutters installed at every exit

174
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:13,723
are programmed to shut along with the cage.

175
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:16,824
No one will be able to escape.

176
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,323
I see.

177
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,524
So she wants to open the box no matter what.

178
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:29,024
Even if it means getting help from Thief Kid.

179
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:35,423
So, where are the written instructions for opening the box?

180
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:38,524
After my husband closed the box,

181
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:44,123
I saw him putting a piece of paper with a diagram of the box

182
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:47,824
with arrows and numbers inside a book.

183
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:55,523
Later my husband found me searching the study for that book.

184
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,923
Oh, my.

185
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:01,323
So you saw me opening the trick box.

186
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:03,823
But you won't be able to find it.

187
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,824
What?

188
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,624
Not that paper or the contents of the box.

189
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:13,623
That's what he said, so I assume the instructions

190
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:16,423
to open the box were written on that paper.

191
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:22,023
Why did your husband hide that jewel from you?

192
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:23,423
Who knows?

193
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:26,523
My husband was a very shy man.

194
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:27,823
What?

195
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:29,123
Oh, that is,

196
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:33,723
moonstones are said to bring about love.

197
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:36,223
Perhaps he didn't want me to see him

198
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:39,123
so carefully keeping such a stone.

199
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:43,223
Her husband was one of my adventuring friends.

200
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:46,523
He certainly was a shy man.

201
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:51,223
When we circled the world in our man-powered plane,

202
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:58,024
he hid behind me when the media came to take photos of us.

203
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:02,623
So, has Thief Kid told you he's coming?

204
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:06,023
Yes. We just received a message reading,

205
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:08,823
"As the moonlit magician,

206
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:12,123
I swear on my title that I will come for the moonstone."

207
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:16,023
Which means in order to open the box before Thief Kid,

208
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:18,323
instead of blindly fiddling with the box,

209
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,723
it would be faster to find the book

210
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:24,923
containing the written instructions to open it.

211
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:29,324
All the books in the study were donated to the library.

212
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:32,924
I keep them here in this room.

213
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:38,323
Then if we split up and search for...

214
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:39,923
What?

215
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:41,323
Wait...

216
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:42,924
Seriously?

217
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:51,223
All of these?

218
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,223
There's about ten thousand of them.

219
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,224
It's worth finding, don't you think?

220
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:59,124
This is way too many.

221
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,828
Ten thousand?

222
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:09,828
This is just like the study at Shinichi's house.

223
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:11,528
You're right.

224
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:15,628
But the instructions to open that box

225
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:20,528
are inside one of these books, right?

226
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,628
How are we supposed to find it?

227
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:24,629
There.

228
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:30,728
We'll have to search each one.

229
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:35,728
Gosh. I wish you'd done this before we arrived.

230
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:40,228
I had my entire staff spend a whole day searching,

231
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:42,328
but they didn't find the paper.

232
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:43,429
What?

233
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,328
Though since there's ten thousand books,

234
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,928
instead of reading each individual page,

235
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:55,129
they flipped through them like you're doing now.

236
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,428
Normally if there's something stuck between the pages,

237
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:03,628
the books should open right to it.

238
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,228
Is it possible your husband hid the paper somewhere else?

239
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:10,128
No.

240
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:12,828
My husband died last month

241
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:15,228
in an unfortunate traffic accident.

242
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:19,328
He couldn't have foreseen that and hidden the paper elsewhere.

243
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:24,828
But your husband hasn't open the box in ten years, right?

244
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,528
Not that I saw.

245
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,228
Apparently, he secretly opened it while I was out.

246
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:35,328
When I returned,

247
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,028
he would always say the same thing.

248
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:42,528
Looks like you still haven't opened the box.

249
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:43,628
What?

250
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:48,028
The instructions were still in the same place.

251
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,028
If you're able to find that paper,

252
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:55,029
you should be able to find the true contents of the box.

253
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:59,228
I guess this was too much for you.

254
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:01,928
But if you insist,

255
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:04,728
I'll show you where the page is hidden.

256
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,129
It's a bit embarrassing, though.

257
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,128
Is what he'd say.

258
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,728
The true contents?

259
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:16,028
Does that mean there's something inside the box

260
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:18,428
besides the moonstone?

261
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:20,228
I... I'm not sure.

262
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:23,528
I've never opened it, so I have no idea.

263
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:27,328
If he said he'd tell you,

264
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,728
you should've asked him which book it was.

265
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:33,128
I was frustrated.

266
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:37,228
He made it sound as though I'd never find it.

267
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:40,728
Did you search for the paper after that?

268
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:44,328
Yes, while my husband was out.

269
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,628
In the end, I never found it.

270
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:51,528
Then maybe it's in a book

271
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,128
you wouldn't normally read.

272
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:55,228
You're right.

273
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:58,128
I tend not to read

274
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:04,028
murder mysteries or monster stories.

275
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:08,228
Those books are kept around there.

276
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:10,729
Then we'll start there.

277
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,828
Before we start searching, why don't you go to the bathroom

278
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:21,228
to take the cough medicine we got at the hospital?

279
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:23,428
Fine.

280
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:25,728
If you're taking your medicine,

281
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,228
there was a vending machine in the lobby.

282
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:31,028
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:33,228
If you're going to the bathroom, I'll join you.

284
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,529
Me, too.

285
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,628
"Open the Trick Box!"

286
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:45,428
"Anyone able to open the trick box made by Kichiemon Samizu"

287
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:47,028
"will be awarded one million yen!"

288
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:49,529
"Each person has only five minutes to open the box."

289
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,428
The trick box is a huge hit.

290
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:02,128
Conan.

291
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,128
There you are.

292
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:06,428
You took forever in the bathroom, Dr. Agasa.

293
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:09,428
My stomach hasn't been feeling well.

294
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:12,528
Maybe I caught Mouri's cold.

295
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:19,028
Anyway, I thought Mouri left the bathroom shortly before I did.

296
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,328
He's taking another stab at opening the trick box.

297
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,829
He should just give up.

298
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:37,729
What? This cage moves?

299
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,028
Of course.

300
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:43,628
It uses sensors to accurately capture any moving object.

301
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:46,028
Otherwise, it'd cause major injury.

302
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,528
What's all this noise?

303
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,628
Detective Mouri was just joking around.

304
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:55,228
No. I was just checking to make sure

305
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:56,828
the anti-theft measures were working.

306
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,329
Oh, my! It's wet!

307
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:06,329
If any water got inside...

308
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,428
Well, because it's a wooden box.

309
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,328
It can't get wet.

310
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:13,729
Right.

311
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:20,228
Huh? Where are Ran and Sonoko?

312
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:24,428
They went to the bathroom immediately after you did.

313
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:27,028
Then they're taking a long time.

314
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:30,428
The women's restroom was crowded.

315
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,128
So, have you found the paper?

316
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:35,128
Not yet.

317
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:37,728
I saw some mystery novels I hadn't read yet

318
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:40,129
and couldn't help myself.

319
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:48,628
I smell soy sauce and mirin.

320
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,928
Were you making meat and potatoes?

321
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:52,128
Yes.

322
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:56,128
He made some before coming here.

323
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,528
Perhaps he spilled some on his sleeve.

324
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:01,128
Oh, my. You cook?

325
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,128
Yes, some.

326
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,328
Meat and potatoes is my specialty.

327
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,428
It was my husband's favorite.

328
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:12,029
I had his mother teach me.

329
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:16,128
Subaru, you cook?

330
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:17,928
How surprising.

331
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:22,328
Speaking of cooking, my husband bought

332
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:25,528
countless cookbooks for me since I loved to cook so much.

333
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:29,828
I read them so often, they were practically falling apart.

334
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:33,928
Then we can skip cookbooks.

335
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:37,928
Huh? Sonoko, did you put on some makeup?

336
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,328
While we were in the bathroom.

337
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,728
After all, Thief Kid is coming.

338
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,629
I need to dress up for him.

339
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:49,028
Even if he does come,

340
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:52,428
the anti-theft mechanisms and trick box

341
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:55,928
will probably prevent him from taking the moonstone.

342
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:59,029
Not even that pretentious thief could manage that.

343
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:04,029
I wouldn't be so sure.

344
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,928
This presence...

345
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,228
It's him.

346
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:09,729
He's nearby.

347
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:19,028
Who?

348
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:20,729
Who is he disguised as?

349
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,228
"Next Episode"

350
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:46,229
What?

351
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,028
A blackout?

352
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,829
It's Thief Kid! Thief Kid is here!

353
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:57,928
Get those lights back on.

354
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,028
"I've taken the contents of the box. Thief Kid"

355
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:01,329
"I've taken the contents of the box."

356
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:06,329
Looks like you've figured it out, too, Detective.

357
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:12,629
