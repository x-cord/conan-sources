1
00:00:02,148 --> 00:00:03,747
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:05,747
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,748 --> 00:00:07,747
Ran encounters a queer case at the convenience store.

4
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:09,547
She makes a pure deduction in order to help her friend.

5
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:11,047
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:12,947
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:15,248
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,667 --> 00:02:00,567
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 2)"

9
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:22,252
Who are you?

10
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:38,052
Jodie? Jodie!

11
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:40,951
Are you all right, Jodie?

12
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,551
Did you come across an idea or something?

13
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:45,251
You seemed to be in deep thought.

14
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:48,051
No idea. Not the slightest!

15
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:50,851
Huh? What's the matter?

16
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:54,451
I saw you take off your glasses for the first time, so...

17
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:56,451
You know what I mean, don't you?

18
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:58,351
For the first time?

19
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:01,251
But those glasses sure look old.

20
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:05,451
Oh, yes! This is something I cherish.

21
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:09,051
The only vestige that a person very, very important to me

22
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:11,251
left in this world.

23
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:13,551
That's why it's so very important!

24
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:15,451
A very important person?

25
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:19,752
Is it a keepsake of your ex-lover or something?

26
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,951
By the way, did you two figure out this case?

27
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:26,252
Not at all!

28
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:32,351
It stopped.

29
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:33,951
A delivery truck?

30
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:37,652
Right! The sales clerk mentioned it.

31
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,051
Remember? On the days that Aya is in charge,

32
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:44,251
even the boxes that arrive just before closing

33
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:46,351
are nicely organized, right?

34
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,951
Now that you mentioned it, the sales clerk said so.

35
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:51,752
So? How does that connect to what happened?

36
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:56,251
Well, I wonder how it connects.

37
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:59,951
I thought you had something in mind.

38
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:01,251
But...

39
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:02,652
There!

40
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:06,751
Here are the items you ordered!

41
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:08,351
Oh, you're early.

42
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:09,751
We'll stack the boxes up

43
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:12,151
as usual in the corridor in front of the restroom.

44
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:16,151
Oh, a customer is still using the restroom. What should I do?

45
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:19,551
Oh. We'll bring the boxes over again later.

46
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,751
We got other places to make deliveries to too,

47
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:23,051
so we'll stop by again after we complete the other deliveries.

48
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:24,851
Thank you.

49
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:27,051
Since a customer is using the restroom,

50
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:30,151
the boxes cannot be placed in front of the restroom.

51
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:31,851
If the boxes are placed there,

52
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:34,552
the customer cannot come out of the restroom.

53
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,451
We'll be back later then!

54
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:39,452
Thank you, see you later!

55
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:41,751
On the days that Aya is in charge,

56
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:45,552
the boxes in front of the restroom are nicely organized.

57
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:55,052
What was it? That famous dialog by Holmes.

58
00:04:56,952 --> 00:05:00,051
Shinichi used to remark haughtily.

59
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:03,551
When you have eliminated the impossible, then... this and that.

60
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:07,552
When you have eliminated the impossible.

61
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:14,051
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

62
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,851
however improbable,

63
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:17,652
must be the truth.

64
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,751
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

65
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:25,051
however improbable,

66
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:27,252
must be the truth.

67
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:31,451
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

68
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,551
however improbable,

69
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:35,751
must be the truth.

70
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,451
This dialog?

71
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:39,351
-Oh, yes! -What, what?

72
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,951
Don't tell me Ran, that you came across something?

73
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:46,152
-Oh, not really. -Stop bringing my hopes up again.

74
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:51,151
I think I got it. I feel like I got it

75
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:54,452
but I wonder if my deduction is correct.

76
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:02,851
My!

77
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,751
It's already 21:00!

78
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,251
I'll have to call mother.

79
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:08,151
The customers are decreasing.

80
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:09,152
Yes.

81
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:16,751
-Aya! -Shopkeeper.

82
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,251
So, are you ready to confess?

83
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,851
But, I really haven't done anything.

84
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:26,051
It seems I have no choice but to call the police!

85
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,051
Oh, no.

86
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,951
What shall I do?

87
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:32,751
I could tell them about my deduction.

88
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:37,851
But what if I'm wrong? What if I'm off the point?

89
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:40,451
Then, I may be getting Aya into more trouble than helping her.

90
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:43,851
What shall I do?

91
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:46,351
What would he do at a time like this?

92
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:49,552
What would he do?

93
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:05,052
Caller unidentified?

94
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,751
Hello?

95
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:10,952
Ran.

96
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:13,951
How're you doing?

97
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:15,351
Shi...

98
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,351
Shinichi?

99
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:18,851
Sorry, Ran.

100
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:21,351
I don't have anything to say

101
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,551
but there was a little something I wanted to ask you.

102
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,052
Shinichi.

103
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:31,351
Shinichi!

104
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,251
Huh? What?

105
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,651
Is it from Shinichi?

106
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,051
Yeah.

107
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:37,751
Hey, what's up?

108
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:41,051
My friend's in a tight situation right now.

109
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,551
You know her too,

110
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:44,851
Aya, who was our classmate in intermediate school.

111
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:46,951
Yeah, you mean Nanakawa?

112
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:48,951
For some reason, things disappear

113
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:51,351
at the convenience store where she works

114
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:53,151
and it happens only on the days

115
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:56,151
that Aya is in charge of cleaning and closing the store.

116
00:07:56,152 --> 00:08:00,051
So, the shopkeeper suspects that Aya is stealing the things

117
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,851
and says that he will call the police unless she confesses.

118
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,851
There aren't any customers on the surveillance camera

119
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,651
that are shown stealing either.

120
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,751
The shopkeeper insists that there is no one but Aya

121
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:12,051
because he was watching the store after it closed,

122
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:14,351
but things disappeared after all.

123
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:16,751
And? What kinds of things have disappeared?

124
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:19,051
Game softwares, CDs, DVDs,

125
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:21,351
drinks, lunch boxes and candies.

126
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:23,451
According to Aya, she thinks that

127
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:26,851
there are three suspicious people among the customers.

128
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:29,851
Oh, what kind of people are they? Those three?

129
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:32,751
One of them is a man that looks to be a university student

130
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:35,451
who reads game magazine till near closing time.

131
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:39,351
He bought some cup noodles and pouched food.

132
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,151
The second one is a timid office worker type of man

133
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:44,251
who always lets others go through the register

134
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:46,151
or use the restroom before him.

135
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:50,251
He bought a toothbrush set, a shaver, batteries and a towel.

136
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,651
The third one is a stubborn old lady

137
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:55,451
who asks for discounts on lunches are near shelf life expiration.

138
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:59,551
She seems to have bought nothing at the store.

139
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,851
And?

140
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,251
What all the three of them have in common

141
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:05,951
is that they frequently come to use the restroom at this store.

142
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,651
A month ago,

143
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:10,251
when Aya was scolded in front of the restroom by the shopkeeper,

144
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:12,951
things stopped disappearing just like that.

145
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,351
Then, last night, a month after the incident,

146
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:17,051
again on the night when Aya was in charge, things disappeared.

147
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:21,051
I see, which means it's only natural that Nanakawa is suspected.

148
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:24,251
Wait! Don't talk like it's somebody else's problem!

149
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,951
And? There's something else, isn't there?

150
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:29,051
Something that only Nanakawa does on the days

151
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:31,651
that she is in charge that nobody else does.

152
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:34,951
Oh, yes. The other employees

153
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:37,151
leave the boxes that arrive just before closing time

154
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:41,151
stacked up in the corridor in front of the restroom, and go home

155
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:44,251
but, Aya organizes the boxes neatly before closing the store.

156
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:47,351
Since the surveillance cameras are working all this time,

157
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,851
it should be easy to prove Aya's innocence,

158
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:51,251
but the shopkeeper seems to turn off

159
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,451
the switch of the surveillance camera after operating hours.

160
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,451
Weren't the lunches that were stolen

161
00:09:57,452 --> 00:10:00,051
all near shelf life expiration?

162
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:02,251
Huh? How do you know?

163
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:03,651
Just as I thought.

164
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:06,951
The culprit is probably a pretty nice person.

165
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:10,051
What? You know who the culprit is?

166
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:12,051
Yeah, the culprit is probably...

167
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,152
Wait, Shinichi!

168
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,951
I sort of came up with my own deduction.

169
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,151
So, will you hear me out without laughing?

170
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,751
Go ahead.

171
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:24,952
Ran.

172
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:31,852
Let me hear your deduction.

173
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:39,254
So, that's my deduction.

174
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:40,954
I took everything into consideration,

175
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:44,854
I came to the conclusion that it's not shoplifting, a thief, or Aya.

176
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:47,654
Although it's hard to believe...

177
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,555
Well? Am I right?

178
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:55,854
Hey! I told you not to laugh.

179
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,954
Oh, sorry. It's not your deduction I'm laughing at.

180
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:02,554
I mean I couldn't help imagining you looking all troubled

181
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:05,754
after having deduced the situation as much as you have.

182
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:09,554
Huh? Then are you saying I'm right? Is my deduction correct?

183
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,654
I wonder.

184
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,254
Just what do you mean by that?

185
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,254
Don't be mean and tell me!

186
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:20,754
I'm not an over confident detective like somebody somewhere!

187
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,054
Don't be silly.

188
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:26,954
A detective is only human, and not some almighty god.

189
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:28,554
Huh?

190
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,454
When a detective reveals his deductions,

191
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,554
chances are that he carries doubts somewhere in his heart.

192
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:39,554
Like maybe, I left some detail out or overlooked something.

193
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,554
That's why when your deduction hits the bull's eye,

194
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:43,654
you feel more joy than anyone ever will!

195
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,554
I'm just thinking that I don't want

196
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:48,854
to take the best part away from you, Ran.

197
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,455
Shinichi.

198
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:53,654
He's putting on airs like he always does,

199
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,854
that "hubby" of yours.

200
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:59,254
If you think your deduction is correct, try it out.

201
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,255
Try it out?

202
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,454
You know? Come on, Ran.

203
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:09,054
There's a simple way to drag the culprit out before everybody.

204
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,854
Drag the culprit out.

205
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,154
If you were the culprit,

206
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:16,954
what situation would you hate to be in?

207
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:19,455
If I were the culprit?

208
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,654
Ran?

209
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,855
Mouri?

210
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:35,555
Welcome!

211
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:43,254
Excuse me.

212
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,755
Let me borrow your restroom!

213
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:51,755
Ran.

214
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,955
Shinichi.

215
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,154
Where's Ran?

216
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,654
The restroom.

217
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:20,855
Huh? The restroom?

218
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:25,254
Fire!

219
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:27,954
Quick, everybody! Run!

220
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:30,454
You'd better hurry, or you'll burn to death!

221
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:32,854
You'd better cut it out or I'll file charges against you

222
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,055
for interfering with business!

223
00:13:37,455 --> 00:13:39,154
Listen, here.

224
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:42,255
What on earth's on your mind?

225
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:11,255
Hi.

226
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:14,255
No...

227
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,554
What...

228
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:23,554
-What's with him? -What's up?

229
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:25,254
So, it was you after all.

230
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,354
What?

231
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:29,354
Timid, office worker type customer.

232
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:31,454
Don't tell me it was him?

233
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,854
Yes, it's him!

234
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:36,554
He's the one who's been stealing stuff night after night

235
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:40,754
from this store and giving Aya a bad time!

236
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,454
Night after night? I was in front of the store watching last night too,

237
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:47,854
but I didn't see him sneak into the shop.

238
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,854
Of course, you didn't.

239
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,754
Because he was living in the attic of your store all this time!

240
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:56,754
What?

241
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:58,554
I can't believe it.

242
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:02,754
It may be hard to believe, but this is the truth.

243
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:05,554
After Aya closed the store,

244
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:07,354
he came out of the attic through the restroom

245
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,054
and sneaked into the store,

246
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,754
taking drinks and tons of food, and was making a living!

247
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:17,454
But Aya is in charge only 2 or 3 days a week and not everyday.

248
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:22,354
If he steals a lot at one time, he can probably last 2 to 3 days.

249
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:26,554
Then, why were games software and CDs also being stolen?

250
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:29,754
I think he was probably taking them out of the store occasionally

251
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:32,454
and selling them off for cash.

252
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:33,654
He'd have to go get a hair cut as well

253
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:35,454
as go to take a bath at the times,

254
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:37,754
otherwise his hair would grow long and he'd be smelly,

255
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,354
which would force him to stay in the attic

256
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,554
keeping him from coming out forever.

257
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:45,054
But, can he come in and out of that restroom

258
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:48,354
without the customers or the employees noticing him?

259
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,154
If he suddenly comes out of the restroom

260
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:52,154
or goes inside and doesn't come out,

261
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,954
he'll be suspected right away.

262
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:58,254
No problem! If he's hesitant and careful.

263
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:01,754
Because if he keeps letting people go before him

264
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,154
and keeps standing at the end of the line,

265
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:06,154
nobody would notice him going into the restroom,

266
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,854
so he wouldn't have to come back out, right?

267
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:10,355
Oh, I see.

268
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,854
If he comes down from the attic to the restroom

269
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,154
just before it starts getting crowded,

270
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:18,854
and comes out of the restroom after it gets crowded

271
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:19,954
and go into the store among the other customers,

272
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:22,154
he wouldn't risk being suspected.

273
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,054
If he'd been living in the attic for a while,

274
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:25,154
he would probably have had an idea

275
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:27,054
of when it would start getting crowded.

276
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:28,754
Besides, if the restroom starts getting crowded,

277
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,154
so would the store,

278
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,754
so the employees wouldn't possibly be able to remember

279
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:34,854
who came into the store and who went out, right?

280
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:39,654
Then the toothbrush set, batteries and shaver that he bought...

281
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:43,254
The batteries he used for the flashlight he used

282
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,954
when looking for stuff after the store closed!

283
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:50,154
All the other stuff he took to make himself look decent!

284
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:53,554
Besides, there's a mirror in the restroom too!

285
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,654
Shopkeeper! It's just as she says!

286
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:58,954
The board of the ceiling of the restroom is removed!

287
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:01,454
What?

288
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:04,555
Which mean he was hiding in the attic all this time, after all.

289
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:09,954
This place is a trash dump, shopkeeper!

290
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:13,554
-Incredible! -Oh my God.

291
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:17,354
But, why did he do it only on the days that Aya was in charge?

292
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:20,754
That's because Aya is a diligent worker!

293
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:23,554
The cardboard boxes that are left out on the corridor.

294
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:26,154
The other employees would leave the boxes stacked,

295
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:27,854
in other words, the restroom door was blocked,

296
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:29,454
so he couldn't come out.

297
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:31,054
But, Aya would organize them

298
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:32,754
and move them to both sides of the corridor,

299
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:35,254
making it possible for him to come out of the restroom

300
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,754
and go into the store!

301
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,954
But, Ran,

302
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:41,854
the boxes can be moved over with just a slight shove, can't they?

303
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:43,754
Exactly.

304
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:46,254
That's one thing I can't make out.

305
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:47,354
Hey.

306
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:50,954
Maybe he could've gone through the corridor if he moved the boxes.

307
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:54,754
If the employees find out that the boxes have been moved even slightly,

308
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:56,654
they might find out that the culprit walked through the corridor

309
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:57,754
and get suspicious.

310
00:17:57,755 --> 00:17:59,554
They would suspect the restroom

311
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:03,454
and the fact that he's hiding in the attic may be discovered.

312
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:07,554
Since he was afraid of this happening, he couldn't make any moves.

313
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,554
-That's the story! -Right!

314
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,754
I see.

315
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:13,754
But, I still don't understand.

316
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:15,354
Huh?

317
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,354
Why did he stop stealing for a month?

318
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,454
Well, it may be that he was working things out with the cash

319
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,354
he got from selling off the games and all,

320
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:24,054
but if he didn't stop at that timing,

321
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:27,854
I wouldn't have suspected Aya as much as I did.

322
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:31,254
The culprit is probably a pretty nice person.

323
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:35,454
That's probably because he's a pretty good person.

324
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:38,054
That is, he heard Aya being scolded because of what he did

325
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:39,654
from the attic

326
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:42,054
and that's why he probably decided not to steal for a while.

327
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,854
I see! That's the story.

328
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:47,954
He stole only the lunches that were near the expiration date

329
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:51,654
because he wanted losses to the store to be as little as possible.

330
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:54,755
But stealing is stealing!

331
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,754
How dare you make Aya go through something like this?

332
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:59,454
Ran? Hey.

333
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,255
I could never forgive anyone who did something like this to Aya!

334
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:09,955
I'm so sorry!

335
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:13,954
Three months ago, I was fired from my company

336
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,454
and evicted from my apartment.

337
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,954
I walked into this store feeling faint from hunger.

338
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,454
But I didn't have money to buy anything.

339
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,154
The lights were turned off

340
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:24,854
while I was in the restroom at a loss what to do.

341
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:27,054
Even if I wanted to go out, the doors were locked

342
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,554
and I couldn't go out.

343
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,354
Once my eyes got used to the dark,

344
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,554
the thing that came bursting into my eyes

345
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:35,054
was the stack of food.

346
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:36,954
That's why you stole things from our store.

347
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,954
Yes. I figured since there was so much,

348
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:40,854
taking just a little wouldn't hurt.

349
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:42,154
You've gotta be kidding!

350
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,954
How much do you think we have to sell

351
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:47,554
in order to regain the amount you stole from us?

352
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,854
I'm really sorry!

353
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,054
Either way, you're going to pay us back for all the loss you cost us!

354
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:57,854
Even if I wanted to pay you back, I don't have a cent.

355
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:00,054
You're going to work here.

356
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:03,654
Although you'll have to work for free for a while to start with.

357
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:06,354
You're willing to hire me?

358
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:09,254
After all the trouble I caused you?

359
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,954
I quit being an office worker and started working here,

360
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:14,454
so I sort of understand how you feel!

361
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:16,854
Shopkeeper.

362
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:19,154
Thank you so much.

363
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:21,554
Do your best and work hard.

364
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,054
-Yes, sir. -Well...

365
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,554
I hate to be a wet blanket when you guys are getting it on but...

366
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:29,454
Will you please apologize to Aya?

367
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:31,255
Both of you!

368
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,054
I'm so sorry.

369
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:41,355
I'm very sorry, really. I'm sorry.

370
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:45,354
-I'm happy for you, Aya. -All is well!

371
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:48,055
Ran. Sonoko.

372
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,754
Thank you! Ran and Sonoko!

373
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:56,155
Nothing to it, just leave it to me.

374
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,854
Hey, woman detective!

375
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:03,654
Sorry, Shinichi, what was it you wanted to talk about?

376
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:06,354
Well, it's nothing much.

377
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:08,854
Did you come to my house recently?

378
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:11,654
Huh? No. Why?

379
00:21:11,655 --> 00:21:13,954
Nothing. If not, it's okay.

380
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:17,554
-See you, then. -Oh, hey, Shinichi...

381
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:20,455
It's not Ran.

382
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:54,854
Yes. So, I'm going to sleep over at Jodie's place tonight.

383
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:57,554
Eat dinner at Cafe Poirot, okay, dad?

384
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:58,955
See you!

385
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:04,054
It's her little farewell party

386
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:06,454
and she gets wasted to the point of no return.

387
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:09,354
I'm sure she's relieved because she gets to go back to her country

388
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,654
after a long time.

389
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:13,554
Where are you going?

390
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:15,255
To the restroom.

391
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:22,254
Again. He helped me again.

392
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:23,954
It's so vexing.

393
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:26,055
Really vexing.

394
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:30,355
What on earth is this?

395
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,755
Pictures?

396
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:39,155
What's this?

397
00:23:46,155 --> 00:23:49,454
Jodie...

398
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:52,755
Why? Jodie?
