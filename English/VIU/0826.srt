1
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:49,044
It's all dark out.

2
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:52,444
It's because you guys took forever eating dessert.

3
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:53,844
You're one to talk.

4
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,644
It's because you kept on chatting with that pretty waitress

5
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:57,644
about stupid stuff forever.

6
00:00:57,645 --> 00:00:58,744
What?

7
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:02,145
I was listening to her problems with all my heart.

8
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:16,044
Hey, Ran! Call the ambulance!

9
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:18,644
-Contact the police, too! -Okay!

10
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,344
It looks like he fell off.

11
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:21,445
Yeah.

12
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:23,745
Pops.

13
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:28,145
Miss! Are you all right?

14
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:31,145
Darn.

15
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:42,244
A canvas stained black with crime.

16
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:44,544
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

17
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:46,544
A beauty is behind the case.

18
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:48,744
The reason behind the death fall.

19
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:50,544
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:52,544
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,945
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:39,585
"A Beauty, A Lie and A Secret"

23
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,210
"MPD Beika Police Station" -I see.

24
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:48,184
In other words, that man suddenly attacked you?

25
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,185
Yes.

26
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,284
"Misaki Takizawa (28)" -So I desperately

27
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,385
ran over to the emergency stairs.

28
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:04,184
I was scared.

29
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:06,784
I thought he was going to kill me.

30
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,084
And you're sure that he was the same man

31
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,684
that you witness during that incident?

32
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,784
Yes, I'm sure.

33
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:19,584
Inspector, what case are you referring to?

34
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,884
A murder robbery.

35
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:24,385
Murder robbery?

36
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:27,684
A week ago late at night,

37
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,084
a robber broke into the house of Mrs. Misaki Takizawa

38
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:32,684
through the 2nd floor veranda.

39
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:35,484
"Akira Takizawa (58)" -He threatened her husband, Mr. Akira Takizawa,

40
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,784
and made him open the safe in the study.

41
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:40,885
And stole precious stones worth about 100 million yen.

42
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,885
Then, he killed Mr. Takizawa.

43
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:53,484
I woke up back then after hearing the glass table crack,

44
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:56,385
and ran over to my husband's room immediately but...

45
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:10,284
Was that perp the man who attacked you a while ago, Ms. Misaki?

46
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:11,484
Yes.

47
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:14,184
He's Takeshi Yaginuma

48
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,384
who is a hired manager at a jazz cafe.

49
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,684
"Takeshi Yaginuma (32)" -It seems that the late Mr. Takizawa

50
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,185
also visited that shop several times, too.

51
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:25,184
He turned up as one of our suspects,

52
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:29,084
and all we had left to do was to have Mrs. Takizawa come and point him out.

53
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,384
I see.

54
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:32,084
So he tried to beat you

55
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:35,085
to the punch and silence you, Ms. Misaki.

56
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:39,384
Come in.

57
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:43,284
Inspector, while we were searching Yaginuma's shop,

58
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:46,284
we found this in the storage space under the floor.

59
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:47,485
What is it?

60
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:52,584
Please take a good look.

61
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,885
Is this what was stolen from the safe at your house?

62
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:59,285
Yes, no mistake about it.

63
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,985
Inspector, that clinches it.

64
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,984
It's too bad that we couldn't arrest the perp,

65
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,284
but we'll send papers to the prosecutor

66
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,084
pertaining to the dead suspect,

67
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:11,984
then the case will be closed.

68
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:14,184
I'm happy for you, Ms. Misaki.

69
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:15,684
Thank you very much.

70
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,584
But...

71
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,985
Why'd you park your car in a place like that, Ms. Misaki?

72
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:24,284
Because...

73
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:28,584
Isn't that the 1st and 2nd floor of that parking lot was empty?

74
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:31,384
I just thought that you didn't have to go all the way up

75
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:34,384
to the 3rd floor to park your car.

76
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:37,384
So, did you have a special reason for doing so?

77
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:40,484
Hey, brat! Are you trying to pick a fight or something?

78
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,484
Did you take a good look at Ms. Misaki's car or what?

79
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:46,284
If she parked that expensive car in a place that's too obvious,

80
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:48,284
it'd get stolen!

81
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:50,884
That's why she went all the way up to the 3rd floor

82
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,384
to park her car!

83
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:53,984
Understand?

84
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:55,184
Isn't that right, Ms. Misaki?

85
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:56,784
Well, yes.

86
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:57,984
That hurts.

87
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,584
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,284
I never rode such a cool car,

89
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,184
so I was curious.

90
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:06,784
You are Conan, was it?

91
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:09,084
-Yep! -Do you like cars?

92
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:12,585
Yes. I wish I could ride in a car like that, if just once!

93
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,284
I'll let you ride it next time, then.

94
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:17,684
When's next time?

95
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:19,284
Hey, cut it out!

96
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:23,584
But maybe I'll never get to see Ms. Misaki again.

97
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:24,684
Okay, then.

98
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,884
Would you like to go for a drive from now?

99
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:29,584
Ms. Misaki, but...

100
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:31,284
It's all right.

101
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,684
I was just starting to feel lonely being by myself, you see.

102
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:37,784
Wow, yeah!

103
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:39,085
That's great.

104
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,884
You're the first, Conan.

105
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:57,184
What?

106
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,384
You're the first man to ever ride in my car.

107
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:03,584
Your husband, Mr. Takizawa never rode this car either?

108
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:06,684
He had a bad heart.

109
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:09,285
He said he was afraid of my driving.

110
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,984
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:30,984
I get this urge to speed down the expressway like this sometimes.

112
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,785
Maybe I like being thrilled.

113
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:38,384
Do you smoke, Ms. Misaki?

114
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,784
No, I don't.

115
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:41,984
Why?

116
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:46,484
Look. These are cigarette ashes, aren't they?

117
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,884
Your husband, Mr. Takizawa probably didn't smoke

118
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,884
because he had a bad heart

119
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,784
and you don't smoke either.

120
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,084
I wonder

121
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:58,085
who smoked this cigarette, then.

122
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:00,685
Maybe it's not cigarette ashes,

123
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,885
but just plain dust.

124
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:11,184
Conan, when you grow up, do you

125
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,284
want to become a detective just like Mr. Mouri?

126
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:16,084
Yep, sort of.

127
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:17,884
No.

128
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,584
This place is a secret.

129
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,384
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:23,484
I kind of got curious.

131
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:26,484
You're curious about everything, aren't you?

132
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,284
Do you want to see it that badly?

133
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,684
Yep.

134
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:32,785
Well, I guess I have no choice, then.

135
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,285
I smoked that cigarette.

136
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:41,784
It was a secret. I didn't smoke in front of Takizawa.

137
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,084
A secret?

138
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:46,284
Yes, since he didn't like cigarettes.

139
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,484
When we got married,

140
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:50,785
I lied and told him that I don't smoke.

141
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:54,885
So you lied even though you were getting married.

142
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:59,184
Happiness...

143
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:02,384
is made up of lies and secrets, you know.

144
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:04,785
You'll understand when you grow up.

145
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,285
Lies and secrets?

146
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:14,384
Oh, right! Ms. Misaki, your house is big, isn't it?

147
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:15,884
What? Yes.

148
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:17,884
I want to go see it.

149
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,584
Please take me there.

150
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:23,384
But that place is still as it was since the incident, you know.

151
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:26,284
That's why I'm afraid to go home alone.

152
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:28,184
I live in a hotel right now.

153
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:30,085
Don't worry.

154
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:33,185
Because you're not alone today.

155
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,784
What?

156
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:39,584
Conan is over at Misaki's place?

157
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:41,784
Yep, he called just a while ago

158
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,384
to say he's going to stop over there.

159
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:46,284
I tell you, what's with that brat, anyway.

160
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:49,484
Sonoko told me a while ago

161
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:53,084
that Mr. Takizawa's family has been land magnates for generations,

162
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,284
and they're millionaires.

163
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,685
So what?

164
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,684
That's why when he married Ms. Misaki

165
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:05,084
who was 30 years younger than him a year ago,

166
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:08,285
it seemed people accused her of being a gold digger.

167
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,584
That's what's called petty-minded suspicion!

168
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:15,084
Ms. Misaki is a pitiful victim

169
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:17,384
whose husband was murdered, you know!

170
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,885
That's true, but still...

171
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:22,184
By the way, when did that precocious brat

172
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:24,885
turn into such a womanizer?

173
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:37,184
Wow, butterflies.

174
00:11:37,185 --> 00:11:39,284
Takizawa loved nature

175
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:42,584
and adored country life.

176
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:45,984
That's why there's so much greenery in the garage, too.

177
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,485
But it's not my cup of tea.

178
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:52,985
I hate bugs.

179
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,684
Conan.

180
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:08,784
I'm going to change, so sit wherever you like.

181
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:09,885
Okay.

182
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:31,285
If I remember correctly the site of the crime was in the 2nd floor study.

183
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,684
Bummers.

184
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:44,185
The study's that way?

185
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:03,085
So, this is the study.

186
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:23,184
This is...

187
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,185
Which means that is just as I thought.

188
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,750
You shouldn't be entering rooms

189
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,750
without permission, Conan.

190
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,550
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:45,850
There were a lot of old records so I couldn't help myself.

192
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,450
Takizawa was a jazz maniac.

193
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,650
Would you like something to drink?

194
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,851
I think I've only got orange juice, though.

195
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:56,250
He used to say listening to jazz with the volume up high

196
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,250
got rid of his stress.

197
00:13:58,251 --> 00:13:59,350
I see.

198
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:02,451
That's why this room has a soundproof door?

199
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:04,950
Soundproof door?

200
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:09,250
Yep. When I came in here the door was really heavy and thick,

201
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:10,650
so I could tell right away.

202
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:11,651
I see.

203
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,850
But it's strange.

204
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:19,550
You woke up because you heard the table crack, right?

205
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:20,750
Right.

206
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:23,350
But if the soundproof door was closed,

207
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,650
you couldn't have heard the noise, right?

208
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:27,950
The door was open back then.

209
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,750
It couldn't have been.

210
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:33,850
Mr. Takizawa was killed while he was listening to records

211
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:36,750
so I'm sure the soundproof door was closed.

212
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,950
How do you know?

213
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:43,150
Because look, the record is still on the turntable.

214
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:45,850
If he treasures his records,

215
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,350
I don't think he'd leave a record that he's listening to like that, right?

216
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:51,050
I guess you're right.

217
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:55,250
If so, maybe Yaginuma opened the door.

218
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:56,850
Mr. Yaginuma did?

219
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:59,550
After stealing the jewels,

220
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:03,650
maybe Yaginuma tried to take Takizawa to my room,

221
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:06,850
so he could silence the both of us.

222
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:08,851
But weren't you asleep, Ms. Misaki?

223
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:13,950
I'm not Yaginuma so I wouldn't know.

224
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:16,050
Here's your orange juice.

225
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,050
Just one more thing, then.

226
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:23,050
When you ran over here after hearing the glass table crack

227
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:26,050
the jewels were already stolen, weren't they?

228
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,650
Yes, of course.

229
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,450
But take a good look.

230
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,450
The door of the cabinet this safe is in...

231
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:33,451
Behind it.

232
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:40,750
I found a cracked piece of glass from the glass table.

233
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,550
What about it?

234
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:46,350
In order for the piece of glass to get in here,

235
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:49,750
the door of the cabinet had to be closed.

236
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:53,550
But, if the door was closed, the safe cannot be opened.

237
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:55,750
In other words, the safe was opened

238
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:58,150
after the glass table cracked.

239
00:15:58,151 --> 00:16:02,150
That is, after Mr. Takizawa was killed.

240
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:05,750
But if so, how did Yaginuma open the safe?

241
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,750
Ms. Misaki, you opened it, right?

242
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,351
You opened the safe, didn't you?

243
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:17,450
I wasn't expecting that.

244
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:21,450
Then, what? Are you saying that I'm lying?

245
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:25,150
That's not the only thing you lied about, Ms. Misaki.

246
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,250
You said that when you came into this room,

247
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:30,851
you saw the face of the perp who fled from the veranda.

248
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:34,350
But that would've been impossible.

249
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:37,850
Impossible or not, I saw what I saw.

250
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:39,350
From there,

251
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:43,151
the light of the mercury lamp would result in a backlight effect.

252
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,451
You can't see my face, can you?

253
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,850
In other words,

254
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,250
the fact is, you didn't care to look at the perp at all.

255
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,550
You were certain that Mr. Yaginuma was the perp

256
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:08,251
because you were his accomplice.

257
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:14,450
You instructed Mr. Yaginuma to steal the jewels

258
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,750
and murder your husband.

259
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:21,350
Then, you called him to the parking lot, murdered him

260
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:24,250
and framed him for the entire crime.

261
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,051
Conan, you're cute.

262
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:31,350
Maybe I'll take you somewhere far away.

263
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,551
It seems you'll fit right into my suitcase, too.

264
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,851
I'm only joking, sorry.

265
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,251
You'd better answer the phone or they'll get worried.

266
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:55,651
Hello.

267
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:58,450
Hey, Kid! Where are you?

268
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:00,350
I'm still at Ms. Misaki's house.

269
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:02,450
What?

270
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:06,250
I hope you're not planning to spend the night at her place!

271
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,950
You don't need to worry, Mr. Mouri.

272
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:10,951
Ms. Misaki?

273
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,750
We'll be a little late,

274
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:15,350
but I'll see to it that Conan gets home safely.

275
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:19,350
Well, I'm sorry for all the trouble.

276
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:20,750
For all I care,

277
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,451
you can dump that glasses kid out there anywhere.

278
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,851
Here.

279
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:33,250
Since when did you start thinking that I was the one who murdered Yaginuma?

280
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,451
From the start.

281
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:39,150
Because the palms of Mr. Yaginuma's corpse

282
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,350
were spotless.

283
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:42,450
His palms?

284
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:45,950
Yeah. Anybody falling down the stairs

285
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:49,550
would impulsively try to grab onto something, right?

286
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:52,450
The stairs there were pretty dirty,

287
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:53,550
so if you tried to grab onto it,

288
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:56,450
the palms of your hands would get dirty.

289
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:59,950
But the palms of his hands were clean.

290
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:03,651
Instead, there were cigarette ashes around his chest area.

291
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,950
Which means that Mr. Yaginuma was smoking

292
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:10,151
until just before he fell.

293
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,651
The only thing thinkable then is...

294
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,950
Mr. Yaginuma approached you

295
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:18,851
while smoking a cigarette.

296
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:20,951
Then, at that time...

297
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,050
Insecticide causes...

298
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:27,451
unbearable pain when sprayed from a close distance.

299
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:31,250
And when Mr. Yaginuma covered his eyes with both hands,

300
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:34,051
you pushed him from behind.

301
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:39,150
Fantastic deduction.

302
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:40,850
But...

303
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:43,050
if it's just as you say, it means that

304
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:47,350
you're here with a murderer in front of you, you know?

305
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:49,351
Moreover, it's just you and me.

306
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:53,550
Aren't you scared?

307
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:56,150
What? You're going to kill me?

308
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,650
But if I don't go home,

309
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:01,650
you'll be the first one to be suspected, right?

310
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,350
I wonder about that.

311
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:06,650
If I say that I dropped you off near your home,

312
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:08,550
I think that everyone will believe me.

313
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:10,050
I wonder about that.

314
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:12,750
Of course, because...

315
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:16,251
I have no motive to have to kill you.

316
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:23,250
You're planning to keep on lying?

317
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:24,350
Didn't I tell you?

318
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:29,050
That happiness is built upon lies and secrets.

319
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:30,750
I don't think so.

320
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:34,450
But I also deceived you, too.

321
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:35,451
What?

322
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:38,450
When I put the smartphone back in my pocket a while ago,

323
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:40,950
I pushed the call back button.

324
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:43,850
"Kogoro Mouri: In Call" -Ms. Misaki! Don't do anything stupid!

325
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,150
I already reported this to the police!

326
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:49,150
The inspectors and the others will be there any minute now.

327
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,351
So, turn yourself in already!

328
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,551
Too bad, Ms. Misaki.

329
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:59,551
Who on earth are you, anyway?

330
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:03,451
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

331
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,350
"MPD Beika Police Station"

332
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:28,250
According to her confession,

333
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:32,050
Yaginuma and Misaki were friends since some time ago,

334
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:35,750
and they seem to have devised this scheme even before she got married.

335
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:37,150
I see.

336
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:41,150
At any rate, Conan, you were a great help again this time.

337
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,050
Did Kudo give you instructions again?

338
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:46,850
What? Oh, sort of.

339
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:50,150
But because of that, Conan was put in danger.

340
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:51,750
What's on that guy's mind anyway?

341
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:53,050
But that's...

342
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:54,550
Exactly, exactly!

343
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:57,750
What was he going to do if something happened to this brat?

344
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,751
Well, well.

345
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,050
The case has been solved.

346
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:03,450
And Conan is safe, too.

347
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:07,151
I tell you. If they let me handle it, to begin with.

348
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:11,950
You were having lewd thoughts again, weren't you?

349
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:14,650
Idiot. No, I was not.

350
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:16,850
I'm positive you were.

351
00:23:16,851 --> 00:23:17,950
You were imagining

352
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:20,450
-being alone with Ms. Misaki, weren't you? -Come on, both of you.

353
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:22,450
I was thinking no such thing.

354
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,750
-It's just that I... -You just what?

355
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:25,950
-I only... -Only?

356
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,650
Oh, inspector, would you like to go for a drink

357
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:30,050
-to celebrate case closed. -Don't get me involved.

358
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:32,050
Dad, don't play dumb with me!

359
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:33,750
I'm not playing dumb.

360
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:36,651
Will you have your family brawls at home!

361
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,650
"Next Episode" -Shall we have ramen for dinner, Conan?

362
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,450
-Okay. -Will you cancel

363
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:51,550
my French dinner tonight for me?

364
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:54,650
-You want ramen instead of a French dinner? -Bye!

365
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:56,050
Hey, you over there!

366
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:57,251
Just what do you think you're doing?

367
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,250
As if carrying out

368
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:03,850
a ritual or something!

369
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:05,850
Ritual?

370
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:07,050
Spooky.

371
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:08,750
Next Conan,

372
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:12,451
"Ramen Good Enough to Die For: 2 (Part 1)"
