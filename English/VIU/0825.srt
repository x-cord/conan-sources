1
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,484
Isn't it happening yet?

2
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,083
It's already started.

3
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:21,983
Come on.

4
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,383
Nothing has changed from a while ago.

5
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:27,283
Well, it takes time to change.

6
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:30,383
You've got to be patient.

7
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:32,084
Be patient?

8
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:39,683
This lake is called the tidal lake

9
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:42,983
and is made by drawing in ocean water.

10
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:47,483
In other words, the scenery changes with the rise and fall of the tide.

11
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:49,683
It's just like the Hamarikyu Gardens.

12
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:50,684
Yes.

13
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,183
So, what's the difference in tidal level?

14
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:55,883
Wait.

15
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:57,683
It says approximately 2 meters.

16
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:01,284
Which means you'll be submerged, kid.

17
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:04,683
So will you, Pops.

18
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:07,784
Hey, the submerged bridge will be appearing soon.

19
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:12,183
There it is, there it is.

20
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:13,783
All right. Let's move on.

21
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:16,484
Let's go eat all the fresh seafood!

22
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:18,984
What is it, Conan?

23
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:21,583
Somebody's lying on the bridge.

24
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:22,984
-What? -What?

25
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:37,283
A canvas stained black with crime.

26
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:39,783
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color.

27
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:41,483
A park lake that joins the sea.

28
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,883
The case occurs at ebb tide.

29
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:45,583
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:47,583
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,884
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:33,743
"The Turn Over Case of Shioiri Park"

33
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:38,142
Did you find out his identity?

34
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:39,842
He's the well known

35
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:42,242
Mr. Ryuji Kimijima, age 48.

36
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:44,842
"Officer Motoi (45)" -Everybody knows him around here.

37
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:48,642
He's the 2nd generation president of a food manufacturing company.

38
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:49,842
I see.

39
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,442
Did he drown?

40
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:54,843
No. Please look closely around his neck.

41
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:58,542
There are traces of strangulation around his neck.

42
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:01,142
What? Which means he was strangled to death?

43
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:02,842
Is it murder?

44
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,942
It could be murder, or it could be an accident.

45
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:07,542
Accident?

46
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:10,842
Maybe something got caught around his neck.

47
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:14,442
Hey, something's wrong with his shoes.

48
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:15,443
What?

49
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:19,942
He's wearing his shoes on the wrong feet.

50
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,343
Why would he do that?

51
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:27,242
Officer Motoi.

52
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:31,243
"Officer Keitoku (28)" -I brought the manager of the park, Mr. Tanba.

53
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:33,242
Hello.

54
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:36,443
I have something I'd like to ask you.

55
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,342
He avoided the subject because he couldn't come up with anything.

56
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:44,642
Were you at the park at ebb tide in the morning?

57
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:46,342
"Eizaburo Tanba (65)" -I was.

58
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:48,142
Back then, was the corpse there?

59
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,142
Of course not.

60
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:52,142
Which means

61
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,442
the corpse came from the ocean through the floodgate

62
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:56,943
and probably drifted over here.

63
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:09,442
She is Aoi, the victim's wife.

64
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,542
She's very beautiful.

65
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:13,042
Yes, I guess.

66
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:16,342
I heard she used to be a pin-up girl and an actress as well.

67
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:17,743
I see.

68
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:21,543
Dear!

69
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:25,042
Why did you have to die

70
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:27,942
"Aoi Kimishima (28)" -and leave me behind?

71
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,443
Dear.

72
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:33,142
Talk about dorky acting.

73
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:35,242
Who is he?

74
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,142
He's the older brother of the victim

75
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:40,242
and is an executive at the same company, Yuta.

76
00:05:40,243 --> 00:05:43,543
"Yuta Kimishima (50), older brother of the victim"

77
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:56,442
By the way,

78
00:05:56,443 --> 00:06:00,042
did you notice any changes in your husband lately?

79
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:04,142
No. Nothing in particular.

80
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:05,742
How about you, Yuta?

81
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:08,242
Beats me. I have no idea.

82
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,042
I only saw my kid brother sometimes, you see.

83
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:14,043
What? Despite working at the same company?

84
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:19,642
I may be an executive, but it's just a title.

85
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:22,342
By the way, what's the cause of his death?

86
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:23,942
We're waiting for forensics to give us the results.

87
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:26,542
You can't even tell if it was an accident or suicide?

88
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,242
No, not yet.

89
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:32,643
I think we'll be investigating this case from both sides.

90
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,242
A case?

91
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:37,242
Do you mean murder?

92
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:41,042
Yes. We can't rule out that possibility.

93
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:43,942
I'd like to ask you, just in case.

94
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:47,142
When Ryuji died last night around 10 p.m,

95
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:50,242
where were you two?

96
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,942
I... I was with a friend.

97
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:54,942
What's your friend's name?

98
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:57,542
Well...

99
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,542
His name is Kazuma Nishikikoji.

100
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,342
Is he an actor friend?

101
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:03,642
I guess.

102
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,642
And what about you?

103
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:08,442
I was out night fishing.

104
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:11,742
Can someone testify for you?

105
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:15,743
No. I was out at the shore alone on my cruiser.

106
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,042
Why are you sighing like that?

107
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:31,043
What I really want to eat is fresh seafood.

108
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:33,642
He's still thinking about it.

109
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:34,743
Mr. Mouri.

110
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:39,142
Aoi says she wants to talk to you.

111
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:41,442
What did you want to talk to me about?

112
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,642
I want to talk about my brother-in-law.

113
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,042
Your brother-in-law?

114
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:46,642
Well...

115
00:07:46,643 --> 00:07:52,542
It seems that Yuta doesn't think well of Ryuji.

116
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:54,743
Is there a reason for it?

117
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,542
He thought that he was going to be the successor,

118
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:04,042
but his father decided to make Ryuji as the successor.

119
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,442
I see.

120
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,742
Is there anything else?

121
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:09,642
That cruiser that Yuta mentioned a while ago,

122
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:12,542
Ryuji was the one who paid for it.

123
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,642
-What? -What?

124
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:16,442
I'm sure he got a lot of executive remuneration,

125
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,742
stock dividends and others.

126
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:22,742
Yet he came to Ryuji, asking for money saying he didn't have enough.

127
00:08:22,743 --> 00:08:24,443
A cruiser...

128
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,242
Well, maybe...

129
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:29,742
I'd like to do a little experiment.

130
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:30,942
Will you help me?

131
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,242
-Yes, sir. -Okay.

132
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,442
Excuse me.

133
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:35,143
Wait, Dad.

134
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:38,443
Gosh.

135
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,142
Hey!

136
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:44,842
Paper bags must go in here!

137
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:47,742
Cans in there, and PET bottle over there!

138
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:50,143
Yes, sir. Understood...

139
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:53,542
Value and treasure nature.

140
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:55,242
"Treat Nature and the Environment With Care" -Understand?

141
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,643
We're sorry...

142
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,942
I guess with this old man,

143
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:02,142
even the police can't talk back.

144
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:05,343
Young people these days.

145
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:10,342
Hey, Mr. Tanba!

146
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:11,542
You're late!

147
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,942
"Keisuke Sugao (26)" -I'm sorry.

148
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:17,042
It took a while to finish the job before this.

149
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:18,342
Never mind excuses.

150
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:22,042
In any case, you've caused me a lot of trouble.

151
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:25,142
This time something even worse than garbage washed up.

152
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:26,942
Like what?

153
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:28,642
A human body.

154
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:31,242
What? A human body?

155
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,442
No way.

156
00:09:32,443 --> 00:09:34,942
I see. That's why the police was here.

157
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,742
That's right.

158
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,243
Now hurry up and fix it.

159
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:44,342
Is this where you operate the floodgate from?

160
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:46,042
That's right, sonny.

161
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:50,243
The floodgate is opened and closed using this control panel.

162
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:57,542
This is not good.

163
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:59,743
It won't close.

164
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,043
Did somebody broke it?

165
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,143
I don't think so.

166
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:19,342
Who threw away their garbage here?

167
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:21,842
There's some over here. Who did this?

168
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:25,842
That old man seems to complain a lot, doesn't he?

169
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,242
You mean Mr. Tanba?

170
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:30,542
He sure does, but he's not a bad person.

171
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,142
Maybe he's just too serious.

172
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:37,142
He's been working at this park since I was a child.

173
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:39,442
He's like the master of the place.

174
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:40,843
Really?

175
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,042
Row!

176
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,243
Yes, sir!

177
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:53,442
Conan, where were you?

178
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:55,742
I got lost.

179
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:58,143
By the way, how's the experiment going?

180
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,443
-Row! -Yes, sir!

181
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:06,343
Faster!

182
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,342
How is it, Mr. Mouri?

183
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:17,242
Well, let's finish the experiment here,

184
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,842
and hear what Yuta has to say.

185
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:21,243
What?

186
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:32,542
It's true that I didn't like my little brother.

187
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:33,842
I see.

188
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:37,342
But I didn't have any reason to kill him.

189
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,942
Why not?

190
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:41,242
Think about it.

191
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,542
Thanks to him,

192
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:46,642
I get to play around and get paid at the same time.

193
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:49,142
But with him gone,

194
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:52,142
I'll have to work for myself.

195
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:55,442
But now that Ryuji is dead,

196
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:58,542
aren't you going to be the next president?

197
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,842
I guess so.

198
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:02,142
But I think I'll only take on the title

199
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:05,642
and let someone else handle the job.

200
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,642
By the way, Mr. Mouri,

201
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,142
Ryuji couldn't swim at all.

202
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:13,542
He didn't fish either.

203
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:17,343
And yet, I wonder why he died at sea?

204
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:23,142
Maybe somebody wanted to frame me

205
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:26,342
so they killed him at sea?

206
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:28,442
What do you mean?

207
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:30,042
You know what I mean, right?

208
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:32,642
It's that woman.

209
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:34,942
Be it her alibi or whatever,

210
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:39,342
I don't think you should believe what she says.

211
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,342
I mean, she was a former actress after all.

212
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:45,442
My little brother was probably deceived by her, too.

213
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:47,143
Excuse me then.

214
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:55,143
I bet Mr. Tanba is going to get really angry.

215
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:03,143
What?

216
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:09,143
Styrofoam?

217
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:17,743
That is...

218
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:25,743
This is the fiber of a rope.

219
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:28,943
Which means...

220
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:37,450
What? A rope?

221
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:41,550
Yes. Did you see one this morning when you patrolled the area?

222
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,850
No, I didn't.

223
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,250
Really?

224
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:46,850
Yes.

225
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:49,450
What time do you make your rounds in the morning?

226
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,550
A little after 5:00 a.m.

227
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:53,650
That's early.

228
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,850
Old people usually get up early.

229
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,750
Mr. Tanba.

230
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,951
The battery was dead.

231
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:02,550
The battery?

232
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,350
It hadn't been change for a while, right?

233
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,850
I changed it to a new one.

234
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:09,350
I see.

235
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:11,250
By the way, Mr. Tanba.

236
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,250
-I heard today's going to be your last day. -What?

237
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:17,750
Thanks for all your hard days of work till now.

238
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:19,150
No.

239
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:22,050
I'm the one who should thank you for everything.

240
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,750
I see.

241
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:27,051
So this old man is retiring today.

242
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,650
It's not here after all.

243
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,051
Well, it's just as I expected.

244
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,851
"Treat Nature and the Environment With Care"

245
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:52,851
I see. I know what's happening.

246
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,351
Well, in other words...

247
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:08,150
It's the water ski principle.

248
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:11,250
Water ski?

249
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:15,150
Wait, Mr. Mouri. What are you talking about?

250
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:18,350
While he was being pulled along by the motor boat,

251
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:23,050
the rope he was holding got caught around Ryuji's neck

252
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:26,250
and dragging him along at tremendous speed,

253
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:28,050
leading to his death.

254
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:29,851
That is what happened.

255
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:34,150
So, is it homicide or an accident?

256
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:35,650
Which one is it?

257
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:39,550
Is there anyone who would go water skiing in the middle of the night?

258
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,150
No. Which means...

259
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:45,151
Right! This is unmistakably a mur...

260
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,650
-Mr. Mouri? -What's the matter?

261
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:57,150
It would probably look like nothing but a murder case.

262
00:15:57,151 --> 00:16:01,350
In reality, water skiing is not possible.

263
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,450
What?

264
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:05,150
Then...

265
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,150
You mean it was an accident?

266
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:13,850
Firstly, I'm not sure whether Ryuji really died at sea.

267
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:14,851
-What? -What?

268
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:19,250
If he didn't die at sea, where did he die?

269
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:22,250
He died in this park.

270
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,450
Near Azumaya.

271
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:27,850
That means, the body didn't drift over from the sea,

272
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:31,350
but was in this park from the beginning all along?

273
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:34,450
No, it drifted here from the sea.

274
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,650
What do you mean?

275
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:38,650
He died at the park

276
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:41,150
and yet drifted over here from the sea.

277
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:44,150
The body couldn't possibly move on its own.

278
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:47,750
A certain person moved the corpse.

279
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:51,850
He placed the body on styrofoam and put it in the lake.

280
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:56,350
Usually, the lake and sea are separated by the floodgate,

281
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:59,150
so the perp first opened that.

282
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,850
Then, Ryuji's body rode the ebb tide

283
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:06,150
and went through the floodgate into the sea.

284
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,250
All that was left to do was to close the floodgate.

285
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:11,550
However, due to a malfunction with the control panel,

286
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:14,050
the floodgate didn't close.

287
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:16,150
The cause of this was the battery.

288
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,450
Because of this, during the next high tide,

289
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:22,050
the corpse came back through the open floodgate,

290
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:25,250
fell off for some reason

291
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:29,251
and Ryuji's corpse sunk onto the submerged bridge.

292
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:34,350
But why do something so bothersome like that?

293
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:39,650
That means the perp didn't want the corpse to be found in the park?

294
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:41,750
Yes, that's right.

295
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:43,550
What kind of reason is it?

296
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,050
Never mind that, who is the perp?

297
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:49,050
Office Keitoku, show them the footage.

298
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:51,150
Yes, sir!

299
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:57,450
It was just by coincidence, but Aoi uploaded a picture on her SNS.

300
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,250
It was posted at almost the same time as his ETD.

301
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:04,351
Therefore, Aoi's alibi has been established.

302
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,750
Next, Yuta.

303
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,150
You know that it is forbidden

304
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:15,950
to chum the waters here for recreational purposes, don't you?

305
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:17,850
Of course.

306
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:19,750
If the patrols caught you doing it,

307
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:21,450
that would mean serious trouble.

308
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,950
I'll bet you wouldn't try to do anything

309
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:26,750
in an area that's so closely watched.

310
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,651
So you're innocent, too.

311
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:32,450
Wait a minute, Mr. Mouri.

312
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:34,150
It's not his wife.

313
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:35,950
It's not his older brother.

314
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:38,550
Then who did it?

315
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,951
There's another person, isn't there?

316
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:46,450
Mr. Eizaburo Tanba.

317
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:48,750
What... what do you think you're saying?

318
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:49,950
How rude!

319
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:55,250
Wait. He's the manager of this park, isn't he?

320
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:59,250
What's his motive? What's his motive for killing Ryuji?

321
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,450
He has no motive.

322
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:05,150
Ryuji was not killed.

323
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:07,150
He committed suicide.

324
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:08,350
Suicide?

325
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:10,150
That's ridiculous.

326
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:13,850
If it's suicide, all he had to do was report it to the police, right?

327
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,450
Why would he go through all that trouble?

328
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:20,451
Actually, Mr. Tanba is retiring today.

329
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:25,850
Mr. Tanba, who had worked as the manager of this park for years,

330
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:31,051
enthusiastically wanted to conclude his career successfully.

331
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:47,150
However, he found the corpse of Ryuji who committed suicide.

332
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:51,150
If things are left as it is, his important day would go to waste.

333
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,750
After thinking,

334
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,850
"Suicide letter" -Mr. Tanba decides to carry the corpse

335
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:56,451
out of the park.

336
00:19:58,051 --> 00:19:59,850
But the corpse was heavy

337
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:04,650
and it would've taken too long for Mr. Tanba to move it on his own.

338
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:09,150
Therefore, he decided to take advantage of the low tide

339
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:12,150
and float the corpse out to the sea.

340
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:16,550
Gosh. What an awful world we live in.

341
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:18,950
People don't respect the elderly anymore,

342
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,050
rather they make criminals out of them.

343
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:24,150
If you think that hiding corpses is not a crime,

344
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:26,650
you're wrong.

345
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:28,750
Suit yourself.

346
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:32,751
Although you probably can't accuse me without proof.

347
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:36,950
By proof, do you mean the rope?

348
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:40,551
The rope which matches the strangulation marks left on Ryuji's neck?

349
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:42,950
What is it?

350
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:47,050
That rope may have turned to ashes by now.

351
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:50,550
No, it hasn't.

352
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,150
Why not?

353
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:56,450
The rope was made of heat-resistant polypropylene.

354
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:59,150
So it is not burnable.

355
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:01,150
If you consider the environment,

356
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:04,050
Mr. Tanba would never burn this in the incinerator.

357
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:06,250
I'm sure he would put it together

358
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:09,051
with the rest of the inflammable garbage.

359
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:18,350
I found it, Mr. Mouri!

360
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:22,351
Mr. Tanba. Do you still insist on playing dumb?

361
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:28,250
I don't know what has gotten into me.

362
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:31,850
Today was your special day.

363
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:35,750
It was all the more reason to report it to the police.

364
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:38,150
You're right.

365
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:43,150
That's right. I found a suicide letter near the corpse.

366
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:45,251
"Suicide letter"

367
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,650
"Aoi, Yuta.

368
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:51,150
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

369
00:21:51,151 --> 00:21:55,550
I bought stocks wanting to increase assets for the company."

370
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:57,150
What? Bankrupt?

371
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,151
No way.

372
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:26,451
"Fresh-Caught Seafood, All You Can Eat Seafood"

373
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:29,950
My seafood!

374
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,051
My all-you-can-eat seafood!

375
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:37,550
Talk about a high tide of tears.

376
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:40,251
We won't be seeing ebb tide for a while.

377
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:42,950
"Next Episode" -It looks like he fell off.

378
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:44,950
Yeah.

379
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:47,150
-Pops! -What?

380
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:49,750
Miss! Are you okay?

381
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:51,750
It's a murder robbery case.

382
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:55,250
-A murder robbery case? -What?

383
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:57,150
This place is a secret.

384
00:23:57,151 --> 00:24:01,450
I'm sorry. I just couldn't help myself.

385
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:04,851
-Do you want to see it that badly? -Yes.

386
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:10,851
