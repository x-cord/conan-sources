1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,425
"Poirot" -A band, a band!

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:06,125
Let's the three of us start a girls' high school band!

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,125
What?

4
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,325
Where's all this coming from?

5
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:12,425
The movie of a girls' high school band that I was watching last night

6
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,025
was super cute.

7
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:15,425
Really?

8
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:16,625
And?

9
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,325
What musical instrument are we going to play, Sonoko?

10
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:21,725
Of course drums!

11
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:25,225
The girl drummer in that band looked like me.

12
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,625
She was awesome.

13
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:28,825
I see.

14
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:31,025
Then, I'll...

15
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,925
Since you've got long black hair,

16
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,125
you're playing the bass, you're the bassist!

17
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,125
What?

18
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,125
The bassist in that band had hair like yours too.

19
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:42,725
But I never played bass before.

20
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:45,925
You're better at playing the piano, right, Ran?

21
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,725
Maybe I should play bass?

22
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:53,625
Big brother's friend taught me how to play bass before.

23
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,725
Okay, Sera, you play bass

24
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:58,025
and Ran, will you play the keyboard then?

25
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,725
Okay.

26
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:02,425
But, where are we going to be performing?

27
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:04,625
"Looking For Performers, Beika-cho Countdown Talent Show"

28
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:09,525
We'll perform at the end of the year countdown talent show in Beika-cho

29
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,925
and win the championship!

30
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:17,225
But don't we need a guitarist for the band too?

31
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:18,825
You're right,

32
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:22,125
but there's no one in class who looks to be able to play the guitar.

33
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,325
Azusa!

34
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:26,325
Will you wipe the table, please?

35
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:27,625
Oh, okay.

36
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,225
I found a guitarist!

37
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,325
What?

38
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,125
There was a girl named Azusa,

39
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,825
who played the guitar well in that high school girls band too!

40
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:40,525
But I never ever touched a guitar.

41
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:43,125
And, besides, I'm not even in high school to begin with.

42
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,025
If you wear a uniform, nobody would know!

43
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:48,725
Besides, you have pretty much of a baby face too, Azusa!

44
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,325
Baby face?

45
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:53,725
She's completely poisoned by that movie.

46
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,925
But, isn't a guitar difficult to play?

47
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:58,425
You'll be just fine, don't worry.

48
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:02,025
Just a little practice and you be able to play in no time!

49
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:03,625
Strum, strum.

50
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,925
Okay, play then!

51
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,525
Here, I'll lend you my guitar.

52
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,225
Oh, but...

53
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,825
We'll hook it up to our portable amp,

54
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,525
so you can play right away.

55
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,025
Go ahead!

56
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:18,225
No...

57
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:21,925
You said with a little practice, you could play in no time, right?

58
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:26,225
If so, show me what you can do, young lady.

59
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,925
A canvas stained black with crime.

60
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,325
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

61
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,525
What will happen to Sonoko?

62
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,125
I guess there are great expectations for the three member of the JK band!

63
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,725
He sees through the one and only truth.

64
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:43,725
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

65
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:46,225
His name is Detective Conan!

66
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:30,949
"A Girls' Band on Bad Terms (Part 1)"

67
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:41,849
In the movie, I think the fingers were place like this.

68
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:48,249
Come on, you can't even play.

69
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:50,649
You've got the nerve, when you can't even play!

70
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,549
High school girl!

71
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:53,849
Sonoko.

72
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:58,349
Hand it over.

73
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,949
Wow.

74
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,749
He's good!

75
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:40,849
Well, if they practice a little,

76
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,949
they'll be able to play this in no time at all, right?

77
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,049
Sure.

78
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,149
Yes.

79
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,449
You're right.

80
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:50,249
Sonoko, you should watch your big mouth too.

81
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,249
Okay.

82
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,749
Thank you very much!

83
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:58,249
Amuro, please join our band!

84
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:59,249
What?

85
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:02,849
Then, we can have a girls' high school plus handsome band, right?

86
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:04,449
I don't think so.

87
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,149
I don't like to stand out, you see.

88
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,949
Well, after all, you're a security police agent

89
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,149
that's infiltrated the Black Organization so...

90
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,849
I can help you out when you practice, though.

91
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:15,749
Would you like to go to a rental studio

92
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,349
and practice a little from now?

93
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,649
-That sounds good! -Yes, let's!

94
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:20,849
Hey, you.

95
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:25,749
Haven't we met somewhere before?

96
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:26,949
No.

97
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,549
I think today's the first time.

98
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,449
Oh, no?

99
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,049
All the rooms are full?

100
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:46,849
It'll be a one hour wait.

101
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,049
What shall we do?

102
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:49,249
Maybe some other time then?

103
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,449
But, we came all this way.

104
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,849
Well, if it's just an hour, maybe we should wait?

105
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,849
There seems to be a break room on the basement floor too.

106
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:59,449
If we rent the instruments,

107
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,849
I can at least teach you the feel of a song

108
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:03,149
by playing note for note and the chords.

109
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:07,049
Oh, you can play the bass too?

110
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,149
Yes.

111
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,949
Although I can't guarantee that I'm better than your big brother's friend.

112
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,849
By the way, can you play the drums, Sonoko?

113
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:16,949
Of course!

114
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:19,749
I'm great at Drum Master!

115
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:21,349
A video game, huh?

116
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,549
Sera, you're fantastic!

117
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:31,649
You're good!

118
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,749
I just played the scale.

119
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:37,149
Well, but the only thing that my brother's friend taught me

120
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:38,849
was till here though.

121
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,549
Really?

122
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:45,749
Do you remember the face of the guy who taught you how to play the bass?

123
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:47,649
Well, sort of.

124
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:52,249
But how did you know that his friend was a guy?

125
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:55,849
Well, I just happened to think so.

126
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,149
Come on!

127
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,449
At this rate, we won't make it in time!

128
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,649
We've only got a week to go before the live, you know!

129
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,149
Tadako, your bass is off rhythm,

130
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:10,549
and your voice isn't projecting either!

131
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:14,249
Sorry, I over drank yesterday.

132
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:17,549
And Rumi, your keyboard played the wrong sound at times!

133
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,649
I'll bet your nails are long!

134
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,849
Sorry. I haven't been playing the keyboard recently.

135
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,249
And Hagie, your drumming was more sluggish than always.

136
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:31,449
"Hagie Yamaji (25), Drums (Leader)" -Sorry.

137
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,049
"Hagie Yamaji (25), Drums (Leader)" -I'm kind of sleepy, you see.

138
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,449
Come on, shape up, everybody!

139
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:40,849
Someka, your guitar was a bit too fast too.

140
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,349
It was like you were annoyed or something.

141
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,049
Like I said, we don't have much time left.

142
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,749
You don't seem to notice that your button's about to fall off too.

143
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:51,649
-What? -The chest pocket to the left.

144
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:57,949
Well, let's cool our heads off a bit and resume practice.

145
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:01,149
I'm going back to the studio to take a quick nap till then.

146
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,449
I should be okay after a 10 minute nap.

147
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,349
Gosh.

148
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:09,349
We only have two more hours in the studio.

149
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,149
What should I do about my nails?

150
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,049
Would you like to use my nail clipper?

151
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,449
Thank you. I'll go cut my nails in the restroom later.

152
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:19,249
Would you like me to sew your button on for you too, Someka?

153
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:21,649
I have a sewing kit.

154
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:24,149
You're like a mother, Tadako.

155
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,449
You're good at sewing too.

156
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:29,049
I'm not as good at knitting as Akane, though.

157
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:33,149
Akane knitted the cap that Hagie's wearing too.

158
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,349
That's right.

159
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:39,849
This is a tribute for Akane, so we have to make it a success!

160
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:42,649
And yet, Hagie goes and takes a nap.

161
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,049
I wonder if she really understands.

162
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,749
Bummers!

163
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:49,149
I forgot my sewing kit at the studio.

164
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:50,649
Okay, I'll go wake Hagie up

165
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,649
and while I'm at it, I'll sew your button on for you

166
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:53,949
so can you take off your jacket?

167
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:58,149
Okay. But, I'll go wake Hagie up

168
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,149
because I've got to change the guitar string that broke too.

169
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,749
Oh, there was a part in a song that I wanted to change too.

170
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:08,949
But if Hagie's sleeping in the studio, I guess I can't.

171
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:12,049
I've got to play the keyboard to write out the notes too.

172
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,149
I've got to turn the volume up to tune my guitar too.

173
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,449
Well, since we've still got time, no need to rush.

174
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:18,649
Okay!

175
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:26,249
We'll be playing Yoko Okino's "Dandelion".

176
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:28,549
Who's going to be singing it?

177
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:29,649
What?

178
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:33,549
You are, aren't you, Sonoko?

179
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,149
I can't do two things at one time.

180
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:38,949
So, would you like to sing it, Sera?

181
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,849
Nah, I pass.

182
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,849
How about your boyfriend, Shinichi?

183
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:44,949
What?

184
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:47,849
I'm sure that he can play the guitar too, can't he?

185
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:51,649
Shinichi can play the violin.

186
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,949
But I wonder about the guitar?

187
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:55,049
As to singing...

188
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:56,549
As to singing?

189
00:10:56,849 --> 00:11:01,049
As to singing, he's on the same level as Conan, right?

190
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:03,649
Sorry that I'm tone-deaf.

191
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,649
Isn't the scream of the people of the band we saw earlier?

192
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,449
It came from the studio upstairs, right?

193
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:16,949
Where did that scream come from?

194
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,649
From the studio back there.

195
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,449
Is she dead?

196
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,649
Hey! Hagie!

197
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,149
No joke?

198
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,949
Hagie? Hagie?

199
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,749
There's a Yoshikawa line on her neck.

200
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:35,449
She was strangled to death.

201
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,449
Strangled?

202
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:39,249
Who did this to Hagie?

203
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,449
I think we'll be able to figure it out right away.

204
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:42,449
What?

205
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:43,649
See.

206
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,849
We can view the footage from the security camera on the ceiling.

207
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:52,049
Hey? What the heck is this?

208
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:55,049
Half of the image is black and not visible?

209
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,349
More so, it's black just by the drums.

210
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,949
I think that's behind the cell phone.

211
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,849
We were filming ourselves practicing.

212
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:05,949
We stuck a selfie stick to the tip of the mic.

213
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:07,249
I see.

214
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,149
Under these circumstances...

215
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,549
Even if somebody was doing something near the victim...

216
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,649
Nobody would know about it!

217
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:25,056
I see.

218
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:27,956
In order to record your practice,

219
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,656
since you set the cell phone onto the tip of the mic stand,

220
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:33,156
which was attached to the selfie stick, like this,

221
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:36,956
one side of the image on the security camera was cut off,

222
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,556
and the area around the drums was completely out of range

223
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:43,356
that it's impossible to tell who strangled her.

224
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:44,956
Is that right?

225
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,656
Yes, sir.

226
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:50,156
By the way, who put this here?

227
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,756
I did.

228
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:56,756
But I wasn't trying to block the security camera or anything.

229
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:59,856
I just set it up like everyone told me to.

230
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,856
Right?

231
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:02,856
Yes.

232
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:05,356
We were watching the image on the cell phone

233
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,956
and told her to move it more to the left.

234
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:09,356
Or more to the rear and things like that.

235
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:14,356
And in the end, I think we decided on the position after Hagie said

236
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:17,756
to set the camera there and start practice.

237
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,956
But, didn't the shop people scold you?

238
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:23,956
After all, you've blocked half the security camera.

239
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:27,056
At first they cautioned us, but...

240
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:32,356
we're regulars here so they're lenient on us recently.

241
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:35,856
But, why?

242
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:40,456
Normally, one part of the wall of rental studios

243
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:42,856
is made of mirrored walls like this,

244
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,056
so that the crime being committed is reflected on the mirror

245
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:48,456
and recorded on the security camera.

246
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:50,856
Why were the curtains closed?

247
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,656
Hagie told us to do so too.

248
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:55,356
She said because she wanted to concentrate on playing.

249
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,656
She said if we're recording it on the cell phone,

250
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:59,456
watching it later would be good enough.

251
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,756
Which means this situation was meant to occur.

252
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:05,956
Yes.

253
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:08,756
The perp who assumed it would turn out this way,

254
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:11,056
used it to her advantage.

255
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:15,856
Well, that is, if you will take the word of a detective.

256
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:22,756
I think it's best to listen to what the three have to say

257
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:26,156
while watching the security camera, no?

258
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,756
It seems that all the girls

259
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:32,756
went in to the studio one after the other to wake Hagie up.

260
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:36,456
So, we have this coffee shop detective, a high school girl detective

261
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:39,356
and a grade schooler who believes he's a detective once again.

262
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:42,656
There sure are a lot of detectives in this town, aren't there?

263
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:45,856
So, is this how it is?

264
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:49,656
You four were taking a break in the basement break room,

265
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:53,356
Hagie said she wanted to take a nap and went back to the studio.

266
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:56,456
The three of you went at different times to wake her,

267
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:57,956
but she didn't get up.

268
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,256
And since she was sleeping for more than 30 minutes,

269
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:03,656
all three of you decided to go and wake her up together,

270
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:06,456
but you found Hagie dead.

271
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,556
Yes.

272
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:11,856
Who was the first one to go wake Hagie up?

273
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:13,656
It was me.

274
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:17,156
I called out to her several times but got no answer.

275
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:20,056
She was sleeping even after I finished sewing on the button,

276
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:23,456
so I went back to the break room where Someka and Rumi were waiting.

277
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,656
-Button? -I was going to sew the button

278
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:28,356
that was almost ready to come off from Someka's jacket,

279
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:32,056
but found out that I had left the sewing kit at the studio.

280
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,356
This must be it.

281
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:35,556
When Tadako entered the room.

282
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:37,956
Half of your body is hidden,

283
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:40,756
but it's obvious that you're sewing.

284
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,156
But, it looks as if you've been here for more than 10 minutes.

285
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:48,056
Does it take that much time just to sew on a button?

286
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,656
Yeah, when I took a look,

287
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,756
I saw that cuff of her sleeve was coming a bit apart.

288
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:55,056
True! The cuff's been fixed.

289
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:57,356
So, who's the next one that went to wake her up?

290
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,156
Me.

291
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:03,556
My guitar's getting a tune up so I rented one from this shop.

292
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:07,156
While I was practicing, the string of the guitar broke.

293
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:10,156
I thought I'd try waking her while I replaced the string.

294
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:13,656
The reason why all four of us took a break from practice

295
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:16,056
was because my guitar string broke too.

296
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:17,956
If you rented the guitar from here,

297
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:21,756
couldn't you have had the shop clerk change the string for you?

298
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:25,756
I wanted to replace the string and tune the guitar myself!

299
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:28,156
Oh, this is you, isn't it, Someka?

300
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:32,556
It's when you're replacing the string and tuning your guitar.

301
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,356
Yes, that's right.

302
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:36,956
But, you've got to turn up the volume to tune the guitar, don't you?

303
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:40,256
You're pretty close to the drums, aren't you?

304
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:43,656
I figured I'd deliberately make noise and wake her up!

305
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:46,356
I wanted to hurry and get on with practice, so...

306
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:49,156
How did Hagie look back then?

307
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:54,156
She had her face on the high tom of the drums and was sleeping.

308
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:56,356
She always slept like that.

309
00:16:56,356 --> 00:17:00,156
So if she was already dead by that point...

310
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:03,156
You wouldn't have known.

311
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,656
Don't tell me that

312
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,456
you're insinuating that I did it when I went there at the beginning?

313
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,456
I was just stating an example.

314
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,956
So, the last one to go wake her up was you, Rumi?

315
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:15,056
Yes.

316
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:19,856
The fact is, I found a part in a song that I wanted to change.

317
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:23,256
So I went to make the change while at the same time to wake her up.

318
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,556
If you take a look at the music sheet I left back at the studio,

319
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,456
I think you'll understand what I mean.

320
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:29,556
Let's see.

321
00:17:29,556 --> 00:17:33,456
It's true that there are parts that look to have been re-written.

322
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:35,856
You changed this part to up tempo, right?

323
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:36,856
Yep.

324
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,256
I think this is better because it has more beat to it!

325
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,356
It's all Greek to me.

326
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:44,256
Well, but now that Hagie is dead,

327
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:48,556
I don't know if we'll have the chance to play that song anymore though.

328
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:51,156
There, there!

329
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:55,056
But, Rumi, you're moving your keyboard.

330
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:59,056
I moved away from the drums so I wouldn't wake Hagie.

331
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:02,756
I wanted Hagie to listen to the song after I finished revising it and all,

332
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:05,356
so I kept the volume down really low too.

333
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:10,956
I finished revising and called out to her but got no answer.

334
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,556
You seem to have been at the studio for about 10 minutes too?

335
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:18,056
Okay, we're going to search for the rope like murder weapon

336
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,756
that Hagie was killed with.

337
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:22,856
After all three of you go through a body check,

338
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:25,756
please wait at the break room in the basement.

339
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,556
What? You can't find the murder weapon?

340
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:35,856
Did you search every nook and cranny?

341
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:37,856
Yes, we searched all over the studio

342
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:40,456
including the bathroom and inside the drain as well.

343
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:44,456
Her ETD is around just when the three girls

344
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,856
went to the studio to wake her up.

345
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:49,256
According to the security camera of this shop

346
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:51,056
that's set up by the entrance,

347
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:53,956
those three did not go outside.

348
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:57,156
If no weapon was found on the bodies of the girls,

349
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,456
the murder weapon has to be somewhere in this room.

350
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,156
Search harder!

351
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,156
Yes, sir.

352
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:06,956
Did something happen?

353
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:09,056
There were police cars parked outside,

354
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:10,056
but is it a case or something?

355
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,756
No, it's nothing really...

356
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,556
What's the matter, Sera?

357
00:19:14,556 --> 00:19:17,056
Do you suspect them?

358
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,256
Oh, no.

359
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,556
It's just that seeing somebody carrying a guitar case

360
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:22,356
brings back memories.

361
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:23,756
It reminds me of 4 years ago

362
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:26,856
when I watched Shu standing on the other side of the platform

363
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:29,356
carrying a guitar case!

364
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,156
Shu?

365
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:35,656
So, is she Mr. Akai's younger sister after all?

366
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:37,356
I was surprised.

367
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:39,956
Because I thought he was in the States.

368
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:44,156
And I never saw Shu do music too.

369
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:49,356
Back then, I was on my way back after watching a movie with a friend,

370
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,256
but ran and got on the same train as Shu!

371
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:55,956
I really wanted to listen to Shu playing the guitar.

372
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,556
Really?

373
00:19:57,556 --> 00:19:58,756
What happened next?

374
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:02,256
Shu found me on one of the station platforms

375
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,456
where I transferred trains several times.

376
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:06,556
He scolded me telling me to go home

377
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:07,656
but when I told him

378
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:10,456
I didn't have any money and didn't know how to get home,

379
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,856
he left me on the platform after telling me to wait

380
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,456
while he goes and buys me a ticket.

381
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,956
To tell the truth, I was already in intermediate school

382
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:20,256
so I had money and knew how to get home too,

383
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:24,756
but to him, I guess I was still a child.

384
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:28,456
And? Did you wait like he told to?

385
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:31,156
Yeah. I felt like crying.

386
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:36,156
But back then the man that Shu was with...

387
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:37,956
You.

388
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:41,256
Do you like music?

389
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:44,756
After saying that, he took the bass out of the case

390
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:49,056
and taught me how to play a scale.

391
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,656
Oh.

392
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:53,956
So the person you mentioned earlier that taught you the bass...

393
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:55,656
It was him?

394
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:59,656
Yeah. It was only for about 10 minutes though.

395
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:03,956
Then maybe he was your big brother's music friend?

396
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:05,956
I wonder about that.

397
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:09,856
The bass that the person had was in a soft case.

398
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:12,456
But it didn't change form and stayed upright

399
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:15,356
even after he took the bass out.

400
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:18,356
Maybe the bass was just camouflage

401
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:22,556
and something harder was inside the case.

402
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:23,756
A rifle.

403
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:25,456
And? And?

404
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:27,656
Did you get his name?

405
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:29,456
No, I didn't.

406
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:34,556
But another man who came to the platform called him.

407
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:36,756
Scotch!

408
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:41,056
Scotch?

409
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:42,456
He was non-Japanese?

410
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:44,956
He looked Japanese no matter how I looked at him

411
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:47,256
so I think it was just a nickname.

412
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:50,856
But, the man who called him that

413
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,256
had his hat deep over his eyes

414
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:55,956
so I didn't get a good view of what he looked like.

415
00:21:55,956 --> 00:22:02,156
He looked very similar to you, Amuro!

416
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,856
It's someone else.

417
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,656
Never mind such old time stories.

418
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:09,356
Why don't we get to solving the case that just happened here?

419
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:12,156
You're a detective too, aren't you?

420
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:14,856
Yeah, I guess so.

421
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:44,356
It's just as the girls say.

422
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:48,256
I guess we need to investigate the members of other bands too.

423
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:50,856
Come to think of it, I'd like to watch the video recording

424
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:53,056
of your practice session at the studio!

425
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,256
Sure!

426
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,856
We switched the power off when we weren't practicing

427
00:23:56,856 --> 00:23:59,956
so I don't think the perp would be displayed.

428
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:01,256
See!

429
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,156
I see.

430
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:06,256
So, that's the story.

431
00:24:06,856 --> 00:24:08,356
Next Conan,

432
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:12,256
"A Girls' Band on Bad Terms (Part 2)"
