1
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:11,007
Come on, honey.

2
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,637
We've been walking for a while.

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,308
Are we there yet?

4
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:21,828
Where's this villa your wealthy uncle bought us as a wedding gift?

5
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:24,967
Be patient. We're almost there.

6
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:28,347
Like you told me the other day, I made sure it's in your name.

7
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:29,818
Don't worry,

8
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:31,818
darling.

9
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,328
We've arrived.

10
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:38,727
I'm so excited.

11
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:41,837
Stop teasing me and let me see it, honey.

12
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:43,078
Nope.

13
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:46,647
I'm going to remove my hands now, but keep your eyes closed, okay?

14
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:47,478
Okay.

15
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:53,768
Now open your eyes and take a good look.

16
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:01,598
Th-This house...

17
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:03,077
That's right.

18
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:08,608
It's the villa you built with the money you scammed from stupid women like me.

19
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:13,028
The love nest you've been sharing with some bitch.

20
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:16,997
It's not like that with her.

21
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:19,447
Y-You've got it all wrong, honey.

22
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:21,377
What a shame.

23
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:24,498
Your excuses won't reach my ears.

24
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:29,658
Make all the excuses you want in the afterlife.

25
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:40,888
Goodbye, darling.

26
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:47,377
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

27
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:49,657
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

28
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:51,427
The Detective Boys go picking wild plants

29
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:53,477
and encounter a case in the forests of Gunma!

30
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,157
Always determining the one truth

31
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,097
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

32
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:59,648
his name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:44,968
"Picking Wild Plants and Clovers, Part One!"

34
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:22,753
TR Minanokami Station

35
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,888
You must be exhausted from your long journey.

36
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:28,388
Welcome to Gunma prefecture.

37
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:31,357
It must've been a long trip from Tokyo.

38
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,887
It wasn't too bad.

39
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:36,018
Are you kids all right? You're not too tired?

40
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,717
I'm totally fine.

41
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:40,107
I'm a little hungry, though.

42
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:42,857
Let's pick some wild plants today.

43
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:43,778
That's right.

44
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,737
Thank you for coming to meet us today, Zenda-sensei.

45
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:49,877
You even brought a car.

46
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,087
It's fine.

47
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:55,797
My own elementary school used this mountain for our own outdoor class.

48
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:58,548
It comes highly recommended.

49
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,548
Besides, I'm excited since this is my last job as a teacher.

50
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,727
What? Your last job?

51
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:06,928
Are you quitting?

52
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:10,557
Yes. I'm actually getting married.

53
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:14,187
Actually, I already quit last week.

54
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,287
Congratulations.

55
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:17,867
Thank you.

56
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,358
Hey.

57
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:21,957
We're taking this car, right?

58
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,647
Can we get in?

59
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:25,318
Go ahead.

60
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,698
First.

61
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:32,677
Huh? There's something on the seat.

62
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:35,458
Looks like unassembled cardboard boxes.

63
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:37,787
Oh, I'm sorry.

64
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:42,088
I forgot that my cardboard moving boxes were still in my car.

65
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:45,557
Would you mind putting them up against the windows?

66
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:46,848
Okay.

67
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:52,888
Everyone's in, right?

68
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:54,768
Yup.

69
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,768
Then let's go.

70
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,237
I see.

71
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:14,288
Your school has first and second years attend outdoor classes together.

72
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:15,607
Yes.

73
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,977
That's why we brought some children with us today to check things out beforehand.

74
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:22,298
We wanted to see how they'd respond to the location.

75
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,548
We chose five exceptionally precocious kids.

76
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,058
I see.

77
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:32,298
Anyway, isn't this way too much cardboard?

78
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:35,558
They're covering the rear windshield.

79
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,507
There're lots of expensive-looking houses.

80
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:42,977
They look like villas.

81
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:43,818
Yeah.

82
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:48,167
This area has a lot of vacation homes, huh?

83
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,068
Yes.

84
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:53,578
Although they have nothing to do with us common folk.

85
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:20,607
Okay, you can get out now.

86
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,438
Okay.

87
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:25,897
It's so pretty!

88
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:27,488
The air here is nice, too.

89
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,528
I bet we'll be able to pick lots of wild plants here.

90
00:07:31,148 --> 00:07:33,537
Let's pick a whole bunch and turn them into tempura.

91
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:34,847
Yeah.

92
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,548
Hold on.

93
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,757
As long as we're here,

94
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:43,668
why don't we take a photo to commemorate the occasion?

95
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,418
Good idea.

96
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:54,808
Ready? What's one plus one?

97
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:56,308
Two.

98
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:15,287
We should probably have an instructor assigned to each group.

99
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,198
Yes.

100
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:19,627
Maybe I got too excited.

101
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:22,137
I'm kind of thirsty.

102
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:27,067
Oh, right. I left the drinks I brought in the car.

103
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:28,838
I'll go get them.

104
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:31,197
We'll help you.

105
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:36,458
No, we should have the children help.

106
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:41,227
Your name is Yoshida-san, right?

107
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,967
Could you help me get the drinks?

108
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,648
Yeah, sure.

109
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:48,648
All right, Yoshida-san.

110
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:52,667
Could you take this bag to the others?

111
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:53,658
Okay.

112
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:55,208
Hup.

113
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:59,658
Zenda-sensei, what is it?

114
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,918
I think I dropped my earring.

115
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,918
See? This one.

116
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:10,077
I'll help you look for it.

117
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:12,568
Sorry about that. Thank you.

118
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,678
Ayumi's taking a long time.

119
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,637
What are she and Zenda-sensei doing?

120
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:22,058
I'm parched over here.

121
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,358
The direction of the wind suddenly changed.

122
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:29,168
This...

123
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,108
This smell...

124
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:32,248
Blood?

125
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:42,588
What is this?

126
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:51,347
He probably died about five or six hours ago.

127
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:52,258
Look.

128
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:56,758
There are tracks behind the tree as though something was dragged.

129
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:01,268
This body wasn't here when we got out of the car.

130
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:07,768
Someone must've moved the body here while we were picking wild plants.

131
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:12,777
But who put it here, and why?

132
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,307
Hey, Conan.

133
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:16,228
What's the matter?

134
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:19,178
What happened?

135
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:27,118
No. You're kidding.

136
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:31,048
Darling. Darling!

137
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:32,987
Darling!

138
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:35,178
D-Darling?

139
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:49,508
The victim is Fukikoshi Toji-san, 42 years old.

140
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,928
He's the president of a trendy IT company.

141
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:56,658
Is that correct?

142
00:10:57,628 --> 00:10:58,707
Yes.

143
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:04,028
And you happened to be at the location where the body was discovered,

144
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:07,718
Zenda Maika-san, the victim's fiancée.

145
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:15,237
Yes. We were supposed to get married next month.

146
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:17,837
Why did he have to die?!

147
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:20,678
Who would do something so awful?!

148
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,347
Please arrest his killer as soon as you can!

149
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:28,017
That's what you say now, but...

150
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:29,157
What?

151
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:34,007
Perhaps you changed your mind about marrying him, killed him, and left the body here.

152
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:38,167
Maybe it was your plan to act surprised

153
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:42,577
when the people you invited to pick wild plants discovered him.

154
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,647
No...

155
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:46,408
That's not possible.

156
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:51,927
When we arrived, the body wasn't here.

157
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,548
Right, Wakasa-sensei?

158
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:54,748
Yes.

159
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:59,888
When we arrived, I believe we took a photo in front of the car to commemorate the occasion.

160
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,067
As long as we're here,

161
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:06,018
why don't we take a photo to commemorate the occasion?

162
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,768
Good idea.

163
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:17,148
Ready? What's one plus one?

164
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:19,148
Two!

165
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,618
You can check the photo later.

166
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:26,957
But while all of you were distracted by picking wild plants,

167
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,157
maybe she retrieved the body she hid in the trees.

168
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:30,788
That's not possible.

169
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:34,538
Zenda-sensei was with us the whole time.

170
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:36,127
Really? The whole time?

171
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:37,207
Yeah.

172
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,668
Really really?

173
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:43,567
We went back to the car together to get drinks.

174
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:50,308
She dropped her earring next to the car, so we looked for it til our hands were covered in mud.

175
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:52,277
Right, Sensei?

176
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:54,188
Y-Yes.

177
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:03,647
And besides, you always have ridiculous things to say.

178
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:07,197
Please don't disrupt the investigation with your crazy remarks again.

179
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:08,288
Shut up!

180
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:12,287
If you kids don't watch your tone,

181
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:14,677
even though you discovered the body,

182
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,168
I'll throw you out of the crime scene.

183
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:27,278
Sorry we don't know how to keep our mouths shut.

184
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,058
You're right.

185
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:40,318
When you took this photo, there wasn't a body here.

186
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:43,167
That's what we've been telling you.

187
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:50,018
Someone left the body next to that tree while we were picking wild plants.

188
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:54,617
But there are a lot of similar trees growing in this area.

189
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:58,748
Perhaps you initially parked your car in a very similar-looking location.

190
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:01,627
And while you were distracted,

191
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:05,888
she left the body here and moved the car.

192
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,678
I-I didn't do anything like that.

193
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:13,297
Maybe she did it when you went to get drinks while picking wild plants.

194
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:16,987
I told you, I was with her when we got the drinks.

195
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:19,268
Zenda-sensei didn't move the car.

196
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:22,977
And we didn't hear the sound of a car engine.

197
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:25,947
The only thing Zenda-sensei did was open the rear door

198
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,278
and get the bags of drinks out of the car.

199
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:32,817
And besides, we didn't smell anything when we got here.

200
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:37,577
That's right. When people die, they produce a weird putrid smell.

201
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:38,288
Actually,

202
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:43,327
it depends on the specific body and where it's left,

203
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:46,807
but generally corpses don't smell until after two days during the summer,

204
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:48,468
or four days in the winter.

205
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:51,308
It doesn't smell right now, does it?

206
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:55,308
Now that you mention it, you're right.

207
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,647
You know a lot about corpses.

208
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:01,858
Oh, I saw it on a suspenseful drama last night.

209
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:06,677
You mean "The Thunder God Murder," right?

210
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:10,618
The one where the horrible wife electrocutes her husband to death.

211
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:14,118
I-Is that what happened?

212
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,498
Excuse me, Inspector Yamamura.

213
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:21,498
Did you find something?

214
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:25,427
I found a large quantity of business cards inside the body's inside jacket pocket.

215
00:15:25,428 --> 00:15:27,767
Well, of course he has some.

216
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:31,067
After all, he was the president of an IT company.

217
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:33,177
I'm sure he meets a lot of people.

218
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:36,767
We found several business cards that aren't his own.

219
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,648
Large numbers of each, too.

220
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:41,148
What did you say?

221
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:44,648
Kogo Michio Segawa Rikuaki

222
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:47,898
This is certainly odd.

223
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:54,028
Why was it necessary for him to carry so many business cards that weren't his?

224
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:55,888
Maybe he was doing something

225
00:15:56,328 --> 00:16:01,668
that required him to change his name or profession depending on who he was meeting.

226
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,727
Like a detective who assumes different titles in order to acquire information,

227
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:10,678
or a spy who becomes other people in order to blend in better.

228
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:16,348
Or a conman who assumes different identities in order to fool people more easily.

229
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,348
A conman?

230
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,858
Could it be?

231
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:27,368
That's my phone.

232
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:31,048
Hello, this is Yamamura.

233
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:35,028
What? You identified the body from his face?

234
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:43,918
Marriage fraud?

235
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:47,647
Fukikoshi-san was committing marriage fraud?

236
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:48,458
Yes.

237
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:53,658
We sent the body's face to the Gunma police headquarters, and we got a hit.

238
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:56,757
His real name was Uruma Shigefumi.

239
00:16:56,758 --> 00:17:00,147
He committed numerous cases of fraud in other prefectures, too.

240
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:02,978
Apparently he was a wanted criminal.

241
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:09,147
In some ways, this was a good thing for you.

242
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:11,407
It happened before you got married to a wanted man.

243
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:13,417
There's nothing good about this.

244
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:16,488
How much do you think I gave him?

245
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,857
When we went to buy this engagement ring,

246
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:26,248
he said he didn't have any money on him, so I paid for it.

247
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:30,258
Really? That's unfortunate.

248
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,508
Something's definitely odd.

249
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:37,077
The dirty fingertips on her left hand wearing the ring

250
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:41,518
can be explained by searching for the earring she dropped.

251
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:46,247
But even though the fingertips on her right hand aren't particularly dirty,

252
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:50,028
she's got dirt on the inside of her arm all the way up to her elbow.

253
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,278
How did that happen?

254
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:57,868
Come to think of it, when we found the body,

255
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:02,328
Zenda-san and Ayumi-chan were next to the car.

256
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,778
They were both near the front tire.

257
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,237
What are you doing, Ayumi-chan?

258
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:15,968
I'm looking for a four-leaf clover.

259
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:18,887
A four-leaf clover?

260
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:28,358
Yeah. I found one earlier while looking for Zenda-sensei's earring, right next to this tire.

261
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:30,977
I'll help you look for it.

262
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:33,438
Sorry about that. Thank you.

263
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,238
It's a four-leaf clover.

264
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,738
Yoshida-san?

265
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:47,577
Did you find my earring?

266
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:49,567
No, not yet.

267
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:52,407
Then could you look over there?

268
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:53,458
Okay.

269
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:56,907
Fine, then.

270
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:58,967
We'll help you look for it.

271
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:01,058
Let's all look for it together.

272
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,698
Thanks.

273
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,627
It's not here.

274
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:08,058
I can't find it either.

275
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:12,237
Are you sure it had four leaves?

276
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,448
Yeah. I know I saw it.

277
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:19,507
Why didn't you pick it when you found it?

278
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:24,077
I was busy looking for Zenda-sensei's earring then.

279
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:31,588
Besides, don't they say carrying a four-leaf clover is supposed to bring you good luck?

280
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:33,687
I suppose.

281
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:36,088
They do say that.

282
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:41,098
So I wanted to give it to Zenda-sensei.

283
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:47,558
I'm sure she's shocked that the man she was supposed to marry is dead.

284
00:19:47,738 --> 00:19:52,318
And it sounds like he was a bad person, and she seems really down about that.

285
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:55,818
So I wanted to cheer her up.

286
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:59,517
I see. It's like a good luck charm.

287
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:02,487
Then we've got to find it.

288
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:04,647
Don't get too excited and accidentally step on it.

289
00:20:04,648 --> 00:20:05,828
Yeah.

290
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:09,458
A good luck charm.

291
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:12,348
A good luck charm...

292
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:18,158
"A bishop on your own side makes clever moves."

293
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:26,288
Will you still kill me regardless?

294
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:33,948
That idiot...

295
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:37,468
Idiot...

296
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:44,628
Wakasa-sensei?

297
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,138
Are you all right, Wakasa-sensei?

298
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,388
Yes.

299
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:52,887
I've been feeling a bit anemic recently.

300
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:55,288
We did get up early this morning.

301
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,128
She covered her eye just now.

302
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,728
Her right eye must be damaged.

303
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:11,988
Inspector.

304
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,117
Inspector Yamamura.

305
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:16,108
What is it?

306
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:20,097
We followed the tracks left by the body was dragged.

307
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:22,947
It led us to a villa through the woods.

308
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,988
A villa?

309
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:29,748
Apparently it belonged to the murder victim.

310
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:31,248
What?

311
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:34,117
I-In any case, please come with me.

312
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,458
Okay.

313
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:53,628
Did someone really move the body while we were picking wild plants?

314
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:59,408
The dirt on Zenda-san's right arm is odd.

315
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:07,028
As well as all the cardboard boxes in her car.

316
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:16,748
And then there's the four-leaf clover Ayumi-chan lost track of.

317
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:47,718
Wait a minute.

318
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:52,917
But if they had time to do that, wouldn't they have fled the scene?

319
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:56,978
I'm telling you, they panicked.

320
00:23:57,598 --> 00:24:02,868
As though by magic, they made this body appear.

321
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:05,717
A picture is worth a thousand words.

322
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:09,158
Why don't we perform an experiment?

323
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:14,228
The next episode of Conan is "Picking Wild Plants and Clovers, Part Two!"
