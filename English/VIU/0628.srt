1
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:05,227
Another letter of warning of an upcoming crime is delivered.

2
00:00:05,227 --> 00:00:07,927
However, this time he says he's coming to return

3
00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:10,027
the items that another thief had stolen previously

4
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,327
to its original owner.

5
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:16,827
All three items belonged to Ryoma Sakamoto.

6
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:19,327
Meanwhile, the original owner Mr. Tarumi

7
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:21,327
and the appraiser Mr. Hanamura

8
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:24,627
held a Ryoma exhibition in the Great Suzuki Museum.

9
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:27,927
At the exhibition grounds, the gunbelt with a ruby on it

10
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:31,027
that was given to Ryoma by Shinsaku Takasugi, along with a pistol,

11
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:32,427
was on display.

12
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:37,227
Rumors that Thief Kid may be after the gunbelt also go around.

13
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:38,927
Metal detector gates are set up

14
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,927
at the entrance of the exhibition grounds

15
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:42,727
since among the items that Thief Kid will be returning,

16
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:45,627
a pistol is included.

17
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:47,627
But, something bothers me.

18
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:51,227
Will such a method really help to capture Thief Kid?

19
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:54,427
Like the fog clears.

20
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:56,627
Let's see through love and crime as well.

21
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:58,527
Unbelievable, he's returning the treasure.

22
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:00,627
What is Thief Kid's real target?

23
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,327
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:04,227
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:06,327
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,200
"Conan vs. Kid Battle for the Treasures of Ryoma (Part 2)"

27
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:57,565
Officers guarding the entrance of the museum!

28
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:58,765
How are thing there?

29
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:03,965
Yes, sir! There's no one who was surprised by the gate and left!

30
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:06,765
Are the metal detector gates functioning all right?

31
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:10,665
Yes, sir! Nobody is in possession of the pistol in question.

32
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:12,365
How about in the exhibition room?

33
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:16,965
There is no one who looks to be Thief Kid here for now.

34
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:18,665
Is Thief Kid really going to show up?

35
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,165
Idiot!

36
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,365
There isn't a time that Kid had warned of a crime

37
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:23,565
and not shown up!

38
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:25,465
I'm sorry, sir!

39
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,065
Come on, Kid.

40
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:32,665
I'll nab you for sure this time!

41
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:39,465
Wow! Fantastic!

42
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:42,865
It really looks like the boarding gate at the airport!

43
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:45,365
Moreover, there are three gates too.

44
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:48,265
Uncle sure is something!

45
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:52,465
Something bothers me, after all.

46
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,165
Writing something like,

47
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:57,065
"I'll be bringing the pistol with me" deliberately,

48
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:58,865
I'm sure he would assume that something like this

49
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,865
would happen, and yet...

50
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,665
In addition, I can't even make out

51
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:06,965
how he plans to use the rain to his advantage yet, either.

52
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:08,965
The last sentence of the letter.

53
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,865
"I pledge to clean up once and for all."

54
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:13,265
I don't understand what it means.

55
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:18,065
Did he just happen to use Ryoma's phrase to play on words?

56
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:23,165
Or, is he really planning to wash something?

57
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:25,265
Come on! Let's go inside too!

58
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,865
Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,965
It's set up so that the corridor on the other side of the entrance

60
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:34,365
of the Ryoma Exhibition is blocked off by a wall

61
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:38,865
so you have to go through the gate get inside.

62
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:42,965
The only thing that is in between is the restroom, but...

63
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,965
Inside the restroom...

64
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:49,165
There was only one window

65
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:54,065
with bars and coming in from outside is impossible.

66
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:55,765
So, it would be impossible to bring a pistol inside

67
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:57,365
under the present situation.

68
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,765
Conan?

69
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,765
We're going in.

70
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:01,865
Yes!

71
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,765
Check out the crowd of people here.

72
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,065
Attention please!

73
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:12,065
The exhibition ground is getting to be very crowded.

74
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,165
We are sorry to announce that

75
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,665
viewing the Ryoma Exhibition

76
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:17,865
will be limited to ten minutes.

77
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:21,865
So they say, but it looks like nobody's leaving.

78
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:24,365
-Yeah. -Right!

79
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,165
There's still two hours to go before the assumed arrival time,

80
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:30,665
but maybe Sir Thief Kid is already mingled somewhere in here already.

81
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,865
But, you can't go through the gate

82
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,965
with a pistol on you, can you?

83
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:37,965
Besides, the items that he's returning today

84
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:40,765
are things that another thief stole,

85
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,465
so he may just call it off, right?

86
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:46,065
What do you mean by another thief?

87
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:49,065
The three items that Thief Kid is going to return this time...

88
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:52,765
Ryoma's last letter, the blood stained goblet

89
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:56,065
and the pistol that he had in his pocket when he was assassinated

90
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,865
are all things that a woman thief

91
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,465
called Phantom Lady stole 20 years ago!

92
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:03,665
Who's Phantom Lady?

93
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:07,865
She was called the woman with 20 faces of the Showa era

94
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:09,765
and was a great thief who used horrific methods

95
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,965
to steal only from businesses and rich people

96
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,665
who were making money by evil means.

97
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,765
Therefore, she seems to have been really popular!

98
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:20,865
Well, she isn't as great as my Sir Thief Kid, though.

99
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:26,765
But, why is Kid returning the items that the lady thief stole?

100
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,365
How should I know?

101
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:30,165
Maybe they know each other?

102
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,365
After all, they're both thieves.

103
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:36,765
Oh, I got to go to the men's room again,

104
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:39,665
-so go on ahead without me. -Oh, okay.

105
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,865
Geez.

106
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:45,565
Look at the crowd of people here.

107
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,965
It's like a bargain sale or something.

108
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:51,765
Oh, Sonoko, are you all right?

109
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:53,965
Ouch...

110
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,565
Geez, who pushed me?

111
00:06:56,565 --> 00:07:00,265
Phantom Lady...

112
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:01,865
Found it!

113
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:04,565
I guess there's no mistake that Phantom Lady

114
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:07,665
was the one who stole the three items 20 years ago.

115
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,565
But, for some reason, after that one incident,

116
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,065
she stopped committing crimes completely.

117
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,565
Rather, even after that incident,

118
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,465
although she sent out advance warnings of crimes

119
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:17,865
and traces of her having broken in were found,

120
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:20,665
nothing was stolen.

121
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:25,165
The last thing she stole was Ryoma's pistol.

122
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:28,565
A 32 caliber 5 bullet model

123
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,565
with a length of about 17cm.

124
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:35,065
17cm is about...

125
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:37,865
This long?

126
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:41,565
June 24th, 1867.

127
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,265
The pistol is also mentioned in the letter

128
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:45,865
that Ryoma wrote to his older sister Otome on that date.

129
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,665
The length is about 3.03cm, capable of holding 5 bullets

130
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:51,065
and smaller than a dagger, but...

131
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:57,065
it can shoot people dead from a distance.

132
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,965
-You see! -Kid!

133
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,365
The door won't open!

134
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:06,365
Darn! He closed it using a stopper.

135
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,765
How'd you get that pistol through?

136
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,165
You mean you made it through the gate?

137
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:11,765
Yeah.

138
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:14,965
Removing the lead that was in the grip made going through a breeze!

139
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:16,665
It becomes really light too.

140
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:17,965
Well, but since they were in large numbers,

141
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,565
it wasn't that easy carrying them, though!

142
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,565
The lead in the grip?

143
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,365
In large numbers?

144
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:26,165
What're you talking about?

145
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:27,465
Let me remind you once more.

146
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,365
I just came to return items that were stolen this time.

147
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:33,865
So, don't you get in the way, famed detective!

148
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:35,565
-See you! -Oh, hey.

149
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:36,965
Hold it!

150
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:40,865
Darn!

151
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:45,065
Hey, are you sure everything's okay?

152
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:48,765
If Thief Kid is nabbed by the police...

153
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,365
Don't worry!

154
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:53,365
Let's believe in him who appears at most unexpected places.

155
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:58,065
If he makes a clean get away, we'll make a lot of cash again.

156
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:02,065
But, he's coming to return the items, you know!

157
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,665
No need for worry.

158
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:07,065
I've got everything thought out.

159
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:08,465
Say, mister.

160
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,465
What happened to you finger?

161
00:09:11,465 --> 00:09:12,965
Oh.

162
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:15,365
I was appraising a Japanese sword this morning

163
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:17,965
and cut my finger then...

164
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:30,265
Darn! He's already inside the exhibition room?

165
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:35,065
Where?

166
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:36,365
Where'd he go?

167
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:41,965
What're you...

168
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,365
Ran?

169
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:47,665
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:51,465
I figured you'd get squashed in this crowd.

171
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,265
But, at this rate,

172
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:56,065
it'll get even worse at the announced time.

173
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:57,665
Sonoko.

174
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,965
There's something on your right sleeve.

175
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,065
I think something's written.

176
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:07,065
One of the iron ones?

177
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,765
One of the iron ones?

178
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,465
Is it some kind of code?

179
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,465
Sonoko,

180
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:16,165
didn't you bump into something inside the exhibition room?

181
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:19,665
That's right,

182
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:21,065
somebody pushed me

183
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,965
and I fell to the showcase where the gunbelt was.

184
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:25,765
The showcase where the gunbelt is displayed.

185
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:33,165
Don't tell me that he's really going to make it rain

186
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,465
in order to clean this corrupted exhibition hall up.

187
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:44,765
Darn, Kid!

188
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:46,965
Where the heck is he planning to sneak in from?

189
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:49,265
Inspector Nakamori.

190
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:51,065
He may be capable of appearing at unexpected places

191
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:52,065
at unexpected times,

192
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:55,065
yet he couldn't possibly get through that metal detector gate

193
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:58,565
-while carrying a pistol. -Yeah, I'd like to think so too.

194
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:02,365
-But he... -If he were to break through the gate,

195
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:06,365
that pistol is a replica that he made,

196
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,765
is that it?

197
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:12,165
Of course, after all the three items are returned,

198
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:14,765
I'll have you appraise them, Mr. Hanamura.

199
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:15,865
Yes.

200
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:18,965
I sure hope that they're all genuine.

201
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:22,865
Never mind that, but I hope Ryoma's gunbelt is all right?

202
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:26,165
We did a final check of the exhibition cases

203
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:28,265
just before opening, you see.

204
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:30,765
If you like, would you like to go to the site?

205
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,065
Yes.

206
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:34,765
If the three items that are returned turn out to be fake

207
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:38,465
and the moreover, the gunbelt is stolen,

208
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,365
I wouldn't be able to take it.

209
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:48,365
It's getting to be crowded.

210
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:52,065
Only four minutes more to the time Sir Kid announced he'd be here.

211
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:53,865
Do you think we should start on our way inside?

212
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:55,765
But, with all these people here,

213
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,465
we may not be able to see Kid even if he appears.

214
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,665
Oh. Inspector Nakamori.

215
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:02,865
Uncle Jirokichi too!

216
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:06,165
Police! Please open the way!

217
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:07,465
Police!

218
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,865
Come on, let's go on in too!

219
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:12,265
I don't think you should!

220
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:16,765
Conan?

221
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:18,965
Why shouldn't we go inside?

222
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:21,865
Because, you don't want to get wet, do you?

223
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:25,865
I think Kid is really thinking of washing and cleaning here!

224
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:28,365
Darn! They're just too many people here.

225
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,565
We couldn't possibly guard this place safely.

226
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:32,965
What?

227
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:37,965
What's that?

228
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,065
Thief Kid!

229
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:52,801
Thief Kid!

230
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:57,301
He's standing on top of the gunbelt case.

231
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:59,601
Sir Kid is so fantastic.

232
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:02,701
He's gone through the metal detector and is unarmed!

233
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:05,401
-Nab him! -Yes, sir!

234
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:07,801
How dare you, Kid?

235
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,801
Clean up, my foot!

236
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:15,701
I'll get you and give you a good clean wash instead!

237
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:18,501
Yes. Clean wash.

238
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:22,601
In order to give a clean wash, water is needed.

239
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,801
So, starting now, right here...

240
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:32,501
Watch, I shall make it rain.

241
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,101
Rain?

242
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:36,901
What the heck is he planning to do?

243
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:46,801
That rat.

244
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:50,601
He used fire to set the extinguisher sprinkler off!

245
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:52,701
I shall be on my way, then.

246
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,001
Hey, hold it!

247
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,201
Weren't you going to return the three items in question?

248
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:01,601
This shower will bring everything to light.

249
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:05,101
As the rain shall wash away polluted water.

250
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,001
That rat!

251
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:12,601
He changed the water pressure of the sprinkler!

252
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,201
He's disappearing within the smoke of water...

253
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,601
Darn.

254
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,301
He disappeared?

255
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,501
That Kid!

256
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:33,501
He's going to mingle among the crowd and flee!

257
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,601
Hey!

258
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,201
How many people went outside where the gate is just now?

259
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:38,601
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:41,501
-There were about two or three people. -It's them!

261
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,601
Among them, nab the one who is drenched!

262
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:46,401
He's the Kid!

263
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:49,301
If he changed clothes inside that shower and disguised himself,

264
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:51,601
he should be soaking wet!

265
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,501
But...

266
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:54,901
it's also raining heavily outside too,

267
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:57,201
so most of the people are wet.

268
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,801
Then, look at his feet!

269
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:01,501
Go after the wet footsteps that left the gate!

270
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:06,401
But most naturally the floor is also filled with wet footprints.

271
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,601
What?

272
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:09,901
I see.

273
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:13,701
That's why he was waiting for a rainy day.

274
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,401
Then, what about the three items he said he'd be returning?

275
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,401
They're right here.

276
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:23,501
They're on top this gunbelt case.

277
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:28,501
Oops, the goblet's got my blood on it.

278
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:32,601
Oh well, but all three of them seem to be replicas...

279
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,401
So there should be no problem.

280
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:37,501
If there should be need for concern, it would be this gunbelt but...

281
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:41,701
The crime prevention device inside is destroyed!

282
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:44,401
Which means that the gunbelt that is inside is a fake

283
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,301
that Kid had switched for the genuine one! Darn!

284
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:50,401
He got what he wanted after all.

285
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,501
Huh?

286
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,601
Is anything the matter?

287
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:57,001
The explanation plate in the case.

288
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,201
Something's hanging from it.

289
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:00,701
Paint?

290
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:03,201
What? It's doubled.

291
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,501
I see!

292
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,801
A duplicate explanatory plate written in water color

293
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,901
was pasted on top of the one on the bottom and made

294
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:16,101
so that when wet by water, the words written below would emerge.

295
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,401
I see!

296
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:19,901
It was because my sleeve was wet with rain.

297
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,101
Yes.

298
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:23,501
The words on the explanatory plate of the gunbelt

299
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:25,401
rubbed off as mirrored image.

300
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,601
Yes.

301
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,101
And? What's written on it?

302
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:30,401
Let's see.

303
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:35,101
This gunbelt is super fake to begin with because...

304
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:37,601
Because it's been mass produced

305
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:41,001
taking into consideration the fact that it may be stolen.

306
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,301
That's right, isn't it?

307
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,901
The important thing is

308
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:46,901
the fact that it was stolen makes the news,

309
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:49,201
and that this is known the world over.

310
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:53,801
So, replicas of the item was made in large quantities to begin with,

311
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:58,301
then sold by a third party to rich Ryoma fans.

312
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:02,601
Telling them that it's the item that was stolen the other day!

313
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,301
The advantage of this method,

314
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:07,601
is that even if the buyer realizes that he bought a fake,

315
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,001
a complaint won't be submitted.

316
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:13,901
Because they feel guilty about having secretly bought a stolen item,

317
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,701
they have no way of making a case of it, even if they wanted to.

318
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,601
That's why the crimes that Phantom Lady committed

319
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:23,801
after stealing the three items didn't come into the light.

320
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:28,801
She probably only targeted the people who purchased the three items.

321
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:33,401
Phantom Lady gave you all the load fake items that she collected

322
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:38,201
and asked you to disclose the evil deeds of the two, didn't she?

323
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:41,201
She also told you that this crime wouldn't have been possible

324
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,501
without the host who exhibited the items knowing they were fake

325
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,201
and the corrupt appraiser who appraised

326
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:49,801
the items as being authentic joining hands.

327
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,201
Isn't that right?

328
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:57,301
Thief Kid disguised as Ryoma!

329
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:04,301
Hey! Is the thing written on the plate true?

330
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:06,601
No! That's just nonsense!

331
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:12,101
In the first place, where is the large amount of fake items anyway?

332
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:15,101
The only three items here are a plastic pistol,

333
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:18,301
fake goblet and a letter.

334
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,301
Inspector!

335
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:23,801
We have a gunbelt around our hips and a pistol!

336
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,201
There's one on my hips too.

337
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:27,701
What?

338
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:37,301
Taken from Mr. Tarumi's storage room, it says.

339
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,201
Darn, Kid!

340
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,801
He used the crowd to wrap the gunbelts around our hips!

341
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,401
I see.

342
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:48,301
He broke the crime prevention device to begin with,

343
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,301
and made it look to be stolen.

344
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:54,601
This time the scheme was to sell the gunbelt.

345
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,501
-Oh, well... -Inspector!

346
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,101
What is it now?

347
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,801
The paint of the other explanatory plates is coming off

348
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:03,801
-and words are appearing. -What?

349
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:06,801
It's written in great detail,

350
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:09,001
what and where of this item are fake!

351
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:11,601
Moreover, at the end of the letter it is written in English.

352
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,601
In English?

353
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:14,701
Pull.

354
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:18,501
Pull... pull down?

355
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:23,301
Does it mean to pull this hanging scroll?

356
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,301
What is it?

357
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,801
This is...

358
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,201
Ryoma's letter!

359
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:48,901
Moreover, many of the same kind of letters!

360
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:52,801
They seem to be complete replicas of the letter

361
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:55,601
that was found on the gunbelt case.

362
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:57,101
A trap!

363
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,401
This is a trap that Kid set up!

364
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,401
Sir!

365
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:05,401
You have no proof that we made them and sold them off.

366
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,701
Hey, Sonoko?

367
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:11,601
But, that's what's written on Sir Kid's plate!

368
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,301
To crack it.

369
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:16,301
Hey, what's this?

370
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:20,501
There is a large number of goblets inside!

371
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:25,101
Moreover, each of them seem to be stained with blood.

372
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:27,801
If we do a DNA check of the blood,

373
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:32,901
it'll be obvious who made the fake goblets.

374
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,501
Do you want to make it through by touching it

375
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,001
with your hurt finger like you did a while ago?

376
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:41,501
So as to stain all the goblets here with your own blood.

377
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,801
Well, I'm sure that if we check your storage room,

378
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,301
we'll come up with the items, no?

379
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:49,501
A heap of the fake items that you couldn't sell off.

380
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:15,501
Amazing that you figured out that I'm Thief Kid.

381
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,801
I'm no different from any other man around, am I?

382
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,601
Simple!

383
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:23,901
Even if the pistols are made of plastic,

384
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:25,001
they would become quite a load

385
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,001
if you have to carry a great number of them, right?

386
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,201
If you also have to carry a large amount of goblets

387
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:31,001
and letters at the same time, the more so!

388
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:35,001
That's why I looked for a thin person

389
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:38,901
from hip down who was mingled among the crowd!

390
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,501
And I found you, who had a whole lot of stuff stashed on yourself,

391
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:45,501
so you had to disguise yourself as a fat man.

392
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,201
Of course, since you're in disguise,

393
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,701
you weren't perspiring either!

394
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:55,801
I stuck a button type transmitter on the guy's thin ankle,

395
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:58,901
confirmed your location using these pursuit glasses,

396
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:01,301
and called out to you!

397
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,901
Well?

398
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:06,001
Do you plan to turn me into the police?

399
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,301
No.

400
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:12,201
In respect of Ryoma, I will let you go this time.

401
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:14,001
Are you a Ryoma fan?

402
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:16,301
It's Mom!

403
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:19,401
She played the role of Otome, Ryoma's older sister once

404
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:21,201
and is head over heels over him.

405
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:23,401
I see.

406
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:27,201
Well, she was said to be too cute to play the role of Otome,

407
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:29,701
and that's what triggered her popularity, though.

408
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:35,001
Well, but we mutually...

409
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:38,801
cannot beat our mothers.

410
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,501
See ya

411
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:48,701
Mutually?

412
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:52,801
Hey, don't tell me that Phantom Lady is...

413
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,701
Hey, isnt that Yuya Miyasaka?

414
00:23:57,701 --> 00:24:00,301
The actor that is said to have caused trouble when he was drunk.

415
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:01,801
Ready.

416
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,401
Action!

417
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:06,701
You idiot!

418
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,801
Punched... again...

419
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:13,601
Mr. Miyasaka is dead!

420
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:15,501
No!

421
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:18,901
Somethings... somethings not right.

422
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:24,601
