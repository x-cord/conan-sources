1
00:00:03,563 --> 00:00:05,363
Satan!

2
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:06,663
The devil.

3
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:08,963
What? The devil?

4
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:12,063
But there are still two keywords left.

5
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:14,363
It's still too soon to conclude that it's the devil.

6
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:16,863
But the remaining two are...

7
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:19,663
"A long-nosed wizard living in a castle"

8
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:22,963
and "Pierce through the white back with two swords." Right?

9
00:00:22,963 --> 00:00:26,563
They sound eerie even before looking for the keyword.

10
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:29,063
As for the long-nosed wizard living in a castle,

11
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,763
I've figured out where it is!

12
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:34,063
The long nose is the elephant!

13
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:35,763
Then, for the word castle...

14
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:39,263
There's a district called Elephant & Castle in London,

15
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:40,763
so will you try going there for me!

16
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:43,963
But, where do I go when I get there?

17
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:46,463
Well, I guess you can start with the station or something.

18
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,963
Okay! I'll try going to Elephant & Castle Station!

19
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,663
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

20
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:57,163
You must be true to yourself.

21
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:59,063
The target that emerges beyond the code.

22
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:01,063
Who is the culprit's target?

23
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,563
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,463
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:06,863
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:49,961
An eerie coded paper awaited us when we got to London.

27
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,661
It was a forewarning of a crime

28
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:54,161
that would be committed by Hades Sabara

29
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:55,761
a vicious killer who was on the run.

30
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,561
Each sentence of the code

31
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:03,461
indicated a characteristic building in London.

32
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,961
And in each place,

33
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:08,461
hints that appeared in Holmes' novels were left behind.

34
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:12,461
The hint was a letter of the alphabet one at a time.

35
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:14,561
We continued to decipher the code

36
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,661
and got hold of five letters.

37
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:19,461
There are only two more letters left.

38
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:22,561
You just wait, Hades!

39
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,561
I'll decipher the code at all cost

40
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:27,061
and prevent you from committing the crime!

41
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:36,361
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Code Break)"

42
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:39,061
"Elephant and Castle Station" -Well...

43
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:42,561
we came to the station and looked for close to an hour,

44
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:44,761
but we've come up with nothing!

45
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:49,861
Shinichi. Are you sure it's here?

46
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:53,861
Yeah. I'm sure the place is right, but...

47
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,461
It could be the shopping mall in the same district.

48
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:00,361
Hey.

49
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,261
That man...

50
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,861
He's been going back and forth

51
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:06,261
since we've come here, hasn't he?

52
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:08,061
True.

53
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:09,861
Hey, Shinichi!

54
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,461
The briefcase that the man is holding

55
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,461
has written in large letters the word "identity!"

56
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,961
That's probably...

57
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:21,261
"A Case of Identity", a title of Holmes' story,

58
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,061
with the Japanese title, "Disappearance of the Flower Lady".

59
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:26,261
Please ask that man.

60
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,761
It seems that he was paid by someone

61
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,761
who told him to stay in front of station

62
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:36,161
looking the same and walk around.

63
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,361
He says that the empty case and the clothes he's wearing

64
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,761
were all given to him by this person.

65
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:42,461
His clothes too?

66
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,161
When I look at a woman,

67
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,261
the first thing I look closely at are the sleeves.

68
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,261
In the case of men,

69
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,361
you should probably look at the knees of his trousers.

70
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,261
The knees of his trousers!

71
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,761
Look at the knees of the man!

72
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:59,161
Huh? The knees?

73
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:01,661
But there's nothing written there.

74
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:03,561
-Then, flip his trousers up! -What?

75
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,261
-What? -What are you doing?

76
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,861
Hey, hey. What are you doing here?

77
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,061
I found it!

78
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:11,261
On the back of the trousers by the knee part!

79
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,561
It's the letter "U"!

80
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:20,861
So, now we've got T, N, A, A, S, U.

81
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,561
The only code left then, is, "Finish everything off.

82
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:29,961
Pierce the white back with two swords." The last sentence.

83
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:33,561
The thing that bothers me is "the white back" and "two swords".

84
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:34,861
There aren't anything shaped like that,

85
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:37,161
or a building or place with that kind of name.

86
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:41,261
I see! It's this!

87
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:47,961
It's the mark of the porcelain maker!

88
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:51,161
"Pierce the white back with two swords"

89
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:54,061
was referring to the mark of the two swords on the dish

90
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,161
that is famous for its whiteness!

91
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:59,461
Then, are you saying that you want us to go to the store in London

92
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:00,761
where that maker's things are next?

93
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,561
Mother used to go to that store a lot!

94
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:07,261
Mother loves the dishes of that maker.

95
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:10,061
And there's only one store in London that carries things of that maker!

96
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:13,061
What? A strange decoration?

97
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,461
Yep. I asked the salesclerk and was told that

98
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:18,061
they were bothered because someone would come

99
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,161
and put a strange decoration on the sign of the store.

100
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,861
What kind of decoration is it?

101
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:26,061
There is a bell on the tip of strings of various colors.

102
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,661
There seems to be one letter on each of the bells.

103
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,261
There are words that look to be a title too

104
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:33,961
on the part where the strings are bunched together.

105
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,661
But it's soiled and I can't make it out.

106
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:38,861
The title is probably...

107
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:41,661
"A Study in Scarlet."

108
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:43,861
It's the very first novel,

109
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,761
that Conan Doyle wrote of Sherlock Holmes',

110
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:49,861
"A Study in Scarlet" -bringing him into this world!

111
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:52,061
Take the scarlet string from the bunch.

112
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,861
In other words, find a bright red string!

113
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:59,261
Holmes' dialogue in that story goes like this.

114
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:01,761
"There's a scarlet thread of murder

115
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:04,961
mixed among the colorless skein of life.

116
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:08,861
Our duty is to unravel it, isolate it

117
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:09,961
and expose every inch of it,

118
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:13,261
under the light of the sun as soon as possible."

119
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:15,661
I found it, the red thread!

120
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:17,761
The letter "R" is written on the bell

121
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:20,461
that's attached to that string!

122
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:23,261
If the "R" is the final letter, it means

123
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:31,161
that the keywords are the seven letters, T, N, A, A, S, U, R.

124
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:34,061
If the five letter make out the word "Satan",

125
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:36,761
what about the other two letters, U and R?

126
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,561
Hey, Shinichi?

127
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,561
It seems that only one "A" is necessary.

128
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:47,061
-Huh? -The order of the letters is...

129
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:53,761
"Saturn".

130
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,261
Planet Saturn!

131
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:57,061
Therefore, the culprit's probably

132
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:59,961
planning to do something on Saturday.

133
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,661
Saturday...

134
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:04,161
Hey, that's tomorrow?

135
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,961
Hold it...

136
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:07,361
If it were in Japanese,

137
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,661
I can see that you'd come up with the word "Saturday"

138
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,161
because of the kanji character used to write it,

139
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:15,561
but you don't write it like that in English, do you?

140
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,661
The etymology of Saturn

141
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:22,161
comes from the agricultural god of Roman mythology, Saturnus.

142
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:25,061
Saturnus' day became Saturday

143
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:28,661
and Saturnus is pronounced "Saturn" in English.

144
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:30,761
Is that so?

145
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:34,361
But, where on Saturday is it going to happen?

146
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,061
Apollo!

147
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:37,961
It sounds Apollo!

148
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:39,261
Mom!

149
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:41,461
How did you know I was here?

150
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:44,561
The solution of the code brought me here.

151
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:47,961
The last sentence might hint this boutique.

152
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,861
See, I told you so, Ares.

153
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:55,261
Yes, you deserve to be a Sherlockian.

154
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:59,261
Now, we are going back to the hotel!

155
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:02,761
Tomorrow, we are going to watch Minerva's game!

156
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,161
Not now!

157
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:06,261
Leave solving the code to us,

158
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:08,261
and you go home to your mama, sonny!

159
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,061
But...

160
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:14,061
Hey, your mother says we're all going to go cheer,

161
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:16,461
but if I remember correctly, weren't your mother's eyes...

162
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:19,461
She can't see, but she can tell by sounds!

163
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,861
"Juno Grass (45), MG's mother" -That's why mother always...

164
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,661
comes only to the finals!

165
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:24,561
She makes sure to come

166
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:25,961
"Ales Ashley (30), MG's ex-coach" -because big sis lost

167
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:28,161
at French Open Tennis Finals last year, since mother wasn't there.

168
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:32,261
Apollo, be an angel and jump in the car!

169
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:35,061
Though I broke all of the codes,

170
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:38,961
I can't find out what and where it will happen!

171
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,461
Of course, you can't.

172
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:46,461
Because you didn't break them.

173
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:51,561
Now, I gave you a chance.

174
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:56,961
It's your fault that you can't stop my final revenge

175
00:09:56,961 --> 00:10:00,561
since you couldn't read my revelations.

176
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:04,561
Curse your incompetence.

177
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:10,861
Holmes' apprentice is on your side, right?

178
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,761
He'll make it clear.

179
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,861
Holmes' apprentice?

180
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:20,861
No kidding.

181
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:26,201
"The following day" -Really, talk about easygoing...

182
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:28,001
Today is Saturday.

183
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:32,601
There may be a massacre somewhere here in London

184
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:34,601
and they go walking with their dog.

185
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,901
You notified Scotland Yard

186
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:41,601
that the code was deciphered to mean "Saturday", didn't you?

187
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,701
Yep. The seven code sentences

188
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,601
each indicate buildings or places.

189
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:52,401
And in every place one keyword letter is hidden.

190
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,901
When you connect the letters together,

191
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,901
the word "Saturn" came up, so it's Saturday!

192
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,201
I went on to explain that therefore,

193
00:10:57,201 --> 00:11:00,101
the culprit may be planning to carry something

194
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:02,101
out on Saturday, but...

195
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:05,101
I was asked which Saturday is it?

196
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:08,101
And the person hung up the phone after telling me

197
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,401
that unless I can give him what's going to happen where,

198
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,001
there's nothing he can do.

199
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:15,001
Didn't that detective kid say anything?

200
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:18,301
Shinichi said, he had to go investigate a different case,

201
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,601
so that he'd leave the rest up to us.

202
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:23,301
Leave the rest up to us...

203
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:25,901
I mean, we solved the last hint that was left to solve

204
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:29,901
and found out that something's going to happen on Saturday.

205
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:31,801
What else does he want us to do anyway?

206
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:37,901
Maybe the code isn't completely deciphered yet.

207
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:42,501
Because there's only one letter "A" in the keyword Saturn.

208
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:46,201
Maybe there's another reason why Big Ben

209
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,801
where the letter A was found, came out twice?

210
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:51,601
Conan! Is your cold okay, already?

211
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:54,801
Yep! Although I'm still coughing a bit...

212
00:11:55,801 --> 00:12:00,101
What's with this guy called Hades Sabara, anyway?

213
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:03,901
Why's he handing out coded warnings of a crime?

214
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,801
Maybe he loves the attention he's getting.

215
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:10,701
In the past when he bombed the hospital,

216
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:13,601
he also sent out a coded warning of the crime he was going to commit.

217
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,301
After he blew up the hospital,

218
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,601
it seems that he sent the police

219
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:20,501
a video tape of the scene and all.

220
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,601
He seems to have also included

221
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,601
a letter of explanation of the code back then.

222
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,301
I see.

223
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:30,201
It's like he's saying "catch me if you can".

224
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:33,601
If so, we'd better figure out the real meaning of the code

225
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,401
and report it to the police.

226
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:39,001
And we better be really careful!

227
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,901
At the time of the 2nd hospital,

228
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:43,001
the code was somehow deciphered

229
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:46,001
but the hospital seems to have blown up

230
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,901
right after the bomb squad charged inside.

231
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,301
What?

232
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,901
Which means that he's going to carry out whatever he plans to do,

233
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,501
whether we solve the code or not!

234
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:54,101
It seems that the video tape taken at that time

235
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:56,501
was also sent to the police!

236
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,801
They say that Hades' voice saying, "Too late"

237
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,801
was also included in the video.

238
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:05,901
That's why in order to keep him from carrying out the crime,

239
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:08,001
we've to decipher the code accurately,

240
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,001
secretly go over to the place indicated,

241
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:12,601
sneak up to him and then nab him.

242
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:16,001
If I remember correctly, the City Hall and Gherkins are...

243
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:19,601
standing confronting each other, with the Thames between them.

244
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,001
When you went to the place

245
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,401
that was indicated by the code,

246
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,401
didn't you see anyone suspicious?

247
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:27,701
A suspicious person?

248
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:29,101
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:32,301
there was a woman wearing sunglasses.

250
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:33,601
Could it be...

251
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:36,901
Did she look like this?

252
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:40,301
She's an expert on explosives that's helping Hades out.

253
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:44,001
I can't really say for sure.

254
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,401
I see! A balloon!

255
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:49,101
Maybe that Hades guy is planning to attach a bomb to a balloon

256
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:51,901
and let it fly off?

257
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,901
First, it takes off from the first Big Ben

258
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,901
that is in the coded sentence.

259
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,201
Then it'll fly by Elephant and Castle Station

260
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:59,001
that's mentioned in the 2nd sentence.

261
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,301
Then on to City Hall in the 3rd sentence.

262
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:04,201
After that, it'll cross the Thames,

263
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:06,601
pass through Gherkins in the fourth sentence,

264
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:09,001
over to St. Bride Church that is in the fifth sentence,

265
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,601
and go pass it.

266
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,501
Then, back to Big Ben in the sixth sentence.

267
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,601
Finally to the last sentence...

268
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,701
If a line is drawn from the store

269
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:20,201
that sells chinaware on Walton Ave...

270
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:22,401
See, look!

271
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:27,201
It looks just like a balloon!

272
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,801
Big Ben came out twice in the coded sentence

273
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:32,501
because a line had to be drawn in the order

274
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:35,101
as indicated in the coded sentence!

275
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:41,701
Rather, than a balloon... I think that's...

276
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:42,701
Don't tell me that...

277
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:46,201
Excuse me.

278
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:49,001
We're looking for this man. Have you seen him?

279
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:50,101
I'm sorry?

280
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:54,501
He seems to have entered the toilet that you came out of.

281
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:56,301
Who is this man?

282
00:14:56,301 --> 00:15:00,901
He's known to be the mass murderer terrifying the people in London.

283
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,901
And he seems to have changed his appearance to this.

284
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:08,801
Sorry, I haven't seen him!

285
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:10,901
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

286
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:15,501
Oh, he won't be around here.

287
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,001
Yeah, I guess so.

288
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,101
Incompetent fools.

289
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:21,701
Just as I thought,

290
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:24,601
nobody even comes close to my level.

291
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:32,201
It's a bit of a throw off that I get no resistance,

292
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:33,401
but this is the last thing I have to do

293
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,701
to take revenge for mother.

294
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,201
It's not bad ending it all quietly.

295
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:41,401
Yes, for my mother's sake.

296
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:43,601
I'll hush this place up.

297
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,501
This place that echoes with cheer.

298
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:52,701
This Wimbledon Center Court.

299
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,901
This...

300
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:56,501
Hades Sabara will...

301
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:01,301
What? A tennis racket?

302
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:03,601
-Not a balloon? -Yep!

303
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:06,901
It's true that it's a little crooked,

304
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:09,101
but it does sort of look like a racket.

305
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,501
Hey, hey. When you refer to racket in London...

306
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,201
The Wimbledon!

307
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:17,501
Minerva is competing in the finals today at 14:00!

308
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:21,401
But, wasn't the Wimbledon ruled out?

309
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:22,501
Yep.

310
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:26,301
If the culprit told all the children that he gave the coded paper

311
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,801
to that "Someone would die right in front of their eyes",

312
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:30,601
I thought it wasn't Wimbledon.

313
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,701
Taking into consideration that the police are not

314
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,701
on their guard of a massacre about to happen yet.

315
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:39,101
He probably relayed those words only to Apollo.

316
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,601
He passed out the same paper with coded sentences to other children

317
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,301
just to confuse the police.

318
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:48,001
If somebody's going to die in front of Apollo,

319
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:52,901
the culprit may be after the finals of the Wimbledon.

320
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:56,401
But, why is the Wimbledon?

321
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,601
Maybe it has something to do with tennis.

322
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,701
The culprit gave Apollo the paper with the codes

323
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,401
at the Wimbledon grounds too.

324
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:06,601
That something is maybe the bookie?

325
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:10,101
Hades' mother passed away of a heart disease

326
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:11,801
in July last year.

327
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:13,501
It seems that a month before

328
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:17,201
that Hades bet on a certain match through a bookie and lost.

329
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,401
Come to think of it,

330
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:21,601
Minerva lost at the French Open last year.

331
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:24,301
The finals back then was in June, wasn't it?

332
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:28,501
If I remember correctly, she won all the matches she entered

333
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:30,701
except for those she skipped because of injury.

334
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:33,201
So, if Hades tried to make just a little more cash

335
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,901
for his mother's surgery,

336
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:41,201
and bet a great sum of money on her sure-win game...

337
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:42,901
And if he lost the bet, lost a great sum of money,

338
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:44,801
and couldn't pay for his mother's surgery,

339
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:45,801
which resulted in her death...

340
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:49,301
Then, don't tell me that the culprit is after...

341
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,701
Grass Queen, Minerva Grass!

342
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,701
I wonder if she's okay.

343
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:10,101
Yep! She'll win for sure since you're here, mother!

344
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:12,401
But, are you sure you really don't mind

345
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,601
always sitting in the general seat here?

346
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:17,801
No. I don't like the family seats.

347
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:21,701
The TV stations will zoom me,

348
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,801
because they know I can't see the match.

349
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:25,701
If Minerva sees this while she's competing,

350
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:29,301
it'll distract her, wouldn't it?

351
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:31,601
Well, though it seems that

352
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:32,801
she always seems to find where I am,

353
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,601
by the time the match ends.

354
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:38,301
But it's really disappointing

355
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:40,001
that this match will be the last one

356
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,901
I'll be watching with you.

357
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:46,401
After all, I thought you were going to be my son-in-law.

358
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,701
I took your husband away from you,

359
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:51,301
and I can't possibly also take your daughter from you too.

360
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:55,001
Is it true that you're going to be someone else's coach?

361
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:59,601
Yeah. So it'll be difficult to see you all.

362
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,201
Well, it'll work out.

363
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,301
Your sister can work things out on her own

364
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,101
without me already.

365
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,901
Hey, hey.

366
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:10,001
It's after 14:00 already!

367
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:11,801
The match has already started!

368
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:15,601
But, what do you propose to do when you get to Wimbledon?

369
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,601
We don't even have tickets.

370
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:21,301
We'll just have to do something about it somehow!

371
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:23,301
Do something somehow...

372
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:25,201
How about it? Conan.

373
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,801
Did you get a hold of Apollo?

374
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:30,601
No. Maybe his cell phone is switched off

375
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:32,201
because he's watching the match.

376
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,901
Hello?

377
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:36,601
-Apollo! -Just what were you doing?

378
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:38,801
Not contacting me at all!

379
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,301
Sorry. Where are you now?

380
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:44,201
I couldn't talk in the spectator's seat,

381
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:45,801
so I came out to the corridor.

382
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,801
Since you're calling me,

383
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:52,901
did you catch the culprit who gave me the coded letter?

384
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,501
No, not yet.

385
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,701
Then, don't call me now!

386
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:00,001
I'm watching big sis play, you know!

387
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:04,001
And, did anything out of the ordinary happen over there?

388
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:06,201
Like somebody talking to you or something.

389
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,801
Yeah, the fans of big sis told me

390
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,001
to hang in there and encouraged me!

391
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,101
Everybody knows the faces of mother, Ales and I,

392
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:18,401
so I also got a big stuffed doll for sis!

393
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:20,601
How does your sister look like she's doing?

394
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,401
How she's doing?

395
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,601
Like always I guess.

396
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:27,701
The match has just started.

397
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:30,901
But, why are you asking those questions?

398
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,401
Don't tell me that something's going to happen here?

399
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,501
No, it's not that.

400
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:41,901
We decided that we wanted to watch your sister's match too.

401
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:44,401
Do you happen to have any extra tickets?

402
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,701
Extra?

403
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,601
"Wimbledon Front Gate" -Well, I guess not.

404
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,601
No tickets are available, I'm sure.

405
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:53,001
And we're already by the gate.

406
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,801
We know that a vicious criminal

407
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:58,001
is among the crowd inside and yet...

408
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:01,101
Darn it! I guess I just have to...

409
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:02,501
Hey, hey.

410
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:05,301
Oh, Sleeping Detective!

411
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:08,601
Are you here for the game?

412
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,901
Diana!

413
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:13,301
I forgot our tickets!

414
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:15,401
Can you help me with this?

415
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,701
How about this idea?

416
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,801
I see.

417
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,101
As long as we have admission tickets,

418
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,501
even though we can't get inside the center court,

419
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:33,201
we can watch the finals on this huge screen here!

420
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:36,001
So, this is the famous Murray Mound!

421
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:38,201
We were sure lucky though,

422
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:41,801
that Diana has influence over the Steering Committee here,

423
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,401
and was able to immediately get tickets for us.

424
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:48,001
Well, but as expected, we weren't able to push our luck

425
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:51,001
as far as to get tickets for the Center Court, though.

426
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:55,501
Who the heck is she? That old lady...

427
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:58,601
And, how's the match going?

428
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:02,101
It seems that Minerva's not in mint condition.

429
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,701
All her serves are touching the net

430
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:07,201
and she's losing with a score of 3-1.

431
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,401
Let!

432
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:13,301
First service!

433
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:19,501
Please... somebody...

434
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:24,701
Anybody, help...

435
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:27,501
Help me...

436
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:28,901
Holmes!

437
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:52,901
"Next Episode" -Huh?

438
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:55,201
Big sis is the target of the culprit?

439
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,701
Soon... Soon, mother...

440
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:02,301
There's no way that someone like you

441
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:04,701
would exist in this world.

442
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,501
A man like Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:10,301
I'll help you!

444
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:13,301
I'm Holmes' apprentice!

445
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:16,001
Holmes' apprentice?

446
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,501
Next Conan,

447
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:21,501
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Grass Court Queen)"
