1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Iori.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,949
Could we listen to that again to confirm what he said?

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,560
Of course, Momiji-ojosama.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,569
Do you really mean that, Heiji-kun?

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,250
Don't make me say it again!

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,590
If anything like that ever happens, I'll do whatever you want!

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,739
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,270
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,379
Momiji issues a mystery solving battle!

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,610
The treasure's location is written in code!

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,569
Always determining the one truth

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,339
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,970
his name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,180
"Ooka Momiji's Challenge, Part One!"

15
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,380
I'm home.

16
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,130
What should I make for dinner?

17
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,790
I already spent a lot this month, so I need to save money.

18
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,440
A coupon for jingisukan.

19
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,559
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.

20
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,250
We can build up our strength to fight the summer heat.

21
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,670
A text?

22
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,310
From M-Momiji-san?

23
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,820
"Dear Mori Ran-sama."

24
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,550
"This is Ooka Momiji."

25
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,489
I apologize for the sudden message, but I'd like Kudo Shinichi-kun,

26
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,939
whom I met in Kyoto, to decipher a code for me.

27
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,600
I've sent you pictures of the code.

28
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,469
A code?

29
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,969
Attachments

30
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:23,720
The treasure is here! From your football-loving mother

31
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,099
"A housekeeper who worked for a wealthy man

32
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,730
for many years passed away at his mansion the other day."

33
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,529
"Just before she died, she sent this code to her four sons."

34
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,609
Apparently she wanted to leave the incredible treasure

35
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,740
her employer gave her to her sons.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,469
She loved mysteries and sent each of her sons a different code,

37
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,750
so they'd have to work together to find the treasure.

38
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,859
However, after the brothers shared their codes with each other,

39
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,760
correspondence from the eldest son suddenly stopped.

40
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,389
Believing the eldest brother may have already solved the code,

41
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,869
and encountered some kind of trouble at the treasure's location,

42
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,619
the three brothers reached out to the wealthy man's family.

43
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,379
As the Ooka family has a relationship with them,

44
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,000
the family reached out to us to ask us to decipher the code.

45
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,999
I heard Kudo Shinichi-kun is a famous high school detective.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,059
I wanted to message him directly, but I don't have his contact information,

47
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:31,040
so I messaged you instead since we exchanged numbers.

48
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,479
"I happen to have plans to go to Tokyo today."

49
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,110
"I'll fill you in on the details today at 4PM on the Haido Chuo Building roof."

50
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,649
That's only three hours from now!

51
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,470
I need to call Shinichi right away.

52
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,110
But I'm still too embarrassed to speak to him directly...

53
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,459
I guess I can text him.

54
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,360
I have to send him the code anyway.

55
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,490
Summer vacation starts tomorrow!

56
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,729
Let's play tons of games at the professor's house!

57
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,979
Yeah!

58
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,499
Let's enjoy our vacation!

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,250
The treasure is here! From your football-loving mother

60
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,929
Conan-kun.

61
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,670
Huh?

62
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,539
Quit scowling and play games with us.

63
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,800
Yeah, sure.

64
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,289
It's all right.

65
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,300
He's currently engrossed in another game.

66
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,889
The game of deciphering a code.

67
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,310
Yeah, I guess.

68
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,749
Where'd you get that code?

69
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,679
Ran sent it to me.

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,899
Sounds like there's a story behind it.

71
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,059
Have you solved it yet?

72
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,820
No, I still have no idea.

73
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,969
What's wrong, Genta-kun?

74
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,139
Are you itchy?

75
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,939
I suddenly started feeling itchy after eating these crackers.

76
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,449
They're ordinary shrimp-flavored crackers.

77
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,330
Kojima-kun, do you ever feel itchy after touching shrimp or crab?

78
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,619
Huh? Everyone gets itchy from peeling shrimp.

79
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,590
Right?

80
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,179
No, not at all.

81
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,510
I don't get itchy.

82
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,909
Kojima-kun, you might be allergic to shellfish.

83
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,009
You shouldn't eat any more of those crackers.

84
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,259
What? But I love these!

85
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,769
No eating them!

86
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,980
How many did you eat?

87
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,789
First I had three, then I had two more.

88
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,240
Since one was taken from me just now, I've only eaten four.

89
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,969
Sounds like your addition and subtraction abilities need fixing, too.

90
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,790
Addition and subtraction...

91
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,830
What?

92
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,829
Uh, nothing.

93
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,590
Mori Detective Agency

94
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,090
Shinichi still hasn't responded yet.

95
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,350
I have to start heading to the Haido Chuo Building soon or I won't make it in time.

96
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,140
Maybe I'll call him after all.

97
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,059
I'm home.

98
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,270
Welcome back.

99
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,730
Shinichi-niichan called me.

100
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,730
What?

101
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,549
He said he's too busy to go to the Haido Chuo Building, so he asked me to go with you instead.

102
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,489
I'll go put my backpack away.

103
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay...

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,120
Why did he call Conan-kun instead of me?

105
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,520
Maybe Shinichi's too embarrassed to call me directly, too.

106
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,869
That tall building is the Haido Chuo Building, right?

107
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,890
Yeah.

108
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,490
Excuse me. You're Kudo Shinichi-sama's companion Ran Mori-sama, aren't you?

109
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,030
Come in.

110
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,900
Thank you.

111
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,120
Hattori-kun and Kazuha-chan?

112
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,870
What are you two doing here?

113
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,039
I could ask you the same thing.

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,009
Did Momiji invite you here, too?

115
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,409
Yeah, she did.

116
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,539
Does that mean Momiji asked Kudo-kun to solve a code?

117
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,170
Yeah, she did.

118
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,819
I knew it!

119
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,590
Which means this is a contest between me and Kudo.

120
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,430
What's going on?

121
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,450
This afternoon, at our school gate...

122
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,065
3 Hours Earlier...

123
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,519
It's finally over.

124
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,630
Heiji-kun.

125
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,449
Congratulations on finishing your first semester.

126
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,400
It's you, Momiji.

127
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,950
What's up?

128
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,160
I'd like you to do something for me, Heiji-kun.

129
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,210
I see.

130
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,840
I bet you're worried something might've happened to the eldest brother who solved the code,

131
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,090
so you want me to solve it and go check things out.

132
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,289
But the eldest brother probably ran off with the treasure

133
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,480
so he could keep it to himself, so there's no point in solving this.

134
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,530
I see.

135
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,979
So you can't solve it either.

136
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,939
I didn't say that!

137
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,490
I could solve this thing faster than anyone!

138
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,990
Anyone?

139
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,869
If there's a high school student who can solve this code before you,

140
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,500
will you do me a favor?

141
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,579
Sure, fine.

142
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,120
Heiji!

143
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,540
Do you really mean that, Heiji-kun?

144
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,709
Don't make me say it again!

145
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,880
If anything like that ever happens, I'll do whatever you want!

146
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,010
Iori.

147
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,380
Yes, miss. I recorded the audio.

148
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,890
I'll do whatever you want!

149
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,350
I'll fill you in on the details today at 4PM on the Haido Chuo Building roof.

150
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,209
4PM? That's just three hours from now!

151
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,849
Hey, Momiji!

152
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,820
It's all right.

153
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,619
We've already acquired tickets to Haneda for you.

154
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,040
That's not the problem here.

155
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,330
It's up to you whether or not you want to come.

156
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,670
But understand that if you don't, it will mean Momiji-ojosama wins.

157
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,229
After he said that, we flew here in a hurry.

158
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,789
Isn't that a bad thing?

159
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,430
Doesn't Momiji-san have feelings for Hattori-kun?

160
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,629
Exactly. She'll obviously ask Heiji to marry her.

161
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,939
Heiji said she probably wants to play karuta with him again like when they were kids, but...

162
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,699
I see. I was wondering why she asked Shinichi instead of Hattori-kun.

163
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,200
Anyway, Ran-chan, I hate to ask you to do this, but...

164
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,369
Could you ask Kudo-kun to let Heiji win this time?

165
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,869
Little Miss Leaf, don't you think that would be against the rules?

166
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,460
Th-That's Momiji's voice.

167
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,920
Where are you?

168
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
Kazuha-chan.

169
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,090
There's something on your collar. It looks like a brooch.

170
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,410
A mic and speaker?

171
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,769
He must've stuck it on me then!

172
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,489
Hey, Momiji!

173
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,350
It's all right.

174
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,730
Momiji's butler must've secretly attached it to me then!

175
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,409
Momiji, you're listening, aren't you?!

176
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,529
Quit sneaking around and show yourself!

177
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,800
In that case, perhaps I shall.

178
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,400
Come on, Momiji!

179
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,720
H-Hey, Kazuha-chan.

180
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,290
Isn't this circle drawn on the floor...?

181
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,200
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

182
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,200
I am Ooka Momiji.

183
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,049
Skip the formal greeting.

184
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,370
Fill us in on those details you promised us.

185
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,380
Those details are only a few additional words.

186
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,630
The message "From your football-loving mother" was written on the code,

187
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,919
but she apparently never watched a football,

188
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,000
or in other words, a soccer game once in her life.

189
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,629
Sh-She'd never seen...

190
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,280
...a soccer game?

191
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,530
Which means we should focus our attention on...

192
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,780
...the word "football" at the end of the code.

193
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,289
In the first three codes, the characters spelling "foot" are a little thicker.

194
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,900
But in the final code, the "ba" are a little thicker.

195
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,090
Why?

196
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,430
Huh? I don't see Kudo Shinichi-kun.

197
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,429
What happened to him?

198
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,310
I sent him the pictures of the code, but he said he was too busy to come,

199
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,189
so Conan-kun and I came in his place.

200
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,819
But doesn't Kudo-kun's absence give Heiji-kun a significant advantage?

201
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,400
It'll be fine. I'm on a call with Shinichi-niichan right now.

202
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,200
Seriously, why Conan-kun?

203
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,960
Fine, then.

204
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,550
Now that you have all the information you need to solve the code,

205
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,420
ready, go!

206
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,430
Please let me know once you've solved the code.

207
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,579
Whoever tells me the answer first will be the winner.

208
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:56,439
I'd like to remind you that a man's safety depends on you solving this code.

209
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,620
We'd like you to solve it as quickly as possible.

210
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,950
Additionally, in the event that Hattori-sama loses to Kudo-sama,

211
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,260
don't forget that Hattori-sama has agreed

212
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,450
to fulfill a request from Momiji-ojosama.

213
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,470
Yeah, I know.

214
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,460
Hattori, what's this about a request?

215
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,859
I'm sure it's no big deal. Don't worry about it.

216
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,050
Oh, really?

217
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,549
In that case, everyone, shall we get something to eat?

218
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,570
After all, they say you can't fight on an empty stomach.

219
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,289
But, Momiji-san, why are we starting in Tokyo?

220
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,019
Because before her death, the housekeeper who made the code

221
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,110
was working at a wealthy man's mansion located in Tokyo's Haido City.

222
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,499
I thought the treasure she received from her master must be in Tokyo as well.

223
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,119
Wouldn't it be hidden at the mansion, then?

224
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,130
Since it would inconvenience her master to have her sons search his mansion,

225
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,630
the housekeeper's letter said the treasure wasn't there.

226
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,630
Then maybe it's at the home of that housekeeper and her sons.

227
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,719
They sold their home when the housekeeper's husband passed away,

228
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,859
and it's no longer there.

229
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,189
After that, she put her sons up for adoption

230
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,520
and began working as a live-in housekeeper at the mansion.

231
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,839
After the four sons were separated as children,

232
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,059
they apparently haven't met once in 30 years.

233
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,410
Huh.

234
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,469
I heard only their mother the housekeeper

235
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,919
and the eldest son exchanged messages with the three younger brothers.

236
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,389
Then maybe some bad guy who heard about the treasure

237
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,969
pretended to be one of the brothers so he could swipe it?

238
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,430
I wouldn't worry about that.

239
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,839
Apparently the four brothers

240
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,680
have a rather obvious mark on the palms of their hands.

241
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,559
An obvious...

242
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,900
...mark?

243
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,379
It's a burn scar from when the four brothers were children.

244
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,519
A burn?

245
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,950
All four brothers?

246
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:12,179
Supposedly they were protecting their mother from a serious burn.

247
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,309
Huh.

248
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,950
Sounds like an honorable injury, then.

249
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,339
Excuse me, Ran-sama.

250
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,960
Yes?

251
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:25,229
Forgive me, but we've been walking for ten minutes and 30 seconds.

252
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,769
Have we still not arrived at our destination?

253
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,970
We should be there soon.

254
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,239
When I went with some friends the other day, it was really good.

255
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,970
That's it right there.

256
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,980
That pancake shop.

257
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,539
That store's pancakes are really good.

258
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,669
But there's a huge line.

259
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,979
Tokyoites are so patient.

260
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,990
We sure are.

261
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,189
It's normal to wait an hour in line at a popular shop.

262
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,439
No, Ran-chan. That's an insult coming from a Kyoto woman.

263
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,990
Huh?

264
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:59,299
What she actually means is, "look at these idle people wasting their time."

265
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,589
What?

266
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,249
It's not an insult.

267
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,130
I'm dropping a hint so she can figure it out herself before she gets hurt.

268
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,510
That's even more hurtful.

269
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,859
If only they'd add the time spent in line plus the fatigue from standing

270
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,520
and subtract that from the food's price.

271
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,610
Add...

272
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,160
And subtract...

273
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,649
Haido Harbor Warehouse 4!

274
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,460
What?

275
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,230
That's where the treasure is, Shinichi-niichan?

276
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,490
How did you arrive at that conclusion?

277
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,240
The key to solving the code was in the word football after all.

278
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,039
In the first three codes, the characters spelling foot were bolded.

279
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,250
The character for foot can also mean add.

280
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,849
When you lay the three codes over each other,

281
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,740
they form a series of odd characters.

282
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,680
But I can't read what it says.

283
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,180
That's why you need the arrows from the fourth code.

284
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,749
In the fourth code, the characters spelling ball are bolded.

285
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,690
Ba sounds like bow here, so you're meant to subtract.

286
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,699
made from overlaying the first three codes,

287
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,950
which turns them into characters we can read.

288
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,109
That's what Shinichi-niichan said.

289
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,650
Huh.

290
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:21,700
You're right.

291
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,710
It says, "Haido Harbor Warehouse 4."

292
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,409
In other words, we'll find the treasure if we go to Warehouse 4 at Haido Harbor.

293
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,309
Since both of them solved it at the same time,

294
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,200
doesn't that mean there's no winner of this contest?

295
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,350
Are you sure?

296
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,079
If Kudo-sama told Conan-sama the answer after solving the code,

297
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,610
and Conan-sama then explained it to us,

298
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,169
then doesn't that mean Kudo-sama solved it slightly sooner than Hattori-sama

299
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,110
who explained the solution after solving it himself?

300
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,119
You're right! Excellent observation, Iori!

301
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,269
No way. As soon as he solved the code, Kudo—

302
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,040
Yeah. I think Shinichi-niichan solved it a little quicker than—

303
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,259
Watch it, Kudo! I'll expose your true identity for real!

304
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,710
I'm kidding.

305
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,259
I unintentionally spoke at the same time as Hattori-niichan because his shouting surprised me,

306
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,340
but they solved it at basically the same time.

307
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,390
That's a problem.

308
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,600
Then how about this?

309
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,369
We'll head to Warehouse 4 at Haido Harbor.

310
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,599
Whoever determines why correspondence from

311
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,860
the eldest brother suddenly stopped will be the winner.

312
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,610
What's with you guys, anyway?

313
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,610
You didn't have these cars ready because you expected this to happen, did you?

314
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,620
The car behind us the girls are riding in is yours, too, right?

315
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,370
That will be revealed in due time.

316
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,750
Hey, Momiji.

317
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,630
It's a good thing the boys solved the code so quickly this time,

318
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,880
but what were you going to do if they couldn't solve it after you came all the way to Tokyo?

319
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,260
I don't know. What would I have done?

320
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,770
You hadn't thought about that?

321
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,270
Ah, you solved the code, did you?

322
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,550
Allow me to show you to Warehouse 4.

323
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,320
I see.

324
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,409
if they made it here and showed you the code.

325
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,280
Yes.

326
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,259
Did someone besides us show up?

327
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,040
A man with a beard showed up early this morning.

328
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,109
After him, another man showed up.

329
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,540
And just now, two men showed up one after another.

330
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,739
Four people came here?

331
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,479
Maybe it was the four brothers.

332
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,990
Yeah. They must've all solved the code.

333
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,430
We're here.

334
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,500
That's Warehouse 4.

335
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,190
Hello. Anyone here?

336
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,930
Seriously? If you're here, you should've said...

337
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,379
What's going on here?! Explain!

338
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,049
I-I don't know.

339
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,950
I came here at my brother's instructions and found him like this.

340
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,949
I also came here because I received a message from my brother.

341
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,460
M-Me, too.

342
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:17,460
Then you guys must be three of four brothers who received a code from their mother.

343
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,010
Which means the dead guy is the eldest brother.

344
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,769
Who are you people?

345
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:31,640
We were hired to solve the code in order to confirm the well-being of your brother.

346
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,999
Oh, right.

347
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,299
Mom worked as a housekeeper.

348
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,900
You're connected to the mansion somehow.

349
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,400
Do you have any idea why your brother ended up like this?

350
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,669
He probably lost his footing up there.

351
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,570
And then fell to his death.

352
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,630
We don't know if it was an accident or suicide, though.

353
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,059
Has anyone touched the body?

354
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,170
No, we haven't.

355
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,420
Then this wasn't an accident or a suicide.

356
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,169
It was a murder.

357
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,430
What?

358
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:08,690
And it seems like one of you three brothers is the culprit.

359
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,869
This is hardly the time for a contest.

360
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,349
Yeah.

361
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,440
No.

362
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,130
Wouldn't whoever arrives at the truth behind this case be the winner?

363
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,030
So he fell to his death.

364
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,120
We don't know yet if it was an accident or suicide.

365
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,240
It was murder.

366
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,240
What?

367
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,250
All three of them claim they came here because their murdered eldest brother texted them.

368
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:04,000
Normally you'd assume whoever arrived first pushed the eldest brother and killed him.

369
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,339
Who arrived first?

370
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,080
Well...

371
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:09,140
It was...

372
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,580
