1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,099
We went skiing at a snowy mountain in winter

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,100
and helped a car that was stuck on the road.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,699
The driver of the car, Kengo Ishibashi,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,999
later stabbed his passenger, Dr. Yokoyama to death with a knife.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,199
Ayumi happened to witness the crime being committed

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,299
while on a ski lift,

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,399
so The Youth Detective Squad

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,700
ended up being chased by the murderer Kengo Ishibashi.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,100
What's that?

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,899
It's a cabin.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,400
Thank goodness!

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,999
They've done it.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,199
Come on, let's go!

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,800
Yes.

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,900
Just you wait, you brats.

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,199
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,499
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,399
The culprit approaches within a blizzard and there is no escape!

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,099
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,999
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,900
"Whiteout (Part 2)"

23
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,099
We are looking for missing children.

24
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,899
Conan Edogawa, Genta Kojima,

25
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,899
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya and Ayumi Yoshida from Beika-cho,

26
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,199
please come to the main information centre.

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,799
Your guardian is waiting for you.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,499
It doesn't look like they are coming.

29
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,399
Goodness, where on earth have those children gone?

30
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,899
Should I make the announcement again?

31
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,499
Please do. If they happen to come by here later...

32
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,099
Of course, we will contact you immediately by phone.

33
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,599
Please don't worry.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,300
I will leave the matter to you, then.

35
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,999
The number you have dialled...

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Where on earth have they gone?

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,599
In the end, they're only kids.

38
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,199
They aren't careful enough to hide their footprints.

39
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,799
Excuse me, boss.

40
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,999
Are you sure you want those kids dead?

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,399
Are you saying you want me to turn back now?

42
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,300
After all, I've already killed another man.

43
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,999
Are we killing every one of them?

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,899
Yes. Don't leave anyone alive.

45
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,599
If we leave them buried under the snow with Yokoyama,

46
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,999
no one will find out until spring comes.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,799
Man, what a terrible thing to do the first thing after waking up.

48
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,399
If you two had caught them quickly,

49
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,899
we wouldn't have such a hard time now.

50
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,699
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,299
Let's hurry.

52
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,099
If we don't catch them before the snow turns into a blizzard,

53
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,000
the footprints will...

54
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,799
The footprints are gone.

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,599
This is...

56
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,299
The brats must have done this!

57
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,799
"Please contact me immediately. Agasa."

58
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,500
And send.

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,299
I hate to think about it,

60
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,500
but those kids must be involved in a kind of trouble again.

61
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,699
It's a little cold.

62
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,299
But still, it's a lot better than being outside.

63
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,699
Yes. But how long do we have to stay here?

64
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,399
We used our snowboard to help us cover our tracks,

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,299
so we should safe here for a while.

66
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,499
But we don't know how soon they'll catch up to us.

67
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,499
That said, we might get lost in the snow if we go out carelessly.

68
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,899
The weather might get worse soon,

69
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,699
so it's difficult to decide what we should do.

70
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,099
What do I do? Maybe I should move to another cabin on my own.

71
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,899
Or...

72
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,200
If only I could get a signal on my smartphone.

73
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,399
-The call went through! -What?

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,399
Come on. Dr. Agasa, please pick up.

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,999
-Hello. -Dr. Agasa, it's me!

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,599
-He picked up! -Yes!

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,699
Where are you now? Are you all right?

78
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,399
Dr. Agasa, the phone signal isn't stable, so please listen!

79
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,799
We're being chased by that Ishibashi guy and his lackeys!

80
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,299
What did you say?

81
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,499
We're being chased!

82
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,899
Please come and help us!

83
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,499
Please, Dr. Agasa!

84
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,100
Guys, shut up.

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,099
We're being chased because when Ayumi was on the ski lift,

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,499
she watched the moment Ishibashi killed another man.

87
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,499
Right now, we're in a semi-detached cabin.

88
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,599
The weather is getting worse. Call the rescue team right away.

89
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,899
Please say that again. I can't hear you.

90
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,199
The police! Please call the police and rescue team!

91
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,799
Ishibashi and his lackeys are hanging around nearby!

92
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,799
About Ishibashi...

93
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,399
-What? -I...

94
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,000
Dr. Agasa? Dr. Agasa!

95
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
It's no good. The call was cut off.

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,099
But you were able to talk to Dr. Agasa, right?

97
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,199
The phone signal wasn't stable,

98
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,699
so I'm not sure how much of the call went through.

99
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,199
So you're saying that help might not come for us?

100
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,699
Well, I can't deny that possibility.

101
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,899
No way.

102
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,599
I'm kind of getting hungry.

103
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,200
The blizzard is getting stronger.

104
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,599
Don't worry about it!

105
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,699
That's right! Things will work out somehow!

106
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,199
We're here with you!

107
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,500
Okay!

108
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,699
The blizzard's getting stronger.

109
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,100
Where did those kids go?

110
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,999
Let's get out of here.

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,699
Get out of here? In this blizzard?

112
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,099
Yes.

113
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,099
But why?

114
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,399
The first reason is that

115
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,599
the cabin may not hold up for much longer.

116
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,399
Honestly, I don't think it can withstand this blizzard.

117
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,999
The second reason is that they are coming for us.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,799
Third, we can use a landline phone if we go to the other cabin.

119
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,899
A landline phone?

120
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,699
That's right. When we were on the road to the ski area,

121
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,799
I saw electrical and phone cables extending from the other cabin.

122
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,999
With a landline phone,

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,699
we can make calls without worrying about phone signals!

124
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,599
That means we can call for help, right?

125
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,999
At the very least, there's electricity.

126
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,500
If we can make it to the other cabin, we can bear the cold.

127
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,899
We shouldn't sit around and talk anymore.

128
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,299
But we can't see anything outside.

129
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,200
It'll be all right.

130
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,699
Now I get it!

131
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,599
With this, we don't have to worry about getting separated.

132
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,299
Just as expected from you, Conan!

133
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,699
Still, there's a blizzard out there.

134
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,499
Let's be careful.

135
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,900
Yes.

136
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,199
It's a whiteout.

137
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,099
Oh, no! I can't see anything!

138
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,899
Everything is all white!

139
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,299
Conan!

140
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,999
Stay calm!

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,699
Use the rope and take each step carefully!

142
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
Got that?

143
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
Okay!

144
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,699
The other cabin is over there.

145
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,600
Let's go!

146
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,199
I can't see a thing.

147
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,900
It would have been dangerous if I didn't have the rope and my glasses.

148
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,000
Look out!

149
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,900
Oh, no, my glasses.

150
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,599
The rope has been cut.

151
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,499
Ayumi?

152
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,299
Genta?

153
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,100
Mitsuhiko?

154
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,699
Ayumi! Genta! Mitsuhiko!

155
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,299
If you can hear me, answer me!

156
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,500
Guys!

157
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,400
I can manage on my own, but those guys...

158
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,899
There's no caller ID.

159
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,099
Hey, kid.

160
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,399
Ishibashi?

161
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,699
I bet you're thinking, 'How did you get my phone number?'

162
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,999
You asked Dr. Agasa for it, didn't you?

163
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,799
It's not surprising at all.

164
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,199
You're such a cheeky brat. I'm coming for you, so you just wait.

165
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,799
And it's not just you.

166
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,299
I'll break your friends' necks too,

167
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,199
and bury you all under the snow.

168
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,099
You can be sure of it.

169
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,699
Even if you're clever, you're still just a kid.

170
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,199
There's only so much that you can do.

171
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,799
You're as good as dead, unlike me!

172
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,499
Kid! You're just a brat!

173
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,100
A weak little child who can't do anything!

174
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,299
Boss.

175
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,199
The call was disconnected.

176
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,499
How much more is that kid going to make a fool of me

177
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,399
until he's satisfied?

178
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,899
Gosh, the battery went out just as I finally got a phone signal.

179
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,499
I have to find everyone.

180
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,199
Think.

181
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,699
First, I have to find my glasses.

182
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,899
From the way it fell.

183
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,099
Calculate the distance by which it flew.

184
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,199
My glasses are over there!

185
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,099
Guys, can you hear me?

186
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't move! I'll make my way to you!

187
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,400
I must have hurt my leg.

188
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Wait for me.

189
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,499
My glasses should be around here.

190
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,899
Where is it?

191
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,399
Where is it? It should be right here.

192
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,700
I have to find it now, or everyone's going to freeze.

193
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Found it.

194
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,500
I have to hurry.

195
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,699
Hold on! What's going on now?

196
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,099
Come on, just for one moment! So fix yourself!

197
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,500
Come on!

198
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,000
Guys.

199
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm hungry.

200
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,799
It's cold.

201
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,699
If this goes on, am I...

202
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,699
Am I going to die?

203
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Somebody help me.

204
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Conan.

205
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,400
I can't take it anymore.

206
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,999
Ayumi!

207
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,799
Sorry, it took me so long.

208
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,699
Conan, I...

209
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,799
I had always thought you would come!

210
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

211
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,400
Sorry for making you wait, Genta.

212
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,500
You're late.

213
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,899
Mitsuhiko, you must have waited for quite a while.

214
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,100
This much is nothing for me.

215
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,500
It stopped working.

216
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,500
It's okay. Just have to go along this way.

217
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,699
There's the cabin!

218
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,999
We'll be able to get help!

219
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
We did it!

220
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,100
Now that we're here, things will work out for us.

221
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,100
All right, let's go inside and find a heater and a phone!

222
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,500
Conan!

223
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Look out!

224
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,100
Good. Let's go.

225
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,699
Hey, Conan!

226
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,399
Answer us!

227
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,500
Conan!

228
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,699
Conan! Conan!

229
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,099
Conan!

230
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,799
Answer us, Conan!

231
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,600
Conan!

232
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,600
"Okuyama Central Hospital"

233
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,899
Guys...

234
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,099
Where am I?

235
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,199
It looks like he has woken up.

236
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,499
This is the hospital.

237
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,199
Hospital?

238
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,599
Have you forgotten, Conan?

239
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,899
You were hit by a clump of snow and got knocked out.

240
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,599
Snow?

241
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,500
Was that it?

242
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,299
Dr. Agasa! What about the case?

243
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,999
What happened to Ishibashi?

244
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,699
-Ouch. -Look, you have to lie down.

245
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,499
You say that, but...

246
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,499
Don't worry about it. Dr. Agasa has taken care of everything.

247
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,599
I got a call from you,

248
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,499
so I thought things must have been pretty rough.

249
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,499
I called the police,

250
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,999
coordinated a rescue team and headed towards that cabin.

251
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,199
All of us carried you inside.

252
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,799
And we found the victim at the place Ayumi said it happened.

253
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,999
The police have also arranged for a wide-area search

254
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,299
for Ishibashi and his men.

255
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,699
And?

256
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,499
Don't worry, those three have been apprehended.

257
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,499
The rescue team found them in the mountains

258
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,399
while they were sheltering from the blizzard

259
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,300
and they turned themselves in on the spot.

260
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,199
Conan went back to sleep.

261
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,699
He must have been really tired.

262
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,299
Is he not hungry?

263
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,700
He worked so hard in that blizzard after all.

264
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,399
The culprits have all been apprehended.

265
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,799
Thank goodness for that.

266
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,099
Yes, while I was asleep.

267
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,699
Apparently, the two accomplices

268
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,999
were Ishibashi's subordinates at his workplace.

269
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,399
They revealed a lot so that they could get lesser sentences.

270
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,599
Goodness, someone gets killed over medicine

271
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,800
that's supposed to save people.

272
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,999
Not again.

273
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,400
What do we do, Dr. Agasa?

274
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,599
Well, by all rights, I'd want to avoid trouble.

275
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,800
But let's help them.
