1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:01,995
Speed!

2
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:04,095
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:05,795
Our car with three of us inside was rigged in a way that

4
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:07,495
it would explode if the speed is reduced!

5
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:08,895
What're you going to do, Pops?

6
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:10,395
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:11,895
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:14,095
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:57,492
"Chasing rabbits in the mountains"

10
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,392
"of my homeland."

11
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:05,392
"Fishing on a small boat"

12
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:09,592
"in the river of my homeland."

13
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:14,592
Ran. How much more is there to go

14
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,992
before we reach the hot spring we're headed for?

15
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:18,892
Just about 100 km more.

16
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:22,592
We've only driven 10 km so far.

17
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,492
Dad! You've been asking the same question every five minutes.

18
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:27,192
I don't mind you being super happy.

19
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:29,692
But please watch out not to speed so much.

20
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:33,692
I know. Today sure is a nice day.

21
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:36,892
Bathing in a hot spring.

22
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:39,992
Delicious food, good liquor.

23
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:43,192
Moreover, we get to enjoy all of it at half price!

24
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:52,992
I'd like to speak to Inspector Megure

25
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:56,292
of MPD First Investigation Division.

26
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:57,892
Dad...

27
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:02,392
-Ran, will you answer it. -Okay.

28
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,492
Who is it from?

29
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:05,992
Let's see. Inspector Megure?

30
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:07,992
Inspector Megure?

31
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:11,292
-Hello. -Mouri! Where are you now?

32
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,792
In Takaoka-cho.

33
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:14,992
This is Ran.

34
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:18,292
I'm in the car together with Conan and dad.

35
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:20,692
Ran? Takaoka-cho?

36
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,992
Their present location is Takaoka-cho!

37
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:25,092
What does the Inspector want?

38
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:26,392
Well...

39
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:27,792
Listen, Ran.

40
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:28,992
Yes.

41
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:31,092
Stay calm and listen.

42
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:33,892
The car that you're riding in now is...

43
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,192
An explosive device is rigged onto it!

44
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,392
An explosive device?

45
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:42,392
What?

46
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:44,092
Ran!

47
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:47,592
If the car that you're in now go further than 10 km,

48
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,792
the switch of the explosive device will turn on.

49
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:52,792
Ten km?

50
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:01,292
Then the switch has already...

51
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,392
The car...

52
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:06,792
Don't stop the car!

53
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,192
Keep going the way you are!

54
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:13,692
Once the car reduces speed to below 20 km/h...

55
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,392
it'll explode!

56
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:17,892
It seems that a device that works that way is rigged to the car.

57
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:26,092
"Rental Car Goes Out of Control"

58
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:35,592
But, Inspector, maybe someone's just playing a prank.

59
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:44,392
The culprit says that he will first blow up the water tower.

60
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:48,292
So as long as we haven't confirm whether or not this warning is true,

61
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:51,792
it's better to think that a real explosive device is attached.

62
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,892
An explosive device.

63
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:56,392
A bomb.

64
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:00,892
A time bomb is rigged so that when Pops goes by, it will explode.

65
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:03,092
This is a demonstration to show.

66
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:08,392
That was done to prove this wasn't a lie.

67
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,292
It's a demonstration

68
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:14,092
from the culprit who set the bomb to this car.

69
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,492
Mouri?

70
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,192
Mouri!

71
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:30,492
Don't worry.

72
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:32,092
Just stay calm and drive on.

73
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:36,892
I've deployed an emergency squad just now.

74
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:42,092
We're counting on you.

75
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,992
We'll catch up with you soon too.

76
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:07,992
And Inspector, about the culprit...

77
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,692
All right, I'll tell you now.

78
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:15,092
Just a while ago, I got a call from a man who called himself Sugiyama.

79
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,992
It's most probably an alias, though.

80
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:20,492
He said that he rigged an explosive device

81
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,592
to the car that Kogoro Mouri rented.

82
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:25,592
Do you have any idea who this Sugiyama could be?

83
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:26,792
Sugiyama.

84
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:34,392
The name of the worker at the rental car company was called Sugiyama.

85
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:37,492
That man introduced

86
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:40,792
this half price discount hot spring campaign we're headed for today.

87
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,692
But why me?

88
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:45,892
He says that if he kills you, a famed detective,

89
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:48,592
he would be famous as well.

90
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:50,492
I thought it may be a prank.

91
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,792
But he's aware of your moves.

92
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,792
And he did blow up the water tower.

93
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,492
So, we've no choice but to subject to his orders.

94
00:06:58,492 --> 00:06:59,992
Orders?

95
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:01,392
Sugiyama is saying

96
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,892
he wants you to take the expressway.

97
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:06,292
Expressway? What's his purpose?

98
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,592
I don't know.

99
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:08,992
Until we get a hold of the situation,

100
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:10,492
please do as he says.

101
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,092
All right.

102
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:13,792
The culprit disclosed his name

103
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:17,092
and ordered the car to take the expressway.

104
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:20,792
Could there be a reason for the culprit having chosen today too, then?

105
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,192
Report on the circumstances on the road block

106
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:30,992
near the Takaoka ramp of the expressway.

107
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:36,192
The east intersection of the expressway toward Takaoka is now closed.

108
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:40,392
Likewise, roads leading to Takaoka-cho have been blocked.

109
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:44,392
Route eight leading to the Takaoka ramp has been blocked

110
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:46,892
and a detour has already been secured.

111
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:51,892
All the sidewalks near the respective roads have been blocked off.

112
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:57,192
Confirmation of all roads that have been blocked is completed.

113
00:07:57,192 --> 00:08:00,592
The detour to the expressway has also been set.

114
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:01,792
Roger.

115
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:06,992
Mouri! We have visibly confirmed your car.

116
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,692
Starting now a speed cop on a white motorbike will lead your car along.

117
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,092
Got it!

118
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,992
Ran, Conan.

119
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:25,192
The Inspector come to help us.

120
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,392
The police will handle this matter for us.

121
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:28,692
So don't worry.

122
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:30,392
Okay.

123
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:34,192
Kogoro Mouri. Writhe in agony!

124
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:37,892
I'll watch you suffer for a while, then kill you.

125
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,892
You gotta be kidding!

126
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,692
What's up, dad?

127
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,292
Gas.

128
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,892
We only have less than half left!

129
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:55,492
I'm sure it was on full when we rented this car.

130
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:56,692
Darn it!

131
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:58,892
He made us confirm the tank once

132
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:00,992
and after we checked, he drained the gas out just before we left.

133
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:04,292
Don't worry! I'll get you two out of this car

134
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:06,892
before we run out of gas.

135
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:09,592
Mouri, let's get the two out of the car first.

136
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,892
Open the window, please.

137
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:13,492
It won't open!

138
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:16,992
The door won't open either!

139
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:18,992
Ran, what about that side?

140
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,492
This side is no good either.

141
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:26,392
Darn it! He broke it beforehand.

142
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,592
The gas is less than half.

143
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:33,892
If we go at 20 km/h which is the minimum speed,

144
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:35,892
we've got to maintain we may at most keep for an hour.

145
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:39,392
Once we run out of gas, the car will stop and explode.

146
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:45,092
The windows and doors cannot be opened from inside.

147
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:46,192
What now?

148
00:09:47,392 --> 00:09:48,492
This is Megure.

149
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:50,392
Officer Takagi, where are you now?

150
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,992
I'm approaching the merge!

151
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,592
Inspector Megure, sorry to keep you waiting!

152
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,392
I'm counting on you, Takagi.

153
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:13,592
Good! Keep this position!

154
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:14,692
Roger!

155
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,592
I'm counting on you.

156
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:18,792
Takagi.

157
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:24,292
Conan. Let's back off from the window.

158
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:31,892
Even if the glass is successfully cracked

159
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:34,092
and Ran and I get to evacuate from the car.

160
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,392
What about Pops?

161
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:38,892
If he takes his foot off the accelerator when escaping,

162
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,492
the car will reduce speed.

163
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:46,092
What should I do?

164
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:51,192
While maintaining the speed at over 20 km/h,

165
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,592
will anything work?

166
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:54,792
The position of the tires!

167
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,092
The position of the tires are falling out of line!

168
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,692
Back the car off a bit!

169
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,692
Okay!

170
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,392
Tires...

171
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:04,692
Spin.

172
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,592
Tires!

173
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:07,992
Stop without stopping.

174
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,892
That's it!

175
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:22,892
Yes, we've got to do it. In order to do it...

176
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,892
Ran! Conan!

177
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,392
Officer Takagi, hurry and help us! I'm scared!

178
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:28,992
Hold on, Conan.

179
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,292
Okay!

180
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:32,792
I'll pull you out right now!

181
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,792
Darn it!

182
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:43,992
Conan!

183
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:49,792
Are you all right, Conan?

184
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,992
Okay, once more!

185
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:54,592
-It'll be okay. Stay calm. -Okay.

186
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,492
They rescued one person.

187
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:09,192
Well...

188
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,692
Only 10 minutes before the car runs out of gas.

189
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,192
That's the time Mouri dies.

190
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:16,692
We've safely secured Conan!

191
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:20,492
Next, we'll work on getting Ran out!

192
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:22,592
Oh, no! Inspector Megure!

193
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:26,392
Bad news! The car is approaching a jammed area several km away.

194
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:30,692
A space enough to let one car through has been secured

195
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,392
but going pass while moving is impossible.

196
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:34,492
We may have to drop rescuing while the car is moving!

197
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:35,992
Please stop the rescue procedure!

198
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,192
Ran! Hurry!

199
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,192
-Ran! -Quick!

200
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:56,292
Ran!

201
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,992
No good, can't do!

202
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,392
No good!

203
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:03,192
Takagi, get way! Hurry!

204
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:16,392
Ran.

205
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:18,092
Mouri.

206
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,392
Inspector!

207
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:21,792
Pops said...

208
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:43,481
Ran.

209
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:47,181
Cover your head with my jacket.

210
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:49,781
And after you jump out, get down right away.

211
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:53,181
You may get hurt but it's better than losing your life.

212
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:55,081
You can do it.

213
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,781
But what about you, dad?

214
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:59,081
First priority is for you to be saved.

215
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,681
Listen to me, I'm your parent.

216
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,881
Mouri?

217
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,681
Can you hear me, Mouri?

218
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:16,581
Just a while more.

219
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:19,181
Just a little while more, big brother!

220
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:21,281
Ichiro Matsumiya?

221
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,481
Yes.

222
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:25,181
The case that you and I were after.

223
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:28,481
The culprit who killed his girlfriend who fell out of love with him.

224
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,281
He was being pursued by us

225
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:33,281
and sped his motorbike along the expressway.

226
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:36,281
He crashed into a fence at the turn off and died

227
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:37,981
three years ago today.

228
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:42,881
But, didn't he commit suicide?

229
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:45,681
Matsumiya had a younger brother that was staying in the U.S.

230
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:47,181
as a student back then.

231
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:48,781
If he thinks that we were responsible

232
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,681
for his older brother's death

233
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,481
without knowing of all that happened then...

234
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:56,981
No. He has a grudge against us because of a misunderstanding?

235
00:14:56,981 --> 00:15:00,581
We're looking for the whereabouts of Matsumiya's younger brother now.

236
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,881
We'll take custody of him soon.

237
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,281
And...

238
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:06,081
how's the gas tank?

239
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,881
It's practically on empty.

240
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:12,081
I wonder how much longer it's going to hold up.

241
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,081
Ran.

242
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,281
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:20,581
I got you messed up in this because of me.

244
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,581
You can do it.

245
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,181
Hurry up and go!

246
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:26,681
Dad.

247
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:39,181
Stupid! Get out of my way!

248
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,781
Don't come near me!

249
00:15:45,581 --> 00:15:47,781
Kogoro Mouri.

250
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,981
The time for us to part is about to come.

251
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:54,081
That tunnel will be your grave!

252
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:48,581
I did it...

253
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:51,081
I killed Kogoro Mouri.

254
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,781
I avenged my brother's death.

255
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:54,081
Big brother!

256
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:03,481
Where are you going?

257
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:08,081
I'm Megure from the Metropolitan Police Department.

258
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:10,681
You're Mr. Jiro Matsumiya?

259
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:18,181
I checked the cases having to do with the expressway

260
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:21,681
three years ago today that involved Kogoro Mouri

261
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:25,581
and found the case involving your older brother, Mr. Ichiro Matsumiya.

262
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:27,881
And thus, found you, Mr. Jiro Matusmiya.

263
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,881
That's how we got to you.

264
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,581
So, what?

265
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:36,781
There is suspicion that the Public Roads Administration's security

266
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:39,881
was hacked by the computer at your residence today.

267
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:42,481
We'd like to ask you questions on it.

268
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,481
So please come with us to the station.

269
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,381
What's the matter?

270
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:52,581
Mr. Sugiyama...

271
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,881
No, Mr. Matsumiya.

272
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:57,781
You look like you've seen a ghost or something.

273
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:59,181
Why?

274
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:00,381
Why are...

275
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:02,081
why are you alive?

276
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:07,181
I'm alive and kicking as you can see.

277
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,181
It was set to explode when the car stopped.

278
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:14,681
The car's still running while gas is being pumped into it.

279
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:15,681
It's only a matter of time

280
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:17,981
until the bomb disposal squad removes the explosive device.

281
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:20,081
How?

282
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,981
The device is on the back of the body of the car!

283
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,981
There's no way it can be removed!

284
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:28,481
The car isn't stopped but still running.

285
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:44,381
They're working to remove the explosive device right now.

286
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:48,681
The speed is being maintained at 20 km/h.

287
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,181
When on earth...

288
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:54,581
What about that explosion?

289
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:58,381
Yeah. In that tunnel...

290
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:07,781
On the bed of a large truck

291
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:11,481
and by the bomb disposal squad that was in the tunnel beforehand.

292
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:14,481
A slope was used, a net was hooked up.

293
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:17,181
All set!

294
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:24,881
The car that I drove was lead onto a large truck.

295
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,881
The car that is on the truck was stopped by the net

296
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,881
and the tires are still spinning on rollers.

297
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:42,081
Afterwards, the bomb disposal squad were able to move in and rescue Ran

298
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,181
and keep supplying gas to the car.

299
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:47,181
They opened the door on my side

300
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:49,481
and fixed the accelerator in place.

301
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:59,281
Like so, the car is stopped but the tires are still spinning.

302
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,881
Thus, the explosive device can be removed.

303
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:05,081
A smoke candle and fireworks were used...

304
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:06,481
Fire!

305
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:11,081
We rigged it so that it would look like the car exploded.

306
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:12,881
No way.

307
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,981
It can't be.

308
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,381
Darn it!

309
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,681
If you guys didn't chase my brother too far.

310
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:22,481
He didn't have to die.

311
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:24,281
Just what're you talking about?

312
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:27,281
Your brother committed suicide.

313
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,581
Wrong!

314
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:31,781
Brother was killed by all of you!

315
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,881
My older brother was not such a weak person that would commit suicide!

316
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,481
There were no brake traces at the scene

317
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,381
where your brother crashed.

318
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:43,181
Moreover, he took off his helmet and threw it down

319
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:45,481
just before crashing into the fence.

320
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,381
He was determined to die.

321
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:48,681
No.

322
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:49,981
Matsumiya.

323
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:51,981
It's your biased perception.

324
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:56,281
Besides, do you think your dead brother is happy about what you did?

325
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:57,981
Shut up!

326
00:20:57,981 --> 00:21:02,281
Matsumiya. Unlike your brother, you're a lucky guy.

327
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:05,081
Nobody's dead.

328
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:09,781
You're not a killer.

329
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:13,481
Mouri.

330
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:17,481
Well, lucky you found out the truth. I'm glad.

331
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,081
Mr. Mouri.

332
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,881
Well, it sure was a surprise.

333
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:07,081
That the driver of that huge truck was Officer Sato.

334
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:11,481
Yes, it was me!

335
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:14,081
There's nothing to be surprised of, is there?

336
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:17,881
After all, you're the one who gave us order of what to do through Conan.

337
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:22,281
What's the matter, dad?

338
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,581
We've got to hurry to the hot spring!

339
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:26,681
Why don't you go again some other day?

340
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:30,381
No, the half price discount sale is just for today!

341
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:35,481
Maybe that was just a made-up story to get us to ride the car.

342
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,981
No way!

343
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:40,681
Maybe only that part is true.

344
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:42,981
So, Inspector Megure.

345
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:45,381
Could you lend us a police car?

346
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:48,981
You idiot! Just what're you talking about?

347
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:50,681
Well, you know...

348
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:53,181
You've really got a great personality, Pops.

349
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,181
"Next Episode"

350
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:00,881
Okay, let's go to the library then.

351
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,681
Oh, wait!

352
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,881
Shinichi.

353
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,881
It won't open!

354
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:20,881
What?

355
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:26,781
Next Conan, "The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 1)"

356
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,281
Next Conan's Hint:

357
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:46,681
"Shinichi Kudo's younger brother"

358
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:47,981
The next episode will be about 10 years ago.

359
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:49,481
Which means you're not in it, right, Conan?

360
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:51,681
-But Shinichi was. -Right?
