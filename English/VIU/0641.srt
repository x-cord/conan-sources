1
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:04,297
We visited Okayama.

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:06,497
We encounter a woman there who has amnesia

3
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:08,722
and end up helping to find out her identity.

4
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:11,597
The clues that we have to go on,

5
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:13,597
are the 8 sketches that she drew.

6
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:18,297
After we started investigating,

7
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:20,697
we ran into a friend of hers,

8
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:23,297
Ms. Kanae Nonomiya, who had also been looking for her.

9
00:00:23,297 --> 00:00:24,697
"Kanae Nonomiya (25)" -According to Kanae,

10
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:27,697
we find out that the woman's name is Mayuko Kichise.

11
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:30,697
We also found that Mayuko was an eye-witness who could prove

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,897
that Kanae's older brother who was arrested as a suspect

13
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:34,697
"Keigo Nonomiya (28)" -of a robbery case was innocent.

14
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:36,797
Unless Mayuko regains her memory,

15
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:38,697
it's impossible to prove that he was just a scapegoat.

16
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,097
While investigating

17
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:44,297
we find that Mayuko's room has been ransacked,

18
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:47,397
or that there's suspicious figure following us around.

19
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,997
We couldn't help but smell smoke.

20
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:53,097
Amidst all this, Mayuko's whereabouts become unknown.

21
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:56,197
No good. Mayuko's life is in danger.

22
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,297
Like the fog clears.

23
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:02,797
Let's see through love and crime as well.

24
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,597
Lost memory returns.

25
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,797
At the end of the trip through Okayama and Kurashiki.

26
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:08,297
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:10,197

28
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:12,497

"Memory Trip of the Eight Sketches (Kurashiki Part)"

30
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:08,991
No!

31
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,591
Help, somebody!

32
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,291
Go get him!

33
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,491
Ms. Mayuko.

34
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,691
Ms. Mayuko, are you all right?

35
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:32,191
Ms. Mayuko.

36
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,191
It's dangerous, we should call the police

37
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:39,191
and have you taken into custody after all.

38
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:42,191
But, I can't possibly trust the police

39
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,691
who have the nerve to arrest

40
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,691
my older brother who is innocent.

41
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:49,891
Yes, so... please let us continue as is.

42
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:53,791
Thank you, Mayuko.

43
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,191
I'm sure that brother would...

44
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,591
I'm not doing this only for your older brother.

45
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:00,591
I feel so wretched.

46
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,591
While I was crying myself out,

47
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:05,991
not being able to remember the past, all the pain,

48
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:08,391
I felt so lost, then suddenly the past overwhelmed me.

49
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:11,991
I felt sort of vexed.

50
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:15,991
I'm going to get my memory back no matter what it takes.

51
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,991
I understand.

52
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:21,191
I admire Mayuko.

53
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,891
I'll bet she's actually a very strong person.

54
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:29,991
You've come to visit a friend here?

55
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,791
Another coincidence.

56
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,391
We really synch, don't we?

59
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,591
Thank you very much.

60
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:46,491
I'll be going then.

61
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:47,591
See you.

62
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,891
Is something the matter?

63
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,491
That man looks familiar.

64
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:56,491
Really?

65
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:58,891
Of course.

66

To all local sweet fans here

00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,691
he's considered their God.

68
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:04,791
Our company did a special on him too.

69
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:08,091
"Charisma Pastry Chef, Kenzo Taira" -See.

70
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,391
Is he Mr. Taira?

71
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,191
"Teruyuki Nashita (35)" -Yes, he looked so different

72
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:14,491
that I was surprised, though.

73
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,891
We only have 5 more sketches to go.

74
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:22,991
I wonder what place this indicates?

75
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,991
I have no idea...

76
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,991
I just realized,

77
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:34,591
but could this be referring to the sounding boiling pot reading?

78
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,491
Sounding boiling pot?

79
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,791
The sounding boiling pot reading

80
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,391
is a ritual in this Kibitsu Shrine

81
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,691
that has been passed down from ancient times.

82
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,991
By drawing upon the length

83
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,391
and loudness of the rice that is boiling in the pot,

84
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,891
good or bad fortune is predicted.

85
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:58,291
Ms. Mayuko, could it be...

86
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,291
You regained your memory?

87
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,991
Quiet.

88
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,991
You're the one who...

89
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,691
Do you know her?

90
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:11,891
I don't know why I cried.

91
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:15,491
Maybe she had a sounding boiling pot reading done before?

92
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,891
Yes, three days ago.

93
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,691
That's a day before the robbery.

94
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:22,691
Didn't she mention anything?

95
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:24,391
Well...

96
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:29,691
I want to start over from scratch by getting rid of my past.

97
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,391
I want to really stand on my own two feet this time.

98
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,291
It seems you went on an introspective walk here

99
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,191
and there around Okayama,

100
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:39,191
the place where you were born and raised.

101
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:43,791
I see. Now I understand why she visited the places that she sketched.

102
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,591
We received more postings on our website again.

103
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,991
She was witnessed in Kurashiki too.

104
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,391
We immediately moved on to Kurashiki.

105
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:57,391
"Kurashiki Grillwork"

106
00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,791
This drawing...

107
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,491
Isn't this the grillwork of that window?

108
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:06,391
I see, it was a drawing of Kurashiki grillwork.

109
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,391
Kurashiki grillwork?

110
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,691
It's a design exclusive of Kurashiki.

111
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:13,491
You can see a lot of it if we go to the Bikan Historical District.

112
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,191
Bikan Historical District?

113
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:18,791
"Bikan District"

114

There seems to be no mistake that Mayuko came here.

115
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,691
What's the matter?

116
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,291
He just asked me for directions.

117
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,291
Sonny, you try it.

118
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,291
What?

119
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:55,391
"Handmade Sparrow-shaped Pancake Workshop"

120
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:00,991
Why me?

121
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:02,991
Conan, look this way.

122
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,491
Afterwards, we found places that matched the sketches

123
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,091
that were drawn one after the other.

124
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,491
"Kuraho Memorial Hall"

125
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:21,691
Ms. Mayuko's memory was coming back little by little.

126
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:29,491
I've been here before.

127
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,991
"Ohara Art Museum"

128
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:32,991
Yes, here too.

00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,591
I remember.

131
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:41,491
And there were only two more sketches to go.

132
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:44,791
That's maybe...

133
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,691
"Peach Boy Museum of Illusion"

134
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:49,691
"Peach Boy Museum of Illusion" -I think it's here?

135
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,791
When you turn the disc,

136
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,091
the number of ogres differ?

137
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:02,591
What?

138
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:03,791
The grapes are gone

139
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,991
and there are two bunches bananas instead.

140
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,491
It's because the picture of grapes are painted

141
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:13,191
on the face-up surface of this accordion shaped object,

142
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:16,391
but on the surface facing downward, bananas are painted instead.

143
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:19,391
I see. On the mirror that is placed below,

144
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,591
the bananas that are drawn on the bottom are reflected.

145
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,691
Isn't it interesting to think that

146
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:26,691
just by changing the angle a different thing can be seen.

147
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,591

Mayuko, did you regain your memory?

160
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:45,874
You recall where the jewelry is then, don't you?

161
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:50,274
You finally spit it out.

163
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:55,674

of the suspect of the robbery, Mr. Nonomiya Kengo, are you?

169
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:27,974
Oh no?

170
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:29,574
You gotta be joking?

171
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:32,674
After thinking it out a little, it should've been obvious.

172
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:34,874
In the case that the suspect denies the allegations,

173
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:35,974
it is difficult for anyone except the lawyer

174
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:38,374
to meet with the suspect, be it his relatives.

175
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:40,074
Nevertheless...

176
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,474
But when I visited him at the police,

177
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:45,674
my brother definitely told me

178
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,674
that he was innocent.

179
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,474
No... I really...

180
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:54,974
I know who you actually are, already.

181
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:56,274
Conan.

182
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:57,774
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:57,774 --> 00:11:58,874
Look at this.

184
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:06,274
It's a contract for a loan.

185
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,074
Kanae Nishida?

186
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:09,574
Ishida?

187
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:11,674
Then, just as I thought?

188
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:13,674
You didn't play the role

189
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:17,574
of the suspect Nonomiya's younger sister to clear his charges.

190
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:20,474
But rather because you wanted the jewelry, isn't that right?

191
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:21,974
Acting as his younger sister

192
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,674
will give you away as soon as someone checks on you.

193
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:28,674
She was that desperate about her debts.

194
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:30,774
Exactly.

195
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:34,074
Some trashy man hoodwinked me into getting loans to support him.

196
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:37,874
And the finance company also turned out to be a wicked one too.

197
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,374
After midnight the day before yesterday,

198
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,874
I visited Mayuko's apartment hoping to borrow money from her.

199
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:44,474
There...

200
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:45,874
Where's the jewelry?

201
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:48,974
How should I know?

202
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:50,074
Come.

203
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,174
Let me go!

204
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:04,674
I didn't know what was going on at that time but...

205
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:05,774
The following day,

206
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:07,674
I saw the news about the jewelry robbery

207
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,974
and everything fell into place.

208
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:19,074
The remark of Mr. Nonomiya who that was aired on the news wasn't a lie.

209
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:22,774
That guy struck Mr. Nonomiya and set him up as a scapegoat,

210
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:25,674
and Mayuko was a witness to this, he said.

211
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,374
Come to think of it,

212
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:31,574
everything but the part about Mayuko being the eye-witness

213
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:33,874
was aired on the news.

214
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:37,274
I don't know what happened between the two,

215
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,874
but I figured that Mayuko betrayed the man

216
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:43,074
and hid the jewelry some place.

217
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:44,274
If I play it right,

218
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,874
I thought I could also get rid of my debts.

219
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:50,874
That's why I rushed to look for Mayuko's whereabouts.

220
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:55,374
But, when I finally found her, Mayuko was suffering from memory loss.

221
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:59,374
I was at a loss as to what to do.

222
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:01,874
After that, I carelessly happened to tell

223
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,374
the president of the finance company who came to collect money

224
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:07,774
"Osanai Norio (38)" -about the jewelry.

225
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:09,574
Then...

226
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:12,074
He conned you into act as Mr. Nonomiya's younger sister

227
00:14:12,074 --> 00:14:15,874
and contact us.

228
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:19,774
So, that you would find out where the jewelry is from Mayuko,

229
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:21,474
after which they planned to take it away.

230
00:14:28,374 --> 00:14:30,174
Hello?

231
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:31,674
Yes, that's right.

232
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:36,774
Dad, it's from the Okayama Police.

233
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:37,974
They tracked the guy down with the license plate number

234
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:39,374
that Conan reported

235
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:41,374
to the police and arrested him, right?

236
00:14:42,374 --> 00:14:44,974
Me, the one who robbed the jewelry store?

237
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:46,674
Give me a break.

238
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:51,074
All I did was try to snatch the jewelry from the side.

239
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:54,474
My company's in hot water too,

240
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:56,274
that's why I...

241
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:58,774
He seems to have admitted that he attempted to kidnap Ms. Mayuko

242
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,074
at the Bikan Historical District,

243
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:02,474
but he seems to be denying all else.

244
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:05,274
I'm sure he's just trying to get away with it.

245
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:06,674
The man who attacked Mayuko at the observation deck

246
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,674
was also that guy Osanai.

247
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,274
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

248
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:12,574
Ran.

249
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:13,574
Yes.

250
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:17,074
Do you remember any characteristics of the man who attacked Mayuko

251
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:18,874
at the observation deck?

252
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:22,274
Characteristic?

253
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:25,074
Help, somebody!

254
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:28,274
Right. That man was left-handed.

255
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:31,774
Osanai is right-handed.

256
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:37,974
In other words, there were two people who were going after Mayuko.

257
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:41,574
One was the right-handed man who cooperated with Mayuko

258
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,574
and followed us,

259
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:46,774
the president of the finance company, Osanai.

260
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:51,074
And, the other one is the jewelry store robber.

261
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,974
The guy who attacked Mayuko at the observation deck,

262
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:57,374
who on earth was he?

263
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:01,374
Mr. Mouri, please cut the Gordian knot.

264
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:04,074
In fact, the culprit was depicted

265
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:06,874
in the sketches drawn by Mayuko to begin with.

266
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:09,174
What?

267
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:11,974
Look at the last sketch.

268
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:12,974
Yes.

269
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,574
The sketch of the grapes.

270
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:19,774
This depicts the culprit...

271
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:22,674
Come to think of it,

272
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,774
you mentioned you were a sommelier some time in the past?

273
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:26,074
Yes.

274
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:27,574
If I'm not mistaken,

275
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:30,874
sommelier's wear badges the shape of grapes, don't they?

276
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:32,074
The shiny thing that was on the chest of the man

277
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,674
in the picture at Mayuko's house, whose face was all torn off,

278
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:37,674
wasn't that a sommelier badge?

279
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:41,574
Besides, just before Mayuko was attacked at the observatory deck...

280
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:45,574
I'm sorry, the editor just called me.

281
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,874
I'll be back in about an hour,

282
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,474
so please go on and eat without me.

283
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,974
You excused yourself, didn't you?

284
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:54,474
What's with that look in your eyes?

285
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:56,374
Are you suspecting me?

286
00:16:56,374 --> 00:17:00,074
The man at the observatory deck was hit on the head

287
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,974
with the can that Conan kicked towards him. Mr. Nashida,

288
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:05,774
why are you suddenly wearing a cap?

289
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,974
Just what are you talking about?

290
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:11,774
I'm not hiding a wound or anything. See.

291
00:17:11,774 --> 00:17:13,174
See.

292
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:15,774
No. It's not Mr. Nashida.

293
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:17,574
What? Is that right?

294
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:20,574
The sketch is depicted something else.

295
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:21,574
Conan.

296
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:26,274
Ran, the sketch of the grapes is not the sommelier badge but this.

297
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:28,874
This...

298
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:31,174
This is how you're supposed to look at it, right, pops?

299
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:39,974
This is Mr. Taira's Muscat parfait.

300
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:42,774
It's the same as the mirror trick.

301
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:43,974
When you change the angle,

302
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:46,374
something different comes into view.

303
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:49,974
Mr. Taira most probably left-handed.

304
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:56,074
Conan watched Mr. Nashida and Mr. Taira shaking hands at the hospital.

305
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,874
Mr. Nashida stuck out his left hand

306
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:02,974
because he knew that Mr. Taira was left-handed. Isn't that right?

307
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:06,674
Yes. Exactly.

308
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:09,474
Come to think of it,

309
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:12,074
the man from that time was also left-handed.

310
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:16,974
Mr. Taira, I think it's about time you come out.

311
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:20,174
I know you've been listening from over there for some time now.

312
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:32,374
Without money,

313
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:33,974
I couldn't get a hold of a new shop.

314
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:37,974
The banks wouldn't lend me money either

315
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:40,474
because I went out of business gambling.

316
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:43,974
That's why I made Mayuko help and carried out the robbery.

317
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:46,674
You mean Mayuko was an accomplice in the robbery?

318
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:50,374
She probably helped keep on the look out, or drive the car?

319
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:53,374
Yes, exactly.

320
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,274
But, that guy happened to see what happened.

321
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:30,974
You went ahead to Mayuko's apartment

322
00:19:30,974 --> 00:19:33,574
and caught her trying to get back the jewelry

323
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,774
but since Mayuko fell down the stairs

324
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:39,374
and you were surprised by Kanae's scream, you fled.

325
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,974
After that when you found out from the website of the Town Magazine

326
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:44,474
that Mayuko was suffering from loss of memory

327
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,274
and that I was investigating the case,

328
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,474
you got rid of the evidence that pointed to you

329
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:52,774
and Mayuko having any connection with each other from her room

330
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,174
and got into contact with us under disguise

331
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:58,774
in order to get the jewelry back.

332
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,074
Hello.

333
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:11,574
Yes, that's right.

334
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:14,674
Really?

335
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:18,074
Dad, Mayuko disappeared from the hospital.

336
00:20:20,974 --> 00:20:21,974
Conan?

337
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:41,474
So, you did get her memory back after all.

338
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,574
Mr. Mouri?

339
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:47,074
You mumbled the following at the Bikan Historical District.

340
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:49,374
What a beautiful moon.

341
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:52,374
Back then, you were remembering

342
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:56,774
the scenery that you once saw when you were there.

343
00:20:56,774 --> 00:21:00,274
I tried time and time again to get back on my feet.

344
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:08,074
But, each time, I was betrayed by the person I trusted.

345
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:12,074
I fell in love with Taira and when he asked me run a shop together,

346
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:14,274
I made up my mind that this time is the right time.

347
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:18,474
That's when Taira told me about robbing the jewelry store.

348
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:20,874
If there was no way out of my situation I thought.

349
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:23,874
Why not take everything for myself?

350
00:21:23,874 --> 00:21:28,274
I figured I'd become more evil plunge farther into the pits.

351
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,374
But you were crying

352
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,074
after seeing the boiling pot ritual.

353
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:35,174
You requested a reading wanting to get rid of your past

354
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,674
and start over again.

355
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:39,574
If you got your memory back,

356
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:42,074
I'm sure you can remember how you felt back then.

357
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:45,774
Ran was saying

358
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:48,174
I admire Ms. Mayuko.

359
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:52,874
I'll bet she's actually a very strong person.

360
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,274
Ran said that?

361
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:55,874
I'm sure that she's praying

362
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:59,874
that you'd get back on your feet this time for sure.

363
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,374
The following day,

364
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:33,074
Mayuko Kichise was arrested and from her testimony

365
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:36,674
Mr. Keigo Nonomiya was released.

366
00:23:42,774 --> 00:23:45,374
Finally... finally!

367
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:47,674
I get to eat octopus rice and drink beer.

368
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:51,674
Dad, we're going to miss our Bullet train.

369
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:54,074
Oh, no!

370
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:59,074
-Just come! -Octopus rice! Beer!
