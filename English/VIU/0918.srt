"Naeko Miike, Yumi Miyamoto, MPD Traffic Department"

2
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:10,764
The city's so peaceful.

3
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:12,064
It really is.

4
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:15,164
Maybe there will be some really big case,

5
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:16,964
like in a drama.

6
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:19,864
Don't say such ominous things.

7
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:21,264
I was joking.

8
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:23,164
Besides, we'd never get the chance

9
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,564
to participate in a case that big.

10
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:27,164
You're right.

11
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:30,164
The man you love might, though.

12
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:45,664
Hey, it's a food festival!

13
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:47,464
"Dominating the nation!" -It's almost lunch.

14
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,964
"Food festival!" -Why don't we stop by?

15
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:50,464
We can't.

16
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:53,864
We still have lots to do once we get back to the station.

17
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:55,864
A short stop wouldn't hurt.

18
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:56,864
Cheapskate.

19
00:00:58,164 --> 00:00:59,664
Wait!

20
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:03,964
What are you shouting about?

21
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,764
-Did something happen? -I'm glad you're here!

22
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:09,264
Chase that car that just left!

23
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:11,864
The car that just left?

24
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,664
-Genta has been kidnapped! -Genta has been kidnapped!

25
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:16,364
-What? -What?

The mini-patrol car is driven by an energetic duo.

29
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:25,864
How will they handle this shocking case?

30
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,364
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:29,064
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:31,364
His name is Detective Conan!

"The Mini-Patrol Car Police's Big Chase"

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
You came to the department store to go shopping at the food festival,

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,580
and Genta went missing?

36
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,980
-Yes. -Yeah.

37
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,780
While we were looking for him...

38
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Hey, Genta!

39
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,580
Where are you?

40
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,980
Genta, where did you go?

41
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,880
Genta!

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,780
He doesn't seem to be here.

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,780
What's this?

44
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,780
Genta!

45
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,080
And that was the car that just left?

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,780
Yeah. We found this on the ground.

47
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,480
What is that?

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
There's blood on it.

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,980
-What? -Maybe Genta...

50
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
Got stabbed.

51
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,180
That reminds me of those historical dramas.

52
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,580
Like, "It's nothing to do with me".

53
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,180
Yumi, don't scare the children.

54
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,380
Oh, sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood.

55
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,980
You're not lightening anything.

56
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,280
Really?

57
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,880
And she's mixing up her references.

58
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,780
Ms. Yumi, please save Genta!

59
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,580
-Please! -Leave it to me.

60
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,580
No one's escaped from my mini-patrol car on these streets before!

61
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,380
Yumi, let's contact HQ.

62
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
We can do that later.

63
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,680
Genta. Can you hear me, Genta?

64
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,980
If you can hear us, say something, Genta!

65
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,980
The kidnappers will hear you.

66
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,980
I heard something.

67
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,280
What is that?

68
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,680
I recognize that sound.

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Could it be...

70
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,980
I know! It's his stomach growling!

71
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,080
You're right. It's the sound of Genta's stomach growling.

72
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,580
He's probably responding

73
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,280
with his stomach's growls because he can't speak.

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,080
His stomach's growls?

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm glad he seems to be doing fine.

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,380
I'm hungry.

77
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,480
This brat.

78
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,480
He's so carefree, his stomach's growling.

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,080
More importantly,

80
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,080
once we finish this job, they said we'd be paid out generously.

81
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,580
Yeah, real generously.

82
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,580
I'm excited. What should I buy?

83
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,680
"Mitsuo Kawamata (35)" -But what are we going to do with this kid?

84
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,580
He's a nuisance.

85
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,880
"Sho Iguchi (24)" -He overheard us talking,

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,180
and he's seen our faces.

87
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,280
We can't just let him go alive.

88
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,680
Nope.

89
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,380
Darn. We're supposed to clean up on diamonds today, too.

90
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
Wait.

91
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,280
Did he just say they're cleaning up on diamonds?

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,180
Could it be...

93
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,680
They're jewel thieves!

94
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,080
Genta's been kidnapped by thieves?

95
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,480
I see.

96
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
They kidnapped Genta

97
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,280
because he overheard them plotting to steal diamonds.

98
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,580
Then we should hurry.

99
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,980
They said they couldn't let him go alive.

100
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,480
Genta's car is heading towards Teitan Elementary School.

101
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,580
All right. We'll cut them off and arrest them!

102
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,580
Miike, take that left!

103
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,180
What? Yes, madam.

104
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,580
Next right!

105
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
Yes!

106
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,480
Can we make it through here?

107
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,480
It'll be fine. Trust me.

108
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,680
Take that right!

109
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,780
Hey, you're right. It's Teitan Elementary School.

110
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,880
That was amazing.

111
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,680
What did I tell you?

112
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
That car!

113
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,180
Full speed ahead!

114
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,680
Got it!

115
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,780
Emergency vehicle coming through.

116
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,480
Please clear the road.

117
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,080
Emergency vehicle coming through.

118
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,780
Please clear the road.

119
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,680
That mini-patrol car isn't coming after us, is it?

120
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,380
It's got nothing to do with us.

121
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,680
Some idiot must've been caught speeding.

122
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,180
Emergency vehicle coming through!

123
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,280
Clear the road!

124
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,380
We're not making any progress.

125
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,580
Hey! Get out of the way!

126
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,180
We appreciate your cooperation.

127
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,480
Her voice is louder than the siren.

128
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,780
You in the gray van! Stop!

129
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,680
They are after us!

130
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,980
Run!

131
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
You can't escape.

132
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Go!

133
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,080
Farewell.

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,780
Make a u-turn!

135
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Got it!

136
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,380
You're mine!

137
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,680
-Drive across! -Got it!

138
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,780
We can't do that.

139
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,380
But we almost caught them!

140
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,980
How long are they going to make us wait?

141
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,380
Hurry...

142
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,980
Go!

143
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,580
Where did they go?

144
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,180
We lost them.

145
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,980
Conan, which way?

146
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,680
Right. They're heading towards the harbor.

147
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,280
Got it.

148
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,180
All right. We'll catch up before long.

149
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,880
I hope Genta's okay.

150
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,180
Genta! Genta!

151
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,880
-Genta! -Guys, be quiet.

152
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,480
Genta?

153
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,680
I got it off.

154
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,080
Genta.

155
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,680
You're all right.

156
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,380
Yeah. I thought we were going to eat some good food.

157
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Why are you talking to yourself?

158
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,780
What's this?

159
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,480
Genta, help is on the way.

160
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
You just wait.

161
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,880
Hey, what's going on?

162
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,580
Crap. They noticed.

163
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,380
Do you think we're idiots?

164
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,080
Don't!

165
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:37,529
What's this?

166
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:40,129
Genta, help is on the way.

167
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:41,429
You just wait.

168
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,029
Hey, what's going on?

169
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:48,329
Do you think we're idiots?

170
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,229
-Don't! -Genta!

171
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:55,029
-Genta! -Genta!

172
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,429
Genta. Hey, Genta!

173
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,329
Genta. Genta!

174
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,729
Genta, are you okay?

175
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,029
Darn.

176
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:06,129
My tracking glasses aren't working.

177
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,229
His badge must be broken.

178
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:09,529
What should we do?

179
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,529
What can we do?

180
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,729
Now we don't know where Genta is.

181
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:17,829
We need to save him soon. Otherwise Genta...

182
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,029
That cooler.

183
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:29,529
What about the cooler?

184
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,329
While we were searching the department store for Genta,

185
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:34,629
I saw two men transporting coolers

186
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,629
that looked just like the ones in that car.

187
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:40,329
They were an unusual color, so I remember them well.

188
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,729
Those men kidnapped Genta.

189
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:47,729
And? Do you know where they're going?

190
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:51,229
They were using hand signals to communicate with each other.

191
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:54,129
I think they looked like this.

192
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,229
Doesn't that mean "gun"?

193
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,729
What?

194
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:11,229
Wait, they have guns?

195
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:12,329
What should we do?

196
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,429
Are they going to shoot Genta?

197
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:18,729
No, they were probably communicating the location of the job

198
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,329
to the person standing next to me.

199
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,629
I see. So that's where it is.

200
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,529
"Shintaro Horikawa (43)" -Got it.

201
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,429
He's probably working with them.

202
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:35,229
Then if we figure out what these signals mean,

203
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:37,529
then we might know where they're headed.

204
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,829
Yeah. And before we lost sight of them,

205
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:42,829
their car was heading towards the harbor.

206
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,529
-Which means... -I've got it!

207
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,229
This means two, and this means one.

208
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:49,129
Two and one?

209
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:52,029
Isn't this two and one?

210
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,129
That's it. It's Conan style.

211
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:56,929
Yes.

212
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:59,029
When using your fingers to count,

213
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,529
in Japan we start with the index finger and raise one at a time.

214
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,929
But in Europe, they start with their thumbs.

215
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,229
Right?

216
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:08,529
Yeah.

217
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,329
I see. It's those fingers.

218
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:14,529
That's exactly what a certain someone

219
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:17,229
influenced by his Gallicized mother does.

220
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,129
This gesture means three, right?

221
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:23,629
Yeah. That's three, but this is two.

222
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,329
But...

223
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:29,729
In other words, those signs meant "two" and "one."

224
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:31,929
They're referring to 21.

225
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:33,329
Combine that with the fact

226
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,329
that the car is heading towards the harbor, and...

227
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,629
That's it. The number 21 in the direction of the harbor means...

228
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:41,829
I get it now.

229
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:46,129
They're heading towards warehouse 21 at the harbor.

230
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,029
That's right.

231
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,129
Their thinking's not wrong,

232
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,529
but there's still something...

233
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,629
Come to think of it, at the department store...

234
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:00,129
I see. So that's where it is.

235
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:02,829
Got it.

236
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,629
The smell of fish?

237
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:13,029
"Eel" -It's the smell of eel.

238
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,929
I see. Then this must be...

239
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,629
Ms. Yumi, hold on!

240
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:19,629
What?

241
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,729
What is it, Conan?

242
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,529
It's not the number 21?

243
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:30,529
No. Those hand signals aren't the European style of counting.

244
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,929
They're the secret hand signals used at auctions.

245
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,329
Secret hand signals?

246
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:39,529
Those signals used to indicate prices at auctions?

247
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:43,629
Yeah. When the man they were signaling walked past me,

248
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:45,729
I caught a faint whiff of eel.

249
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:48,729
Does that mean he was eating eel?

250
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:51,129
Not the smell of broiled eel.

251
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,629
A fishy smell.

252
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:56,329
And this is a punch that's used for butchering eels.

253
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,629
Does that mean they're eel vendors?

254
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,629
-Yeah. -I see.

255
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:04,529
Eel vendors would know the secret hand signals of auctions.

256
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,129
So, what number do those signals mean?

257
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:11,529
The hand signals differ slightly between markets,

258
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,629
but in Tokyo, one through five

259
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:17,029
are expressed normally with your fingers.

260
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:19,929
This is six, and this is seven.

261
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:23,329
Got it. So it's 76.

262
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:26,329
Miike, head to warehouse 76 immediately.

263
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:27,329
Got it.

264
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,329
-Genta. -Genta.

265
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,229
We'll rescue you soon.

266
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:54,129
Okay.

267
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:57,729
"Shunpei Matsuno (38)" -I accept your white diamonds.

268
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:58,729
Here.

269
00:15:58,729 --> 00:15:59,729
Thanks.

270
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:09,329
That concludes our deal.

271
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:11,229
I'll let you know if I need anything else.

272
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:12,329
Sure.

273
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,629
Now what should we do about him?

274
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:25,129
Hey, I'm hungry.

275
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,029
Feed me.

276
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,529
What are you talking about?

277
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,929
Do you not understand the position you're in?

278
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,929
What are you doing?

279
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,729
There's only one thing for us to do.

280
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:40,329
Haven't you ever seen one of these

281
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:42,029
in a police drama before?

282
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:46,129
No hard feelings.

283
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,629
Genta!

284
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:02,529
-Conan! -What?

285
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,629
Jewel thieves!

286
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:10,729
Don't attempt to resist arrest!

287
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,829
What?

288
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,729
You're not making any sense.

289
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:17,129
The jig's already up.

290
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:18,129
Darn.

291
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:20,629
It's just a couple of women and some kids.

292
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:21,729
Get them!

293
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,629
Don't underestimate the police!

294
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:30,529
Darn it.

295
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:34,629
I learned this from Miwako!

296
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:35,929
German...

297
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,129
You're too fat.

298
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,429
German suplex!

299
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:50,729
Got them.

300
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,329
Got them?

301
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:54,829
That was so cool.

302
00:17:57,629 --> 00:18:02,829
There. Speeding, illegal passing, illegal crossing,

303
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,929
and entering a closed railway crossing.

304
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,529
-What? -You're arresting us for that?

305
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,629
That's just for now.

306
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:12,629
Division one will show up soon.

307
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,929
They'll put you through the wringer then.

308
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,529
Genta, you're okay.

309
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:23,029
Yeah, thanks.

310
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,029
What's that?

311
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:28,129
Those are whitebait eels.

312
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,829
What? Whitebait eels?

313
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:32,529
They're juvenile eels.

314
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,729
They grow up into regular eels.

315
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:40,129
There are all eels?

316
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:48,029
Why don't you let those two go?

317
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:50,729
There he is. The final boss of the jewel thief gang.

318
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,429
Hey, you! Division one is on its way!

319
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,129
You won't be able to escape!

320
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:58,629
Don't you care what happens to him?

321
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:05,429
-Genta. -Genta.

322
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,229
-Genta! -Are you okay?

323
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:31,129
Yeah. I thought I was going to die.

324
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,829
I'm glad you're okay.

325
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:36,129
The eels are okay, too.

326
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:38,129
But why eels?

327
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:42,529
Where are the diamonds?

328
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:18,429
Apparently, they're part of an organization

329
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:20,929
that smuggles protected whitebait eels

330
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,929
that are illegal to export overseas.

331
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:26,829
So they weren't jewel thieves.

332
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:30,229
But didn't they say they'd clean up on diamonds?

333
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:32,929
Come to think of it, they did.

334
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,829
The number of whitebait eels has declined sharply recently.

335
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:38,529
Since they're traded at such a high price,

336
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,829
they're referred to as white diamonds.

337
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:43,029
White diamonds?

338
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:46,029
The diamonds they were talking about

339
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:48,529
were whitebait eels.

340
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:54,729
And I stopped that deal from happening.

341
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,329
I knew I could do it.

342
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:57,429
What?

343
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:59,229
What are you talking about?

344
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:02,229
You thought they were jewel thieves.

345
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:03,629
Yeah!

346
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:06,429
And this only happened because I got kidnapped?

347
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,129
Because you got kidnapped?

348
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,829
Well, I'm the one who arrested them.

349
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,629
You were really cool.

350
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:14,929
Right?

351
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:17,729
I'm just glad things turned out okay this time.

352
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:21,029
Hello, Dr. Agasa?

353
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,529
Yeah, we saved him.

354
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,729
Yeah. Yeah, got it.

355
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:32,129
Dr. Agasa said he'll treat us to eel

356
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:35,129
since we didn't buy anything at the food festival.

357
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:37,129
All right!

358
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,329
I'm hungry.

359
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,529
I'm starving.

360
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,829
I'm so hungry I could die.

361
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,129
Hey, make sure you savor the taste.

362
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:49,129
Japanese eels are an endangered species.

363
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:50,929
An endangered species?

364
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:54,129
You mean they might go extinct?

365
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,829
What?

366
00:22:55,829 --> 00:23:00,129
Are the eels gone because you ate too many of them?

367
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,429
That must be it.

368
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:02,829
Seriously?

369
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,829
I doubt that.

370
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:10,529
Hey, you're back. Good.

371
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:12,729
Is Genta "availabeel"?

372
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,229
Eel...

373
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,129
Genta is "availabeel".

374
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,129
In English, the word for unagi is eel.

375
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,029
Genta is "availabeel".

376
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,429
Gosh. Some old men can't resist "deelivering" stupid jokes.

377
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:26,929
Yumi, you've been infected.

378
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:31,229
Now why don't we manyu over and partake of this repast as well?

379
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:34,829
Yumi, we still have work to do!

380
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:37,029
And what's manyu?

381
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,629
Why'd she switch to Chinese?

382
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:46,329
"Next Episode" -I'm so excited.

383
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,529
She took a book from the shelf.

384
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:00,129
What was that scream?

385
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:04,129
What's going on?

386
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:09,129
Next Conan,

387
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:13,029
"The High School Girl Trio's Secret Cafe (Part 1)"
