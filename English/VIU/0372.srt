1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,591
Today's stage is also Okinawa!

2
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,191
An alibi trick that goes through the sky.

3
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,891
See through the case with deduction from a different angle.

4
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,391
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,191
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:31,092
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,168
A TV program is to be aired with

8
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:58,868
professional baseball player, Toshizou Nose,

9
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,568
sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama and Pops in a talk show,

10
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:05,269
so we all head off to Okinawa.

11
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:09,068
We join Mr. Motoyama at Naha Airport,

12
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,968
and go to see Mr. Nose,

13
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,369
however, on the way...

14
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,868
That is...

15
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:18,669
The uniform of the Jaguars.

16
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:25,368
-Hey! Isn't that Mr. Nose? -No way.

17
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:28,968
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

18
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,469
The police?

19
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:38,968
At any rate, please arrest the murderer as soon as possible.

20
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:42,068
The devil who got in the way of my best friend

21
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,468
making his Japan record of saves.

22
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,168
No, not right.

23
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,869
He's the killer.

24
00:02:58,769 --> 00:02:59,869
What the...

25
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:14,369
"The Silent Route (Part 2)"

26
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,869
Conan...

27
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,968
What's the matter?

28
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:21,969
Are you all right?

29
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,468
What a frightening look you have on your face.

30
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,368
It's nothing.

31
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:27,168
Really?

32
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,868
Yeah. I was surprised too.

33
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:33,168
-Well, I'll tell you the details again later. -What was that just now?

34
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,768
Oh, right! Mr. Teranishi, please lend me the car key.

35
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,669
I forgot something in the car.

36
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:54,469
Excuse me!

37
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,969
May I ask you something?

38
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,468
What is it, sonny?

39
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:07,268
The key of the hotel of Miyazaki that you just had

40
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:09,069
isn't disposable, is it?

41
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,468
Why didn't you return it to the front desk

42
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,668
when you checked out?

43
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,868
I haven't checked out yet.

44
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:22,568
I've got another interview in Miyazaki day after tomorrow.

45
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,368
But, you were planning to have an interview tomorrow too, right?

46
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:30,168
Going back to the hotel in Miyazaki, then coming back again,

47
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,268
isn't that a waste of plane fare?

48
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:34,568
You couldn't have known before hand

49
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:38,168
that the interview tomorrow was going to be cancelled, did you?

50
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,669
This brat.

51
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,368
Did you find what you forgot?

52
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:46,168
No.

53
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,668
It must've been my mistake.

54
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:49,669
Thanks for this.

55
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:57,068
By the way, why are you all here?

56
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,368
Well, they say they're doing another circumstantial investigation,

57
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,668
where Mr. Nose was found dead.

58
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,169
Well... It's just to be sure.

59
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:09,868
Excuse me.

60
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,568
Are you left handed?

61
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:13,768
No.

62
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,368
But you caught the key with your left hand just a while ago.

63
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:17,968
It's a habit!

64
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,668
I used to be an ace number 4 player of the baseball club

65
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,069
until high school.

66
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,968
And...

67
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:30,868
Why did you use such a back street to go to Mr. Nose's hotel?

68
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:34,768
The main roads around that area are crowded just about that time of day.

69
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,768
That's why although it's the long way around,

70
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,369
we can get to our destination faster using the back road.

71
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,768
Wait a second.

72
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:43,969
If I remember correctly...

73
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:48,269
I'm sure that...

74
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:52,369
This is it!

75
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:56,269
I get it.

76
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,669
So, that's what it was.

77
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:09,368
It's not that he didn't check-out of the hotel.

78
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,669
He couldn't.

79
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,268
No doubt about it.

80
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:16,068
The killer is Mr. Motoyama.

81
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,769
He's the one who killed Mr. Nose.

82
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,969
He used the back road of the sky to his advantage.

83
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,268
Inspector!

84
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:33,968
I've finished asking around!

85
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,168
And, did you find any witnesses?

86
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:37,169
Well...

87
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,268
there was no one who passed by here

88
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:43,868
just about the time Mr. Nose was killed around 9:30 am.

89
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:48,568
No witness, weapon nor evidence?

90
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:51,168
Let's take it easy and take our time, Inspector!

91
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,668
There's still a lot of time

92
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,068
before it's time for us to board our plane for Tokyo,

93
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,868
If you think carefully,

94
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:59,868
you may come up with evidence

95
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:04,368
that the killer inadvertently forgot to get rid of!

96
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:07,469
You brat, cut out your irresponsible comments.

97
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,668
Excuse me.

98
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,168
I'm sorry...

99
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:20,068
but could I be excused to get something to eat?

100
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,469
I haven't had a bite since I've come here.

101
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:26,568
True.

102
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,068
No problem.

103
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,368
I'll wait here.

104
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:30,668
So go ahead.

105
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,168
Would you like to come along too?

106
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,568
I guess so.

107
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,968
Let's take my car and go all together then!

108
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:39,769
Thank you.

109
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:47,568
This is a restaurant that I come to often,

110
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,969
and it's quite delicious!

111
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,969
Let's eat and return as soon as we can then!

112
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:59,768
It's from the producer of the TV station.

113
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,668
We'll wait for you inside the restaurant then.

114
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:05,669
So when you're done could you lock the car and come.

115
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:08,869
We'll go on ahead.

116
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,269
Conan!

117
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,468
-Okay. -Hello, Motoyama here.

118
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:16,868
What's up?

119
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:21,868
I got a call on my cell from you that rang once and hung up,

120
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,368
that's why I'm returning your call.

121
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,468
I thought that maybe something new came up

122
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,868
regarding Nose's case.

123
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:27,968
Oh, sorry,

124
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:30,769
I think I may have mistakenly pushed the button.

125
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:36,768
I'll contact you if anything comes up.

126
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:37,869
Goodbye.

127
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,468
What are you doing, Conan?

128
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:47,268
Oh, well.

129
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,868
I was just thinking what a great detective Mr. Motoyama is.

130
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:53,168
Idiot!

131
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,268
You're talking about him sensing that Mr. Nose was killed

132
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,268
just as soon as he saw him lying on the ground, right?

133
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:01,768
Didn't I tell you that Mr. Motoyama sensed it

134
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,168
because he knew that somebody had been threatening Mr. Nose!

135
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,669
No!

136
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:13,468
Remember what Mr. Motoyama told me at the airport?

137
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,768
What?

138
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,869
He said, let's go, sonny!

139
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:25,769
Hey! Let's go, sonny!

140
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,168
So why does that make him a great detective?

141
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:37,968
Because I was away from you and Ran back then

142
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:40,569
and I was talking to the security guard.

143
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:45,568
But you still could tell that I was supposed to be with you.

144
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,168
That's what you call super deduction, right?

145
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:51,368
Come to think of it...

146
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:54,368
That's strange because this is the first time we ever met.

147
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,869
Well, I guess we can talk it over having a meal.

148
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:00,268
The place is packed!

149
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,368
I wonder if there are any empty seats?

150
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,568
Everyone!

151
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,768
This way! Over here!

152
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,368
He's found us seats but it's hard to get straight over there.

153
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:12,868
Okay, then...

154
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:14,069
The back road!

155
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,169
There, I'm already here!

156
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,669
Taking the longer way, got me here faster!

157
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:40,760
This is it.

158
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:42,861
As long as I get rid of this...

159
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:49,960
Nobody will ever be able to see through the crime that I...

160
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,760
I'm sorry,

161
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:56,260
but will you please get the timetable from my bag?

162
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:58,461
I forgot what time our flight is.

163
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:06,461
-Is this it? -Thank you.

164
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,060
Oh, that's right!

165
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:17,960
An acquaintance asked me to get him a souvenir from Okinawa.

166
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,660
Will you tell everyone

167
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:22,260
to go ahead and finish the meal without me,

168
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,961
because I want to go get the souvenir first?

169
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,460
Well, after I'm done,

170
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:32,560
I'll buy some bread or something and join you all.

171
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,861
Oh, all right!

172
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:52,061
"Naha Airport Parking Lot."

173
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:15,060
My...

174
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:18,260
You seem to be enjoying yourself a lot.

175
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:20,360
Your best friend passed away

176
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:23,260
and you look to be quite over the grief already.

177
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:25,760
Well, I guess it's only natural.

178
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:28,460
Because you're the one who killed him.

179
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:31,260
What? Don't be ridiculous.

180
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:34,861
You even said I have an alibi.

181
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,460
Nose was killed

182
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:42,160
if I remember correctly at about 9:30 this morning.

183
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,060
I arrived on the 9:50 am,

184
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:48,261
flight from Miyazaki to Okinawa, you know?

185
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:54,760
Moreover, that is the only flight from Miyazaki,

186
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:59,360
and I was on the program that was aired live in Miyazaki, wasn't I?

187
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,760
So, how could I have killed Nose?

188
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:07,261
It's true that you couldn't come directly from Miyazaki but...

189
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:14,560
But if you take the long way around via Tokyo.

190
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:18,861
It's possible for you to set foot on Okinawa before 9:30 am!

191
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,160
Yes, you avoided the crowded main road

192
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:26,960
and took the back road which got you faster to your destination.

193
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:31,960
You took the 8:35 pm flight from Miyazaki to Tokyo

194
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:37,260
and headed for Okinawa on the 6:55 am morning flight from Tokyo.

195
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:40,860
This would allow you to arrive here at 9:20 am!

196
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,360
Then you went with that rental car

197
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:47,660
from the airport to Mr. Nose's jogging route,

198
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,460
ambushed and killed him.

199
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,460
You returned to the airport by 9:50 am

200
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:55,560
and pretended that you just arrived in Okinawa,

201
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:58,560
then, came to see us!

202
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,960
Wait!

203
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:03,460
I came out of the Naha Airport arrival gate

204
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:07,061
this morning at 09:50 am, right?

205
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:11,560
Let's say I did come in on the 09:20 am flight

206
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,860
and left the gate going outside once,

207
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:18,760
how was I supposed to enter the arrival lobby again?

208
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:21,260
-Well... -Well...

209
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,161
That's true.

210
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,360
-See. -Hey.

211
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:28,860
Mr. Mouri.

212
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:31,960
We came here because you said you figured out who the killer was.

213
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:33,160
Oh, well.

214
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:36,360
-Talk about hopeless. -Right, that's right.

215
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:42,060
Why were the people in the store a while ago giving us strange looks?

216
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:43,560
Of course!

217
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:45,760
We went into the store,

218
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,260
sat down and left without ordering anything.

219
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:50,260
I'll bet you're hungry.

220
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,260
Would you like my juice?

221
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,060
Oh, yes, please!

222
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,660
You went into the store and left without ordering anything?

223
00:14:57,661 --> 00:14:59,460
Hey!

224
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:03,060
Come to think of it, the embarkation and arrival floors of Naha Airport

225
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,360
are connected on the inside?

226
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,460
Yes, that's right.

227
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,260
Which means...

228
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:11,060
you could've just bought any ticket

229
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,660
and go inside from the embarkation gate

230
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,360
and come out from the arrival gate without boarding the plane.

231
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,761
That's right, exactly!

232
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:22,060
Which means you still not being checked out

233
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:25,860
from the hotel in Miyazaki suspicious too.

234
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:29,160
If you came from Miyazaki to Okinawa on this morning's flight,

235
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:33,060
you would've checked out from the hotel in Miyazaki.

236
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:35,660
If you also have an interview scheduled in Okinawa tomorrow,

237
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:38,360
it's only natural for you to spend the night here.

238
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,160
But you couldn't do so

239
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:44,460
because you were already away from Miyazaki at that time.

240
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:49,060
Isn't it because you're on a flight last night and already in Tokyo?

241
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,660
Any evidence?

242
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:53,660
Of course we've got evidence!

243
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,560
Right, Mr. Mouri?

244
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:58,260
What?

245
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,560
Now, what was it?

246
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:02,861
Let's leave the rest up to the famous detective!

247
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:08,560
Pops!

248
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,261
You want juice, don't you?

249
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,360
Right!

250
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,660
That's right!

251
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:23,260
Please check the flight from Tokyo to Okinawa

252
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:27,360
that Mr. Motoyama used to carry out his trick

253
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,861
because we were on board that flight too.

254
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:35,260
My daughter happened to spill tennis balls on board this flight.

255
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:39,260
And the passenger in the next seat helped pick up the balls.

256
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:42,260
He was among the passengers,

257
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:45,260
a suspicious man that caught the tennis ball

258
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,060
with his left hand.

259
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:49,560
Was that Mr. Motoyama?

260
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:52,760
But, isn't he right-handed?

261
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,560
A habit since he caught so many balls with his left hand.

262
00:16:56,561 --> 00:17:01,660
Moreover, his job required him to protect is right hand.

263
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:04,760
That's why he used his left hand

264
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:06,161
without thinking.

265
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,660
So, please give it to me.

266
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:14,860
The stuff that you took out from Ran's bag and hid in your pocket.

267
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:16,860
Mr. Masaharu Motoyama,

268
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,760
the baseball player who in the past,

269
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,760
was awarded the King of rookie and save.

270
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:23,460
Just what are you talking about?

271
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:25,960
You're sweating! You must be hot?

272
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,361
How about some juice?

273
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:47,061
Yes.

274
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:50,360
Your fingerprints on the tennis ball that you picked up back then

275
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,361
is evidence that you are the killer.

276
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:56,461
That is what I'd like to say

277
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:58,561
but that's not how it is.

278
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:03,960
The surface of a hard tennis ball is fluffy making it difficult

279
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:06,560
for fingerprints to remain.

280
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:08,160
And, even if it were found on the ball,

281
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:12,660
it would only serve as proof that you were on the same flight as we were.

282
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:16,460
It won't serve as proof that you killed Mr. Nose.

283
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:19,860
That's why we deliberately made you steal the can of tennis balls

284
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,461
and made you swim.

285
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,560
Because we figured you would undoubtedly lead us

286
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:30,060
to the weapon you used for the murder

287
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:31,460
and the place you hid the clothes splotched

288
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,860
with blood when you killed the victim!

289
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:36,360
This is unmistakably immovable evidence!

290
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:38,760
But, how amazing that you saw through everything

291
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,860
just by watching him catch the can with his left hand!

292
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,260
Well...

293
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:44,660
I happened to remember that Mr. Motoyama,

294
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,060
though we met for the first time,

295
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:49,260
called out to this boy knowing that

296
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,760
he was with us and everything fell in place!

297
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,360
I figured that maybe Mr. Motoyama saw us all together somewhere

298
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:57,661
before seeing us at the airport.

299
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:04,360
Well, even a snotty kid like him can be of use at times.

300
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:07,660
I should've put him to sleep with the tranquilizer gun after all.

301
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:09,660
Talk about ironic.

302
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:12,460
To think that my habit ended my baseball career,

303
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:15,560
and again with this habit of mine, I dug my own grave.

304
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:20,760
Nose told me that I got a habit when pitching on my first season off

305
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,760
after I received the King of Rookie and King of Save.

306
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:25,660
I checked myself over and over.

307
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,361
To the point of going neurotic.

308
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,760
But I couldn't find any habit.

309
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,060
Not only that, I damaged my shoulder

310
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:34,461
because of over pitching during the off season.

311
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:38,960
I thought that it was strange that after I resigned,

312
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,560
Nose suddenly became very friendly

313
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:44,460
and introduced me to TV jobs and such.

314
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:45,860
Then last month,

315
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:46,861
after coincidentally seeing the VTR

316
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,860
of a sports variety program before editing,

317
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:51,861
I finally understood why he did so.

318
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:55,860
Are there any other interesting stories?

319
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,060
Mr. Nose, please tell us!

320
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:02,760
Well, it's easy to get rid of a young pitcher.

321
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,660
All I did was whisper that he had a habit

322
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,660
and he self-destructed.

323
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,060
-What? -What?

324
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:09,860
Cut the part out!

325
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:10,960
I don't want trouble.

326
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,260
Are you serious?

327
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:15,061
No, it's something I heard from somebody else!

328
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:20,360
Yes, I never had a habit to begin with.

329
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,460
But I felt obligated to him and swayed between joy and sorrow

330
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:26,160
because he became the guardian of the Jaguars after me.

331
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:29,160
I supported him as if he was myself.

332
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,560
That's why I'm so vexed and wretched.

333
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:34,060
Is that why you killed him?

334
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:40,560
Yes. I kept him from making his Japan save record.

335
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:44,060
Using Hideyoshi's "great revenge" trick.

336
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:45,860
Because the real person to break the national record

337
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,560
and have worldwide fame should have been me.

338
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:51,261
I wanted to make him realize that!

339
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:55,060
No.

340
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:57,960
You would've never made the Japan record.

341
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,560
What?

342
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:02,860
I feel sorry for the fact that you were deceived

343
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,860
but a stopper is the last stockade for the team.

344
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,360
Even if you're beaten and battered,

345
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:10,460
no mattered if you're jeered at or what,

346
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,360
if your turn to play comes up in the next game,

347
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:15,760
you've got to stand on the mound as if nothing happened!

348
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:19,360
I don't think a guy who loses himself

349
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,161
and commits murder can shoulder the fate of a team.

350
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:26,660
Pops.

351
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,861
Dad.

352
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:33,660
I'm the one who wants to cry!

353
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:36,760
Thanks to you doing something like this.

354
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:38,860
After I went all out to...

355
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,361
No, forget it.

356
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:44,161
Do the rest of your repenting behind bars.

357
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:48,460
What were you going to say, dad?

358
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:50,061
It's nothing.

359
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:26,261
Darn it.

360
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:35,661
I went out of my way to get it and then.

361
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:46,460
Now, I can't give to her even if I wanted to.

362
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:48,160
No, wait a second.

363
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:51,560
If this is going to be his final autograph,

364
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:54,360
this is be a super rare item.

365
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:56,061
Dad?

366
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:01,361
"Next Episode" -That's a red-back spider, isn't it?

367
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:10,460
Don't touch it!

368
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:13,460
We have to leave it that way until the police get here.

369
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:14,861
This is not an accident!

370
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:19,060
Pops Kogoro said that,

371
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:23,160
it's strange that only the serum for the Black Widow Spider is missing.

372
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:28,761
Next Conan, "Deadly Venom Spider Trap".

373
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:46,660
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:48,460
"Telephone."

375
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:50,060
Finally in the next episode is the new semester.

376
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:51,660
Conan and school will start off energetically!

377
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:53,361
Ran, your face is black with tan.
