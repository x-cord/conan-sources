1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,672
The moment of vengeance has come!

2
00:00:10,572 --> 00:00:13,572
The curtains will soon rise.

3
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:19,972
The masque of death is ready to commence.

4
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:28,672
A crisis is gracefully revived.

5
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,072
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

6
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,872
The malicious intent of an unseen face is frightening.

7
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:35,072
Tragedy during a Masque performance.

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,772
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:38,772
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,772
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

11
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:20,895
"The Malice Hidden Behind the Masque."

12
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:29,986
Masque...

13
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:32,086
"The Triumph of Folly" -in other words, a masque is a play

14
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,086
that used to be popular in England

15
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,986
in the days before Shakespeare.

16
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:50,886
The play that's being performed right now is John Benson's.

17
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:52,786
"The Triumph of Folly".

18
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,686
"Shimizu Kinuko (26)" -In Japanese...

19
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:57,686
"Troupe Company Manager" -Orokasa (folly) no Shouri(triumph).

20
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,686
I see.

21
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:08,586
You know, this performance is really something.

22
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:09,886
We borrowed...

23
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:12,786
"Manabu Tabuchi (50)" -genuine rapiers to practice with.

24
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:53,086
No dialog?

25
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:54,686
Yes.

26
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,286
It's silent play.

27
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:58,386
I see.

28
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:08,286
He vanished?

29
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:10,886
There's a landing below the veranda

30
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:12,886
and he jumped down.

31
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:24,186
And this scene is?

32
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:25,586
This is a scene in which the two unwanted characters, the prince

33
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:27,086
and the minister die,

34
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:29,486
and the king raises his cup in celebration.

35
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:32,586
Of course, it was the king who orchestrated

36
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:35,286
the feud between the two.

37
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:50,286
The wine the king was just drank

38
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:53,286
was poisoned by the minister beforehand.

39
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:12,386
What a bloody story.

40
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:13,986
The story is indeed bloody,

41
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:16,486
but the play itself is also said to be cursed.

42
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:18,086
Just what do you mean?

43
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:20,686
They say that ever since the first performance in the 17th century,

44
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,086
this play has been cursed

45
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:25,486
and somebody involved in the play is destined to die.

46
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:35,086
The guy playing the prince really looks like a prince, doesn't he?

47
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,286
"Robert Banno (21)" -That is our star actor,

48
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,086
called Robert Banno.

49
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,586
Oh, that's Hiroshi Komazuka!

50
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,986
-Dad, do you know him? -Yeah.

51
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:50,686
"Hiroshi Komazuka (50)" -Back when I was a student,

52
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:53,186
I used to watch his movies all the time.

53
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:58,086
The one playing the minister is Atsushi Yabuki.

54
00:05:58,086 --> 00:06:00,386
"Atsushi Yabuki (28)" -As for the lift I'll be taking a plunge for,

55
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:03,786
could you raise the platform a bit more?

56
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:05,586
The fact is, during practice suspicious happenings

57
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:07,986
have occurred one after the other.

58
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,886
That's why we called on you, Detective Mouri.

59
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:12,786
Leave it to me!

60
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:16,386
It shall be as easy as relaxing on a boat... No, I mean a cruise liner.

61
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:42,586
Well, no problem at all.

62
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:47,486
Where is that kid go?

63
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,986
Conan!

64
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:52,286
It's such a big place, he could have gotten lost.

65
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,986
I'll go find him.

66
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:56,686
That kid is such a pain.

67
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,186
By switching this rapier with the real one.

68
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:14,086
Robert will...

69
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:25,786
Kyoko, I don't know where you are now,

70
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:28,986
but make sure you watch tomorrow's news.

71
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:32,186
Because there will be a news coverage of the accidental death

72
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,786
of the man who had his fling with you!

73
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:41,286
Robert. Come tomorrow, the sword of justice

74
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:44,586
shall pierce right through your sinful heart!

75
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:53,386
Who... who are you?

76
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,886
Hello. Good-bye!

77
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:57,986
Hold on!

78
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:02,086
You're Detective Mouri's...

79
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:04,086
I didn't hear a thing.

80
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:06,586
There's no way you didn't hear anything.

81
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,986
Now that you've heard, there's no way I can let you go.

82
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:13,686
At least until the show is finished.

83
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:24,186
Stay put right here.

84
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:31,986
Darn. My alcoholism is acting up again.

85
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,886
Hi.

86
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,886
Anything?

87
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:07,386
Have you seen a child about this tall?

88
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:10,086
Haven't seen him.

89
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:13,286
Is that so? Sorry for the trouble.

90
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:21,686
There we go.

91
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:31,786
That's right.

92
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:34,886
The real rapier is missing.

93
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:36,486
Rapier?

94
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,686
Could it be...

95
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,886
How dangerous!

96
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,186
Darn it! I'm going tell them off!

97
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:53,486
No, wait a second.

98
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:56,286
Rather than shocking him to death on the stage lift,

99
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:58,686
maybe this way I can be sure to kill him.

100
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:02,286
I'm not the one who mistook the rapiers,

101
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,786
so I can claim it was an accident.

102
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:05,786
Now, the problem is

103
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:09,286
how to switch roles before the real performance begins.

104
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:11,086
He'll definitely take the bait.

105
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:13,386
All right, I'll talk him into it.

106
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,586
What?

107
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:17,786
You don't have money to pay me back,

108
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:19,586
so you're giving me your role?

109
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,886
My apologies.

110
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,286
There's just no way I can get the money ready.

111
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:25,086
As such, I'm giving you my role.

112
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:26,786
Don't be stupid.

113
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:29,486
It's just before the performance, you know.

114
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:32,686
Hold it. This is a silent play,

115
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:35,486
I guess I can somehow handle it because there is no dialog.

116
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:37,986
Rather... All right.

117
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:39,986
I'll take it.

118
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,386
Well, hurry and tell the manager.

119
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:45,886
Why don't we keep it as a surprise until encore?

120
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:49,586
In view of performance, I think it would be more interesting.

121
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,686
I guess so.

122
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:57,586
Let's go with it.

123
00:10:57,586 --> 00:10:59,686
I'll just leave this here.

124
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:07,986
I want to undo the trap.

125
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:09,586
No, so long as I fall to the side,

126
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,786
I should be fine.

127
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:15,486
Conan, where are you?

128
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:23,686
Even elephants are said to die with this.

129
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:26,186
So, as for that old man, he doesn't stand a chance.

130
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,086
A gift from the fans?

131
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,186
Yes.

132
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:33,886
But, I don't drink...

133
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:40,586
Well, I guess I'll have some, after all.

134
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:47,086
-Mr. Komazaki, is everything going OK? -Yeah.

135
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:50,086
Please, Robert and Yabuki

136
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,886
are acting their first starring roles,

137
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:54,886
so please do guide them along the way.

138
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,986
Yeah, I got it.

139
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:58,186
Bye.

140
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,186
Just don't do anything foolish

141
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:04,286
that would embarrass me like you did during rehearsal!

142
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:06,186
I'll pay closer attention.

143
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:08,386
Though you're all too ready to promise,

144
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:11,386
too bad you have zero acting talent.

145
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:14,086
I'm not even sure how someone like you

146
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:15,686
was allowed to go on the stage.

147
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:17,386
Put this away.

148
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:20,786
I quit drinking.

149
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:22,686
I understand.

150
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:26,586
What a nag.

151
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:29,986
I would've landed the big role much earlier

152
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:33,086
if it hadn't been for you nagging about this and that's.

153
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,386
Hurry up and realize that the audience

154
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:38,686
is sick of watching your mildew ridden act.

155
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:42,886
Well, from the next performance, I'll be the one in the spotlight.

156
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,186
What's wrong? Everything will be just fine.

157
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:54,086
I suppose but...

158
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:55,086
Where's Conan?

159
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:58,186
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find him.

160
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:00,786
Could it be that something happened?

161
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:04,386
Nah, no worries, he's always like this.

162
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:12,386
The moment of vengeance has come!

163
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:17,486
The curtains will soon rise.

164
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,886
The masque of death is ready to commence!

165
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:58,855
You don't have the slightest clue that this performance is about

166
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,755
to become your last.

167
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:06,855
Everything's okay.

168
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,755
Same here.

169
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:15,682
Conan, where are you?

170
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:33,082
How did a guy like him...

171
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:37,582
You said it, didn't you?

172
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:40,182
My dream is to see out the remainder

173
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:42,782
of my life on the stage.

174
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,982
I'm merely obliging by fulfilling your wish.

175
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:51,182
It's almost the climax.

176
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,182
I guess everything will somehow work out okay.

177
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,782
Yeah.

178
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,682
That Yabuki seems to really be into it today.

179
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:06,982
Could it be that he performs better during show time?

180
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:09,082
No matter, it'll be in this state that you put a sword

181
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,282
right through him.

182
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:15,982
Whatever happens, don't blame me.

183
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,082
It's an accident.

184
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:21,282
The acting of the two look as if they've switched, you say?

185
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:22,582
Yes.

186
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:24,682
Could I just be imagining things?

187
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:29,082
Yes, that must be it.

188
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:46,282
Your pleas for mercy will be in vain.

189
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:56,982
What? He shrieked?

190
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:59,882
I did it! I finally did it! I've killed Robert!

191
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:05,582
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:08,282
But it was an accident.

193
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:18,582
What was that sound just now?

194
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:23,882
What goes around comes around.

195
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:32,682
It would be fantastic if this were actual wine.

196
00:16:32,682 --> 00:16:35,682
Just to be safe, I'll go take a look at the stage lift.

197
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:55,182
Don't tell me that...

198
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,082
-Dad. -Ran.

199
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,082
He's still alive.

200
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:10,382
Ran, call an ambulance.

201
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:11,582
All right.

202
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,382
It's too late.

203
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:17,082
The poison's already going through his body.

204
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,482
This is the punishment for looking down on me

205
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:20,482
who knows how many times.

206
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:24,282
But, more importantly who switched the rapier for a real one?

207
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:27,282
I was the one who did.

208
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:31,482
Robert, that's punishment for making my daughter suffer.

209
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,482
What did you say?

210
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:36,082
Robert!

211
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:42,282
Mr. Yabuki!

212
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:44,182
What's going on?

213
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:46,582
When I found out that the rapier was genuine,

214
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:49,182
I switched roles with him

215
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:51,282
in place of repaying him what I owed him.

216
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:53,982
Everything was going fine

217
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:58,282
until I ended up falling into my own trap.

218
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:02,382
Hurry and shut off the power to the lift!

219
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,382
All right.

220
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,982
Just what is going on here?

221
00:18:07,982 --> 00:18:11,682
Robert.

222
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,082
Am I going to die?

223
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:16,082
A shock that small won't kill you.

224
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,082
Still, we'll need an ambulance!

225
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:28,582
But, when was the rapier switched?

226
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:32,682
The last time I checked, it was definitely the fake one.

227
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:36,882
It's the fake?

228
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,782
Of course it's the fake.

229
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:40,982
I was the one who secretly switched them.

230
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:42,782
And not only that,

231
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:44,782
I weakened the electrical flow,

232
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:47,382
and also switched the wine inside the decanter.

233
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:50,082
But I really panicked when...

234
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:59,582
Darn it.

235
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,382
After escaping from the coffin,

236
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:07,482
I used the genuine rapier to cut the rope.

237
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:08,782
And...

238
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:14,182
Right. The real rapier is missing.

239
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:20,882
How dangerous!

240
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:23,282
Darn it! I'm going tell them off!

241
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:25,582
I believed everything was all right at that point.

242
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,082
No, wait a second.

243
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:30,882
Rather than shocking him to death on the stage lift,

244
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:34,182
maybe this way I can be sure to kill him.

245
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:36,782
I wasn't the one who mistook the rapiers,

246
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,282
I can claim it was an accident.

247
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:42,082
Don't tell me that even Robert...

248
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:45,982
In a hurry, I switched it to the prop rapier.

249
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:48,982
Then, just to be safe, I went to Mr. Yabuki's dressing room,

250
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,482
and this time...

251
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,982
Even elephants are said to die with this.

252
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,682
So, as for that old man, he doesn't stand a chance.

253
00:19:57,682 --> 00:19:59,582
Dealing with one criminal is relatively simple,

254
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,882
but three is too many to handle.

255
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:05,382
And even if they were stopped now, there will be a next time.

256
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:07,182
So...

257
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,182
I have to save him, even though he's a criminal.

258
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:15,382
Well, I guess I'll take it.

259
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,082
-Mr. Komazuka, is everything going OK? -Yeah.

260
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:23,382
Please, Robert and Yabuki

261
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:24,982
are acting their first starring roles,

262
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:29,182
so please do guide them along the way.

263
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:33,882
Afterwards, the show began.

264
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:43,182
A bottle cap should be enough.

265
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,982
First, make Yabuki lose consciousness.

266
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:55,382
Next, Robert.

267
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:03,382
Oh, no.

268
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,882
And then, Mr. Komazuka.

269
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:31,782
The evidence is all here,

270
00:21:31,782 --> 00:21:34,682
so the three cannot deny what they did.

271
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:40,382
Well, if they'd promise not to do something stupid like this ever again,

272
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,682
and repent what they did, then...

273
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:45,582
Conan!

274
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:47,982
Where were you all this time?

275
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:50,982
Well, the restroom.

276
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:54,082
I've been looking everywhere for you!

277
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:55,982
I had my reasons too.

278
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,582
Apologize.

279
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,682
Yes. I'm sorry.

280
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:23,982
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -You act in a masque, dad?

281
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,582
Can you pull it off?

282
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,082
Of course, I can.

283
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:28,282
"Strange Attempted Murder Scenario" -Well...

284
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,282
"Plays Out At The Theater" -let's give it a try.

285
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:43,582
Is that supposed to be a masque?

286
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:45,082
Yes...

287
00:23:46,382 --> 00:23:50,882
"Next Episode" -I mean, why didn't you ask Pops Kogoro?

288
00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:52,282
That's right, that's right!

289
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:55,782
Mom is a lawyer, Dad is a detective!

290
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:58,382
If it is a stalker case, a detective is...

291
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:02,182
Don't hang up the phone!

292
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:07,582
Is it this closet?

293
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:16,382
Next Conan, "Might Over Mystery (Part 1)"

294
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:29,482
Next Conan's Hint:

295
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:31,682
"The trace of a ring."

296
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:34,182
Next episode, Mom and Dad makes up!

297
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,782
-Really? -Yes, really!
