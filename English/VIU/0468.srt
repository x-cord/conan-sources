1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:01,147
Bite!

2
00:00:02,647 --> 00:00:04,547
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:05,647
A violent exotic species,

4
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:07,047
an annoying new inhabitant in the lake,

5
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:08,847
and the unexpected connection of a man wanting to breed them.

6
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:10,247
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:11,747
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:13,947
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:07,396
"Beika Central Park"

10
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,340
What's up?

11
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,440
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

12
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,040
Oh, it's you guys.

13
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,340
Are you investigating a case?

14
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,440
Yeah.

15
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,040
At the Fukurokouji residence over there.

16
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,940
Late last night...

17
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,140
Robber!

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,640
So he got away just like that.

19
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,340
The amount stolen was three million yen.

20
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,540
The robber had gloves on, so we couldn't get any fingerprints.

21
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,440
He also wore a mask, so we don't know what he looks like either.

22
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,340
The only clue we have is that he is tall and skinny.

23
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,940
We're trying to get clues as to where he may have fled

24
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,140
and are looking for witnesses.

25
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,740
I guess you won't be needing the Youth Detective Squad's help, then.

26
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,240
Yeah, a burglary is a case that should be handled by the police.

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,340
-Yeah. -Let's hurry and go to Beika Central Park!

28
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,240
At Beika Central Park, they're...

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,540
They're working on that thing

30
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,040
that was reported to the city hall this morning.

31
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,440
Please stand back! It's dangerous!

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,140
Stand back from the lake a little more!

33
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
Where is it? Is it really here?

34
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,640
Don't push, Genta!

35
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,440
Even you're afraid of it, Conan.

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
There it is!

37
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,740
Over here, over here!

38
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,640
There, there!

39
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
No doubt about it.

40
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,240
That's an alligator snapping turtle.

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
Alligator snapping turtle?

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,640
"Lakeside Mystery"

43
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,640
I wonder if someone kept it as a pet?

44
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,440
It's a turtle that didn't originally exist in Japan.

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,740
So I think the owner secretly disposed of it

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,240
because the turtle was hard to keep.

47
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,840
It is called the alligator snapping turtle

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,740
and it lives mainly in North America and Mexico.

49
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,840
It has an aggressive character and strong jaws.

50
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,840
It can easily bite off the finger of a human being.

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,540
No one should keep something so dangerous as pets.

52
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,040
In this world, to each is his own.

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,340
There are people who fill empty spaces in their hearts

54
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,440
by keeping things like them as pets.

55
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
What a lonely person.

56
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,340
I wonder if there are people who aren't lonely?

57
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,140
I wonder if that's the reason why reptiles are popular now?

58
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,640
Well, I don't really like reptiles.

59
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,740
But it's not that I don't understand how people that raise them feel.

60
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,440
Everyone is free to keep what they want.

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,540
But to dispose of the animal is too irresponsible.

62
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,640
That's right.

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah, letting an animal that doesn't originally exist in Japan go free,

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,640
could throw the original ecosystem off balance.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,040
So it is an unforgivable action.

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,340
Isn't it good that there's more of these animals?

67
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,040
No, that's not the point.

68
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,140
But we can't just leave the alligator snapping turtle here!

69
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,440
Let's go and track down the person

70
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,940
who disposed of such an dangerous animal!

71
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,540
-Yeah. -That's right.

72
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,840
It's the mission of the Youth Detective Squad!

73
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,540
But how?

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,740
Always fighting for justice, the Youth Detective Squad.

75
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,140
Huh?

76
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,740
Let's do this, then.

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,040
I'm sure we'll be able to track down the owner,

78
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,540
if we check the pet shops one after the other.

79
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
Since the alligator snapping turtle have a big appetite,

80
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,140
the owner must've frequently go to the pet shop

81
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,540
to buy feed such as little fish or crawfish.

82
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,040
Did I hit the bull's eye?

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,340
I see. Let's do that.

84
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
You're smart.

85
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,140
What's the matter, Conan?

86
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,840
You're the one who got rid of the alligator snapping turtle, right?

87
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,640
I finally have a boyfriend.

88
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,740
But...

89
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,040
He didn't like reptiles, right?

90
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,340
Yes.

91
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,240
After that, things just got complicated.

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,140
But it's good

93
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,040
that you found someone to fill the empty space in your heart, isn't it?

94
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,840
But no matter what the reason,

95
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,340
disposing of an animal is...

96
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,140
Huh? Haibara?

97
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,240
I just remembered that there's something I have to do, so count me out.

98
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,740
Where is it?

99
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,740
-It got away! -No doubt about it.

100
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,240
He's my pet turtle, Kamejiro.

101
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,440
Are you the owner of that alligator snapping turtle?

102
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,840
Excuse me.

103
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,540
My name is Nihonmatsu.

104
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,240
I live in an apartment on 3-chome.

105
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,640
Yesterday, when I took my eyes off him for a moment, he fled.

106
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,440
I had no idea he would come this far.

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,940
Please catch him as soon as possible

108
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,540
and return him back to me.

109
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,340
Just what is that man talking about?

110
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,840
That turtle is mine.

111
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,240
A turtle with more than one owner.

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,340
Very interesting.

113
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Hey, hey.

114
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,640
Is that turtle really yours?

115
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,140
I couldn't possibly made a mistake.

116
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,840
After all, it's such a rare turtle.

117
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,940
But it's strange.

118
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,840
That lady over there is saying that she left the turtle here yesterday.

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Huh?

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,040
I didn't think the real owner would appear.

121
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,640
Why'd you say it was your turtle?

122
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
Well, you see, the reason is...

123
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,440
I want to atone my wrongdoings.

124
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,040
Atone your wrongdoings?

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,940
I bought a red-eared slider at a fair when I was a child.

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,840
But I gradually got tired of taking care of it everyday.

127
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
I eventually disposed of it in a nearby swamp.

128
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,940
But I regretted what I did all these years.

129
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,340
And when I heard that a alligator snapping turtle was found by this lake,

130
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,140
I was sure that someone left it.

131
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,740
The turtle isn't to blame, so I felt sorry for it.

132
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,440
That's why I was thinking of taking the turtle home with me and keep it.

133
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,040
I want to make up for abandoning my red-eared slider away in the past.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,640
Is that right?

135
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,040
Such a good person.

136
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,140
Please give your turtle to me, Ms. Kimata.

137
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,940
I will take good care of it.

138
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Please consider it.

139
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,340
Of course. I'd like you to do just that.

140
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,140
Please keep it for me.

141
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
Thank you.

142
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,640
Of course. Of course.

143
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,640
How lucky, Mr. Nihonmatsu.

144
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,440
There couldn't have been a happier ending for the turtle, too.

145
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
It really found the best possible owner. Right, Conan?

146
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,840
Well, yeah...

147
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,840
-Maybe they... -Maybe they...

148
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm sorry, excuse me.

149
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,140
You got the turtle!

150
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
No, that's not it.

151
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,340
Look.

152
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,640
There are...

153
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,140
Alligator snapping turtle?

154
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,440
There's one on this side, too!

155
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,740
There's another one on this side, too!

156
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,540
Which means there are...

157
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,440
Four in total?

158
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,340
What's with this lake?

159
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,540
Mr. Nihonmatsu, which one is your turtle?

160
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,340
Well...

161
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,740
It's okay.

162
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,040
Let me take all the alligator snapping turtles in this lake home with me.

163
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,140
All of them?

164
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,740
What?

165
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,640
Well, all the turtles have been abandoned.

166
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,040
I feel sorry for them.

167
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,140
Mr. Nihonmatsu.

168
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,040
You're really a kind person, aren't you?

169
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,240
There's no need to cry.

170
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,940
Huh? That finger.

171
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,240
What happened?

172
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Well, this really is nothing.

173
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
All right!

174
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,340
Caught the first one!

175
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,940
Be careful. That's how they are.

176
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,340
He bites at you suddenly like that.

177
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,040
How scary.

178
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,440
But the more you look at it, the cuter it looks.

179
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,140
I love turtles after all.

180
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,840
That's probably because you used to keep a red-eared slider before.

181
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,240
Yeah, that's probably why.

182
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,940
That turtle was cute and beautiful, too.

183
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,640
The shell would get greener and more vivid as it grows.

184
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,340
This man...

185
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
What?

186
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,140
You mean, that man?

187
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,740
What about him that you can't believe, Conan?

188
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,040
Everything.

189
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,240
For example, the red-eared slider

190
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,940
has a vivid green shell only when it's young.

191
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,940
The shell gets darker as it grows.

192
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,140
It was beautiful, too.

193
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,740
The shell would get greener and more vivid as it grows.

194
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,640
It's just not possible.

195
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,140
If he really kept a turtle, that's something he should know.

196
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,240
Which means that he lied?

197
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,140
He lied about throwing the turtle away in the swamp, too?

198
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,240
That's right.

199
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,340
The story about him wanting to make up to the turtle is a lie, too.

200
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,640
I may as well add

201
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,340
that he doesn't think turtles are cute at all.

202
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,840
On the other hand, it seems as if he has a grudge against turtles.

203
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
That's how they are.

204
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,340
He bites at you suddenly like that.

205
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,940
Everything's a lie.

206
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,440
Then why does he want to take all of the turtles with him?

207
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,940
Is he going to be taken to the castle under the sea for having saved them?

208
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Hey, hey.

209
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,040
I got it.

210
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,940
I know what Mr. Nihonmatsu is up to.

211
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,240
I'll unmask his real character.

212
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,340
Mitsuhiko!

213
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,140
Genta, will you keep an eye on that man?

214
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,640
-Conan! -Conan!

215
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,240
What kind of person he is?

216
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
He doesn't seem like a bad person,

217
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,040
but debt collectors come to see him everyday and he hasn't pay his rent.

218
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,140
As far as I'm concerned, he's a troublesome tenant.

219
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,440
He seems to be having financial problems.

220
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
It's hard to think he has enough money to keep those turtles.

221
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,240
A lot of money will be needed.

222
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,640
Maybe he don't intend to keep, but to sell them off and make money?

223
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,040
No, the normal range for the turtle is 4,000 yen to 8,000 yen each.

224
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,340
Even if he sell all four turtles, he wouldn't be able to pay rent.

225
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,240
It's not to sell them, then.

226
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,340
He must have a different reason for wanting to have them.

227
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,440
We've caught the second one!

228
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,940
But if you plan on keeping all four,

229
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,340
what about an aquarium for them?

230
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,840
That's right. I'll have to get one ready right away.

231
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,140
Please contact me after you have caught all four of them.

232
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,340
I'll come back again.

233
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,340
So far everything is going well.

234
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,340
But I thought there was going to be only one turtle.

235
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,240
Turns out that there's four of them.

236
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,940
He's sighing.

237
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,040
It seems like he only wanted one alligator snapping turtle of the four.

238
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,740
But he doesn't seem to know which turtle is the one he wants.

239
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,640
That's why he had no choice but to take all of the turtles.

240
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,240
He just wants one turtle out of the four?

241
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,940
I'm sure that there's something special

242
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,040
about that one turtle that he wants.

243
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I know.

244
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
It's one million yen including the interest and all, right?

245
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,440
I've already got the money.

246
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,840
It's just that I can't get a hold of it yet.

247
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,940
One million?

248
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,640
I'll be able to give you back the money either today or tomorrow.

249
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,440
I hope you know what's going to happen if you don't keep your word.

250
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,540
I wish they would catch the turtles quick.

251
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,740
What did he mean by that just now?

252
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,240
I guess it means that he'll be able to pay his debts back

253
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
if he gets the alligator snapping turtle that he's after.

254
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,140
How does that turtle connect with one million yen?

255
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,640
I got it!

256
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,740
Maybe there's some kind of map on the shell of the turtle?

257
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,240
Like the place that gold and diamonds are hidden?

258
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Hey, Genta.

259
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,840
Who, when and for what reason would someone draw a map like that?

260
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,940
Well, you see...

261
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,840
Let me help you, granny.

262
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,040
Genta ran off just in the nick of time.

263
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,840
We've caught the third one!

264
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,940
Just one more to go.

265
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,040
Alligator snapping turtle and one million yen...

266
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,540
What is it?

267
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,840
Maybe this is...

268
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Remember what Officer Takagi was saying this morning?

269
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,240
The robber last night had gloves and a mask on.

270
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,840
I'll go look for Officer Takagi!

271
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,740
-Ayumi! -It's not confirmed that these are the robber's, though.

272
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,940
But as far as the time is concerned, it matches.

273
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,540
Although it rained a bit last night, this isn't wet.

274
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,240
Which means that these were burnt after it stopped raining.

275
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,840
That's between late last night to early this morning.

276
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
I see.

277
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,540
That means, it's possible that these belong to the robber last night?

278
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,240
After stealing three million yen from a certain house,

279
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
he ran in here.

280
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,440
And he got rid of the things he used.

281
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,740
Maybe the two cases are connected in some way.

282
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,340
The two cases?

283
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,240
Last night's robbery

284
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,640
and Mr. Nihonmatsu wanting to get hold of the turtles in the lake.

285
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,840
-What? -What?

286
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,679
What?

287
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,379
Are you saying that the man called Nihonmatsu

288
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,479
is the one who robbed the house last night?

289
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:12,079
Yeah. You said that the robber was tall and skinny, right?

290
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,579
Well, I did.

291
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,179
He's tall and skinny, too.

292
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,979
Besides, he said...

293
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:22,079
I'll be able to give you back the money either today or tomorrow.

294
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,679
Furthermore, there's a bandage around his finger.

295
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,179
He probably wounded his finger

296
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:29,079
when he tried to get rid of the evidence here.

297
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,079
That's how they are.

298
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,579
He bites at you suddenly like that.

299
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,579
I think he was bitten by the alligator snapping turtle.

300
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,679
But there's one thing that I still can't figure out.

301
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,679
I get it.

302
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,579
You can't figure out why he wants to take the turtles home with him, right?

303
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,479
-I've figured it out! -What?

304
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:52,879
Listen. Last night, he stole the money and fled here.

305
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,279
He took off his mask

306
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,879
and gloves

307
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,179
because he wanted to burn the evidence here.

308
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,479
But just then...

309
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,679
The alligator snapping turtle that bit his finger saw his face.

310
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,079
But it turned out that there were four alligator snapping turtles here.

311
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:24,579
He couldn't tell which turtle saw him, so he...

312
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,279
Conan, if he's the robber,

313
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,679
he should already have gotten hold of the three million yen.

314
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,679
Yet, why is it that he still can't pay back his debts?

315
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,579
Yeah, that's the question.

316
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,679
This is the fourth and last one!

317
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,179
Hey, wait for me!

318
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:46,879
You want to find the guy from this morning who told us about the turtles?

319
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:52,479
He didn't say his name but he sounded young.

320
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,079
It's probably him.

321
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,579
He asked the City Hall to do it since he couldn't catch the turtle himself.

322
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:02,379
But why does he need the alligator snapping turtle so badly?

323
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,779
I've already got the money.

324
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,279
It's just that I can't get a hold of it yet.

325
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,479
So why can't he get a hold of the money?

326
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:15,279
Last night, one of these turtles bit that person's finger.

327
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,779
But that doesn't explain everything.

328
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:21,079
It's so big! Anything would fit into it.

329
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,979
Be careful, Shu. It's dangerous!

330
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:24,079
Come on, let's go home.

331
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,179
Could it be that...

332
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:31,179
But it's not impossible.

333
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:35,979
Hey, I think you should check these alligator snapping turtles right away.

334
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:38,279
What would we be looking for?

335
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,779
Just as I thought.

336
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,979
What? You won't let me have them?

337
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:58,679
No, that's not it.

338
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,379
It'll take a week for the papers to process.

339
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,779
That long?

340
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:07,879
I have to wait for a week?

341
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,879
What a bummer.

342
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:10,879
That's right.

343
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:14,379
He's started moving.

344
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:18,979
Let's see...

345
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:21,079
I'm sure it was 304, 304.

346
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,079
Here it is.

347
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,079
What's wrong?

348
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,379
That's weird.

349
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:28,479
No use to keep trying.

350
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,379
You want to pay a one week rental fee, right?

351
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,379
Because if you leave it inside for more than three days,

352
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,979
the management will deem that something is wrong and retrieve it.

353
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:40,779
No, well, that's...

354
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:43,479
Unfortunately, coin lockers are made

355
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:48,279
so that unless you insert the key, you can't insert money.

356
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,879
That's right.

357
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,479
I'm going to open that locker.

358
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,979
The police?

359
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,279
Mr. Nihonmatsu, can you explain why the money's here?

360
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,679
Darn it.

361
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,379
Since you were in debt and troubled,

362
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:18,479
you broke into the Fukurokouji residence last night

363
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:21,679
and succeeded in getting away with three million yen, right?

364
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,579
But putting the money in the locker was a mistake.

365
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:28,979
I thought I was lucky back then.

366
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,779
I am exhausted...

367
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,979
Are you okay, mister?

368
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,479
Let's find a place to rest before we continue.

369
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,879
No, I can't afford being questioned.

370
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,879
Are you all right?

371
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,779
Talk about lucky!

372
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,979
Oh, no. I've got to hide this, too.

373
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:54,479
Minami, Megumi...

374
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:57,679
But I was out of 100 yen coins.

375
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,379
You got rid of the evidence in the empty park

376
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:04,279
and you planned to come back here in the morning to retrieve the money.

377
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,679
So you thought everything worked out fine.

378
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,679
But just then, something unexpected happened.

379
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,479
No way!

380
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,279
Why did you do that?

381
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,679
Hey, spit it out.

382
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,579
Spit that key out!

383
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:30,379
Why you...

384
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:37,979
No.

385
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,679
So that's what happened.

386
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,679
The turtle swallowed his precious key.

387
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,879
I couldn't believe such a thing was possible,

388
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,379
but these are the results of the X-Ray.

389
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,379
Then he reported the turtle to the police

390
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,679
and decided to have them catch it for him.

391
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,079
He did that so he could get the key out of the turtle's stomach.

392
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,979
But why'd he have to do something so troublesome?

393
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,679
All he had to do was go to the management

394
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,979
and have them open the locker for him, right?

395
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,479
No way!

396
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,279
He could have them open it if he did so,

397
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,379
but they'd check to make sure the stuff in the locker belonged to him.

398
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,979
If they find three million yen in the bag,

399
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:19,779
they'd be able to link it to the robbery from last night.

400
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,079
I see.

401
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,579
That's why he had no choice but to get hold of the turtles.

402
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,479
-He's running away! -He's running away!

403
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,979
I won't let you get away!

404
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:35,479
Take that!

405
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:46,279
Gosh.

406
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,979
I tell you.

407
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:50,579
You shouldn't dispose something that dangerous in the lake of a park.

408
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:51,979
Absolutely.

409
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:55,779
But you have no right to criticize the person who did that.

410
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:59,679
You broke into a person's house last night and stole three million yen.

411
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,979
I'm arresting you as a suspect.

412
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,279
That's good, isn't it?

413
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,779
All four turtles have found someone to keep them.

414
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,179
Although they are dangerous creatures,

415
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,879
it'd be pretty cruel to abandon them.

416
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:39,779
Hey!

417
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:40,879
Big news!

418
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:44,079
This time, they're saying that a crane appeared up ahead!

419
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,979
And it's not just one crane!

420
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:48,979
-Let's go! -Hey, we'll be late!

421
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,179
After turtles, now it's cranes.

422
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:55,479
That's just great.

423
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,979
"Next Episode"

424
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:02,679
Thief Kid!

425
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,379
There are five members from the Riot Task Force below the window.

426
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,579
It's difficult to break in from here.

427
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,579
A blackout!

428
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:13,179
Look! The painting's gone!

429
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:16,279
Right. It disappeared as if it were an illusion.

430
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:21,779
I'll rip off your snobbish mask today for sure, Thief Kid!

431
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:27,879
Next Conan, "Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 1)"

432
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,279
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,179
"An illustration of the warning letter"

434
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,479
That thieving Thief Kid makes a showy appearance in April,

435
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,179
the start of the new semester.

436
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,879
How devilishly thrilling.
