1
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:07,286
Th-This house...

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:08,995
That's right.

3
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:14,646
It's the villa you built with the money you scammed from stupid women like me.

4
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:19,066
The love nest you've been sharing with some bitch.

5
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:23,095
I-It's not like that with her.

6
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:25,485
Y-You've got it all wrong, honey.

7
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:27,345
What a shame.

8
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:30,536
Your excuses won't reach my ears.

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,616
Make all the excuses you want in the afterlife.

10
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:46,896
Goodbye, darling.

11
00:00:47,886 --> 00:00:52,096
We came to Gunma prefecture to pick wild plants with Kobayashi-sensei

12
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:55,306
and Wakasa-sensei of Teitan Elementary School.

13
00:00:56,146 --> 00:01:00,335
Zenda Maika-san, who quit her teaching job at the elementary school

14
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:03,676
the previous week to get married, took us into the mountains.

15
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:11,576
However, while we were looking elsewhere, someone abandoned the body of a man there.

16
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:16,496
That man was Zenda-san's fiancé.

17
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:28,666
Did someone really move the body

18
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:32,576
while we were picking wild plants?

19
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:38,566
The dirt on Zenda-san's right arm is odd.

20
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:45,986
As well as all the cardboard boxes in her car.

21
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:55,856
And then there's the four-leaf clover Ayumi-chan lost track of.

22
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,365
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

23
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,775
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

24
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,765
We encounter a case in the woods of Gunma!

25
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,685
Where did that four-leaf clover go?

26
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:11,225
Always determining the one truth

27
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:13,135
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

28
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:15,836
his name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:57,646 --> 00:04:00,786
"Picking Wild Plants and Clovers, Part Two!"

30
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:11,095
Wow. Somebody built a grand villa here.

31
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,235
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:15,776
And in front of the gate, there's a bloodstain?

33
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,556
Yes. It would seem that this was the scene of the murder.

34
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:23,976
The weapon was probably a 20 cm-long kitchen knife.

35
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:29,736
It was wrapped in newspaper and left in a garbage bag inside the villa.

36
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:32,705
And? Was anyone inside the house?

37
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,616
Yes.

38
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:39,116
Inside a closet, we found a rather weak woman whose hands were covered in blood.

39
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:41,496
What? A-A woman?

40
00:04:41,926 --> 00:04:45,325
She's currently being taken to the station for questioning.

41
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,875
She says she's Uruma Shigefumi's girlfriend

42
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:50,986
but had nothing to do with the murder.

43
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:54,845
She remembers last night up until she had some wine.

44
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:57,735
When she woke up, she was trapped inside the closet.

45
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:01,515
Her fear of dark cramped spaces made her panic, so she couldn't get out.

46
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:02,266
Ah, right.

47
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,896
"So dark! So cramped! So scary!"

48
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:06,266
You mean that thing.

49
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,866
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:14,526
But there wasn't any wine in the villa, and the closet wasn't locked.

51
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:17,826
It's possible that she's making it up.

52
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:24,536
I had a high school classmate with a fear of dark cramped spaces.

53
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,036
It seemed pretty questionable.

54
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:31,785
And besides, this place is less than 50 meters away from where the body was discovered.

55
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:35,046
A woman would be strong enough to drag the body there.

56
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:40,565
In other words, that woman got into a fight with the victim and killed him,

57
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,806
but she didn't know what to do with the body.

58
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,066
Some people picking wild plants showed up in a car.

59
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:51,606
Among them was a woman the victim was trying to con.

60
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:54,795
Believing she could frame that woman,

61
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:57,366
she dragged the body to the car.

62
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,615
But the body was found sooner than she expected,

63
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:03,366
and the police arrived right away,

64
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,035
so she hid herself inside the closet.

65
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,615
How does that sound, huh?

66
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:08,875
Sounds good to me.

67
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,675
I don't think that's right.

68
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:11,376
What?

69
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:16,975
After all, that woman's hands were covered in that man's blood, right?

70
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,256
Y-Yeah.

71
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:24,655
If a weak woman wanted to drag a body, she'd carry it by the legs.

72
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:28,646
But there weren't any bloody hand prints on the body's pants.

73
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,896
You're right.

74
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,146
Wait a minute.

75
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,576
You shouldn't be wandering around the crime scene.

76
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,506
Sensei.

77
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:48,125
Please keep an eye on your children.

78
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,836
C-Conan-kun?

79
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:55,136
Jeez. He's just like the old man.

80
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,556
A four-leaf clover?

81
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:06,976
Wait a minute.

82
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:12,476
If this is the four-leaf clover Ayumi-chan found...

83
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:22,486
Then all those unassembled cardboard boxes in the car,

84
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:27,256
and the dirt on her right arm up to her elbow...

85
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:29,996
Could it be?

86
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:32,756
I knew it.

87
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,416
There are tire tracks behind the tires.

88
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:38,546
I'm certain of it.

89
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,136
She's the culprit.

90
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:45,566
She brought us here so we would find it.

91
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:52,656
This body that she made appear, as though by magic.

92
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:07,265
There's a lot about this case that's puzzling, but when you came here and parked your car,

93
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,585
as this photo shows, there wasn't anything beside the car.

94
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:17,315
If the body was placed against the tree behind the car while you were picking wild plants,

95
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:20,626
then while you were distracted by your plant harvesting,

96
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,546
someone must have secretly left the body here.

97
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:30,306
Since the victim attempted to con you with marriage fraud,

98
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:33,356
they must've meant to frame you.

99
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:34,995
No...

100
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:37,856
So have you figured out who the culprit is?

101
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:38,876
Yes.

102
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:41,955
It was probably the woman claiming to be the victim's girlfriend

103
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:47,856
who we found hiding inside the closet of the victim's villa through these woods.

104
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:54,085
But weren't that woman's hands covered in blood?

105
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:59,756
If she moved the body, her bloody hand prints should be on it.

106
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,055
Yes, you mentioned that earlier.

107
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:07,775
She probably washed her hands before moving the body.

108
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:10,645
But since the police arrived sooner than she anticipated,

109
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:14,535
she panicked and accidentally touched the bloody knife with her bare hands

110
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:18,186
while putting it in a trash bag.

111
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:23,115
But if she had time to do that, wouldn't she have fled the scene?

112
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:27,076
I'm telling you, she panicked.

113
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:32,206
In any case, we'll handle the rest of this investigation.

114
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:35,956
You all are free to leave for the day.

115
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,455
I don't have a choice.

116
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:41,466
I didn't want to use this in front of Wakasa-sensei, but...

117
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,836
Hey, Inspector Yamamura.

118
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:46,526
Over here.

119
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:47,216
What is it?

120
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,036
It's right here.

121
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:54,266
Look closely.

122
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,056
What am I supposed to be—

123
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:04,135
Inspector Yamamura?

124
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,026
Wake up. Are you okay?

125
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,495
I-Is something the matter, Inspector?

126
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,656
You're damn right something's the matter.

127
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:14,656
I set up the joke for you guys, but you didn't correct me.

128
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,705
What? That was a joke?

129
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:18,416
Yes.

130
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:24,166
The idea that the culprit left the body here while they were picking wild plants is a huge joke.

131
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:26,746
After all,

132
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:30,735
the body was right here where I'm sitting now the whole time.

133
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,156
What?!

134
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,396
Over here.

135
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:39,016
What is it?

136
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:42,826
It's right here.

137
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,026
Look closely.

138
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,276
What am I supposed to be—

139
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:55,975
Inspector Yamamura?

140
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:57,826
Wake up. Are you okay?

141
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:00,375
I-Is something the matter, Inspector?

142
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,456
You're damn right something's the matter.

143
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:06,466
I set up the joke for you guys, but you didn't correct me.

144
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:09,525
What? That was a joke?

145
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:10,216
Yes.

146
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:15,976
The idea that the culprit left the body here while they were picking wild plants is a huge joke.

147
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,576
After all,

148
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:22,535
the body was right here where I'm sitting now the whole time.

149
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,106
What?!

150
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:29,736
Naturally, it was here long before they came to pick wild plants.

151
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:35,135
Didn't you just say there wasn't anything here before we arrived?

152
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:36,235
Liar.

153
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:40,206
You're trying to confuse everyone by making things up again, aren't you?

154
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:44,086
I love cashews, but I hate being confused.

155
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:48,426
Inspector Yamamura, they have a terrible opinion of you.

156
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:51,296
Besides, didn't you check it earlier?

157
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:58,095
There wasn't a body in the photo we took when we arrived.

158
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,306
So why?

159
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,445
Of course it wasn't in the photo.

160
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,196
What?

161
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:07,056
At that time, the body was hidden behind the car.

162
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,955
Wh-What are you talking about?

163
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:15,076
Are you saying someone moved the car while we were picking wild plants?

164
00:12:15,326 --> 00:12:16,655
Remember what we said?

165
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:20,045
We didn't hear the sound of the car's engine then.

166
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:24,265
It's possible to move a car without starting the engine,

167
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:26,086
even for a little girl like you.

168
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:30,115
A picture is worth a thousand words.

169
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,466
Why don't we perform an experiment?

170
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:34,696
You there.

171
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:36,035
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:40,445
Could you borrow the car keys and do as I say?

173
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:41,476
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:47,106
Also, make sure you write down my deduction so we don't forget it.

175
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,816
Yes, sir. The keys, please.

176
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:54,116
Once you're seated in the driver's seat,

177
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:57,116
insert the car keys in the ignition.

178
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,616
Turn the key to the "ON" position one step before "START."

179
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:07,015
Depress the brake pedal while unlocking the gearshift

180
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:10,126
and shift from park to neutral.

181
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,126
Once you've done that, you can get out of the car.

182
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,125
Leave the key in the ignition.

183
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,466
Yes, sir.

184
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,136
Now we're ready to begin. Kobayashi-sensei.

185
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:24,075
Yes?

186
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:27,365
Could you please move the car towards me?

187
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,135
I can't do that.

188
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:30,896
I don't have a license.

189
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,525
It's all right.

190
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:36,656
Simply put your hand on top of the front tire and push it.

191
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,716
Push the tire?

192
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:42,396
I don't think this will work.

193
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,265
It moved.

194
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,006
Kobayashi-sensei, you're so strong.

195
00:13:57,846 --> 00:13:59,495
But how?

196
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:01,645
The tires are linked together.

197
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:05,766
You can easily move all of them with only the strength required to move one.

198
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:10,485
So when you took that photo when you arrived,

199
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:15,776
the body was probably hidden behind the car like this.

200
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:23,076
Then the tree that was behind the car when we took the photo was that tree.

201
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:24,116
Yes.

202
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,095
And to prove it,

203
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:32,195
the thing Ayumi-chan was looking for is right next to the front tire.

204
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:34,046
The thing I was looking for?

205
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:38,646
Is next to the front tire?

206
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:45,486
It's the four-leaf clover!

207
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,435
Seriously?

208
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:50,056
But what is it doing here?

209
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:54,025
The reason you couldn't find it earlier, no matter how hard you looked for it,

210
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,026
was because the car had moved slightly.

211
00:14:57,366 --> 00:15:03,406
In other words, this is where the car was parked when you took that photo.

212
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,036
Another piece of evidence...

213
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:12,416
is the tire tracks left behind the rear tires when the car was moved forward.

214
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:17,796
I asked the forensics team to take some photos.

215
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:23,426
There's only one person who could have done this.

216
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:26,766
Only one person who could've parked the car here,

217
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:31,936
and pushed the front tire to move the car.

218
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:36,286
Zenda Maika-san, it could only have been you.

219
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:43,445
First, roughly six hours ago,

220
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:48,195
you took the victim to his villa roughly 50 meters from here

221
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,495
and stabbed him with a knife.

222
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,336
You dragged the body through the woods,

223
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:56,966
and left it here where I'm leaning now.

224
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:01,145
Then you picked up Conan-kun and his classmates,

225
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,785
who came to check things out for their wild plant picking class,

226
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:07,176
in your car and parked it in its current position so the body would be hidden.

227
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:15,816
B-But, Inspector, wouldn't the people inside the car see the body when the car was parked?

228
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:19,816
Not a problem. Look closely at the car windows.

229
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:23,316
The rear and right side windows specifically.

230
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,506
Rear and side windows?

231
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,456
Something's covering them.

232
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:36,365
Those are unassembled cardboard boxes.

233
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:40,005
By leaving lots of them on the car seat,

234
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:41,695
she could have them move them out of the way

235
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:45,786
by placing them against the windows and block them that way.

236
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:51,605
After parking the car here, Zenda-san left the car in neutral instead of park,

237
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:56,856
turned off the engine, and left the key in the ignition when she exited the car.

238
00:16:57,146 --> 00:17:02,185
Once she took a photo that made it look like there was no body next to the car,

239
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:03,616
she was ready to go.

240
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:07,326
She simply waited for someone to say they were thirsty,

241
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:12,576
and invited a child to go with her to retrieve the drinks in the car.

242
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:16,325
After getting the bags containing the drinks out of the car,

243
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,586
she claimed to have lost her earring.

244
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:21,385
While pretending to look for her earring with the child,

245
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:26,385
she used her right hand to turn the tire and slowly move the car,

246
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:31,096
making the body appear as though by magic.

247
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:37,726
Kobayashi-sensei, you have dirt on your left arm up to your elbow, don't you?

248
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:38,866
What?

249
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:43,505
Yes, I do. How did this happen?

250
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:46,986
It's because you used your left hand to rotate the tire.

251
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:51,866
There should be a similar stain on Zenda-san's elbow.

252
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:55,876
There should be mud on her right elbow because she used her right hand to rotate the tire.

253
00:17:56,116 --> 00:18:01,376
A very strange stain to acquire if all she was doing was searching for an earring on the ground.

254
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:07,295
Additionally, you're probably also the person who trapped the victim's girlfriend

255
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,636
inside the closet at the his villa.

256
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:15,136
You heard about her love of wine and fear of dark, cramped places.

257
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:19,225
You knew the victim you were meeting early this morning

258
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:22,065
probably wouldn't drink the wine,

259
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:26,905
so last night you gave him the drugged wine

260
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:30,666
knowing only she would drink it and fall asleep.

261
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:36,416
After stabbing the victim, you used his key to enter the villa,

262
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:40,455
wiped the victim's blood on the sleeping woman's hands,

263
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:42,666
and stuffed her inside the closet.

264
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,255
That way, even if she woke up,

265
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,245
her fear of dark, cramped places

266
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:51,335
would keep her trapped inside the closet until the police found her.

267
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:55,806
By leaving the knife in a garbage bag at the villa and taking the wine with you,

268
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,985
you ruined the credibility of her statement

269
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:02,006
and were able to frame her.

270
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:06,005
Judging by how much the victim bled,

271
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:09,196
the culprit was probably covered in his blood.

272
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:14,735
When you killed him, if you drove this car here with the victim,

273
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,206
it should probably turn up somewhere on the driver's seat.

274
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:22,586
Wiping the seat down isn't enough to get rid of a luminol reaction.

275
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:25,086
Am I wrong?

276
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:28,706
You're wrong!

277
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:31,596
Zenda-sensei really was looking for her earring!

278
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:35,726
The car didn't move then!

279
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:40,986
I wanted to... I wanted to give this four-leaf clover

280
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:44,526
to Zenda-sensei...

281
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:53,545
There's no way she did it!

282
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:54,586
Yoshida-san.

283
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:58,865
I'm sorry, Yoshida-san.

284
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,916
I can't accept your four-leaf clover.

285
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:07,756
I'm a bad person who took someone's life.

286
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:12,246
I don't deserve good fortune before I'm punished for that.

287
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:19,636
So you should give that to someone you want to make happy.

288
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:28,366
Zenda-sensei, are you saying you really killed that man?

289
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:29,946
Yes.

290
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,696
Because I realized he was a con artist who commits marriage fraud,

291
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:40,086
I plotted to kill him and frame his girlfriend for it.

292
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:44,956
But... quitting my teaching job was the right choice.

293
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:52,166
I used a child to fabricate an alibi for my own crime.

294
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:56,326
I've failed as a teacher.

295
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:30,765
Huh? What happened to the case?

296
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,536
What are you talking about?

297
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,825
You did an amazing job solving it, Inspector.

298
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:37,616
Right, Wakasa-sensei?

299
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,866
Yes, you really did.

300
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:47,775
What should I do with this clover?

301
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:49,575
Why don't you keep it?

302
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,465
Didn't Zenda-sensei say you should give it to someone?

303
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:56,626
Yes, someone who you want to make happy.

304
00:23:00,576 --> 00:23:02,266
Wakasa-sensei.

305
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:06,975
You can have this four-leaf clover, Wakasa-sensei.

306
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:07,596
What?

307
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:12,626
After all, you're pretty clumsy. It'll keep you safe.

308
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:15,106
Thank you.

309
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:18,106
I'll wrap it in my handkerchief.

310
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:20,635
I'll treasure this.

311
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:21,616
Okay.

312
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:25,996
Anyway, I wonder where Conan went.

313
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:29,385
I saw him hiding behind the tree with the inspector.

314
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:31,496
He must be trying to steal a march on us again.

315
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:48,155
I did it for Erina.

316
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:51,146
No, Shohei-san did nothing wrong.

317
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,776
Wherever there's a case, Mori Kogoro is there.

318
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:58,785
It's so good, I could eat it every day and never get sick of it.

319
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:00,276
Right, Erina?

320
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:02,906
What's the secret ingredient?

321
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:05,036
It's love.
