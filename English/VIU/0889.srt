1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,200
-Good morning. -Good morning.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,700
-Good morning. -Good morning.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,500
Good morning.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,999
Good morning, Conan and Haibara...

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,699
Good... good morning.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,799
You two were at the library where Thief Kid showed up, weren't you?

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,399
And Dr. Agasa!

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,399
Who was Thief Kid disguised as?

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,399
Conan, did you beat Thief Kid?

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,100
Tell us!

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,899
What?

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,099
Thief Kid disguised himself as Dr. Agasa?

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,299
-Yeah. -And you couldn't tell immediately?

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,799
He was bending his knees to make himself Doc's height.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,499
Impressive as always.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,499
The actual Doc was knocked out with a stun gun

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,799
and stuffed into a bathroom stall.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,499
He sounded and acted exactly like the Doc.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,499
Lucky.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,199
Just once I'd like Thief Kid to disguise himself as me.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,199
Me, too.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,700
He already did.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,700
Okay, everyone! Take your seats.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,099
Hey, Conan. Who's that?

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,299
I don't know.

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,899
Who's that?

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,600
Today, I have a new teacher to introduce.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
"Ms. Rumi Wakasa"

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,899
This is Ms. Wakasa.

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,299
She'll be my assistant homeroom teacher starting today.

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Go ahead, Wakasa.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,399
I'm Rumi Wakasa.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,100
I'm ten years older than Ms. Kobayashi, but...

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,199
Nice...

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,700
Nice to meet you!

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,699
Are you all right, Ms. Wakasa?

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,699
You don't usually get assistants this late in the year.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,499
Maybe it's because this class

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,099
has so many transfer students like you and me.

40
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,700
I see.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,799
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,799
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,699
Ms. Wakasa seems clumsy.

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,799
What kind of influence will she have?

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,499
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,499
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,000
His name is Detective Conan.

48
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:31,618
"The New Teacher's Skeleton Case (Part 1)"

49
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,717
Huh? Lime?

50
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,617
What do you need that for?

51
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:42,117
We're playing dodge ball in the yard for fifth period PE.

52
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:47,617
So I thought I'd draw some lines during lunch.

53
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:51,917
But the line marker was nearly out of lime.

54
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,417
There's hardly any in reserve in the storehouse either.

55
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:58,017
Why not check out the old storage shed?

56
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:01,018
There might be some extra in there.

57
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:05,417
You mean that rundown storage shed that seems haunted?

58
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:08,017
I heard a teacher once got locked inside

59
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:10,917
and starved to death in there.

60
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:12,517
Yeah.

61
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,417
Help me!

62
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:15,917
I'm hungry!

63
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,518
Feed me eel!

64
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:22,517
Yeah, right. What ghost would ask for eel?

65
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:25,117
What? You don't know where it is?

66
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:27,617
I do, but...

67
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,017
But?

68
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:33,018
Well...

69
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:38,217
Do you want us to come with you because you're scared?

70
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:39,317
What?

71
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:41,418
Well, yes.

72
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:50,217
Sorry for making you help me during your lunch break.

73
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,517
Not at all.

74
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,317
We should help each other out.

75
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:55,718
Thank you.

76
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:00,817
It really is in shambles!

77
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,717
There isn't even a lock on the door.

78
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:06,617
It didn't have one ten years ago either.

79
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:09,017
What? How do you know that?

80
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,818
Well... Ran told me.

81
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:16,917
Whatever. They should just tear it down.

82
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:22,517
Oh, the principal mentioned that they couldn't

83
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:25,118
because of feng shui or something on the day of the graduation...

84
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,617
At his entrance ceremony address!

85
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:31,517
What? Did he say that?

86
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:36,017
Conan, you weren't here for the entrance ceremony.

87
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:37,018
What?

88
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,017
Didn't you transfer partway through the year?

89
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:42,417
Is that right?

90
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:43,817
What school are you talking about?

91
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:45,417
-Are you okay? -You're acting weird.

92
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:46,418
This one?

93
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,418
In any case, let's get inside and look for the lime.

94
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:56,018
Don't touch that.

95
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:03,717
Hey, what are you doing, Conan?

96
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:05,917
Does it not open?

97
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,318
Sorry. I'm opening it now.

98
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:14,818
It's pitch black.

99
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:22,617
It's no use. The light bulb is dead.

100
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:26,317
I'll go and get a flashlight.

101
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:28,117
-That's quite all right. -What?

102
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:31,417
We have these.

103
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:35,317
Oh, my. Those are awfully convenient.

104
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:37,717
Dr. Agasa made them for us.

105
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:41,117
We have the youth detective badges that serve as transceivers, too.

106
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:44,717
Really? What an amazing Doc.

107
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:49,317
It's time for the Youth Detective Squad to search for lime!

108
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,818
Yeah...

109
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:18,517
I found a schedule.

110
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:20,717
It looks pretty old.

111
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:22,917
The paper is really worn.

112
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,517
There are lots of blank spaces.

113
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,718
Maybe they didn't finish filling in it.

114
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:35,517
A trapdoor leading down?

115
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:38,218
Some of the rust was just recently worn off.

116
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,617
Did someone open it recently?

117
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:44,517
Hey, Conan. Did you find something?

118
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:47,217
Is it an entrance to a basement?

119
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:49,717
Maybe that's where...

120
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:52,017
They got trapped...

121
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:54,117
And the dead teacher's...

122
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,518
Skeleton.

123
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:58,817
We're joking.

124
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:01,217
Ms. Wakasa, you're such a scaredy cat.

125
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:03,017
I'm opening it.

126
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:04,418
Okay.

127
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:18,917
There really was a skeleton.

128
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:20,717
Genta, hold the door!

129
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:22,317
Got it.

130
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:24,517
Ms. Wakasa, call the police!

131
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:25,818
Right!

132
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:29,117
Calm down.

133
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,517
Right.

134
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:31,817
Unbelievable.

135
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:35,117
Anyway, how does it look, Conan?

136
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:38,417
Looks like they died a long time ago.

137
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,917
Based on the condition of the bones and the surroundings,

138
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,117
it's probably been five...

139
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:45,618
No, ten years.

140
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:51,117
There's something in its right hand.

141
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:53,317
A string?

142
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:56,618
No. A sports day headband?

143
00:09:58,318 --> 00:09:59,518
What?

144
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:04,417
Conan, is something wrong?

145
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,917
Conan?

146
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:07,417
Are you okay?

147
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:09,718
Come back up.

148
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:13,118
These characters look familiar.

149
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,718
I think...

150
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:23,318
It was...

151
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:31,518
Shinichi!

152
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:35,517
I found a magic string.

153
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,117
A magic string?

154
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:40,517
It was tied to the old storage shed behind the school.

155
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:42,717
There's no such thing.

156
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:47,318
But it had lots of characters I've never seen before written on it.

157
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,817
See? You don't recognize them, do you?

158
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:57,117
Yeah.

159
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:59,917
It's probably Chinese.

160
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:02,617
Let's untie it and show it to the teachers.

161
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:03,718
Okay.

162
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:06,518
Don't.

163
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:11,318
Don't touch that.

164
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:15,617
That's the magic sealing string trapping

165
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:21,018
a terrible monster inside the storage shed.

166
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:30,818
A sealing string?

167
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,846
Looks like the body's about ten years old.

168
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:01,546
They didn't have any identification on them,

169
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:04,546
but they were probably a thief.

170
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:09,046
There was a large crack on the back of the skull,

171
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:13,546
and it looks like they were carrying a large bag of lime.

172
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:17,146
They probably lost their footing

173
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:19,446
while trying to steal the bag of lime,

174
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,146
and died when they struck the back of their head

175
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:25,546
on the vaulting box at the bottom of the steps.

176
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:28,646
There are no signs of foul play,

177
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,746
so unfortunately, we'll be leaving now.

178
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:34,047
Okay.

179
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:37,446
Well, I should get going.

180
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:40,047
Sure. Thank you for coming.

181
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:47,446
Gosh.

182
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:49,246
So it's not a case.

183
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,146
Genta.

184
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:54,846
It's been ten years

185
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:57,146
since the police last came here.

186
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:58,746
Principal.

187
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:01,246
What happened ten years ago?

188
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,246
Four thieves broke into the home

189
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:07,246
of a wealthy man who lived in the area.

190
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:12,546
They murdered the man and fled with 200 million yen

191
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:16,446
worth of gold ingots they found in the house.

192
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:20,046
That same night, someone saw

193
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:24,946
several suspicious figures enter Teitan Elementary School.

194
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:28,246
So the police came to investigate.

195
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:29,646
Really?

196
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:32,746
Were the thieves arrested?

197
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:36,346
No, not that I've heard.

198
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:39,647
No evil deed goes unpunished.

199
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:45,346
They're probably living in fear,

200
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:48,047
or have died somewhere.

201
00:13:55,247 --> 00:14:00,746
Anyway, I'm surprised someone died in that old storage shed.

202
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:01,846
Yeah.

203
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:04,646
I'm not going near there anymore.

204
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:05,746
Yeah.

205
00:14:05,747 --> 00:14:10,046
It's unfortunate the police took the code string with them.

206
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,146
What was written on it?

207
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:14,646
Maybe it was a curse.

208
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,446
It's called a scytale cipher.

209
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:20,546
What? Su... Sa...

210
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:22,246
Barbecue sauce?

211
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:27,346
It was a cipher used 2500 years ago by the Spartans.

212
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:29,546
2500 years ago...

213
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:31,846
By the Spartans...

214
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,746
Barbecue sauce?

215
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,847
Scytale cipher!

216
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:41,246
First, you make a long band,

217
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,246
wrap it around a rod, and write something on it.

218
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:46,546
For example...

219
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:59,047
"Ayumi is a cheerful and kind girl."

220
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:01,547
See? Like this.

221
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:06,946
But if you take band off the rod,

222
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,846
you can't read what was written on it anymore.

223
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:13,847
Hadeinkshikoyansano...

224
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,046
You're right.

225
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,046
It's a code.

226
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:21,746
But if you wrap it around the same rod,

227
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:24,146
you can read it again.

228
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:28,146
In other words, as long as you have rods of the same size,

229
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:30,546
you can exchange coded messages.

230
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:33,146
I wish we could wrap the code written

231
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:35,146
on that string around a rod and read it.

232
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:38,146
Why'd you have to hand it over to the police?

233
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,946
Don't worry.

234
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,646
Haibara's printing the photo I took with my phone

235
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:43,946
in the faculty office right now.

236
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:45,446
Hey, Haibara.

237
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,646
Were you able to print it?

238
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,146
Yes.

239
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,946
They let me print it

240
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:54,146
when I said we were using it for a Chinese character quiz.

241
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:55,546
Here.

242
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:56,846
Thanks.

243
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:58,946
Since this code is probably meant to be read

244
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:03,847
by wrapping it around the handles of the storage shed...

245
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:06,846
We should be able to read it

246
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:10,246
if we wrap it around a pen of about this thickness.

247
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:12,746
What's it say?

248
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:17,246
The second character from the left is the "e" in Edogawa.

249
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:20,046
But I've never seen the other characters before.

250
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:23,547
That's odd. Am I using the wrong size rod?

251
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,446
It's no use.

252
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:30,846
Even if I change the thickness of the pen,

253
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:32,846
I still can't read it.

254
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:35,146
What is this code?

255
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:37,046
Excuse me.

256
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:40,846
Are we really meant to wrap that code around a rod?

257
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:44,646
We couldn't understand the code Conan made for us earlier

258
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:48,146
without wrapping it around a rod,

259
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:50,646
but we could read each individual character

260
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:53,246
even when it was unwrapped.

261
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,046
Come to think of it, yeah.

262
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,946
It was all in hiragana.

263
00:16:56,947 --> 00:17:00,446
But the code the skeleton in the storage house had

264
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:04,946
was full of unrecognizable characters even when unwrapped.

265
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:07,746
Yeah. Those are left and right radicals.

266
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:09,546
-Radicals? -Left...

267
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:10,946
And right radicals?

268
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,546
You know those characters

269
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:17,146
that are made up of two characters put together?

270
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:22,146
Those are called left and right radicals.

271
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,546
"Genta Kojima" -For example,

272
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:25,646
the "shima" in Kojima's name

273
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:29,346
is made up of the "mountain" and "bird" radicals.

274
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:33,346
And Conan thought the characters written on the code

275
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:35,746
were radicals and that they'd match up and be legible

276
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:39,946
if he wrapped it around a rod, right?

277
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:41,246
Yeah.

278
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:43,846
The right side of the code has lots of characters

279
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:48,746
like "fire" and "metal", which are common left radicals.

280
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:51,546
I thought wrapping it around a rod

281
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:53,946
would swap the left and right sides

282
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,346
so they'd turn into legible characters.

283
00:17:57,347 --> 00:18:00,746
But the only thing we can read is the second character.

284
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,446
The "e" in Edogawa.

285
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:09,846
What are those dots and circles at the end of the sentences?

286
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:14,246
Probably standard punctuation.

287
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:19,046
So the three sentences could be...

288
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:23,046
"Genta, had eel again last night."

289
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:26,346
"He eats too much!"

290
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:30,346
How does that skeleton know about that?

291
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:32,746
-What's wrong? -It was just an example.

292
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:36,546
-You actually had eel? -What?

293
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:40,946
You'll turn into an eel if you eat too much.

294
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:43,046
Okay.

295
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,847
Hey, that first sentence...

296
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:52,847
Couldn't it be "something is" with "ga" instead of "wa"?

297
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:56,046
I don't think so.

298
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,746
Take a look.

299
00:18:57,747 --> 00:19:00,246
The second character in the third sentence has sonant marks.

300
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:01,946
It must be a character belonging

301
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:06,946
to the "ga", "za", "da" or "ba" rows.

302
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:10,946
So if the character before the comma is "ga",

303
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:14,246
then there should be a sonant mark above it.

304
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:18,546
But this character isn't necessarily "ha".

305
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:21,746
Whether or not people put commas in the middle of their sentences

306
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:24,346
is personal preference.

307
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:29,946
Either way, we'll probably need something else to crack the code.

308
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:33,346
Something else?

309
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:36,946
Is everyone studying quietly?

310
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:38,546
Yes...

311
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:41,546
Is the staff meeting over?

312
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,746
Sorry, we'll be a while longer.

313
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:47,446
We just came to check on everyone.

314
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:49,847
And I forgot something.

315
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:54,046
I'm sorry. It won't take much longer.

316
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:56,746
Just keep studying, please.

317
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:59,046
Ms. Wakasa.

318
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,047
Yes?

319
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:04,846
I'm sorry, but could you put these rulers away in the prep room?

320
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:06,547
Yes.

321
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:11,747
Oh, right. Ms. Kobayashi...

322
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,446
The schedule!

323
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,546
The schedule?

324
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:19,646
It's torn.

325
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,446
Calm down, Ms. Wakasa.

326
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,846
We can rewrite it.

327
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,647
But...

328
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,746
I found a schedule.

329
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:33,246
It looks pretty old.

330
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,446
The paper is really worn.

331
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:38,046
There are lots of blank spaces.

332
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:39,947
Maybe they didn't finish filling in it.

333
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,346
Ayumi!

334
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:46,346
You picked up a schedule in the storage shed, right?

335
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:49,046
Yeah, I still have it.

336
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,347
See?

337
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:54,247
Did you figure something out, Conan?

338
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:57,847
I see. So that's how it is!

339
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:04,846
Now that I take a closer look,

340
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,046
there's something wrong with this schedule, isn't there?

341
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,746
What? Wrong how?

342
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:11,746
Look at this line.

343
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:16,446
There's Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, and Sun.

344
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,346
It must be Sunday, right?

345
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:19,646
You're right.

346
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:22,346
But there's no school on Sunday.

347
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,746
And then, there's this homeroom period on Tuesday.

348
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:30,046
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

349
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:31,946
It's seventh period.

350
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:34,146
Surely not even upperclassmen

351
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:37,347
have seven class periods in grade school.

352
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:46,246
Then, what is this chart?

353
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:48,146
Since it was in the storage shed

354
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:52,346
where we found the skeleton holding the code,

355
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:54,546
this is probably...

356
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,547
Probably?

357
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,646
"Next Episode"

358
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:46,346
I'm disappointed, though.

359
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:48,146
We couldn't crack the code.

360
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:49,246
Yeah.

361
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,246
Who cares?

362
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,646
-I'm opening it. -Okay.

363
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:55,247
Here goes.

364
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,546
I'm so hungry.

365
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:01,746
Yeah. Let's go home!

366
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:03,647
-Yeah. -Yes.

367
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:12,447
