1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:03,868
Invited by Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama,

2
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:06,468
Ran and I came to Yadori Village in Shizuoka

3
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:09,969
to help unearth the buried treasures of Tokugawa.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,668
However, that night,

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,268
the gigantic legendary monster, Nue appeared

6
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:18,569
and Mr. Yatsukatsu Someji was murdered.

7
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:25,668
Furthermore, Mr. Michiki Tanzawa was also murdered in his hotel room.

8
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:26,669
And...

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,068
What're you guys doing there?

10
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:32,768
Weren't you told to stay put in your rooms?

11
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:36,168
But, we were worried about the doggie.

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,268
When the Nue cried a while ago,

13
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:44,168
the dog barked and we heard it scratching the wall.

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,868
Now that you mentioned it, the first time the Nue cried...

15
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,769
The dog barked.

16
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:54,268
But when that monster appeared...

17
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:55,769
It didn't bark!

18
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:58,868
So, that's what it was.

19
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:01,269
I'm beginning to see the picture.

20
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,268
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

21
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,968
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

22
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,468
After solving the Nue mystery,

23
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,568
what will Heiji tell Kazuha?

24
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,268
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:17,468
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,369
His name is Detective Conan!

27
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:05,878
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Solved Edition)"

28
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:08,240
Heiji!

29
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:10,441
We brought what you asked for.

30
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,440
Three sets of sheets from an unused room,

31
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,440
a deck brush, a mop and a tool box.

32
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:22,340
A cardboard box and spray paint that was used to remodel the hotel.

33
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:25,140
We also borrowed a permanent marker

34
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,440
and sewing set from Ms. Masuko,

35
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,840
as well as glue and knife from Mr. Tsurumi.

36
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,340
Great work.

37
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:32,540
Thank you.

38
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,040
That's right and...

39
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,440
We found some old pictures in the drawer of the desk

40
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,240
of the room we moved to.

41
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,940
Isn't that a picture of the team that excavated the hidden treasure

42
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,841
16 years ago?

43
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,440
And...

44
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,040
I could be wrong

45
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:53,240
but the foreigner who's in the center of the picture...

46
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:56,840
Doesn't he look a bit like Mr. Tsurumi?

47
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,641
True.

48
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:00,940
And?

49
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,340
What are you going to do with these things?

50
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,140
What else?

51
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:08,840
We're going to lure...

52
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:10,440
That beast out one more time.

53
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,541
-What? -What?

54
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:17,541
Just what do you think you're doing, Heiji?

55
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:22,040
There's not even a tinge of the feeling of love.

56
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,341
You can say that again.

57
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:25,741
Ouch.

58
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:30,940
Hurry, Kudo.

59
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:33,440
We don't have all day, you know!

60
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:37,341
Yeah! Because this trick only works during the night.

61
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:40,941
Yeah. That's right.

62
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:45,140
Don't you have other things you've got to worry

63
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,241
about at the break of day?

64
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,441
I don't I tell you.

65
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:59,841
How dare you disturb me when I'm fast asleep.

66
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:04,440
It's still four in the morning.

67
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,440
But, Mr. Hattori told me

68
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:08,440
"Densuke Takekuma (58)" -to ask you all to come in front of the hotel

69
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,240
because he figured out the identity of the crane.

70
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,940
Identity of the Nue?

71
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,640
No joke?

72
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:15,740
Come to think of it,

73
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,240
it seems that the forensic officers and my men

74
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:19,340
"Fumie Masuko (46)" -were secretly doing something.

75
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,840
"Novelist" -My, without tell you about it, Inspector?

76
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,840
Yes.

77
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,340
Look at that.

78
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,341
It's the same.

79
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:28,341
"Stay out, danger!"

80
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:37,940
It's burning like back then when the monster appeared.

81
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:40,441
The sign board is erected too.

82
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:48,540
What is this weird sound?

83
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,541
It's this, this!

84
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,440
This is...

85
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:58,541
the cry of the Nue.

86
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,040
Heiji, where are you?

87
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,040
Help!

88
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,940
I'm over here.

89
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:15,140
Over where?

90
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,741
Over here, here.

91
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:27,741
I'm right here!

92
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:32,640
Heiji's grown humongous?

93
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:34,440
Wrong, idiot.

94
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,540
Come over here and look closely.

95
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:40,440
But, in front of you, Heiji...

96
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,340
Is a black monster.

97
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:45,540
It's no monster.

98
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,541
Look.

99
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,441
It's just a plain dong wearing the fur of a bear.

100
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:57,141
We found it way inside the storeroom.

101
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:01,441
Look. It's even got the tail of a snake on it, right?

102
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,940
Just come over here, will you?

103
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:08,140
You'll see what I mean if you come.

104
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:10,140
Go over to you, but...

105
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:12,841
We'll go over, but don't step on us and crush us, okay?

106
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,141
What?

107
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,740
No, what is this?

108
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,940
What's going on?

109
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,940
We sewed the sheets together

110
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,640
and drew windows on them using extreme perspective,

111
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:30,240
and suspended it from this window.

112
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,740
For the protruded parts we cut

113
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:33,840
and pasted pieces of cardboard onto the sheets,

114
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:37,241
then used spray paints to make them the same color as the wall.

115
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:42,640
Since that tree is in the way, you can't see the building.

116
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:44,840
If there's a fire and smoke rise,

117
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,740
even the trees behind can't bee seen.

118
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,640
Moreover, as dark as it is at night,

119
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:50,941
it's no wonder we were all fooled.

120
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,440
Officers,

121
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,240
you can go on and extinguish the fire.

122
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,641
Thanks for helping out.

123
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:06,140
The forensics and my men were helping them out

124
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:09,940
putting this trick together without telling me?

125
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:13,241
The finishing touch is this sign board!

126
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:20,840
The dog was trained to carry away this little sign

127
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,940
when he heard the Nue cry.

128
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,440
The real sign with giant teeth marks

129
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:30,240
was left on the ground next to Mr. Someji's body.

130
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:34,140
This way, it would look as if the giant monster,

131
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:35,640
after killing Mr. Someji,

132
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:39,340
left the sign behind and vanished somewhere.

133
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,840
As proof of this,

134
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:44,640
the dog barked when it heard the Nue's cry, right?

135
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:47,540
The dog was barking because it wanted to go to the sign,

136
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,540
but couldn't.

137
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,640
But...

138
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:53,440
As for the first and second time the Nue cried,

139
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:57,740
maybe you could rig the cell phone to do this but...

140
00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:00,840
Even after that, when Mr. Tanzawa was poisoned to death,

141
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,240
it cried again.

142
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,540
Back then, everybody gave you their cell phones,

143
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,140
so that no sounds could be made, right?

144
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:08,440
How would you explain that cry?

145
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:10,141
You mean this sound, right?

146
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,840
If you wet the wine glass with water

147
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:19,641
and trace the edge of the wine glass strongly with a moist finger...

148
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,440
I saw that on TV.

149
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,040
In other words,

150
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,640
the only person who could've hung the painted cloth

151
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,540
with windows drawn on it from where she was,

152
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,940
as well as create the sound

153
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:33,540
is the one who was in the room on the second floor

154
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,441
that asked the village head to bring wine.

155
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,441
There's nobody besides you that could've done it!

156
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,260
You're the only one who could've done it,

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,159
Ms. Fumie Masuko.

158
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,959
Nobody else but you.

159
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,359
Being an art university graduate,

160
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,559
you'd be able to draw realistic looking windows on the cloth.

161
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,859
When we chased the monster around the back of the hotel,

162
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,959
this area was burning

163
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,759
so you could've thrown the cloth into the fire

164
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,959
to erase evidence.

165
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,159
Well, we did find the burnt remains of it, though.

166
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,359
But when did you draw the windows?

167
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,359
She drew it beforehand and...

168
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,059
Probably hid it in this room?

169
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,759
Beforehand?

170
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,159
Somebody used to come here sometimes to feed the dog, right?

171
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,659
I'm sure it was Ms. Masuko!

172
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,959
Because she had to train the dog to pull out the sign board too.

173
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,659
Maybe she's also the one who planted the tree to carry out her trick.

174
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,859
But, when the fire broke out the second time,

175
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,159
she was in her room, wasn't she?

176
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,859
How did she start the fire?

177
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,459
Metal sodium.

178
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,559
Metal sodium?

179
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,759
If you wrap it around in burnable paper or grass

180
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,559
and pour water over it,

181
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,259
chemical reaction will occur and make it super hot.

182
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,259
When we extinguished the first fire,

183
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,859
Ms. Masuko had a bucket.

184
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,059
If she had that in the bucket

185
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,459
she could've have pretended to put out the fire

186
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,660
and sprinkle it all over in front of the hotel, right?

187
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,059
But...

188
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,859
how did she bring the water?

189
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,959
You said yourself, didn't you, village head?

190
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,359
That you heard something like the sound

191
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,259
of a cap of a carbonated drink blow off when the fire broke out.

192
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,359
Open a hole in the cork cap.

193
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,059
Then poke a hole in the spare cartridge

194
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,559
of the ball point pen with its ink removed,

195
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,459
then wrap the cork with a paper tape, adjust the size,

196
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,559
fit it exactly onto the mouth of the bottle of the carbonated drink

197
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,159
and shake it super vigorously.

198
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,159
Then you can eject the water to the targeted place

199
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,860
even if it's quite a distance away.

200
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,959
Eject the water to the targeted place?

201
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,760
That's impossible...

202
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,759
See?

203
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,959
True!

204
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,359
That's amazing.

205
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,859
I could've made it too if I used the extra carbonated soda

206
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,459
and cork of the wine that you bought.

207
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,459
Ms. Masuko had the paper tape, ball pen and all to you see!

208
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,659
Besides, if you face it upwards,

209
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,260
cover the bottle with your finger, then let go.

210
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,559
See, it'll reach the window at the very top super easily.

211
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,659
The window at the very top...

212
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,359
So, Mr. Tanzawa who was poisoned to death...

213
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,759
Right.

214
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,959
Attach a two pronged poisoned dart to the cork.

215
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,359
Then shake the bottle while holding down

216
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,159
in between the forked part with your finger.

217
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,459
Then, when Mr. Tanzawa sticks his head out of the window,

218
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,759
let go of your finger to eject the needles.

219
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,960
Then you can poison him to death.

220
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,459
If a string is attached to the poison needles,

221
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,360
they can be retrieved immediately too.

222
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,659
In other words, this is how you committed the crime.

223
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,959
First, after you hang the cloth with the windows drawn on it,

224
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,559
out of your second floor room,

225
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,559
you wrote Mr. Someji a letter or something

226
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,159
and told him to come out to the back of the hotel and killed him.

227
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,959
Then you left claw marks on his back,

228
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,659
and put the sign board with the gigantic teeth marks on it

229
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,759
near the corpse,

230
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,659
switched the real sign board with a little one,

231
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,559
sprinkled kerosene in front of the hotel and set fire.

232
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,959
And just as everyone came out in front of the hotel,

233
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,559
you created the cry of the Nue with you cell phone,

234
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,059
called this dog that was wearing the fur of a bear out,

235
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,359
and made him hold the sign board in his mouth

236
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,759
just like you trained him.

237
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,359
Then, you made him go around

238
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,759
to the back of the hotel to go back inside.

239
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,359
This was the first case.

240
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,759
Then you pretended to put out the fire

241
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,859
while you were actually sprinkling metal sodium in front of the hotel.

242
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,159
You ejected the carbonated soda so it wouldn't wet us,

243
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,459
who were outside on guard, and set fire.

244
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,359
The second case is when you fired the poisoned needles

245
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,359
at Mr. Tanzawa who stuck his face out to look at the fire.

246
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,759
The first was a tiger, and the next a snake

247
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,159
You made it look as if he was indeed killed by the Nue.

248
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,559
Well, as for the knife you killed Mr. Someji with,

249
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,859
you probably disposed of in the lake or something.

250
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,259
But as for the needles that killed Mr. Tanzawa,

251
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,459
since the forensics still haven't found it,

252
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,059
you probably have it in the cartridge of the ball pen.

253
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,359
You could've made a two-pronged dart

254
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,059
by tying sewing needles to a toothpick.

255
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,259
You're lucky that the poisoned needles

256
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,160
poked right into Mr. Tanzawa's chin.

257
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,460
It wasn't luck.

258
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,659
My aim was perfect.

259
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,959
I tried time and time again,

260
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,859
so that I would be able to aim perfectly

261
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,759
no matter where he stuck his face out.

262
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,160
You're admitting you committed the crime?

263
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,460
But... Why did you kill the two?

264
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,160
Because they left him to die.

265
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,159
A member of the excavation team of the hidden treasures of Tokugawa,

266
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,359
as well as my husband,

267
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Charles Abel.

268
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,759
Then, don't tell me that...

269
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,359
those two were also members of the excavation team?

270
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,159
Yes. At the time of the cave-in accident,

271
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,059
the ones that left my husband to die were those two.

272
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,859
My husband was still alive then, and yet...

273
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,959
But...

274
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,159
It couldn't be helped, could it?

275
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,959
Because he wrote the word Nue on the paper.

276
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,559
That wasn't Nue.

277
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,660
He wrote iron, right?

278
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,459
Charles actually wanted to write that he found a iron hairpin.

279
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,659
But being a foreigner he never saw one.

280
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,459
So, after writing "iron",

281
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,959
I think he wanted to show the word written on the paper

282
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,259
and ask the excavators what it was.

283
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,359
He wrote very slowly using a permanent marker,

284
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,959
so the ink smudged and bled through the back side.

285
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,759
Therefore, the other members mistakenly thought

286
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,759
that he wrote the word Nue.

287
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,159
I see.

288
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,659
You took advantage of the fact that they mistook him

289
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,959
and lured the two over here, right?

290
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,759
By writing them a letter

291
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,759
saying that Charles may have found an iron jar.

292
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,359
An iron jar?

293
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,259
Did you forget?

294
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,459
The light of dawn seeps through.

295
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,359
The light of the sunset shines on 2,000 such jars

296
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,159
filled with 1,000 gold coins.

297
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,359
This nursery rhyme. If there are 1000 coins in the jar,

298
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,959
that's some treasure.

299
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,960
So, lured by that the two came along.

300
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,759
Not even aware that they were going to be killed.

301
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,459
Yes. I was planning to let them go if they didn't show up but,

302
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,659
they had the nerve to come over.

303
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,159
By the way, you called the detective to make him testify

304
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,659
that the monster really existed.

305
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,459
And you also told him to bring his young girlfriend along

306
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,659
so that she would see the creepy hiragana practice book and panic.

307
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,359
After she panicked and asked to have the room changed you figured that...

308
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,959
Mr. Tanzawa would want to move to the room

309
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,059
with Charles's belongings inside,

310
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,159
so he might find more clues on the iron jar.

311
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,559
Therefore, you assumed that he would move over

312
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,059
to the room exactly above yours,

313
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,559
making it easier to poison him to death.

314
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,559
Then, why did you invite me,

315
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,859
a reportage writer that has nothing to do with this?

316
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,359
That's probably because...

317
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,459
Ms. Masuko is...

318
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,160
your mother.

319
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,459
I think she wanted to show you

320
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,760
that she was avenging your father's death.

321
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,259
That dog liked you a lot probably

322
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,360
because you looked a lot like its owner who died.

323
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,659
No joke? Are you serious?

324
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,159
Ridiculous. No way.

325
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,159
I read your poor reportage

326
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,960
and called you over just in fun.

327
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,760
So, go on and write a good reportage this time...

328
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,859
about a stupid lady who tried to take advantage

329
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,959
of the legend of a monster,

330
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,860
and got a taste of her own medicine.

331
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,060
It's just like in the legend.

332
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,259
According to an account,

333
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,159
Nue is the transformed figure of Yorimasa Minamoto's mother

334
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,160
who wanted to give him credit for an achievement.

335
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,359
Aren't you Ran and Conan?

336
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,059
Yes.

337
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,259
This is a grave case, and yet, where is Mr. Mouri?

338
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,559
He's not here.

339
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,059
I mean did you just realize now?

340
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,259
Hey, Conan.

341
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,059
Have you seen Kazuha?

342
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,059
Yeah, she went along with Heiji towards Kurogane Ooike.

343
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,759
But, I think you should leave them alone for now.

344
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,159
Watch how I do things carefully, okay!

345
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,860
He was saying...

346
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,359
What is it, Heiji, calling me out to a place like this?

347
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,659
If you're planning to show me another strange monster,

348
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,459
I've already had enough of it!

349
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,559
No, stupid.

350
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm only going to say this once, so listen well, okay!

351
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,660
Well, Kazuha...

352
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
The surface of the water of the lake

353
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,659
is shining golden in the light of the morning sun

354
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,160
and it's so pretty!

355
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,759
So this was what he was talking about!

356
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,759
What?

357
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,959
The light of dawn seeps through.

358
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,059
The light of the sunset shines on 2,000 such jars

359
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,559
filled with 1,000 gold coins.

360
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,059
This is a nursery song! Kurogane means iron!

361
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,459
In other words, this lake is an iron jar.

362
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,959
When the sunrise and sunset shine on the lake,

363
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,759
it glitters gold, and the ripple of the waters

364
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,759
look as if gold coins had been scattered.

365
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,160
That's what the song meant.

366
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,160
That's not what I came here for.

367
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,559
Until we went to Ebisu Bridge, I didn't realize it but...

368
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,259
It seems as if I...

369
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,460
You know... sort of like... you know about you...

370
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,059
All civilians evacuate to a safe place!

371
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,059
What?

372
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,060
We will begin strategy for capturing the Nue as of now!

373
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,859
Self Defense Force?

374
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,460
They really came!

375
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,559
Well, if they're coming it's probably the air force

376
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,459
from the Hamamatsu Air Force Base?

377
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,360
And? What about me?

378
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,859
Just like you said,

379
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,859
I mixed the egg and the porridge tasted delicious.

380
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,559
Just an uninteresting story.

381
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,760
Right? Porridges taste better if you mix them?

382
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Ran!

383
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,359
What did Heiji say to you?

384
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Heiji told me that it was more delicious if the eggs are mixed.

385
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,159
I told you!

386
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,560
Mixing the eggs in the porridge make them taste better.

387

"Novelist Fumie Masuko arrested" -You're really going for it, aren't you?

388

389
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,659

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,359
Oh my, no what shall we do?

393
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,459
Don't tell me that something bad's going to happen again.

394
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,159
The gods are telling us commoners,

395
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,559
that something bad is going to be happening.

396
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,560
There is no need for detectives to intrude.

397
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
What?

398
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,760
