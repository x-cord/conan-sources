1
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:08,702
Let's determine a name for you then.

2
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:12,802
How about Mr. Moustache?

3
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:15,502
Moustache?

4
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:16,802
What should I call you?

5
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:19,202
Boss, maybe?

6
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:23,502
The others call me Mr. Head.

7
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:26,002
Head... Brains, eh.

8
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:31,802
And so, did I successfully pass the entrance exam, Mr. Head?

9
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:34,702
We're counting on your skills.

10
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:38,603
Give it your all, Mr. Moustache.

11
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:44,502
Hello?

12
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,602
Yes.

13
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:48,702
I've succeeded infiltration!

14
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:52,302
Now, the band of robbers will surely be wiped out

15
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,803
by the hands of I, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri...

16
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:02,403
Hello? Hello?

17
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:05,202
Mr. Mouri? What's up?

18
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:06,602
What happened?

19
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:07,702
Hello?

20
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:11,102
Too bad, great detective.

21
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:12,303
Hello?

22
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:21,002
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

23
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,902
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

24
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:24,702
Pops Kogoro is not his usual self.

25
00:01:24,703 --> 00:01:26,602
Dangerous purpose of undercover investigation.

26
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:28,102
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:30,202
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:32,503
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,570
"The Great Detective is Manipulated (Part 1)"

30
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,570
Awake?

31
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,269
She's a cute daughter, isn't she?

32
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,769
Ran!

33
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,469
Why you... What're you up to?

34
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,569
It's up to you.

35
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,869
Darn it! What do you want?

36
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,769
Just as expected of a great detective,

37
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,469
getting right to the point.

38
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,369
Hurry spit it out!

39
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,769
You deliberately disguised yourself

40
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,969
and almost succeeded your mission.

41
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,369
So, just as scheduled,

42
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,069
work along with my men as a skilled safe breaker.

43
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,369
What?

44
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,369
The fact is...

45
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,270
Among my men, there's the one who killed my son.

46
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,969
I'd like you to determine who it is with your skills as a great detective

47
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,869
by dawn of the day after tomorrow.

48
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,369
What?

49
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,469
Dawn day after tomorrow is also the time,

50
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,569
when we carry out our plan this time and leave Japan behind us.

51
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,969
That's why I need you to do so by then.

52
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,269
What, after specifying who it is?

53
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,569
Are you planning to avenge the death of your son?

54
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,869
That's none of your business.

55
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,370
But, if you refuse my request...

56
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,169
You'll never see your daughter again.

57
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,269
If the killer isn't instructed to cancel before the time limited by me,

58
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,669
he will kill her.

59
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,469
Don't tell me you had this in mind to begin with!

60
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,869
Darn it!

61
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,369
But I believe in...

62
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,769
Kogoro Mouri, your skills as a great detective.

63
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,069
Huh?

64
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,469
What shall I do, Conan?

65
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,469
Dad's still not home.

66
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,669
I can't get through to his cell phone either.

67
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,469
It's been one whole day since yesterday!

68
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,669
Calm down, Ran.

69
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,269
He said that he had work to do, right?

70
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,169
Yep. That he was going to meet a client.

71
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,069
Didn't you get a name or an address of where he went?

72
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,169
Well... I didn't ask him for neither...

73
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,169
Rather, now that I think of it,

74
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,370
he didn't seem to be his usual self.

75
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,469
Bye, Dad.

76
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,669
You're eating at home, aren't you?

77
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,869
I can't tell for now.

78
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,869
Geez, I know you like to drink after work, but...

79
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,869
But I'll promise to come home.

80
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,369
I promise you, I'll come back home so don't worry.

81
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,570
Bye.

82
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,670
Dad.

83
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,169
You asked Inspector Megure already, too, right?

84
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,969
Yep, just a while ago.

85
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,469
I haven't been able to get a hold of Dad since yesterday.

86
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,569
I see.

87
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,969
Have you heard anything from him?

88
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,069
No, not really.

89
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,869
If you're worried, we can try looking for him on our side, too.

90
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,569
Don't worry, he'll be back.

91
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,269
Goodbye, then.

92
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,470
Inspector!

93
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,270
Come to think of it, Inspector Megure wasn't quite himself either.

94
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,269
Something's fishy.

95
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,670
I don't know what it is, but something's going on.

96
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,370
Maybe...

97
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,769
April 25th, 10:00,

98
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,070
Hotel Mole Cafe Terrace.

99
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,669
Hey, sir.

100
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,169
I had a quick glance yesterday,

101
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,769
but the great detective Mouri was here yesterday, wasn't he?

102
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,469
Yeah, he was.

103
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,169
Was he meeting someone here?

104
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,369
Who are you?

105
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,469
Well, I actually wanted to ask him

106
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,169
to investigate a great case, you see.

107
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,469
So, I thought that if he was staying over here.

108
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,569
A great case?

109
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,769
I'm sorry, but it's not that he's staying here.

110
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,570
He was sitting in that seat yesterday.

111
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,169
Sir, you have a phone call.

112
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,869
Thank you.

113
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,069
Hello?

114
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,269
Huh? Don't use a cab right away?

115
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,969
Just what do you mean?

116
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,269
I see. Got it.

117
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,170
Hey, where's the closest subway station?

118
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,169
Maybe Pops was trying to lose somebody that was trailing him.

119
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,770
Rather, maybe somebody was making him?

120
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,769
Darn it!

121
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,369
If I don't know what train he took, I've got no lead.

122
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,369
The taxi stand is...

123
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,769
Over here?

124
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,669
No, there's one by the exit on the opposite side, too.

125
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,969
Don't use a cab right away?

126
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,769
"Right away."

127
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,670
I see! That's what it meant!

128
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,569
"Taxi Stand"

129
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,969
Yeah, you mean the great detective Kogoro Mouri, right?

130
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,569
-He got on yesterday. -Really?

131
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,069
Then, will you take me to the place where Detective Mouri got off?

132
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,370
Yeah, no problem.

133
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,270
A place like this?

134
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,670
Pop's cell phone?

135
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,870
Darn it, no good. The data's all gone.

136
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,270
These shoes prints...

137
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,970
"Mr. Mouth (28)" -Just what do you think you're doing, you jerk?

138
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,670
"Mr. Nose (35), member of a band of robbers"

139
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,669
Wait!

140
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,570
Put it down! Quick, put it down, Nose!

141
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,569
Cut out the noise.

142
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,469
"Mr. Eyes (40)" -We're just starting work.

143
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,969
Enough already!

144
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,570
Yeah.

145
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,669
Ms. Lip is as thorny as always.

146
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,969
"Ms. Lip (33)" -Your crew is as dinky as always.

147
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,869
Just to think I'm going to be together with them...

148
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,069
Watch your mouth!

149
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,669
Wanna crush her once?

150
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,970
Go ahead and try if you can!

151
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,969
It's instructions from Mr. Head.

152
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,969
Another member will be working with us this time.

153
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,170
Glad to join you. I'm Mr. Moustache.

154
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,070
Pops was definitely here.

155
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,970
It doesn't match the room. It's new.

156
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,669
What were they projecting?

157
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,170
Smells burnt.

158
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,669
This is...

159
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,470
A map and a blueprint of the sewer?

160
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,169
Sorry, but can you stop by at the convenience store?

161
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,870
You're so nervous that you gotta go to the john or what, mister?

162
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,469
I want to buy something. I want gum.

163
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,069
Gum?

164
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,269
Without it, my senses go dull when I open the safe.

165
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,269
I've got to somehow get away from them and make contact outside.

166
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,469
Huh?

167
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,969
We don't need to stop now, do we?

168
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,769
Yeah.

169
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,770
Darn it.

170
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,370
I did it!

171
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:17,870
Oh, no!

172
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,169
Freeze!

173
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,270
If you move, I'll shoot!

174
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,569
I'll crush you, get that!

175
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,769
Stay there and don't move!

176
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,170
I'll tell you once more. Move and you're dead!

177
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:55,567
Freeze!

178
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,368
If you move, I'll shoot!

179
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:00,867
I'll crush you, get that!

180
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:02,967
Stay there and don't move!

181
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:06,668
I'll tell you once more. Move and you're dead!

182
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:13,168
If you wanna live, out with your wallets!

183
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:16,767
I'll crush you, get that!

184
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:19,267
Line up! Come on!

185
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,867
They're armed with guns and knives.

186
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,467
When did they...

187
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,268
I wonder where they came in from.

188
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:29,267
Takagi. Sato.

189
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,067
Things have changed.

190
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:34,667
Please don't make any false moves, please.

191
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:38,167
Showtime, Mr. Moustache.

192
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,567
The customers' wallets are worth only so much.

193
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,068
This way.

194
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:48,067
I've heard that there's no safe you can't break.

195
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,667
We're counting on you.

196
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:53,067
Yeah, you can count on me.

197
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:56,268
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

198
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,467
Where's?

199
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:03,167
Oh, well, this is a first for me, you see.

200
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:06,267
-Not that, where's the gum? -Huh?

201
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:09,068
Who are you?

202
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:12,668
Let me go! I'll crush you!

203
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,168
Darn it!

204
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,667
Cut it out!

205
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:23,967
Inspector! Please hurry!

206
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:26,067
Okay! We're going in!

207
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:27,467
We're going in!

208
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:29,868
-We're going in! -Go!

209
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,367
Cut it out!

210
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:33,768
Just what do you think you're doing?

211
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,467
Mr. Mouri?

212
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,867
Mouri?

213
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:50,167
You mean, Mouri, that great detective?

214
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:52,367
-Huh? -Right! That face!

215
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:54,967
The detective's a member of the band of robbers?

216
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:57,567
No! I've got my reasons, you see!

217
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,868
Darn it! So that's the story!

218
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:06,067
Police! All of you, freeze!

219
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:09,167
Please wait, Inspector!

220
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:10,967
Good work, Mr. Mouri!

221
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:13,567
-Uh... -Fighting back?

222
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,467
Gosh, you're not getting your way!

223
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:17,767
-What? -I'll crush you!

224
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:19,367
No! Don't shoot!

225
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,568
Get down! Get down!

226
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:26,868
Somebody, stop me!

227
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,768
Now! Nab them all!

228
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:48,768
Don't let the band of robbers get away!

229
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,367
It's okay already, Mr. Mouri.

230
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,868
The infiltration project is over!

231
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,167
"Several days ago" -Infiltration?

232
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,567
You're going to infiltrate that band of robbers?

233
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:09,267
Yeah. As you can see, with a little disguise,

234
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:14,367
I look just like the safebreaker that you guys arrested.

235
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:16,267
I'm going to sell myself to them, get hired,

236
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,667
and get a hold of concrete evidence of their crimes.

237
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:21,267
It's a chance of a lifetime.

238
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,967
It's true that if we succeed,

239
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:27,467
we could make a wholesale arrest of the band of robbers

240
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:30,167
that we've been pursuing for several years now.

241
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:32,567
But, what if they find out who you are?

242
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:33,967
To make sure that doesn't happen,

243
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,667
Officer Takagi and you, Officer Sato

244
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:38,467
are sneaking into the casino as customers.

245
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:39,967
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

246
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,468
And, one more thing.

247
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:47,467
Please don't tell Ran about this case.

248
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:50,667
I don't want to worry her if at possible, you see.

249
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:52,867
Got you.

250
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:56,368
But, why is Mr. Mouri doing something so far out as that?

251
00:16:57,468 --> 00:17:01,468
I guess he's just an ex-cop at heart.

252
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:11,167
Darn it! By the time I noticed, I was attacking.

253
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:14,068
If things go wrong, I may lose my job as a detective!

254
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:20,567
Inspector! There's no one on this side!

255
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:22,967
Gosh! Where'd they disappear to?

256
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:25,368
There are no other exits, and yet...

257
00:17:27,668 --> 00:17:29,468
A ventilation hole?

258
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:36,767
A rope ladder!

259
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:39,068
They probably made it inside from here, too.

260
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:44,268
I see! That blueprint of the sewer.

261
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:47,268
You're not getting away!

262
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,167
Over there? After them!

263
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:52,168
Yes, sir!

264
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,467
Chiba, get the blueprint for the sewer!

265
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,167
We'll beat them to the exit!

266
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:57,667
Yes, sir!

267
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,767
We won't let you get away!

268
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:03,168
I wonder why Mr. Mouri acted the way he did?

269
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,267
The strategy's not over yet!

270
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:09,967
Not until I make sure that Ran is safe first.

271
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,368
I'm sorry, Inspector!

272
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:22,567
That blueprint was an escape route after all.

273
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,767
Okay! If so...

274
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:26,668
I'm beating them to it!

275
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:08,367
No doubt about it, she's one of them, too.

276
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,768
She's probably the driver for the escape car.

277
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:20,967
What a safebreaker.

278
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,567
Hey, hey. Are we taking him with us?

279
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,967
It's faster to crush him!

280
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:27,867
Don't.

281
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,767
Mr. Head's the one who added him on as a member.

282
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:33,468
We need to hear him out.

283
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:36,968
Hurry!

284
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:42,367
They're coming for us from up ahead!

285
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:43,868
Hurry, get on!

286
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:51,367
Emergency alert, all stations!

287
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:52,368
Yes, sir.

288
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:01,367
We did it!

289
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:03,267
We shook the cops off!

290
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:04,867
That's Ms. Lip.

291
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:06,667
Head on as scheduled, will you?

292
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:08,668
But, before that...

293
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:15,167
What's up, Lip?

294
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:18,767
My steering wheels heavy.

295
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:21,868
Like there's some unwanted mouse in the trunk or something.

296
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:24,967
What the?

297
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:26,667
What, what?

298
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:27,867
Darn it!

299
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,368
What's up?

300
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:35,367
I'm opening it.

301
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:36,968
Okay.

302
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,168
"The Mouri Detective Agency"

303
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:51,567
Mouri Detective Agency.

304
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:53,767
Inspector Megure!

305
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,167
Huh?

306
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:57,267
Dad and Conan are?

307
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:00,567
I'm sorry, Ran. It wasn't supposed to turn out this way.

308
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:03,868
At any rate, all the stations are out looking for them now.

309
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:44,567
"Next Episode" -The truth of 1 year ago.

310
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:47,767
In other words, I decided to have the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri

311
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:51,268
to figure out who killed my son.

312
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:56,367
There's no such person on the casino side.

313
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,267
Then, are you saying that

314
00:23:58,268 --> 00:23:59,968
either Mr. Mouse or I am the one who did it?

315
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:03,867
Darn it!

316
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:06,068
Don't get on, Ran!

317
00:24:06,968 --> 00:24:12,068
Next Conan, "The Great Detective is Manipulated (Part 2)"
