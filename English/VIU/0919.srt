"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:04,218 --> 00:00:05,918
What's going on?

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,118
Yeah...

4
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:09,918
You're right.

5
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:12,618
Lately...

6
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:14,718
Ran's been acting strange.

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,918
She's oddly excited.

8
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,418
Yeah!

9
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:22,418
I'm so excited.

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:25,618
Excited? For what?

11
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:30,418
Anyway...

12
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:33,318
Dad's home. I have to go.

13
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,718
I'll see you later.

14
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:39,018
I'm hungry.

15
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:41,818
Make me something for lunch.

16
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:45,418
There's some cream stew in the kitchen.

17
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:47,618
You can heat it up and eat it.

18
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:52,418
Okay, then. I'm going out for a bit.

19
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:54,418
I'll be back this evening.

20
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:57,018
Sure.

21
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:03,718
What's she excited about?

22
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:07,218
We watched that movie with Attorney Kisaki the other day.

23
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:08,318
"Worry..."

24
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,718
Her karate tournament is still a long way off,

25
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:15,418
and the Beika Hotel cake buffet ended yesterday.

26
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:18,918
She bought a Fusae brand pouch last week.

27
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:21,918
Darn.

28
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:25,418
I wish I could call her as Shinichi and find out,

29
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,818
but I'm having Dr. Agasa fix that phone

30
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:31,218
since it hasn't been working properly.

31
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:34,618
Hey, let's go.

32
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,118
What? Go where?

33
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,218
We're going to follow Ran and figure out what she's up to.

34
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:48,618
I know more or less what that is, though.

35
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:51,318
What?

36
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:56,018
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

37
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:57,918
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

38
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,718
Ran is behaving suspiciously.

39
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:01,818
What will we find when we follow her?

40
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:03,418
He sees through the one and only truth.

41
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:05,218
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

42
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:07,418
His name is Detective Conan.

43
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:54,317
"The High School Girl Trio's Secret Cafe (Part 1)"

44
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:04,931
She's humming while walking with light steps.

45
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:07,331
That must be it.

46
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,931
She must be planning another trip

47
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:13,931
with that detective kid who's always missing.

48
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:17,231
That jerk...

49
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,631
How dare he seduce my daughter

50
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:22,331
just because he's a smooth talker.

51
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,131
Wait...

52
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,131
It's not me.

53
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:28,231
"Beika Bookstore" -Welcome.

54
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:35,531
What's Ran doing at a bookstore?

55
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:38,431
"Travel"

56
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:42,031
She took a book from the shelf.

57
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:45,531
"Kyoto, Highlights Guidebook"

58
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,431
Kyoto?

59
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:49,731
That detective kid...

60
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:52,631
He's planning to shack up with Ran in Kyoto.

61
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,331
It's not me.

62
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,731
Excuse me.

63
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,831
My friends will be joining me later.

64
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:04,231
Could I get a table instead of sitting at the counter?

65
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,231
You can have this table, then.

66
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,331
Thank you.

67
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,331
That detective kid...

68
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,531
He's meeting my daughter at a chic cafe.

69
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:15,631
I told you, it's not me.

70
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:18,231
Excuse me.

71
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,731
Are you customers?

72
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:21,931
Yes.

73
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,931
This has happened before.

74
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:33,131
I think it was when he was watching Yoko Okino and Higo.

75
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:41,131
Now I understand how Haibara and the old man felt then.

76
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:47,131
Who are you so excitedly waiting for, Ran?

77
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:51,131
Ran.

78
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,831
You're already here.

79
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:55,031
Sera, Sonoko.

80
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,131
Sorry. Were you waiting long?

81
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:01,931
No, I just got here.

82
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:04,931
So, it's just Sonoko and Sera.

83
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,031
Ta-da!

84
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:09,031
I bought a guidebook to Kyoto.

85
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:11,731
Me, too.

86
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,231
"Kyoto in Fall"

87
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,731
It's easier to get information from a book than online

88
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:20,931
because of all the nice big photos.

89
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,431
I know what you mean.

90
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,431
Where should we go?

91
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,331
There are too many options.

92
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,131
-I don't know what to choose. -I don't know what to choose.

93
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:36,231
Sounds like the girls are going to Kyoto on their break.

94
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,331
The daughter of the head of Suzuki Financial Group

95
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,031
must be sponsoring their trip.

96
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,531
Now that we know that, we're done here.

97
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:46,831
I'll go pay the check.

98
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:50,031
Get out of here before they notice you.

99
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,031
Okay.

100
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:55,031
I wonder if we'll get to see Okita.

101
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,331
What?

102
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:01,831
As long as we're here, let's get lunch.

103
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:04,331
I'm starving.

104
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:08,831
Jeez. Kids are hopeless.

105
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,831
Okita?

106
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:15,431
It's like they were breaking in a new sword.

107
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:16,931
Furthermore,

108
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:20,031
this looks like the work of a rather skilled swordsman.

109
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,331
Who are you?

110
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:23,631
Who, me?

111
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:26,331
I'm Kyoto Senshin High School student,

112
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:28,431
Soshi Okita.

113
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,231
You're really cute.

114
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,031
What's your name?

115
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:40,031
Ran Mouri.

116
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,231
Ran? That's a nice name.

117
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:46,731
You mean that guy who's just like Kudo?

118
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,031
Yeah.

119
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:50,631
Come to think of it,

120
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:54,231
he said he lives in Kyoto's Kamigyo Ward.

121
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:56,631
Which means...

122
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,931
Is Ran...

123
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,231
going to Kyoto to see Okita?

124
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:08,031
There's no way.

125
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,831
It's incidental.

126
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:12,631
She's just incidentally meeting Okita on her trip to Kyoto.

127
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:15,831
Maybe we'll incidentally run into Shinichi, too.

128
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:17,531
Yeah.

129
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,731
Incidental?

130
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:23,031
Seeing me is incidental?

131
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:28,931
Hold on.

132
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:33,131
Why is there a chance they'll see me in Kyoto?

133
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:37,531
Kyoto does crop up in mystery shows a lot,

134
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:40,631
but surely they don't think I'll show up

135
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:43,531
when there just happens to be a conveniently timed crime.

136
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,831
Crap!

137
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:51,631
Are you okay?

138
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,031
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,031
I'm glad you're not hurt.

140
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,831
I'll bring you a new iced coffee.

141
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:04,831
What do you think of this?

142
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,331
Looks good to me.

143
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:07,331
Yeah.

144
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,031
Looks like they didn't notice.

145
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:15,831
What is this?

146
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,831
It's so good!

147
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,731
These club sandwiches are good.

148
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:25,231
Yeah. They're perfectly toasted, too.

149
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,231
But they're not as good as Amuro's.

150
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,931
Excuse me.

151
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:35,831
What cafe are you talking about?

152
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:37,131
What?

153
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:39,131
"Daiki Saraie (33), Waiter" -I'd like to try it.

154
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,431
If you could please tell me...

155
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,631
It's on 5th street in Beika City.

156
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:45,931
Don't tell him!

157
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,531
If you tell him, he'll write about it on his blog.

158
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,331
"Toshinori Motosu (38)" -That cafe might have to close down.

159
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:56,431
I'm on the brink of shutting down my own cafe because of him!

160
00:09:56,431 --> 00:10:01,431
Sir, please don't make fake accusations against me.

161
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:07,331
I know you're the famous food blogger "the Stuffed Professor"!

162
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,431
Give me a break.

163
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:12,231
If you don't stop now...

164
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:15,531
I really will destroy you.

165
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:20,231
I still have a lot of other methods at my disposal.

166
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:25,131
We lost a lot of customers because you made our chef quit.

167
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:28,731
What's wrong with reducing a rival restaurant's patronage?

168
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,731
I wish you'd call it "business efforts".

169
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,231
Don't forget that the only reason

170
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:36,831
I haven't crushed you yet

171
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:38,431
is because you're the boss' younger brother.

172
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,931
Saraie.

173
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,131
What is it?

174
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:44,331
"Isuzu Naomura (27), Waiter" -What are you doing?

175
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:47,931
We've got food piling up.

176
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:49,331
Sorry.

177
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,931
I'm finished here. I'll be right there.

178
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:57,031
Anyway, have you given any thought

179
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,231
to becoming my girlfriend?

180
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:02,531
I told you I wasn't interested the other day.

181
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:05,331
The current manager will be retiring when she gets married,

182
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,431
and I'm next in line.

183
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:10,431
You wouldn't have to worry about money again.

184
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:13,531
I'm not interested in your money.

185
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:17,331
What are you talking about?

186
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:21,031
You changed your hairstyle to escape your debt collectors.

187
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,331
I don't know why you borrowed money,

188
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,431
but if you become my girlfriend, I'll protect you.

189
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:32,231
I've got a lot of influence with those guys.

190
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:34,331
Hey, you!

191
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,931
"Tamao Hasunuma (40)" -Why are you standing around chatting?

192
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,431
We've got customers waiting to order.

193
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:42,431
Yes, madam.

194
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:44,431
Jeez.

195
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,031
Well?

196
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:49,031
What do you think of our food, Toshinori?

197
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:53,831
The sandwiches pass,

198
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,731
but the stew and pasta are no good.

199
00:11:56,731 --> 00:11:59,231
I'll go to your kitchen to instruct your chefs later.

200
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:01,231
More importantly...

201
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:04,731
Can't you do something about that waiter?

202
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,031
You mean Saraie,

203
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,131
the waiter you called to complain about the other day.

204
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:14,131
I'll try talking to the owner,

205
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,931
but he's his nephew.

206
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,731
Anyway, Sister,

207
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:23,431
I'm surprised you went out with him even for a short while.

208
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:25,231
Don't remind me!

209
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:28,931
I'll be marrying a different, better man soon.

210
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,131
Thanks for the food.

211
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:33,931
Thank you.

212
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:39,131
How about the Kyoto National Museum?

213
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:42,231
They've got all kinds of national treasures on display.

214
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:44,031
Really?

215
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,031
Hey, Naomura.

216
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,431
Yes?

217
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:52,331
One of the big vases we had displayed at the entrance is missing.

218
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,731
Really?

219
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,131
I don't think I saw it when I arrived this morning.

220
00:12:57,131 --> 00:13:01,231
Could you look for it?

221
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:02,531
Sure.

222
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:07,031
Look. We can even check out the "Gakizoshi" painting.

223
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,331
What? But I don't like scary stuff.

224
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,531
But you live with a little imp.

225
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,931
Conan isn't an imp.

226
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,631
Hey, it's the imp!

227
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:22,631
The brat!

228
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,431
Dad, what are you doing here?

229
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,731
Well...

230
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:33,431
It sounded like you were secretly planning a trip.

231
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,931
We followed you because we were curious.

232
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:37,431
Right?

233
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,831
You're so straightforward.

234
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:42,631
Secretly?

235
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:44,931
Are you stupid?

236
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:49,931
Conan, I'm sure you'll experience this when you get older.

237
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:51,831
Experience what?

238
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,831
But this isn't an ordinary trip.

239
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,531
Not ordinary?

240
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:05,131
What was that scream?

241
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,631
What's going on?

242
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:11,531
Naomura!

243
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:14,031
"Changing Room"

244
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:16,231
Naomura?

245
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,431
Saraie?

246
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:22,731
What's wrong?

247
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,931
Saraie, wake up!

248
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:28,631
Saraie!

249
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,015
Saraie!

250
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:39,815
Saraie, wake up!

251
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:41,615
Saraie!

252
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,315
Don't touch him!

253
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:48,334
Let me take a look.

254
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,534
Okay.

255
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:54,834
Ran, call the police! Hurry!

256
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:56,934
Okay.

257
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:58,634
And an ambulance.

258
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:00,734
Don't bother.

259
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,534
You only need to call the police.

260
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:05,434
He doesn't have a pulse.

261
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:08,034
No way...

262
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,634
Who would do this to Saraie?

263
00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:14,334
We don't know who it was yet

264
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:18,134
but it must've been someone quite strong.

265
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:21,734
Not only did they club him to death with this giant vase,

266
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,834
but they even broke the padlock on the locker

267
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,134
and stole something.

268
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:30,934
I see.

269
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,634
A vase, huh?

270
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:37,034
While searching for the vase that is the murder weapon,

271
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:40,134
you came to this changing room where you found Saraie's body?

272
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,334
Yes.

273
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:45,234
The manager asked me to look for it.

274
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:46,534
Right?

275
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:48,134
Yes.

276
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:53,534
One of the two we had displayed by the entrance was missing.

277
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:57,934
Do you know when the vase went missing?

278
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:59,134
I'm not sure.

279
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:03,934
Usually, I'm first to arrive at the cafe and clean.

280
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:07,034
I think it was gone by then.

281
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:10,934
I'm the last to leave since I lock up.

282
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:14,034
The vase was there last night.

283
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,634
I see.

284
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:19,734
Are you two the only ones with keys to the cafe?

285
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:26,434
No. Saraie had a key to the entrance, too.

286
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:31,334
All our cooks have keys to the service entrance.

287
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,534
They've got prep to do.

288
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,334
Service entrance?

289
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,134
Yes.

290
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:40,334
It's this door just outside the changing room.

291
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,534
We can't be bothered to unlock and lock it during business hours,

292
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:45,034
so we leave it unlocked.

293
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:50,134
Start by questioning all the cooks in the kitchen.

294
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,934
See if they saw anyone enter this changing room immediately

295
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:55,434
before or after the victim.

296
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:56,534
Yes, sir.

297
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:01,834
Did you see anyone from inside the cafe?

298
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:07,134
We knew about the staff-only entrance since we saw it, but...

299
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:10,534
But we were chatting at our table.

300
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:13,534
We weren't watching it carefully.

301
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,834
But...

302
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:21,234
the detective watching us might have seen something.

303
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:23,934
I didn't see anything.

304
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,634
Right?

305
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,934
Hey, kid!

306
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:32,634
They're asking if we saw anything.

307
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:35,734
Oh, right.

308
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:39,434
Jeez. I can never tell what you're thinking.

309
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:43,334
Darn it. What's going on?

310
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,234
I don't have a clue.

311
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,534
Inspector Megure.

312
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:52,934
I finished questioning the cooks in the kitchen.

313
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:56,934
Apparently, no one left the kitchen

314
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:59,634
during the estimated time of death between 1:30 and 2:00.

315
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,234
I see.

316
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,934
Also, the changing room door

317
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:07,134
can't be seen from the kitchen entrance.

318
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:11,434
They don't know who entered the changing room during that time.

319
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:15,034
But a former chef of this restaurant

320
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:19,234
came to the kitchen to provide instruction.

321
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:21,634
That's...

322
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,634
my younger brother.

323
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:26,234
That's correct.

324
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:28,834
During that time, I came to the kitchen

325
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:32,734
to provide some cooking instruction at my sister's request,

326
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:36,834
but I didn't know he was in the changing room.

327
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:40,634
Besides, I'd never kill anyone.

328
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:43,134
But...

329
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:47,634
couldn't you have predicted that the victim would come here?

330
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:49,534
What?

331
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:53,334
Right? This room stinks of cigarettes.

332
00:18:53,334 --> 00:19:00,734
There's an ashtray packed full of cigarettes of the same brand.

333
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:05,034
The victim's mouth smelled strongly of cigarettes.

334
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,634
The victim was a heavy smoker, right?

335
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,134
You must've known he'd show up eventually

336
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:12,134
if you waited long enough.

337
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,334
Yes.

338
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:18,334
Saraie's the only employee here who smokes.

339
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:23,934
The entire staff would've known he came here frequently to smoke.

340
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:27,534
But the weapon is that vase, right?

341
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:31,034
It may be hollow, but it seems pretty heavy.

342
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:34,534
None of our employees could swing that thing around.

343
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:46,334
She's right. It's about as heavy as a 30kg bag of rice.

344
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:52,634
If there were water inside, not even I could swing that.

345
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:59,734
But couldn't a strong man like you do it?

346
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:01,534
I couldn't do that.

347
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,834
See? Look at this.

348
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:07,534
I dislocated it while playing baseball.

349
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:12,134
I can't even swing a frying pan in my own restaurant.

350
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:18,634
Which leaves...

351
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:26,034
I'm a woman. Is there a problem?

352
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,134
No...

353
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:34,434
By the way, that locker with the broken padlock...

354
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,534
Was that the victim's?

355
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:41,634
Yes, that's Saraie's locker.

356
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:47,234
Which means the culprit may have been after its contents.

357
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:55,734
It's been badly ransacked.

358
00:20:56,834 --> 00:21:00,234
Do you have any idea what was stolen?

359
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:03,834
I'm not sure. Only its owner would know for sure.

360
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:09,734
Why is this the only locker with a padlock?

361
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:13,934
He's been using it since he started working here.

362
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:17,634
I did think he was overly cautious.

363
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,534
The culprit really smashed the padlock.

364
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:23,034
How were they able to break it like this?

365
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:27,634
Does this cafe have a toolbox?

366
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,134
There's one in those drawers.

367
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:40,034
I see pliers, a hammer, screwdrivers, and a spanner.

368
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:44,434
None of those could break a padlock like that.

369
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:45,634
You're right.

370
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:52,534
The only other thing in here are these screws and nails.

371
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:06,034
Sorry.

372
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:45,734
"Next Episode" -In that case...

373
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,234
Who did it?

374
00:23:48,234 --> 00:23:49,734
Hey, Ran.

375
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,734
Don't you think he's acting different?

376
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,034
Who is?

377
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:55,634
Over there. Him.

378
00:23:57,234 --> 00:24:00,334
The brat with the glasses.

379
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:02,334
What's going on?

380
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:03,934
You can't figure it out?

381
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:05,034
No.

382
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:07,234
I don't have a clue.

383
00:24:08,134 --> 00:24:09,534
Next Conan,

384
