1
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,713
Fantastic!

2
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:10,813
So many yachts!

3
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:13,513
I wonder how far you can go on those?

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,513
Well, you can even go to countries abroad

5
00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:18,813
because the seas are connected.

6
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,513
I'd like to sail on one of those.

7
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:21,913
Me too.

8
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:24,113
More than that...

9
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:27,113
I'm kind of hungry so let's hurry back

10
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:29,013
and eat our lunch boxes.

11
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,613
So you're more into eating

12
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:33,713
than the spirit of adventure, aren't you, Genta?

13
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:44,013
It looks really delicious!

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,513
Hey, which one...

15
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:52,013
This is the place.

16
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:53,713
Mr. Takiguchi!

17
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,313
Shirakabe Hotel delivery service.

18
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:58,013
Your order is ready!

19
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,513
It's from a hotel!

20
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:02,313
No wonder it looks so good.

21
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,013
Hey, no matter how much you stare,

22
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,713
there's nothing for you guys.

23
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:06,813
Go away.

24
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:10,013
There's no need to be so mean.

25
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,013
"Nao Takiguchi (34)" -Thank you.

26
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:15,613
"President's Wife" -That was fast.

27
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:18,313
What a cute puppy!

28
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:20,713
His name's Coro.

29
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,513
What a pretty necklace!

30
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:24,713
Thank you.

31
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:28,513
But this is acrylic and cheap.

32
00:01:28,513 --> 00:01:31,713
Where shall I put the food, Miss?

33
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:34,913
I'm sorry. Would you please bring them on board the cruiser.

34
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:36,913
Why don't you all come too?

35
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:39,913
-But... -You're a total stranger to us...

36
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:42,713
The food of this hotel is delicious.

37
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:44,413
You'll come and eat, won't you?

38
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:46,713
But, if we eat,

39
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:49,013
you won't have enough for yourselves.

40
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:51,213
Children shouldn't be so hesitant.

41
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:52,913
"Kotaro Takiguchi, Company president" -I ordered enough food to last us

42
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,413
till dinner so there's more food than we can possibly eat!

43
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:58,613
You mean it's really okay for us to eat with you?

44
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:02,313
Sure, I was just thinking that we could use some company.

45
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:04,513
You're more than welcome to join us.

46
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:08,813
-Well, then, thank you! -Thank you!

47
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:15,513
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

48
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:17,313
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

49
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:19,013
We are all eye-witnesses.

50
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,913
The tycoon who dived into the sea.

51
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:22,313
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:24,213
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,613
His name is Detective Conan!

54
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:12,854
"The Man Betrayed by the Sea"

55
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,154
I wonder where they went off to?

56
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:18,354
It's because you were sleeping right through

57
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:20,754
despite coming to the beach.

58
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:23,954
Let's look for them a little more

59
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:25,954
and if we can't find them let's eat up their lunch boxes.

60
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:28,454
They curse you for it, if you do that.

61
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:31,054
Like they say, a grudge over food is scary, you know.

62
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:32,354
I guess so.

63
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:37,054
It's too bad that Conan and Ai

64
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:40,454
aren't getting to eat food as delicious as this!

65
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:42,454
That's not our problem!

66
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:45,754
Serves him right for coming to the beach and sleeping!

67
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:47,954
Do you have other friends here with you?

68
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,454
Yes. We're really good friends.

69
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:54,954
But, Ai said that she didn't want to get a sun tan.

70
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:59,654
Worrying about her skin at such a young age,

71
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:00,954
I'd sure like to see

72
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,854
what sort of beauty she'd turn out to be in the future.

73
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:05,254
Conan, despite being in elementary school

74
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,754
reads detective novels till early morning

75
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,054
and isn't very child like.

76
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:11,754
He's not cute.

77
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:14,154
Sorry I'm not cute.

78
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:15,454
Conan!

79
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:19,054
Then, you're Ai cutie-pie?

80
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:23,054
Yes, although I'm sorry I haven't turned into a beauty yet.

81
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:26,254
You're already quite a beauty...

82
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:28,754
for a grade schooler. Right?

83
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,654
What brings you two here?

84
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:34,854
That's for us to say, isn't it?

85
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:36,454
We came to look for you

86
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:38,454
because it's about time to eat lunch!

87
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,854
I feel bad for your mothers who made your lunch boxes,

88
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:44,854
but why not eat them on your way back or something.

89
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:47,654
Come here both of you and eat with us.

90
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:48,854
Do that.

91
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:51,154
This roast beef is delicious!

92
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:53,654
This lobster is superb too!

93
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:01,154
Mitsuhiko, you're eating too much lobster!

94
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:04,254
This is spiny lobster.

95
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:05,954
Are they different?

96
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,854
Dear.

97
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:10,454
The children will laugh at you.

98
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:14,054
You look like honeymooners.

99
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:18,054
Yeah, we just got married 6 months ago.

100
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:22,254
But this is my first marriage, you know.

101
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:24,554
I was so busy trying to enlarge my company

102
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:27,754
that I had forgotten about getting married.

103
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:35,654
How nice.

104
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:37,154
How nice it would be to go off shore in this cruiser

105
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:39,754
and swim in this beautiful sea.

106
00:06:39,754 --> 00:06:44,554
Impossible, you can't swim that much yet, can you, Ayumi?

107
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,254
If I owned a cruiser like this

108
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:48,154
I'd be able to swim right away.

109
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,254
That's the way to go, Ayumi.

110
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:52,054
No need to worry yourself over it.

111
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:54,854
I couldn't swim till this age either,

112
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:57,254
but I trained hard nd can swim now.

113
00:06:57,254 --> 00:07:00,154
Like they say, where there's a will, there's a way.

114
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,854
You went to a sports club, right?

115
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:04,754
No, since I rebuilt my house,

116
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:07,654
I made a pool too.

117
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,654
I'll show you something good.

118
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:15,554
I didn't know you took that kind of picture.

119
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:18,754
Cut it out already. It's embarrassing.

120
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,554
But, in the end...

121
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:21,554
See!

122
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:26,154
True.

123
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,754
You can swim!

124
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:29,954
Okay!

125
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:34,454
Let's race and see who'll get to the beached bank first!

126
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,354
Ayumi, you can go ahead and use a float.

127
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:38,854
Okay, let's do it!

128
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,154
No!

129
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:42,554
You just drank wine.

130
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:44,854
Moreover, you've got high blood pressure

131
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,954
so rest a while before doing so.

132
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:50,554
Heck, I was so sure I could win.

133
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:57,154
How old is Coro?

134
00:07:57,154 --> 00:07:59,554
He just turned one year old.

135
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:02,854
The metal on his collar is rusted.

136
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:07,554
I wonder if it's because we take him for walks even on rainy days.

137
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,754
We should be heading back soon.

138
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:14,454
I forgot.

139
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:18,254
How could you have a feast without me?

140
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:21,954
Isn't it only natural that someone comes to tell me about it?

141
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:26,054
I was so worried that I was just about to call the police.

142
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:28,954
You'll have indigestion if you eat while angry.

143
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:31,354
Here goes!

144
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:34,854
Here goes!

145
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,354
Nice shot!

146
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:38,754
Here.

147
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:46,654
Isn't that Nao and Kotaro's cruiser that's sailing out over there?

148
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,554
You're right.

149
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,354
Yes, Nao's come out too.

150
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:54,154
I wonder if he's planning to swim?

151
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:57,254
Kotaro! Thank you for everything!

152
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:04,754
Let's swim too.

153
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:05,754
I guess so.

154
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:10,154
-I'll go get the float then. -What's this? It feels different!

155
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:12,754
Somebody... Somebody!

156
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:14,654
Oh no! He's drowning!

157
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,654
Dear!

158
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:36,354
"Tokyo Fire Department"

159
00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:38,254
I hope he's okay.

160
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:41,254
I don't feel like having fun anymore.

161
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:42,254
True.

162
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:45,054
Although it's still early, let's call it a day today.

163
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:47,254
Let's call the fire department about Mr. Taguchi later

164
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,354
and find out how he's doing.

165
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:55,554
You're the children

166
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,754
that were with the Takiguchi's a while ago, aren't you?

167
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:00,054
I went to get the dishes,

168
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:02,254
but there was nobody on the cruiser.

169
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:04,654
Do you know anything?

170
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:08,054
Then let us get the dishes for you.

171
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:19,054
I see, they didn't let you ride the ambulance?

172
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:25,754
Maybe we should take Nao and Kotaro's clothes over to them, no?

173
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:27,754
Yeah, I guess so.

174
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,654
Is this really an accident?

175
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:38,754
Although detailed investigation is yet to come,

176
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,254
according to eye-witness reports,

177
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:43,054
there's no mistake that he dived in himself.

178
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:44,854
"Ryoichi Katagiri (48), Takiguchi's secretary" -Unbelievable.

179
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,254
Any possibility that someone pushed him over?

180
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:51,954
"Detective Ishiyama" -Only he and his wife were on board the cruiser.

181
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:54,754
Are you saying that his wife pushed him over?

182
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,554
Not really.

183
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:59,554
The president used to say,

184
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:02,354
that when he was a child, he almost drowned in the river.

185
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:05,554
So since then he'd been afraid of water and unable to swim.

186
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,154
He went trained hard recently

187
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:09,254
and learned now to swim!

188
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,054
And you are?

189
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,954
Excuse us.

190
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:19,754
The children happen to become acquainted with the Takiguchi's.

191
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,654
And since they said the Takiguchi's treated them very cordially

192
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,354
we came over to see them.

193
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:25,354
We brought their clothes over too.

194
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:28,654
Coro was left behind too.

195
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,454
How is Mr. Takiguchi?

196
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:36,154
Well, I hate to say this but...

197
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,954
We confirmed his death a while ago.

198
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:43,454
No.

199
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,454
How could someone so nice pass away?

200
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,354
I don't believe it.

201
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:51,654
At any rate, detective,

202
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:54,754
please check carefully whether it was really an accident or not.

203
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:58,454
We've been repeatedly telling the president from before he got married

204
00:11:58,454 --> 00:12:00,654
that his wife was only after his estate.

205
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:04,254
But, he completely fell for her and was deceived by that woman

206
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:07,154
and ended up this way.

207
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:08,854
Are you saying that Nao's to blame?

208
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,254
Somebody so nice would never do something so evil!

209
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:14,254
Hey, hey...

210
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,954
I'm very sorry.

211
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:19,154
Are you from Mr. Takiguchi's company?

212
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:22,554
Yes. I'm his chief secretary, Katagiri.

213
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:24,854
Did you children see the accident?

214
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:26,254
Yeah, we did.

215
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:30,154
Mr. Takiguchi drowned right before our eyes.

216
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:32,754
Mr. Takiguchi waved at us

217
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,354
and then dived into the sea.

218
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,454
I see.

219
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:40,154
Then, will you come to the station with me

220
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,354
and tell me about what happened back then?

221
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:44,054
-Yes... -Yes, sir.

222
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:54,664
When Mr. Takiguchi dove in

223
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:57,164
do you know where Mrs. Takiguchi was?

224
00:12:57,164 --> 00:13:00,664
She was doing something some distance away.

225
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:04,264
Maybe she was putting away the dishes after lunch.

226
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:09,764
I see. That's why she didn't realize right away that he was drowning.

227
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:10,764
Come in.

228
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:16,864
Nao.

229
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:20,564
Ayumi.

230
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:23,164
Thank you for bringing our clothes.

231
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:28,264
Nao. Your necklace...

232
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:30,564
I'm sure that the chain broke

233
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:31,664
and sank into the sea

234
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:33,364
when I dove in to save him.

235
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:38,564
I heard what these children had to say,

236
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:40,864
and it seems that your husband had in fact,

237
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:42,964
dove into the sea on his own.

238
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,664
So, there's probably no mistake

239
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:47,264
that this was just an unfortunate accident.

240
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:49,364
I'm to blame.

241
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,664
He may have learned how to swim,

242
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,964
but I shouldn't have taken my eyes off him.

243
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:58,964
That was the one other thing I wanted to ask you about.

244
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,964
I hear that Mr. Taguchi told his colleagues that he couldn't swim,

245
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:06,964
but did he really master how to swim?

246
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:12,064
Yes. Show him the practice video.

247
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:14,064
That's right.

248
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:18,764
This is the image of him when he first practiced swimming in the pool.

249
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:20,864
-You're doing good! -My pictures in the pool

250
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:24,064
-Keep it up! You're doing good! -were taken by the housekeeper.

251
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,564
And this is what was taken last week.

252
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:34,364
You're doing good, keep it up!

253
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:36,564
Don't stop and turn!

254
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:40,164
I see.

255
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:43,164
It's true that he could swim.

256
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:46,264
Come here, will you.

257
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:49,964
What is it, Conan?

258
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:52,164
Show me the video camera.

259
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:53,764
Okay.

260
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:05,664
Is there anything important shown here?

261
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:06,964
You're right.

262
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:09,464
Yes. Nao's come out too.

263
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:13,664
Okay, the voices are recorded too.

264
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,364
The problem is after this...

265
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:18,964
Let's swim too.

266
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:19,964
I guess so.

267
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:24,464
-I'll go get the float then. -What's this? It feels different!

268
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:27,164
Somebody... Somebody!

269
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:31,064
Over here.

270
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,964
Can you zoom this up?

271
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,364
Yes, although the picture would become grainy.

272
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:39,564
Somebody... Somebody!

273
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:49,364
Dear!

274
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:53,864
What's going on?

275
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:55,464
There's a slight time lapse from the time

276
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:57,264
that Kotaro is about to drown

277
00:15:57,264 --> 00:16:00,464
to the time Nao jumps in to save him.

278
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:05,164
Besides, that cruiser was equipped with a life saving float,

279
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,864
and yet why didn't she use it?

280
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:09,164
One more thing.

281
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:13,564
What was that image that was taken during the swimming practice?

282
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,564
Maybe Kotaro actually...

283
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:21,564
What're you two doing in secret?

284
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:28,264
The metal on its collar is rusted.

285
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,764
I wonder if it's because we take him for walks even on rainy days.

286
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:34,764
I get it.

287
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,464
All right, I'm sorry to have taken up your time,

288
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:44,664
but you may go now.

289
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:47,664
I'll drive you to the hospital, Mrs. Takiguchi.

290
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:49,064
Thank you all.

291
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:52,064
Will you please wait.

292
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:54,564
Is there something you'd like to say?

293
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:56,964
Oh, no.

294
00:16:56,964 --> 00:16:59,664
This not just a mere accident.

295
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:02,164
It is a carefully schemed homicide.

296
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:04,364
What? What was that?

297
00:17:04,364 --> 00:17:05,964
What?

298
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:09,464
But, Mr. Takiguchi dove into the sea himself.

299
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:13,864
Yes, but if he knew that the wouldn't be able to swim,

300
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:17,664
he probably wouldn't have dove in of his own initiative.

301
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,964
Mr. Takiguchi, although he couldn't swim

302
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:22,064
was made to believe that he could

303
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:23,664
and suddenly taken off shore

304
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:27,164
where his feet couldn't touch the bottom.

305
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:30,464
Wouldn't this be considered nothing but murder?

306
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:33,364
Correct, Mrs. Nao Takiguchi?

307
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:36,064
My husband could swim.

308
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,664
You saw for yourself too, didn't you?

309
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:42,364
Are you saying that there was some trick involved in that image?

310
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:45,864
No, that image is genuine.

311
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,264
Mr. Takiguchi could swim.

312
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:50,364
What on earth are you getting at?

313
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:51,964
However...

314
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:54,664
Only in the pool of his home.

315
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:55,664
Conan!

316
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:56,964
Yes!

317
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,764
Please lend it to me.

318
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:04,464
Please look at Nao's necklace here during his swimming practice.

319
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:08,164
See. It's sunk underwater, isn't it?

320
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:10,364
But, on the last day...

321
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:12,364
See, it's floating on the water!

322
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:13,464
What?

323
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:14,764
Let me see.

324
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,864
The necklace that was sunk is afloat.

325
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,364
What is the meaning of this?

326
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:25,664
Will you explain it in simple terms for me?

327
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:30,064
Why is the necklace afloat?

328
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:32,864
Coro pointed it out.

329
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:35,264
The metal on the collar of Coro

330
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:40,264
who is still on a year old is for some reason already rusted.

331
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:44,964
Mrs. Takiguchi poured a large amount of bath salt into the pool.

332
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:48,064
So that the body would float more easily.

333
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:51,264
The necklace in the video was acrylic.

334
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:56,564
The specific gravity of acrylics is 1.17 to 1.2,

335
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:59,464
so the specific gravity of the pool water the other day,

336
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:02,264
would've had to be heavier than that.

337
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:05,364
Correct, Mrs. Takiguchi?

338
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:08,364
No, if I put that much bath salt in the water,

339
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:10,964
no matter how dense my husband is, he would've noticed.

340
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:13,164
Then, what did you insert?

341
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:14,964
The necklace that sank in the sea

342
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:17,664
is afloat in the video image, you know?

343
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:20,064
Either way, this video is proof

344
00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:24,264
that the specific gravity of the pool water is heavy.

345
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,964
Shall we go over to your residence and check it out now?

346
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:29,964
There's no water even if you did.

347
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:33,164
The water of the pool has been drained.

348
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:35,364
Don't take the police lightly.

349
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:37,964
Just a minimum amount of residue in the pool

350
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:41,664
is enough to determine what was dissolved there.

351
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:47,064
Mrs. Takiguchi, is what he's saying true?

352
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,364
How about it?

353
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:52,564
Nao, it's not true, is it?

354
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:57,264
It's true.

355
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,364
It is... it's just as he said.

356
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:04,264
At first I poured in bath salt but,

357
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:08,764
when I increased the amount, he noticed it.

358
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:12,064
From then I switched over to using water soluble polymer.

359
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:16,164
To a non-toxic substance used in drugs and foodstuff.

360
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:19,764
The specific gravity of the pool water last week

361
00:20:19,764 --> 00:20:22,264
would've probably been over 1.3.

362
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,664
1.3 would mean that you could float on your back and read a book.

363
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,464
It's the same as that of the Dead Sea.

364
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:31,164
It's understandable that Mr. Takiguchi

365
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:35,564
would be under the mistaken impression that he could swim.

366
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:39,464
I guess you took the video as a safeguard

367
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:42,164
in case you were interrogated by the police,

368
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:46,064
but that video on the contrary gave you away.

369
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:54,564
All that guy had in mind till now was to enlarge his company.

370
00:20:54,564 --> 00:20:56,064
If to pursue his purpose,

371
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:59,864
he'd use whatever way he had to no matter how dirty.

372
00:20:59,864 --> 00:21:03,664
He probably had no idea how many people suffered because of him.

373
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:08,664
So, I was thinking of making him suffer,

374
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:12,664
but I just couldn't bear living with a guy with no common sense

375
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:15,664
or sophistication any longer.

376
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:20,164
I've had it.

377
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:24,464
It may be true that Mr. Takiguchi was desperate trying to make money

378
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:27,864
and didn't have any common sense nor sophistication

379
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:31,164
but wasn't he more human than you,

380
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,764
who took someone's life just for the sake of revenge?

381
00:23:03,364 --> 00:23:06,764
I was so sure that she was a nice person and yet...

382
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,664
I thought that she was nice

383
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:10,864
when we were eating over at her place.

384
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:13,864
I don't trust adults anymore!

385
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:16,364
There are all kinds of adults.

386
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:18,364
-An array of them. -Exactly!

387
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:22,064
I still possess a pure heart!

388
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:24,064
Did you say something?

389
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:26,764
By the way, where's the left over lunch boxes?

390
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:29,264
That's right. Thanks to the lunch we were invited to,

391
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:30,964
we still have our lunch boxes!

392
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:32,664
Let's hurry and eat it!

393
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:35,364
Now that you mentioned it, I'm hungry.

394
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:37,364
I wonder what the side dish for today is?

395
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:43,464
Hey! I thought you guys were depressed.

396
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,764
Oh, true! You're carrying Tai!

397
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:50,464
This cat is my granddaughter's pet cat!

398
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:54,064
These people came claiming that they are the owners.

399
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:57,364
No, I'm the real owner.

400
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:00,164
No, you're not! I'm telling you it's me, aren't I?

401
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:02,964
He's not ordinary.

402
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:05,964
Let's ask the master of solving mysteries to join us too.

403
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:09,264
Next Conan,

404
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:13,264
"Lucky Calico Cat Case (Part 1)".
