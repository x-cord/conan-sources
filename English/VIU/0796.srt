1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,549
Inspector. He probably fell from there.

2
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,749
The window of the fifth floor corridor was left opened.

3
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,849
And there were traces of the victim's footprints on the window frame too.

4
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,949
Then, I guess there's no mistake about it.

5
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,049
The problem is...

6
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,449
Why he fell?

7
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,849
Mouri?

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,249
Hi, there. I saw you, Inspector,

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,249
and thought that maybe I could be of some help.

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,750
He says.

11
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,149
"Chosaku Kanbayashi (38)" -This man...

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,349
Could he by chance be the novelist...

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,549
Mr. Chosaku Kanbayashi.

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,149
He seems to have been renting a workshop on the fifth floor here.

15
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,549
Chosaku Kanbayashi is a mystery novelist, isn't he?

16
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,949
His books are selling pretty well, aren't they?

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,249
Not pretty well!

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,049
"Seiko Kanbayashi (35)" -My husband...

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,250
"Kiyoshi Sugiyama (58)" -was super first class.

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,449
She's Seiko Kanbayashi, his wife.

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,849
The corpse has already verified.

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,949
Not so.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,949
She seems to be the first discoverer.

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,749
You mean she found her husband's corpse?

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,849
Why'd you die...

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,250
Why'd this have to happen?

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,749
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,849
Love and cases come from the same origin.

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,849
Lovey-dovey couples get along.

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,749
But the two have an underside?

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,349
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,349
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,550
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:35,921
"The Secret of the Lovey-dovey Couple."

35
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,217
Then...

36
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,017
Please tell us again,

37
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:43,117
how you found the corpse.

38
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:44,217
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:46,817
This morning, before he left...

40
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:49,117
My husband asked me to...

41
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:52,217
My work documents will be arriving in the morning.

42
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:54,517
So I'd like you to bring it over to my workshop.

43
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:55,817
Oh... But...

44
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,217
I know.

45
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:59,917
You can watch the program first,

46
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:01,417
and deliver it to me after that, so please.

47
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,817
So, I took the documents that arrived.

48
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:07,217
And left the house at 12:00 sharp.

49
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:09,217
But, when I called him to say I was coming over,

50
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:11,117
he didn't answer the phone.

51
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,517
I thought that maybe he got sick or something.

52
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:16,718
So I asked the security guard to open the door with a spare key.

53
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:21,417
Mr. Kanbayashi's not in.

54
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,518
He couldn't have gone out, though.

55
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,917
Mrs. Kanbayashi came around 12:20

56
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,817
and he was found right after that.

57
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:47,217
His wristwatch is broken and stopped at 11:50.

58
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:51,417
It's likely that he fell at this time.

59
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,317
So, 30 minutes before he was found.

60
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:57,618
But, I wonder why he's wearing work gloves?

61
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:05,517
These work gloves look new.

62
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:09,317
And about those sneakers...

63
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:11,117
When I saw him this morning,

64
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:13,517
I think he was wearing leather shoes.

65
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:15,117
What?

66
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:18,517
And his scrape wounds on his face,

67
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,717
I wonder what they are?

68
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,617
He probably scraped his face on the ground

69
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:23,417
when he fell...

70
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:27,118
If so, grains of sand should be stuck too, right?

71
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:32,817
Either way, something may come up in the autopsy.

72
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:36,017
Besides, if we check Mr. Kanbayashi's workshop,

73
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,918
we may come up with something too.

74
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:43,617
It's a picture of when you were both really young, isn't it?

75
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:44,717
Yes.

76
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:48,017
We were poor when we just got married.

77
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:50,717
So, it was tough buying the fox and badger stuffed animal

78
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:53,017
in the picture too.

79
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:56,418
I didn't know he kept that picture.

80
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,317
Did you notice anything different

81
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,217
about Kanbayashi this morning?

82
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:02,417
Nothing in particular.

83
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:06,517
He just went out for about five minutes to buy cigarettes.

84
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:10,117
It's your wedding anniversary?

85
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:12,617
Yes. I'm grateful to my wife

86
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:15,917
because I'm what I am now thanks to her.

87
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,017
It's too embarrassing to say

88
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:19,017
so I haven't said it, though.

89
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:20,917
I'll be right back.

90
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:24,317
He said something like that?

91
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,817
It's the opposite.

92
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,917
Thanks to Kanbayashi,

93
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,117
God knows what a great life I've lead.

94
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:35,217
It doesn't sound as if any problems existed.

95
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:37,117
It seems that your husband,

96
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:40,217
judging from his wearing work gloves and sneakers

97
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:42,317
seems to have been working on something

98
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,718
then accidentally fell to his death.

99
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:50,317
It was... An accident?

100
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:53,117
But, Inspector Megure...

101
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:57,217
There's nothing outside that window.

102
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,517
I see.

103
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,717
I guess it's hard to believe he was working on something.

104
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:05,817
If so, it's homicide?

105
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:11,717
Somebody cornered Mr. Kanbayashi to the window and pushed him.

106
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,817
But, Pops...

107
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:15,817
No way!

108
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:17,817
Today is a holiday,

109
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:21,317
so the only one in this building was Mr. Kanbayashi.

110
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:23,317
Even if someone were to have snuck in the only way,

111
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,817
they could come in and out was from the staff doorway.

112
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:28,617
But I was there.

113
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:29,817
Right?

114
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:30,918
You brat!

115
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,617
If so, the only other option is suicide.

116
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,817
That's possible.

117
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:42,317
He was saying that today was the deadline for a manuscript.

118
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:44,917
So, he could've been cornered and acted on impulse.

119
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:50,017
I didn't realize that he was suffering that much.

120
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:51,917
It's my fault.

121
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:53,217
A writer committing suicide.

122
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:56,218
Because he can't write is often.

123
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:58,517
But...

124
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:00,517
If he jumped to his death impulsively,

125
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:02,317
he wouldn't have jumped from the window

126
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:04,418
of the corridor but from here, no?

127
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,717
Really...

128
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:09,417
"Fumito Ikejiri (35)" -Really, Mrs. Kanbayashi?

129
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,017
Is it true that Mr. Kanbayashi died?

130
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:13,917
Mr. Ikejiri?

131
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:15,917
I came to take a look on Mr. Kanbayashi

132
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:17,217
wondering how he was progressing on his manuscript

133
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:19,217
and heard that he passed away!

134
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,617
Yes.

135
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:24,517
He's the publisher who was in charge of Kanbayashi.

136
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:27,017
I'm sorry to have to do this,

137
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:29,217
but I've got to think of a way to cope with this situation.

138
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,518
Please let me confirm the manuscript!

139
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:35,417
You...

140
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:37,017
He's just doing his job.

141
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,018
And besides, if it's suicide...

142
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,017
It... It's finished!

143
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,817
It is.

144
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:48,717
But, when I called him this morning...

145
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:50,517
I'm stuck you see.

146
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:54,118
And won't be finished until 16:00 at the earliest.

147
00:08:55,918 --> 00:09:01,317
And yet, he was finished with it by noon when he died...

148
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:05,417
He was probably just teasing, Mr. Ikejiri.

149
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:09,817
Sensei's last joke.

150
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,817
So, the possibility of suicide has also become slim.

151
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,817
Accident, murder, suicide.

152
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:19,917
None of it fits the logic!

153
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,117
Something's...

154
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:23,617
Just not apparent yet.

155
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:27,018
There should be some clue in this room...

156
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,717
Courier bags.

157
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:33,117
These are...

158
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:34,417
Documents.

159
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:37,417
I wonder if he had them sent here all the time.

160
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:39,518
If so, then, why just today was it...

161
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:42,318
"Circle P."

162
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,218
What're you doing?

163
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:49,418
It's a receipt from the convenience store nearby.

164
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:52,117
It's strange, isn't it?

165
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:55,517
"Gloves 1 Pair" -He bought a carton of cigarettes with working gloves.

166
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:57,117
"Mini Seven 1 Carton" -Moreover, is this morning...

167
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,418
Which means somewhere...

168
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,617
"Mini Seven Extra Lights."

169
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:05,417
See, I found it, the cigarettes!

170
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:09,317
And yet, he went out to buy some, Mr. Kanbayashi?

171
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,917
10 minutes before he fell to his death.

172
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:14,118
True, it's strange.

173
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:18,517
He used to do things like that sometimes too.

174
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,417
When he gets absorbed in work he forgets

175
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,618
that he's stocked things up.

176
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:26,117
So, she says...

177
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:29,217
I'll be heading back to the company, then.

178
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:31,918
I'll come back again to think up what we should do later.

179
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:41,718
Excuse me, ma'am.

180
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:51,217
I just thought it was a bit strange...

181
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,617
Wasn't that picture always there from before?

182
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:55,917
No way.

183
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:59,018
It's been over for them for quite some time already.

184
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:02,717
Mrs. Kanbayashi wanted a divorce

185
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:04,417
but Mr. Kanbayashi was a money monger

186
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:06,017
so he didn't want to pay alimony

187
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,217
so he kept avoiding talks of divorce.

188
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:10,217
I see.

189
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:12,617
She went head over heels over Korean stars

190
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,817
after she got sick of Mr. Kanbayashi.

191
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,117
Don't tell anybody about this.

192
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:19,717
Oh, okay.

193
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:21,117
Mrs. Kanbayashi!

194
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:22,417
Yes?

195
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:24,517
According to my information network,

196
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,917
I hear that your relationship with your husband had long been over.

197
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:28,918
That seems to be the key

198
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:34,517
to solve the case of your husband falling to his death lies.

199
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:37,517
It's true that we had crucial times.

200
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:41,317
But, we've worked everything out already.

201
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:44,417
I wouldn't like you to bring something like up at this point.

202
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,017
Oh... Well...

203
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,818
-Mouri. -Mr. Mouri.

204
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,418
Oh... Well?

205
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:57,217
Something's not right...

206
00:11:57,218 --> 00:12:00,017
Murder, suicide, accident.

207
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:02,417
No matter what you consider, nothing fits into place.

208
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:05,318
"Circle P, Mini Seven Extra Lights" -And it's fishy.

209
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:11,517
What was Mr. Kanbayashi doing here anyway?

210
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:13,418
Standing at this window?

211
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,517
There's a window on the other side too.

212
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:19,917
I see!

213
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:22,918
If so, everything falls into place...

214
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:25,318
"Ristorante Buono."

215
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:29,418
The location's about here...

216
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:31,918
The men's washroom?

217
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:38,918
A window and a window...

218
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:42,617
The width is about two meters.

219
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:43,817
If you put your mind to it,

220
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,818
you could jump from here to there.

221
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,817
"Cleaning Checklist" -Cleaning is done every day

222
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,817
at 7:00, 11:00 and 17:00.

223
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:54,717
As long as everything's put back in place till then...

224
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:58,617
Besides, no matter what time the documents arrive,

225
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,317
it's possible to predict that Mrs. Kanabayashi

226
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:03,117
would leave the house after 12:00.

227
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:06,917
It takes 20 minutes from their residence to here on foot.

228
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,217
Between the house and here is...

229
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:09,917
"Beika Ryokuchi."

230
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:11,518
Is Beika Ryokuchi?

231
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,718
Trees make the place dark even in the daytime...

232
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:21,117
But, since he took the distance of two meters lightly,

233
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:22,518
he failed...

234
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:25,817
What?

235
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:27,117
Mrs. Kanbayashi is lying?

236
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:28,317
Lying?

237
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,517
Mrs. Kanbayashi says that she left home

238
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,217
at 12:00 sharp, correct?

239
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:38,317
But, her neighbor witnessed her leaving much earlier.

240
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,517
At around 11:20!

241
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:45,717
Which means she already arrived here at around 11:40?

242
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:49,217
Mr. Kanbayashi fell to his death at around 11:50.

243
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:52,017
If she arrived at around 11:40,

244
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:54,617
she could've pushed him down!

245
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:56,717
But, even if she could've come here,

246
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:58,017
she wouldn't have been able to enter

247
00:13:58,018 --> 00:13:59,417
without being seen by the security guard.

248
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:02,317
I wonder if doubting her to begin with is...

249
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:05,617
But she was lying about the time that is the key, you know!

250
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:08,618
That's true but...

251
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,718
Just what does it mean?

252
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:20,405
Mrs. Kanbayashi was able to arrive here by 11:40...

253
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:23,904
11:40?

254
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,704
That's just when Mr. Kanbayashi...

255
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:30,204
Maybe back then...

256
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:31,704
If so...

257
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,505
The scrape wounds he had...

258
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,005
"Cleaning Checklist."

259
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:39,704
This is it!

260
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,405
Mr. Mouri!

261
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:46,204
I'm sure she'll spit it out if we corner her!

262
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:47,904
But, Mr. Mouri...

263
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:49,004
This is bad!

264
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:52,104
There's still one thing that hasn't been cleared!

265
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:56,904
It's true that I left home at 11:20 the first time.

266
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,004
What do you mean by the first time?

267
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:03,604
I was in a rush wanting to deliver the documents to him right away,

268
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,704
so I forgot to lock the house, you see.

269
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,904
I walked part way and hurried back.

270
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:13,904
Then I left the house again at around 12:00 sharp.

271
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:16,004
I see.

272
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:18,004
So she says, Mr. Mouri.

273
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:19,304
That's...

274
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,105
Too convenient to be true...

275
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:27,405
Let's get a "convenience" beer!

276
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:29,804
Mr. Chosaku Kanbayashi falling to his death

277
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,904
is indeed quite incomprehensible.

278
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:35,304
But, I finally solved it.

279
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:37,104
Mrs. Seiko Kanbayashi.

280
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:41,604
You were about to be killed by your husband.

281
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,304
Me?

282
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:44,904
What?

283
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:47,804
His motive was that he found someone new

284
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:49,404
or something like that.

285
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:50,504
No.

286
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:53,204
But, if he were to simply kill you,

287
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:54,904
he'd risk being suspected.

288
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:58,904
Therefore, he tried to fake an alibi.

289
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,304
First, in order to lure you here,

290
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:04,704
he asked you to bring his documents over.

291
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:07,504
He deliberately worked it out

292
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,004
so that the documents that were always delivered here were delivered

293
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:11,104
to the residence.

294
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:14,304
Then at 11:40,

295
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,305
Mr. Kanbayashi lied saying

296
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:18,004
that he was going out to get cigarettes,

297
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:20,104
and went to the building next door,

298
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,104
to the fifth floor with the window in question,

299
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:25,604
and opened the window of the men's washroom.

300
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:29,104
Then he comes back looking his usual self...

301
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,904
He changes into his sneakers.

302
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:34,604
He jumps to the window of the building on the other side.

303
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,504
He walks through inside the building...

304
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,104
And ambushes you around Beika Ryokuchi

305
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:40,205
and then kills you!

306
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:44,105
If he takes a reverse route and returns...

307
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,804
I've finally somehow managed to finish it.

308
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:52,504
He then gives the manuscript to Mr. Ikejiri.

309
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:55,004
All he had left to do after that was

310
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:56,704
to close the window of the men's washroom of the building next door

311
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:58,204
that had been left opened,

312
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,004
then all done...

313
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:01,504
Since today's a holiday,

314
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:05,104
there's nobody who would use that restroom.

315
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:09,404
The cleaners come at 17:00 after coming at 11:00,

316
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,004
so if he closed the window by then,

317
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:13,304
no one would notice.

318
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:16,304
Your corpse would've eventually been found

319
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:17,704
and the estimated time of your death would've been determined

320
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,004
to be at around noon today.

321
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:24,104
But Mr. Kanbayashi's alibi would have been established

322
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:27,604
by the security guard who had been at this building

323
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,004
from morning till night.

324
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:32,104
He left the room around five minutes at one time but,

325
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:36,004
since it's impossible to make a round trip from the scene of the crime,

326
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:37,804
no one would make a point of it.

327
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:40,704
He finished the manuscript beforehand

328
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,304
because he wouldn't have been able to write

329
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:45,804
after committing murder!

330
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:49,604
That was just a prop to lead people to think that

331
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:51,204
there was no intent of murder involved.

332
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,504
Everything was schemed

333
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,004
so that he could flee after killing his wife.

334
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,104
Correct.

335
00:17:58,105 --> 00:18:02,904
Although Mr. Kanbayashi wore work gloves as well as sneakers,

336
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:07,204
he couldn't jump over to the window on the other side like he planned.

337
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:10,904
He failed and fell to his death...

338
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,005
Which means it was an accident!

339
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:16,104
What an idiot.

340
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,204
I'm an idiot too.

341
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:22,004
I didn't even realize that I was in his way,

342
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,304
so much so that he wanted to get rid of me.

343
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:25,804
Mrs. Kanbayashi...

344
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,704
You can cut out the acting already.

345
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:30,104
-What? -Yes?

346
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:32,604
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

347
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:36,604
Mr. Kanbayashi didn't fail to jump over

348
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,504
to the next building,

349
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:41,005
he couldn't because you got in his way!

350
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:47,704
After you left your home at 11:20,

351
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:51,304
you arrived at this building at 11:40.

352
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:54,405
At that time, you witnessed it, didn't you?

353
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:59,105
Mr. Kanbayashi's suspicious actions...

354
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,004
You, who also doubted the fact that he had the documents

355
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:05,004
sent to your residence just today,

356
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:07,004
followed Mr. Kanbayashi

357
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:09,105
and realized what he was up to!

358
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:13,505
Then you decided to use his own plan against him.

359
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:37,705
In other words,

360
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:40,805
his fall was a result of homicide.

361
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,804
I could never...

362
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,604
And you along with the security guard

363
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,604
became the first discoverer of the corpse.

364
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,504
Because unless you brought a third person along,

365
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,304
you would've risked being suspected.

366
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:59,904
You're the one who will get the most out of your husband's death.

367
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:02,904
You'll get a load of insurance money coming in too.

368
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:06,904
It's all evil imagination.

369
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,204
I think the evidence is left

370
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:11,905
in the restroom in question of the building next door.

371
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,804
I got it!

372
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:16,404
Mr. Kanbayashi's eyelash

373
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,504
from the tip of the brush of the deck brush.

374
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:21,304
And, we got this from the floor too!

375
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,804
A woman's hair.

376
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,204
Everything will be cleared

377
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:28,505
after a DNA examination, I'm sure.

378
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:31,904
That idiot husband of mine's been trying

379
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:34,205
to kill me all this time.

380
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:38,105
That's why I did the same thing.

381
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:46,004
I got rid of him.

382
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:49,305
I didn't think I'd get caught, though.

383
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:54,804
I always wanted to get rid of him from before.

384
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:56,604
All I did was stick a brush out

385
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,905
at the face of that stupid husband of mine.

386
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:03,804
What's with that attitude of yours after having killed somebody!

387
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,805
They're no different from each other.

388
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:09,304
Although they both wanted to kill each other,

389
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:11,804
they faked being a couple that was on good terms.

390
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:15,305
That's a fox and badger for you, no doubt.

391
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:41,005
Mrs. Kanbayashi...

392
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:45,204
Will you tell me something?

393
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:48,304
Mr. Kanbayashi's murder plan failed

394
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:52,604
because you left the residence 40 minutes earlier than planned.

395
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:55,704
Your favorite Korean star TV program was being aired

396
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:58,505
but why didn't you watch it till the end?

397
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:02,804
That's because, Mr. Mouri...

398
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:07,404
I thought up a great trick of killing that stupid husband,

399
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:10,704
making his death look like an accident.

400
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:13,205
A great trick.

401
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,904
Then, I couldn't help it,

402
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:21,104
I just wanted to carry it out as soon as I possibly could.

403
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:23,304
Like they say,

404
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:25,405
strike while the iron's hot!

405
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:31,004
-Hey, wait! -Hey, wait!

406
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:34,405
My god, what's with that woman...

407
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,705
Geez...

408
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,504
"Next Episode" -Quiet or I'll kill you!

409
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,204
Give me the jewelry!

410
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:48,604
"Crime Plan."

411
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:50,304
Crime Plan?

412
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,804
Oh, my...

413
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,404
My dear Mr. Mirage is doomed!

414
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:57,704
Funachi will not be defeated!

415
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,004
Here it is!

416
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:02,104
But the most important thing isn't here.

417
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:07,904
For this could be the birth of Detective Funachi!

418
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:13,405
