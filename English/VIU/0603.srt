1
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,825
You're lost after all, aren't you?

2
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:17,525
I've known that for ages already!

3
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:20,625
I told you to make a left back there.

4
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,725
There's a house!

5
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,425
What? Saved!

6
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,325
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

7
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,725
Tears are start of all dramas.

8
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:40,325
A gathering of fervent fans.

9
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:42,725
The locked room mystery of and idol that disappeared.

10
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:44,425
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:46,425
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:48,925
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:35,202
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (First Locked room)"

14
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:39,452
Excuse me! Is anybody home?

15
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,552
Excuse me!

16
00:02:46,952 --> 00:02:49,352
Oh, sorry to bother you, but we got lost.

17
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:57,152
Ran...

18
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:04,352
Why it's you, Mr. Mouri?

19
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,552
Oh, you're...

20
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:10,452
Mr. Yatsukawa of Nichiuri TV?

21
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:18,152
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the prominent great detective?

22
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:21,752
I'm sorry that we surprised you a while ago.

23
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:25,252
He is comic writer, Mr. Reiki Hirasaka.

24
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:29,652
Oh, are you the one who wrote "The Blackmagic Girl"?

25
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:33,252
Many girls in my class are reading it.

26
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:36,652
That's an honor, my lady.

27
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:39,952
What's this Blackmagic Girl about?

28
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,352
It's Mr. Hirasaka's representative work

29
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:45,152
and a masterpiece of all occult comics!

30
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:48,452
It's a story about the main character resurrecting into the world

31
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:50,552
as a witch to avenge her death.

32
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:55,352
She's Shoko Utakura, a gravure model in the making!

33
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:58,952
I'll be debuting soon, how do you do?

34
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:02,052
What're you all gathered here for today?

35
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:06,052
Right, I mean you being dressed up like that too, Mr. Yatsukawa.

36
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:07,652
Oh, this is...

37
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:11,052
We're planning to hold a seance tonight.

38
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:12,952
A seance?

39
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,852
You mean the thing you do when you want to summon

40
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:16,852
the spirit of the dead?

41
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:18,852
That's it.

42
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,952
The spirit of who that died?

43
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:24,852
Our idol, Kira Miyahara!

44
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:26,952
Kira Miyahara?

45
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:29,052
Oh, if I remember correctly.

46
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,752
The one who was supposed to be the lead actress

47
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:32,752
in the movie "The Blackmagic Girl".

48
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,152
Supposed to be?

49
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:37,452
She died a year ago of an accident.

50
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:40,552
The production of the movie was eventually cancelled.

51
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:42,352
If only that accident didn't happen,

52
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:45,352
she would've been a top idol by now!

53
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:48,552
Kira... why'd you die?

54
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:51,052
What's with him?

55
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:53,852
He's the chairman of Kira's fan club,

56
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:56,652
and figurine creator, Mr. Yutaka Kani.

57
00:04:56,652 --> 00:05:00,152
Are you Kira's fan too, Mr. Yatsukawa?

58
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:01,552
Of course!

59
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,952
My fan club membership number is 11!

60
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:07,052
All the others too?

61
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:10,652
My name is Kazuo Honogi, membership number 8.

62
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:13,152
While I'm at it, I'm a doctor.

63
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:18,052
I'm Maho Izumi, membership number 120.

64
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,352
My number is 53.

65
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:24,552
I'm cameraman Ryuichi Mifune, nice to meet you!

66
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,852
What's your membership number?

67
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:29,352
I'm not a member.

68
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:32,552
He's an exclusive cameraman for a cosplay shop!

69
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:34,352
Cosplay shop?

70
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:37,052
A store in Akihabara that sells costumes for cosplay,

71
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:40,052
accessories and such, as well as rent them out.

72
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:41,752
Inside the shop, there's a corner

73
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:44,052
where you can take pictures of yourself wearing different costumes,

74
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,152
and I'm the one who takes the pictures.

75
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:47,552
Kira was originally

76
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:50,352
an internet idol who was in charge of the cosplay section.

77
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:53,652
But, the pictures of her on the website of the shop

78
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,252
and cosplay sites became popular

79
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:58,152
so she ended up debuting as a gravure idol.

80
00:05:58,152 --> 00:06:01,252
She caught Mr. Hirasaka's eye

81
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:04,752
and was chosen as the leading actress for "The Blackmagic Girl".

82
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,952
The name of the main character in "The Blackmagic Girl"

83
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:08,452
was also Kira.

84
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,852
There wasn't anyone more appropriate than her for the part.

85
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,752
I can't help regretting what happened.

86
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,352
Kira.

87
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:18,552
Why did you end up scheduling a sence?

88
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:22,652
The fact is, a strange rumor has been going around

89
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:24,852
among the members of the fan club recently.

90
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:25,952
Rumor?

91
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,552
That the fans who have gone from being Kira's fan to somebody else

92
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:32,952
have been getting hurt or falling ill.

93
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:35,152
That's what they get for betraying Kira!

94
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:36,952
It's legit punishment for what they did!

95
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:37,952
On the internet,

96
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:40,652
there's a big fuss about it being a curse cast by Kira.

97
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,452
A curse?

98
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:47,352
Kira resurrected as a witch!

99
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:48,952
A witch?

100
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:53,752
The Kira in "The Blackmagic Girl" also died of an accident once

101
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:55,752
and then resurrected, after getting hold of the powers of a witch.

102
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:58,152
And she takes revenge on those

103
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,752
that made her death look to be an accident.

104
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:05,552
Kira also fell into the lake, car and all.

105
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:09,552
But, her body hasn't been found yet.

106
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:12,752
Besides, even a murder was committed.

107
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:14,352
Murder?

108
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:18,852
The editor in charge of my works was killed

109
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,452
about half a month ago.

110
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:23,852
What did that case have to do with Kira?

111
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:25,352
Mr. Sawanami who died

112
00:07:25,352 --> 00:07:29,752
wrote with his own blood "Kira" and left a dying message.

113
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:31,152
Really?

114
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:35,052
It's true! I saw it with my own eyes.

115
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,552
You saw it?

116
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:39,452
She's the one who first found the body.

117
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:41,052
Don't tell me that

118
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,852
Kira, like in the comics resurrected

119
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:45,752
and committed the murder?

120
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:47,952
We can't be sure about that but...

121
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:50,652
That's why we decided to hold a seance

122
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:54,852
to summon Kira's spirit here and ask her!

123
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:56,752
Ridiculous.

124
00:07:56,752 --> 00:08:00,452
Mr. Hirasaka has strong clairvoyant powers

125
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:03,752
and also has vast knowledge about the occult.

126
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:08,552
My, look at the time. Shall we start, then?

127
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:12,552
Let's go over to the meditation room.

128
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:29,152
"Meditation Room"

129
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:37,552
Why does it turn out this way?

130
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:47,152
Spirit in the dark, please answer me.

131
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:55,152
(Chanting)

132
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:11,552
Please let me hear your voice that is frozen in the dark!

133
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:19,552
(Chanting)

134
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:29,352
Kira Miyahara, answer my call!

135
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:36,152
(Chanting)

136
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:37,552
What the...

137
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:41,652
No!

138
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:51,852
Please answer my call!

139
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:01,152
What on earth is going on?

140
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:03,252
I'm suffering.

141
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,052
How vexing.

142
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:08,852
How vexing. I'm suffering.

143
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,352
It's Kira's voice!

144
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:13,652
I won't forgive...

145
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,552
The voice is coming from the panel!

146
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:18,952
I won't forgive...

147
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,852
The one who killed me is among you.

148
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:26,552
I will never ever... never forgive.

149
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:30,252
I shall resurrect tonight.

150
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:34,052
In order to avenge my death with my very hands!

151
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,452
No!

152
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:50,952
It's Kira's spirit! She's answered us!

153
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,952
No joke.

154
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:08,052
Dad, was that really the doings of a spirit just now?

155
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:10,452
It... it couldn't have been.

156
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:18,252
It smells like gunpowder.

157
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:19,452
What?

158
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:24,352
True.

159
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,552
I see, I got it!

160
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:32,052
Gunpowder was put inside the candles!

161
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:36,652
So that when the candles burned and became short, they would burst.

162
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:38,652
Are you serious?

163
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:41,852
There something that looks like a motor attached here.

164
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:43,352
What?

165
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:48,552
The parts for a radio controller or something have been used.

166
00:11:48,552 --> 00:11:52,152
The stand was shaking from the motor running.

167
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:54,352
Which means that what happened a while ago was a hoax?

168
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:56,852
I guess so.

169
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:59,952
But, what about the things falling?

170
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,852
It's this.

171
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,552
Let's see it.

172
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:07,052
I see.

173
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:11,652
This line was hooked onto the bottom of the cups and plates to begin with.

174
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:14,352
Then, when the remote controller is operated, the motor rotates,

175
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:16,552
winding the line making the cups and dishes fall.

176
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:21,052
I'm sure the same kind of things are done here and there in the room!

177
00:12:21,052 --> 00:12:23,352
You say operating a remote controller,

178
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:26,652
but we were all holding hands, you know?

179
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,452
Just how was it operated?

180
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:30,252
Pressing the button of the remote controller

181
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:32,352
can be done with the foot too.

182
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,452
Isn't that right, Mr. Hirasaka?

183
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:44,552
Mr. Honogi, he's figured it out.

184
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:47,952
Mr. Honogi is in this too?

185
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:51,052
We were just trying to entertain.

186
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,452
But, it's very much in bad taste.

187
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:55,152
Especially that voice a while ago.

188
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:56,752
That's...

189
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:59,652
How did you make that voice?

190
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,752
You used this, right?

191
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:06,052
If you attach this, everything serves as a speaker and emits sounds.

192
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:10,252
That's why it sounded like Kira on the panel was talking.

193
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:14,552
But, the contents of the voice were nothing like that.

194
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:18,152
The recorded contents were switched to something else!

195
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:21,352
Switched? By who?

196
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,652
I don't know.

197
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:27,752
By Kira! Because you're playing around with her spirit.

198
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:30,952
And, because the one who made it look like

199
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:32,952
she died of an accident is here!

200
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:35,952
Kira will resurrect tonight!

201
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:38,152
And, she will avenge her death!

202
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:41,052
Oh, it just makes me shiver!

203
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,952
Kira will resurrect.

204
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,152
There's something weird about the air in here.

205
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:53,152
We can use some ventilation.

206
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:11,824
Who on earth could've switched it?

207
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:13,648
Calm down.

208
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,448
I'm sure it's that chick!

209
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,648
I'll choke her and make her spit it out!

210
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,248
Wait.

211
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:22,548
Mr. Mouri is here. Not tonight.

212
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:24,548
Kogoro Mouri!

213
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:28,848
If he finds out about that, I'm finished!

214
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:33,048
I should've told the police back then, after all!

215
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,948
But, you...

216
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:37,348
It's amazing how you can say that.

217
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:40,148
Do you understand where you stand?

218
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:42,648
Well...

219
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:52,348
Gosh!

220
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:55,248
What a bothersome incident!

221
00:14:56,748 --> 00:15:01,948
I don't know much about Kira, so will you tell me about her?

222
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:08,048
She used to patronize the cosplay shop that Mr. Mifune worked for.

223
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:09,848
Huh? Yeah.

224
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:11,748
Girls who come to places like that

225
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:16,048
are good at expressing their cuteness and coquettishness

226
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,848
but Kira was able to express the dark side

227
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:22,548
and fate like things that the character possessed.

228
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:26,248
I especially thought that she was different

229
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:28,548
from the others girls who like to cosplay

230
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:30,548
when I saw her cosplay "The Blackmagic Girl".

231
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:32,648
Kira is a goddess.

232
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:36,148
I thought that she wasn't the type to end up just doing cosplay,

233
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:39,248
so I started selling her to websites here and there.

234
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:42,048
And, that's when she caught the eye of a show biz production,

235
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,648
which lead to her gravure debut!

236
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:47,748
What about the accident that led to her death?

237
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:50,248
Almost a year has gone by already.

238
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:53,148
There was a small party here

239
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:55,148
and Kira left before everybody

240
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:57,148
because she had other things to attend to

241
00:15:57,148 --> 00:16:00,148
and along the way, she lost control of her wheels

242
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:02,448
and fell into the lake.

243
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:04,848
Who was at the party?

244
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:09,448
If I remember correctly, Mr. Hirasaka, Mr. Honogi

245
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:13,248
and the editor Mr. Sawanami.

246
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:14,948
I think it was Mr. Swanami,

247
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:17,548
you mean the one who was killed a half a month ago?

248
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:18,648
Yes.

249
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:21,148
What kind of a case was it?

250
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:25,348
He was stabbed by someone at his condo.

251
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:29,548
And, Shoko who went to visit him found him dead.

252
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:32,848
Why did she go to the condo of that editor?

253
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:35,948
I told you that she was going to debut as a gravure model, didn't I?

254
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:38,748
She said it was to make arrangements for it.

255
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,248
But, those things are usually

256
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,248
done in the editor's division, don't you think?

257
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:44,548
In other words, were they going with each other?

258
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:45,848
Probably.

259
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:51,548
But, why did the victim write "Kira" as a dying message then?

260
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:52,848
I wonder.

261
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:57,648
Would you like me to call Shoko and ask her for the details?

262
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:00,048
Oh no, you don't have to do that.

263
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:03,148
Oh, Shoko? This is Yatsukawa.

264
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:08,248
Mr. Mouri says that he wants to ask you about Mr. Sawanami.

265
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:11,048
I've got a headache.

266
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:13,948
Could I talk to him some other time?

267
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:16,448
Yes. See you.

268
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:23,848
She doesn't seem to be feeling too well.

269
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:27,348
We should leave the case up to the police.

270
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:31,448
Is there no chance that Kira is alive?

271
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:34,548
Her body hasn't been found yet,

272
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:38,748
but the car that was pulled out of the lake was totally destroyed.

273
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,448
Come to think of it.

274
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:41,648
What is it?

275
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:45,048
I think it's just junk rumor going through the internet,

276
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,648
but the rumor is that Kira didn't die of the car accident,

277
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,648
but, rather, in an accident during the party.

278
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:53,248
It goes that Mr. Hirasaka is hiding the body.

279
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:56,148
Hiding it, where?

280
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:59,248
Under the floor of the meditation room.

281
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:01,448
No.

282
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:07,848
Do you know that Kani is the one who passed that rumor around?

283
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:10,048
What? Really?

284
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,648
He used to go around like a paparazzi chasing Kira everywhere,

285
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:17,848
and found that she was always a very careful driver.

286
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:21,648
So that she would never get herself into that kind of an accident.

287
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:27,148
Kira will resurrect soon.

288
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:44,448
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

289
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:48,148
Excuse me.

290
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:52,448
I'm sorry for intruding on you at this hour of the day.

291
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,148
What seems to be the matter?

292
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:56,348
Shoko is not in her room.

293
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,148
Shoko's not?

294
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:00,648
Since she said she wasn't feeling well,

295
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:03,548
I went to her room to check on her after that

296
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:04,948
but, she wasn't there.

297
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:07,548
And she hasn't been back since.

298
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:10,548
Her cell phone is also switched off.

299
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:14,448
From Shoko?

300
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:15,848
This is...

301
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:18,248
"I have returned to life, Kira"

302
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:24,148
I just got a strange mail.

303
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:25,648
"I have returned to life, Kira"

304
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,848
Ran, please wake Pops up!

305
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,248
Let's look for Shoko!

306
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:31,348
Okay!

307
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:39,048
Who is it?

308
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,948
Mr. Kani. What're you doing?

309
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:48,348
Kira resurrected!

310
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:52,948
I'm sure she's in here! It's locked and won't open!

311
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:55,648
Did you receive mail too, Mr. Kani?

312
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:59,248
Kira, open up!

313
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:05,148
The door is locked.

314
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:09,648
But that door was locked with a padlock from the outside

315
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:12,048
by Mr. Hirasaka after the seance, wasn't it?

316
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:15,048
But, it's locked from the inside now!

317
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,948
Who's in there? Please answer!

318
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:21,048
Kira!

319
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:22,848
What on earth is the matter?

320
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,648
I got a strange mail from Shoko.

321
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,748
You got one too, Mr. Mifune?

322
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:31,248
Shoko wasn't in her room, so I came here looking for her,

323
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:32,948
then I found this door locked.

324
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,848
What? You mean Shoko is inside, then?

325
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:38,648
Maho, can you call Shoko on your cell?

326
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:40,648
Okay.

327
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:46,748
It's calling.

328
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,448
I don't hear the ringtone, though.

329
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,748
Let's crack the glass over there and unlock the door!

330
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:54,848
No, but...

331
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:58,248
Maybe she's not feeling well and collapsed!

332
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:05,048
We've got no choice, let's do it!

333
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:11,048
It's locked with a padlock!

334
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:29,948
What on earth...

335
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:45,148
Shoko!

336
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,948
No joke!

337
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,548
Kira has resurrected?

338
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:59,248
The entrance door was locked from the inside with a padlock.

339
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:01,148
The only window is over there.

340
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:03,548
It's possible to go through a window that size

341
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:05,948
but how would you climb up there?

342
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:09,048
Rather, if I remember correctly, that window...

343
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:12,148
unless you keep on pushing the switch, it'll stop.

344
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:14,848
It cannot be closed from the outside.

345
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:17,148
A locked room murder.

346
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:22,448
How did the culprit who killed Shoko escape from this room?

347
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:30,948
She's resurrected! Kira's resurrected!

348
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:34,248
It's the birth of the The Blackmagic Girl!

349
00:23:57,448 --> 00:23:59,548
"Next Episode"

350
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:01,648
Where's the key to this room?

351
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,648
Only Mr. Hirasaka has it.

352
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:06,648
This is the poster.

353
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:10,148
Probably Kira's poster that was in the meditation room.

354
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,748
Don't tell me that it's Kira's ghost?

355
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:16,748
I guess it means that the blackmailer is among the people here.

356
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,248
The culprit is using Kira who died of an accident

357
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:22,048
to carry out serial killings.

358
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,348
Next Conan,

359
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:27,448
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (2nd Locked room)"

360
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,548
Next Conan's Hint:

361
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:47,648
"Poster"

362
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:49,248
An information corner for the newest movie to be released

363
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:50,448
will finally start after this!

364
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,348
It's exciting, you see!
