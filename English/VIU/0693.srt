1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:04,434
The employees of a company called New Image

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:07,234
are attacked one after the other and are seriously injured.

3
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:11,234
And the president of New Image receives a threatening call.

4
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:14,334
Furthermore, Mr. Mouri was appointed by the culprit

5
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:17,534
to make the delivery.

6
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:19,834
M is going south down Chuo Boulevard.

7
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:29,234
The cruiser that M is on board sailed under Minato Bridge just now.

8
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:32,134
The culprit's planning to get the money somewhere along the river.

9
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,534
Keep your eyes open.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,534
Roger.

11
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:38,534
The waves of the transceiver

12
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:40,234
works only in a range of at most, 100 meters.

13
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:42,634
The culprit should be somewhere in this range.

14
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:49,334
It's about time you start working for me.

15
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:52,434
That cruiser is headed for Oojima water gate

16
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:54,234
and will be going into Ooyoko River.

17
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:58,734
Then, put the briefcase on the roof of the cruiser.

18
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:01,134
Put it in the center so that it doesn't fall.

19
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:04,034
Then, go back to your seat and wait for the next contact.

20
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,334
That brat...

21
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:22,334
M has entered Heikyu River.

22
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:25,234
The briefcase is on the roof of the cruiser.

23
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,934
The briefcase is gone!

24
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:43,534
The criminal used an attache case with an electromagnet stashed inside.

25
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,034
They used this technique

26
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:47,134
so the case would stick to the frame of the bridge

27
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:50,734
and the could artfully get away with the 24,000,000 yen.

28
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,634
We thought it was suspicious

29
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,734
that the culprit designated pops as the courier,

30
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:57,734
so we investigated and the one man emerged.

31
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:02,834
Satoshi Nishizawa, he was New Image's mechanical engineer.

32
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,234
We found out through pop's investigation

33
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:06,934
that he had been guilty of stalking.

34
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:09,334
So, New Images had fired him.

35
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:15,334
Mr. Nishizawa. Are you in?

36
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:16,934
Mr. Nishizawa!

37
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,434
It seems he's not in.

38
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:22,534
Yes.

39
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:26,934
It's open.

40
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,034
Mr. Nishizawa, aren't you home?

41
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:35,834
Mr. Nishizawa!

42
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:41,634
Conan.

43
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,734
No, Conan.

44
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:55,034
You shouldn't go into other people's houses without permission.

45
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,234
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

46
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:06,234
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

47
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:08,234
The culprit dies so the case is closed?

48
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:10,334
Where is the ransom and where is the case headed to?

49
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:12,034
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:13,934
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:16,134
His name is Detective Conan!

52
00:04:56,362 --> 00:05:01,462
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 2)"

53
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:06,062
Mr. Nishizawa.

54
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:07,562
Wait, Ran.

55
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:10,262
Look.

56
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:13,762
Although the water is up to the brim of the bath tub,

57
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,062
there's no water splashed around anywhere.

58
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,362
It probably dried up.

59
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:23,262
This means that Mr. Nishzawa sunk in the water quite a while ago.

60
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:26,362
I think it's been more than 6 hours already.

61
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:27,862
Oh, no.

62
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:30,762
At any rate Ran, contact the police.

63
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:31,762
Okay.

64
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:41,762
An empty pill bottle Sleeping pills.

65
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:44,462
A flower petal?

66
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,162
I wonder what flower the petal is from?

67
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:50,262
It s shape is like that of a cherry blossom, but the color...

68
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:53,262
Hey, Ran. What're you doing over here?

69
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,562
Officer Sato!

70
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,462
Mr. Nishizawa in the bath tub is...

71
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:58,062
What?

72
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:00,262
-Mr. Nishizawa. -He's dead already.

73
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,562
Conan?

74
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,762
Officer Takagi, contact HQ!

75
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,462
Yes, ma'am!

76
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,062
Officer Sato.

77
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,562
What brings you here?

78
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:12,062
A stolen motorboat was found on Heikyu River,

79
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:15,962
and Satoshi Nishizawa's fingerprints were found there.

80
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,162
So, now that you know,

81
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,362
leave the rest to us and out you go, out.

82
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:22,362
Okay.

83
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,962
Then, let's go out so that,

84
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:29,062
we don't get in their way, Conan.

85
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:30,062
Hey.

86
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:43,962
Conan, no!

87
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:46,162
This is?

88
00:06:50,062 --> 00:06:52,162
"Mouri Detective Agency"

89
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,362
Nishizawa committed suicide.

90
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:57,162
The boat that he seems to have used to commit the crime was found

91
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:59,862
and his fingerprints were detected on it.

92
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:03,762
Besides, here's the will that was found inside his computer.

93
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:09,462
The estimated time of his death is around 01:00 am.

94
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,462
He drowned after over dosing himself with sleeping pills.

95
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:16,062
There's probably no mistake that it's suicide.

96
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:20,562
I didn't commit this crime because I wanted money.

97
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:25,762
Kogoro Mouri, you had the nerve to hand me over to the police

98
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,762
saying that pure feeling of love was nothing but stalking.

99
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:31,762
Moreover, President Ishida fired me.

100
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:34,062
I'll put you to shame, world renown detective

101
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,762
and President Ishida, who couldn't save an employee of yours.

102
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:40,862
My purpose this time is to punish both you and the president socially.

103
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:44,362
I no longer intend to live on in shame.

104
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:47,162
I don't have any reason to go on living anymore.

105
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:50,962
Well, although we can't conclude anything

106
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:52,862
before we do a thorough check yet, but...

107
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,862
for now, we'll have to report on the progress we're making.

108
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:56,862
Inspector.

109
00:07:57,862 --> 00:08:00,862
Was the money that was stolen found?

110
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:02,562
No, not yet.

111
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:03,862
I see.

112
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:05,262
See you then, Mouri.

113
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:13,662
It hasn't finished yet.

114
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:15,162
The money hasn't come out yet,

115
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,762
so how can the case be closed!

116
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:22,162
The case is just starting to be solved!

117
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:28,562
I don't anything about Mr. Nishizawa.

118
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:31,262
I heard that you both got along well.

119
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,862
Tell me what you know.

120
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:39,762
"Kaoru Tanaka" -Even if it may not be something too convenient for you?

121
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:42,162
Yeah, go ahead.

122
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:43,462
Let's hear it.

123
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:46,462
Mr. Nishizawa hated you.

124
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:48,462
Yeah. It seems so...

125
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,762
And, did you hear about his plans as to this case?

126
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:52,762
No, nothing.

127
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:54,662
I see.

128
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:56,662
By the way...

129
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,262
What about your alibi at about 01:00 am?

130
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:01,162
Mine?

131
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:03,562
Why do I need an alibi?

132
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:04,862
He committed suicide, didn't he?

133
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:06,662
We don't know for sure yet.

134
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:10,562
Well, if we check on President Ishida's acquaintances,

135
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:13,262
we'll eventually come up with an answer, though.

136
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:18,962
Then, stop suspecting me and suspect the president.

137
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:22,562
Mr. Nishizawa was blackmailing President Ishida.

138
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:30,162
Are you blackmailing me?

139
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:33,462
Are presidents supposed to protect their employees?

140
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:35,162
You lowered the image of the company

141
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:36,562
and yet the nerve of you.

142
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:39,062
If you fired me, pay me compensation.

143
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,762
Don't be ridiculous.

144
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:44,062
I'll disclose your accounting fraud!

145
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:47,162
I could care less if this company goes bankrupt!

146
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:51,162
Cool it, let's talk it over.

147
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:57,362
I think the president has a motive to kill Mr. Nishizawa.

148
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:59,762
I'm asking for your alibi.

149
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:01,362
If at around 01:00 am,

150
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:03,562
I was at home, on the phone with my girlfriend.

151
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,962
Your cell phone won't serve as an alibi.

152
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:07,462
It was my house phone.

153
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:11,962
If you suspect me why don't you check on my call history or whatever.

154
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:14,362
You don't need to check it.

155
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:15,962
It's suicide, isn't it?

156
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:19,662
Don't you want to get back your 24,000,000 yen?

157
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,662
"Gen Ishida (42)" -I don't want such petty money.

158
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,962
I can get that much profit by selling a car anytime.

159
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:27,562
Good work, just forget it, already.

160
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,262
No matter if Nishizawa designated you,

161
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:33,062
I can see it wasn't an easy job.

162
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:34,762
So, keep it.

163
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:37,162
What's your alibi at 01:00 am?

164
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:39,262
Me? I was sleeping.

165
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:43,462
I'm single so I've got nobody to verify it though.

166
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:45,762
Sorry to have intruded on you.

167
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,862
Aren't you taking it?

168
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:51,562
Why don't you use it for Nishizawa's funeral?

169
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:54,762
Why don't you suspect Tanaka who was Nishizawa's subordinate?

170
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:58,262
He was hanging around with Nishizawa

171
00:10:58,262 --> 00:10:59,362
and loved to gamble.

172
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:02,162
He has quite a large sum of debts.

173
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,662
He came to me once, but it wasn't an amount

174
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:06,462
that he could return even if I were to give him advance payment,

175
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,862
so I turned him down.

176
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:14,962
A surveillance camera.

177
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:19,662
That was close.

178
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:20,762
Come to think of it,

179
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,062
there was no surveillance camera on that road!

180
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,662
There's no surveillance camera here either.

181
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,662
It's not cool to go straight.

182
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,362
It's Toyosu Canal.

183
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:45,762
Taking the route that I just came,

184
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:46,862
since there are no surveillance cameras images

185
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:48,762
to serve as evidence won't remain.

186
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:58,262
If he left the boat here

187
00:11:58,262 --> 00:12:01,162
and went out to Ooyoko River

188
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:03,462
and retrieved the briefcase.

189
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:07,862
Gramps!

190
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,162
If you take this side route,

191
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:18,062
it leads to the direction of Sendai Bori River.

192
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,762
Lower your head.

193
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:24,762
It's narrow, but a motorboat could probably make it in here, right?

194
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:25,762
Yeah.

195
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:42,262
Cherry blossoms in full bloom are beautiful, aren't they?

196
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,262
Yes.

197
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:54,962
Stop over there.

198
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:55,962
What?

199
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:03,262
It's Mr. Nishizawa's apartment after all.

200
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:08,262
But, no yellow flower looks to be in sight.

201
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:10,262
Did you find something?

202
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:11,562
No.

203
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:13,262
Hey, do you know any yellow flowers

204
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:16,062
that have petals that look like cherry blossoms?

205
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,562
Yeah, there's something called the Ukon Sakura.

206
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,362
Ukon Sakura?

207
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:23,362
You can find them only in Tsukuda in this area.

208
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:26,362
They normally bloom later than the Somei Yoshino.

209
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,762
This year however, they're already in bloom.

210
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,962
I'd like to see that!

211
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:33,662
What? You've figured out the real culprit!

212
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:36,162
I have someone in mind, Inspector Megure.

213
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:39,362
You mean Nishizawa didn't do it and he didn't commit suicide?

214
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:40,962
That's right.

215
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:43,062
Who's the real culprit?

216
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:45,762
I'll leave you in suspense.

217
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:48,862
Please tell the President of New Image Mr. Ishida,

218
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,562
and engineer Mr. Tanaka

219
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,762
to come to the president's room of New Image at 05:00 pm today.

220
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,262
Okay, but...

221
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:57,462
I hope you know what you're doing, Mouri.

222
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,562
Please trust, Kogoro Mouri here.

223
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,162
Dad.

224
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,562
I told you not to carry yourself too far.

225
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:11,962
Stay in bed like you should be.

226
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,162
I understand! I'll head there immediately!

227
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:17,662
Inspector. There seems to be a large amount of 10,000 yen bills

228
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:20,162
floating in the Tsukuda area of Sumida River.

229
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:30,162
It's yesterday's money, isn't it?

230
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,262
An empty briefcase seems to have been found,

231
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:35,562
so I guess the contents flowed out.

232
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,762
Strange.

233
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:41,062
The place where the empty briefcase was found is here.

234
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,462
And this is where I am now.

235
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:47,162
Why isn't there any money flowing in the rivers along the way?

236
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,906
Not with this fever, dad.

237
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:04,706
I've got to put on the world renown detective,

238
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,506
Kogoro Mouri's deduction show from 05:00 pm.

239
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,906
I can't be stuck in bed because of a cold.

240
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,506
Geez.

241
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:11,706
What's the matter?

242
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:13,906
Stop him, Conan.

243
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:17,106
Dad insists on doing his deduction show and won't listen to me.

244
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,706
Have you figured out the culprit?

245
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:21,306
I'll leave you in suspense till 05:00 pm.

246
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:22,306
Come to think of it,

247
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:25,806
some of the money that was taken was found in Sumida River.

248
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,406
What?

249
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,606
It seems that the money was disposed of.

250
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:32,306
This man.

251
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:34,806
Oh, no.

252
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:38,306
If the money is found, my deduction won't do.

253
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,606
I think my fever's suddenly risen.

254
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:44,206
That's why I've been telling you not to go.

255
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:47,706
Would you like me to go in place of you?

256
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:49,406
You have a video camera, don't you?

257
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,406
Yes.

258
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:53,006
All we have to do, is film your deduction

259
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,906
and show it to everybody.

260
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,506
Since Pops Kogoro can't make it because of a cold,

261
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:02,606
I was told to show you this recorded video film.

262
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:05,006
Never mind the formalities and just get on with it.

263
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,506
I'm busy.

264
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:07,606
Okay!

265
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:13,206
People refer to me as the renown detective.

266
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,106
Yes, I am...

267
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:20,406
Kogoro Mouri.

268
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:23,606
There are two keys to solving the case this time.

269
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,806
First, a grudge against New Image.

270
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:31,006
And, second, someone who has a grudge against me, Kogoro Mouri.

271
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:34,406
"Rather, the culprit utalized these two key issues"

272
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,606
There are three suspects.

273
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:41,406
Mr. Satoshi Nishizawa, who died after leaving a will behind.

274
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:44,006
His subordinate, Atsushi Tanaka,

275
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:48,206
and the president of New Image, Mr. Gen Nishida.

276
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:49,806
Mr. Satoshi Nishizawa had a grudge

277
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:54,306
against the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri and President Ishida.

278
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:58,706
Moreover, he was blackmailing President Ishida.

279
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:00,206
Don't be ridiculous.

280
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:02,006
I was being blackmail by Nishizawa you say?

281
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:03,406
Show me the evidence!

282
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:04,706
As for you, President Ishida,

283
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:08,006
you have no alibi at the time the money taken at Ooyoko River

284
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:12,606
and moreover, during the estimate time of death of Mr. Nishizawa.

285
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:16,306
If Mr. Nishizawa were to have been killed, that is...

286
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:20,406
That doesn't make me the culprit, does it?

287
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,006
But in the case of Mr. Tanaka,

288
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,106
there is nothing that leads to him having a grudge

289
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:27,506
against New Image or to kill Mr. Nishizawa.

290
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:32,506
Besides, he has an alibi during the time Mr. Nishizawa was found dead.

291
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,506
I'm glad you found out.

292
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:39,806
Only, you like gambling and had a great sum of debt.

293
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:41,206
If taken from that point of view,

294
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:44,806
you have a motive to commit the crime,

295
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:47,006
but Mr. Tanaka is clear after all.

296
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:49,506
"That may not be certain!"

297
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:51,006
Why?

298
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,306
Taking into consideration that will that was left behind

299
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:57,206
in Mr. Nishizawa's room,

300
00:17:57,206 --> 00:18:00,106
setting the electromagnet onto the briefcase,

301
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:03,306
stealing the motorboat that was docked,

302
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:06,106
stealing the money at Ooyoko River,

303
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:08,806
then disposing the money and briefcase into the river,

304
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:11,906
return to his apartment and drink the sleeping pills,

305
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:14,206
and finally sink himself in the bath tub.

306
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,906
In other words, Mr. Nishizawa committed suicide...

307
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:22,206
"This would've happened, but, in fast, he was murdered!"

308
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:25,506
Just what is Detective Mouri trying to get at?

309
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,506
"The real culprit is you!"

310
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:32,606
From here, I will read Detective Mouri's deduction from here.

311
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:34,506
Will you be all right, Conan?

312
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:35,606
Yes.

313
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,506
According to Detective Mouri,

314
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:39,706
the real culprit is...

315
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,306
you, Mr. Tanaka!

316
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,306
What?

317
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:48,906
Just what're you talking about?

318
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:51,006
I've got an alibi, don't I?

319
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,406
But you seem to be great debt

320
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:56,406
of about 20,000,000 yen with a financial institution.

321
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:59,906
You committed this crime in order to repay that money.

322
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,406
More than the motive,

323
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,806
how are you going to explain my alibi?

324
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:06,506
I'll explain things in chronological order.

325
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:10,206
Mr. Tanaka who stole the money, didn't dispose of the money

326
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:13,806
but after disposing of only the empty briefcase and electromagnet,

327
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:18,206
used the waterway and went to Mr. Nishizawa's apartment.

328
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:21,506
Then after passing Mr. Nishzawa out

329
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:26,206
carried him onto the boat and went back to your own condo.

330
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,206
Your condo is in Tsukuda,

331
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:31,106
so you can move from place to place using the waterway.

332
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:35,906
You made Mr. Nishizawa drink an over dose of sleeping pills

333
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:40,106
to make it look like a suicide, and made preparations to kill him.

334
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:44,006
At the same time that you called your girlfriend from your house phone,

335
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:47,606
you poured hot water into the bath tub where Mr. Nishizawa was sleeping.

336
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:51,006
I was doubtful

337
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:56,806
because the time you were talking to your girlfriend on the phone

338
00:19:56,806 --> 00:19:59,706
matched the estimate time of death of Mr. Nishizawa.

339
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:03,606
So much so, that it seemed to be an alibi creating scheme.

340
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:07,406
And then, you made a great mistake.

341
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,406
You didn't notice that the petal of an Ukon Sakura

342
00:20:11,406 --> 00:20:14,906
that is in bloom near your condo got stuck on Mr. Nishizawa's clothes.

343
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:19,206
After making an alibi for yourself by phoning your girlfriend,

344
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:21,106
you used the waterway again

345
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:24,106
and returned to Mr. Nishizawa's apartment on your boat

346
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,706
and put the dead body into the bath tub.

347
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:30,206
In other words, you changed not the time of death,

348
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,506
but rather the place.

349
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:40,606
But, you didn't realize the petal of the Ukon Sakura at all.

350
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,006
You had a debt of 20,000,000 yen.

351
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:44,606
At first you were planning

352
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:47,206
to take the entire amount of 24,000,000 yen but...

353
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:48,606
To make it look as if this crime was committed

354
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:50,106
because of a grudge and not for money,

355
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,106
since you left a will behind in the computer,

356
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:54,606
you had no choice but to dispose of the 4,000,000 yen

357
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:59,006
after paying of your debt, so you threw it into the river

358
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:02,506
to substantiate Mr. Nishizawa's will.

359
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:05,006
Is that correct, Mr. Tanaka?

360
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:06,306
It's all just a bunch of baloney!

361
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,806
It's all just made up!

362
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:11,806
I saw you riding a motorbike at Ooyoko River.

363
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:17,106
That was close.

364
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:20,106
Before and after the money was taken...

365
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,306
I had a close call with the motorbike.

366
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:29,106
It was the same number plate as this.

367
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:31,106
It's your motorbike, isn't it?

368
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,706
It was parked in this parking lot.

369
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:37,906
You used the road without surveillance cameras to your advantage,

370
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:39,806
but I saw you.

371
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:52,706
Darn! How dare you feign looking like a good guy

372
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:54,506
and still murder somebody?

373
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,806
Mr. Ishida.

374
00:21:55,806 --> 00:22:00,606
I will report your accounting fraud to the second division.

375
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:03,106
I advise that you be ready for it.

376
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:05,906
I'm sure the tax office will get to you too.

377
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,306
That's quite a problem.

378
00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:10,606
Can't something be done about it, officer?

379
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:12,006
Of course not!

380
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,106
Well, just as expected of Mouri.

381
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:40,506
Will you tell him that he did a great job

382
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,906
despite being under the weather, Conan?

383
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,006
Okay!

384
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:50,106
I edited everything in this.

385
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,706
We're finally in Kyoto!

386
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,006
-How exciting! -Yes!

387
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:05,806
Hey, is it true that all the chocolate flavors disappeared?

388
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:07,806
The chocolate flavors disappeared?

389
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:09,706
What does disappeared mean?

390
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:12,006
How did such a thing happen?

391
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:14,006
Huh? Why?

392
00:24:14,006 --> 00:24:16,806
They say that the sweets that were here disappeared!

393
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:19,706
You know, I'm a great detective.

394
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,606
It's duck soup for me.

395
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,306
Next Conan,

396
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:28,106
"Famed Shop's Sweets Disappears".

397
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:46,006
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,106
"Japanese sweet box".
