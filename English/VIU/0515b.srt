1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,936
Did you see Thief Kid last night?

2
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:08,236
I saw him! I saw him! He was on TV!

3
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:11,836
Kid's teleportation was really awesome, wasn't it?

4
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:16,336
Yep! He's going to come and teleport again tonight, right?

5
00:00:16,336 --> 00:00:18,636
I'm really excited already.

6
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:22,936
Right. He disappears from the middle of an intersection

7
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:24,036
and the next minute he appears

8
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:26,636
like a bolt out of the blue on the roof of a building.

9
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:37,836
Maybe Thief Kid has psychic powers?

10
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:40,736
He doesn't have ESP.

11
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:44,636
He's just a thief that uses a bit of magic.

12
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:49,436
Oh, then have you figured out how he does his magic?

13
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:51,336
You were there at the intersection

14
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:53,636
where Thief Kid was too, weren't you, Conan?

15
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,736
Yeah. Well, I guess I was,

16
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:57,636
but I haven't figured out how he did it yet.

17
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:01,436
Could it be that there were two Thief Kids?

18
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,736
One of them was on the ground,

19
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:05,236
stole the treasured mule and vanished,

20
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:08,436
then the other one who was hiding on the roof appears later.

21
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,736
Amazing, Mitsuhiko!

22
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,436
Not possible.

23
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:16,336
The guard who was protecting the exhibition stand

24
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:19,336
happened to put his handprint on Kid's cape just before he disappeared

25
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:22,336
and that handprint was found on the cape of Kid who appeared on the roof.

26
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:25,536
The mule that he gave the TV reporter was unmistakably

27
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:30,236
the replica that Jirokichi Suzuki had made.

28
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:33,336
It could be that Kid has a twin brother.

29
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,436
That's possible.

30
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:36,736
If so, that's really something.

31
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:39,036
They're not listening to me.

32
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:42,736
Well, but it's for sure that he displayed a miracle.

33
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,436
He vanished in the middle of an intersection surrounded by a net

34
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:48,536
in front of a large crowd of people.

35
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:49,836
And in a matter of only 20 seconds

36
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:53,236
he moved to the roof of a nearby building.

37
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:57,136
Yeah. It's true that it seems humanly impossible.

38
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:58,836
But if look at it from a different view,

39
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:02,836
he needed almost 20 seconds to make his move.

40
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:07,336
I'll figure out the mystery of the 20 seconds no matter what,

41
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,236
and reveal how he carried out his teleportation trick.

42
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:16,136
You look to be enjoying yourself.

43
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,936
You look just like a child ready to open a gift box

44
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:21,436
that was given to him.

45
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:24,236
But, be careful.

46
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:27,936
After all, he's the Moonlight Magician, Thief Kid.

47
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,936
He's already displaying that

48
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:32,836
he's not fretting by appearing at night

49
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:35,836
wearing a conspicuous white outfit.

50
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:39,236
Yeah. I know.

51
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:55,736
Hey, I mean they're already blocking the place off

52
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:57,136
even before Thief Kid's appearance.

53
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:00,036
They're not letting the general public inside either.

54
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:01,036
Now that you mentioned it,

55
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:03,036
Uncle Jirokichi seems to have shut out the TV staff

56
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:06,036
who were doing a live broadcast too.

57
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:10,736
That only man really goes all out.

58
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:14,536
Well, Inspector Nakamori, I really appreciate your cooperation.

59
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:15,836
No problem at all.

60
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:18,236
With my staff and the police department teaming up,

61
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:21,236
it'll be a cinch.

62
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:24,336
You should've done this to begin with.

63
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:29,136
Come on, Thief Kid! Let me see you teleport yourself.

64
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:31,036
I shall surely tonight,

65
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,636
in clear view of everything and everyone capture you

66
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:37,536
and insert this glorious even into the last chapter of my autobiography.

67
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:39,636
I will cover the front pages of the papers

68
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,436
with articles of my brave and glorious deed.

69
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:50,636
That old man's still hung up on something like that.

70
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:53,036
I will return this to you,

71
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:55,636
so if possible I will come back here tomorrow night.

72
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,436
Darling Thief Kid.

73
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:00,136
Oh, is this yesterday's live broadcast?

74
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,236
Yes, I'm watching the video

75
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:04,236
of darling Thief Kid's white outfit

76
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,736
while waiting because I have nothing better to do.

77
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:10,036
I've been wondering from some time ago,

78
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:13,436
but I wonder why Thief Kid always dresses in white?

79
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:16,236
I mean, he always appears at night so I would think that black

80
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:19,336
would be way more inconspicuous and better for him.

81
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:22,036
Why else? It's because darling Thief Kid

82
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:24,536
is daring and fearless as well as graceful!

83
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:28,336
Never mind that, but is that thief really going to show up?

84
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,536
What a stupid thing to say.

85
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,236
There was never a time before

86
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:34,436
that Thief Kid didn't show up after giving out a warning.

87
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:46,036
What's that?

88
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,536
A parachute?

89
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:50,736
Good evening everyone, this is Thief Kid!

90
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:55,036
I hate to say this when you've all gathered here like this,

91
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:58,436
but I'd like to cancel tonight's magic show.

92
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:03,336
What... what did he say?

93
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,036
I would like to perform my magic show for all of you,

94
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,736
however, there are no spectators or TV cameras

95
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:11,836
to watch me closely.

96
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:14,536
Under this bland circumstance, I can't seem to raise my adrenalin level.

97
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:17,136
Therefore, goodbye everyone.

98
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,936
No way. Kid isn't coming?

99
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:25,136
What the heck? I left my office early for this!

100
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:27,336
Let us into the net!

101
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,136
Yeah, let us in!

102
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:40,136
Let us in...

103
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:43,036
Inspector, there's a person who says

104
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:45,236
he saw someone fire a queer looking gun.

105
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:46,236
What?

106
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:48,736
You mean Thief Kid is somewhere among this crowd?

107
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:52,736
Find him! He still around here somewhere!

108
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:56,236
Right, he scattered cards out last night too,

109
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:59,436
just before appearing on the roof.

110
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:02,536
They came falling 5 to 6 seconds before he appeared

111
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,936
so he should've fired a little before that.

112
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:07,436
Since no one saw him back then,

113
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:08,836
he would've had to leave the ground

114
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,436
approximately 10 seconds after vanishing.

115
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:16,436
But, 10 seconds is only just enough to weave through the crowd

116
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:20,036
and make it below the building he teleported himself to.

117
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:24,736
Moreover, he flew three cards in a row.

118
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,036
If he was inside a building or hiding,

119
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:29,436
he couldn't have done something like that.

120
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:32,536
Going to the roof without hiding

121
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:34,736
or being seen by anyone in a short amount of time.

122
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:36,736
Is it really possible?

123
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:43,336
Let us in...

124
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,236
Hey, Kid wants spectators to watch him!

125
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,536
Let's all break inside!

126
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:55,736
Hey, wait.

127
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,736
Inspector, are you okay?

128
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,136
For Christ's sake.

129
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:29,436
Kid...

130
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:31,836
Inspector, the TV crew

131
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:34,236
is firing at us like arrows demanding to be let it.

132
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,336
What?

133
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,536
Ignore them. Ignore them!

134
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:40,636
No, I think you've got no choice but to let them through.

135
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:46,536
Unless Kid comes, we can't even capture him, can we?

136
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,936
Viewers out there,

137
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:51,036
we just got the green light to resume our live broadcast!

138
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:54,336
We, the crew of Nichiuri TV

139
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:55,536
will like we did last night,

140
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:57,536
will go up to the roof where Thief Kid teleported to

141
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:58,936
and bring to you live all that happens.

142
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,336
So, let's wait for Thief Kid to appear.

143
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:04,736
Wow, they're resuming live broadcast.

144
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:07,836
Where's Conan?

145
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:13,136
He deliberately gathered the crowd into the net

146
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:16,436
and made them resume the live TV broadcast.

147
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:17,536
Does this mean that

148
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:21,336
he cannot carry out his trick unless this situation is set up?

149
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,636
Don't move.

150
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:28,436
Don't move, or you're dead.

151
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,936
Thief Kid.

152
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,102
Don't move.

153
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:53,102
Don't move, or you're dead.

154
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:56,502
Thief Kid.

155
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:02,002
Idiot, you're not scaring me with a toy like that.

156
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:06,902
Oh, boy. You're a wet blanket kid as always.

157
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:08,502
None of your business.

158
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:11,302
Hey, famed detective, do you know

159
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,302
about the 3 principles of Thurston?

160
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,402
Yeah.

161
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:17,902
The famed magician at the beginning of the 20th Century,

162
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:19,802
Howard Thurston.

163
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:23,802
The 3 principles defined in honor of his name,

164
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,502
the three taboos that should never be done

165
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:29,002
when performing magic, right?

166
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,402
Exactly.

167
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:34,402
Number 1, a magician should never reveal the trick behind his magic.

168
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:37,202
This isn't even worth mentioning though.

169
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,202
Number 2 is never explain what will be happening

170
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:43,502
before you perform your magic.

171
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:44,802
Because it will decrease the mystery

172
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:47,802
and kill the suspense of the magic.

173
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:50,302
Well, number 3

174
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:54,002
is never repeat the same magic twice.

175
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:56,202
Performing the magic once

176
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:59,802
will leave a strong impression and beautify the magic

177
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:04,302
as the greatest magic on earth into the hearts of the viewers.

178
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:08,102
But, performing it again, will urge the viewers to seek

179
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:11,502
what the trick behind the magic is than to enjoy what is happening.

180
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:15,102
The possibility of the trick being figured out will also increase.

181
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,302
I see.

182
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:18,202
In other words,

183
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,702
if you go ahead with the taboo,

184
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,602
and people still can't figure out how you did it,

185
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:24,702
you'll be the world's greatest magician?

186
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:26,702
Exactly.

187
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:30,002
Oh, there you are, Conan!

188
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:34,602
You should stay close by.

189
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,302
He's mingled among the crowd.

190
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:47,602
Now that there seems to be a great gallery and excitement is rising,

191
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:51,002
I would like to begin my show soon.

192
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:53,302
Please enjoy to your heart's content.

193
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:56,502
All right!

194
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:57,902
Thief Kid's come!

195
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:03,902
Kid...

196
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:05,502
The excitement is so great

197
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:08,202
that it looks as if he's already got hold of his target.

198
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:12,602
Well, if I, the famed Kogoro Mouri were to directly take charge,

199
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:15,402
I could take care of that thief hands down.

200
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:19,702
You know what they call people like you? Big fish in a small pond!

201
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:22,002
Big fish in a small pond?

202
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,902
In a small pond...

203
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:26,202
While we wait for Thief Kid to make his appearance,

204
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,102
let's take a look at last night's video tape recording

205
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:30,902
and examine Thief Kid's teleportation.

206
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:34,402
Thief Kid who arrived over the skies of Ginza on his hang glider

207
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,402
-and the next instant, was standing... -How exciting!

208
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,402
-on the exhibition stand -Yes.

209
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:40,702
vanished along with the smoke.

210
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:43,602
And, Thief Kid gets a hold

211
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,802
of the legendary mules, "Purple Nail".

212
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:48,902
However, Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki's strategy,

213
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:51,202
includes blocking off the four corners of the intersection with a net

214
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,502
and sealing the place off completely.

215
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:56,102
"Osaka" -Despite this impossible to escape situation,

216
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:59,002
Thief Kid had declared with composure

217
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:03,702
that he will escape with teleportation.

218
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,902
Yes, this is Hattori.

219
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:08,902
Oh, Mr. Otaki of the Osaka Prefectural Police Department.

220
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,002
What's up?

221
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:12,702
I'm watching TV and it's coming to the best part now.

222
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:16,402
There's a case you want me to handle?

223
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:19,302
Yeah.

224
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:22,102
Yeah.

225
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,502
Centipede?

226
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:29,502
Thief Kid, who vanished from the exhibit stand along with smoke

227
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,102
and only about 20 seconds later,

228
00:12:31,102 --> 00:12:32,802
-appears on the roof... -Let me take a good look at it.

229
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:35,802
of a department store 30 meters from ground.

230
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,502
A miracle indeed!

231
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,002
This is...

232
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:43,502
"Looking for favorite women!"

233
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:47,002
I wonder where Kid's going to teleport to today?

234
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,102
Beats me. I'm sure he's going to avoid teleporting

235
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,302
to the same building as yesterday, though.

236
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:54,102
Maybe he'll teleport to that helicopter!

237
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:55,902
I doubt it!

238
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:57,602
Wanna go see?

239
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,602
-What? -What?

240
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:03,202
I know where Thief Kid's going to teleport tonight.

241
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:04,602
What? Are you serious?

242
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:07,202
Where will he go, Conan?

243
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:09,902
Like Sonoko just said,

244
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:13,302
to one of the helicopters flying up there.

245
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:15,802
-Not. -Remember the time

246
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:18,702
Kid walked in mid air?

247
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:21,102
At that time he was suspended from a helicopter

248
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:25,102
that one of his friend's who was flying, right?

249
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:28,002
So, when he moved from one place to the next last night,

250
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:30,102
his friend pulled him up from above

251
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,502
and then put him down on the roof of the department store.

252
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:36,502
That's why it looked just like he teleported.

253
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:42,202
Come off it, stupid! No way!

254
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:44,002
Because of what happened last time,

255
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:46,202
Uncle Jirokichi was checking

256
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,102
the pilots of the helicopters with the utmost care.

257
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,102
Besides, unlike yesterday, the helicopters flying today

258
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:51,702
are police choppers.

259
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:55,702
Kid's accomplice wouldn't be able to get in that easily.

260
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,702
Besides, take a good look

261
00:13:57,702 --> 00:14:00,802
at the crowd of people around the mules.

262
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:02,702
There are more than 200 people in that intersection

263
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:04,602
that is blocked off with a net!

264
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:07,502
If Kid is lifted up into the air from there,

265
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:09,802
someone's bound to be watching!

266
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:13,802
Well, it's no more than the shallow cleverness of a child.

267
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:17,402
I hate to admit it, but I'm sure Sonoko's right.

268
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:21,902
I thought I hit upon quite a good idea and then.

269
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:26,702
I've got to think it over from scratch again I guess.

270
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:36,302
Kid...

271
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:39,402
-So, it's nightfall is approaching. -Kid...

272
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:41,302
Among the crowd who are calling out to Kid,

273
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:43,902
will Thief Kid, as he did last night

274
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:47,202
get hold of the legendary mule, Purple Nail

275
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,302
that is placed in the middle of the intersection

276
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,402
and show us as he did last night

277
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:54,702
that miraculous performance of teleportation?

278
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:05,402
It's Thief Kid! Thief Kid has appeared!

279
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:12,402
He's come. Darling Thief Kid has come after all!

280
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:16,402
How dare you. Thief Kid, I'm nabbing you for sure tonight...

281
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:18,502
Hold it, Inspector Nakamori.

282
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,502
Take a good look at the propeller on the rear.

283
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:23,302
That's a dummy after all.

284
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:26,902
I'm sure that just like last night he's going to explode the dummy

285
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:30,502
and during that time is going to head for the exhibition stand.

286
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:33,202
So, he's among the crowd somewhere

287
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:36,502
waiting for the right time to do so.

288
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,802
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

289
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:53,702
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

290
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:57,902
Now, just like last night,

291
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:01,102
please watch to your heart's content

292
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:03,802
as I teleport through time-space.

293
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:06,602
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

294
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,902
Hurry up and nab Kid!

295
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,702
If you want to nab me, suit yourself.

296
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:15,702
However, I warn you, don't ever let go.

297
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,102
Because if you're shaken off while teleporting,

298
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:24,802
you'll end up drifting through space-time.

299
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:33,302
Calm down! He's mingled among the crowd, that's all!

300
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:36,302
He's somewhere nearby, find him!

301
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,602
Hey, did Thief Kid teleport?

302
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:49,202
I can't see, we've got to go more in front.

303
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:52,102
Okay on this side. Start.

304
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:55,302
I wonder if darling Thief Kid is going to teleport over here today?

305
00:16:55,302 --> 00:16:58,402
I wonder where Conan went?

306
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:02,102
Okay, here goes the first shot.

307
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:10,102
-It's Kid's card. -Really?

308
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:12,802
"Three"?

309
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:15,602
"Two".

310
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,602
"One".

311
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,002
Zero.

312
00:17:22,902 --> 00:17:27,402
Too bad, you're performing tonight's magic show for free.

313
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:29,702
You get no reward,

314
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,702
Mr. Moonlight Magician.

315
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:43,332
Too bad, you're performing tonight's magic show for free.

316
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:45,632
You get no reward,

317
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,632
Mr. Moonlight Magician.

318
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,332
Get rid of the weight! Hurry!

319
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,632
What's this?

320
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:01,232
It looks like a bag filled with sand.

321
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:04,432
Where did it come from?

322
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:07,632
The trick involving teleportation is extremely simple.

323
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:11,532
The principle of the pulley used in old wells was applied.

324
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:15,532
Your accomplices disguised among the TV crew

325
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:18,532
are installing two pulleys on the fence of the roof.

326
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,732
Then a wire with hooks on both ends

327
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,832
is pulled through the pulley.

328
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:25,032
One side is lowered below the building,

329
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:27,632
and the other end is hooked onto the body of your accomplice.

330
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:30,732
All that's left to do is vanish from the exhibition table,

331
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:32,232
weave through the crowd,

332
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,432
reach the bottom of the building

333
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:36,932
and attach the hook onto yourself,

334
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:40,032
which after your accomplice jumps off the building.

335
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,132
If a weight is used on the body of your accomplice

336
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:45,932
and he is made to be heavier than you,

337
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:46,932
by the principle of the pulley

338
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:50,532
your body will be lifted up to the roof in no time.

339
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:54,932
Therefore, it will look as if you teleported and appeared.

340
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:58,232
Since the TV crew are busy with the live broadcast

341
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,432
no one would notice even if one person were to leave

342
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,332
and go over the fence.

343
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:06,332
The sound of the pulley would be erased by the cheer of the crowd too.

344
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:09,732
The point is not to let the crowd below

345
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,632
notice the two-people going up and down.

346
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:16,532
Your accomplice can pass through the large banner over there

347
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:20,032
but you have to distract the eyes of the crowd from the building.

348
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,932
So, you had to scatter the cards.

349
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:25,832
Therefore, you could not hide yourself behind the banner.

350
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,232
So, you thought up this text news.

351
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,632
You deceived the eyes of the crowd by taking advantage

352
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:36,132
of the text moving from below upwards, while you ascended.

353
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,332
I see.

354
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:40,232
Your deduction that I heard over the wiretap a while ago

355
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:43,432
was a fake one to catch me off guard.

356
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,332
You already knew about the text news trick.

357
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:50,232
Yeah, thanks to the "contents" of last night's news.

358
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,332
The news that streamed

359
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:54,332
by just before you appeared on the roof of the building was

360
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:57,432
"Looking for favorite women!" (Written in Japanese characters.)

361
00:19:57,432 --> 00:20:01,432
But, that phrase is quite ambiguous, isn't it?

362
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:04,432
That's when I saw through your trick.

363
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,232
The character that streamed by then was not "daisuki"(favorite)

364
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:07,732
but rather "inusuki" (dog loving).

365
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:09,732
That is, you were dressed in black and moved right along together

366
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:13,032
with the apostrophe of the character "inu" (dog).

367
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:17,032
Yes, a black outfit. I've finally figured it out.

368
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:20,132
The reason why you appear wearing an irrational white coloured outfit

369
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:22,932
that only makes you more conspicuous to people.

370
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:26,132
You're neither daring nor fearless.

371
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,332
It's because is easier to hide that way.

372
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:31,732
People have a tendency to unconsciously look for white things

373
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,532
if they suddenly vanish from before their eyes.

374
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:36,932
But, a quick change from white to black

375
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,632
will easily deceive the vision of others.

376
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:41,832
Yeah, and at the same time,

377
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:46,632
something white suddenly appearing from the dark...

378
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:51,032
is also mysterious, isn't it?

379
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:56,932
Hey, isn't that Thief Kid?

380
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:00,532
He's standing on the wall of a building!

381
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:03,432
The place Thief Kid teleported to tonight

382
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:06,932
is... What a surprise! On the digital bulletin board!

383
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,232
He's defying gravity and standing perpendicularly on the wall.

384
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,232
-No way. -No joke.

385
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,032
Darling Thief Kid, you're awesome.

386
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:17,432
Well, give yourself in.

387
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:21,432
If you go all the way up like this, you may be saved,

388
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:22,932
but your accomplice who is lowered to the ground

389
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:25,132
will be arrested by the police.

390
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:28,432
If the reverse happens, that's it for you.

391
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:29,832
Kid!

392
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:32,432
I'm not letting you get away!

393
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,332
I'll see you in the center then.

394
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:38,532
Center?

395
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:46,632
Give me your hand!

396
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:02,132
He made it through the net in the nick of time.

397
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:11,932
"Given that these aren't quite the jewels I was after,"

398
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:15,532
"I relinquish them to you. By Theif Kid"

399
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:19,532
That rat.

400
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:50,832
You really did a good job last night, Conan.

401
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:54,232
It's amazing how you got inside the building.

402
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,632
I'm a kid, so I get to skitter around here and there.

403
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:58,932
Well, I did put the security guard to sleep

404
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:01,032
with my tranquilizer gun, though.

405
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:05,032
It's in the morning papers.

406
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:07,632
"Great Victory for Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki!"

407
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:11,132
I'm sure that gramps can sleep well to his heart content from today.

408
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:15,432
Look at the big picture of his face too.

409
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:17,632
I wonder about that.

410
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:24,132
My face is on the side.

411
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:32,332
It's a centipede!

412
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:35,532
If that's true, this is a serial killing.

413
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,732
Moreover, there may be more victims.

414
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,732
This is...

415
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,432
Impossible crime.

416
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:54,232
Next Conan special,

417
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:57,732
"Fuurinkazan: Armored Warrior in a Labyrinth"

418
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:01,132
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,332
"Centipede"

420
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:04,832
I'm appearing in the next episode!

421
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:06,532
Heiji, me, too!

422
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:07,156
Oh, yeah.
