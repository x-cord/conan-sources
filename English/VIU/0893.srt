1
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,351
Isn't it wonderful, Conan?

2
00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:22,152
It really is!

3
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:26,952
Guess we're not the only ones here.

4
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:45,652
I thought there were other people here.

5
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:50,751
They're probably not in the bathroom

6
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,452
all together, are they?

7
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:06,251
This is kind of like...

8
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:09,551
what happened to that ship...

9
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:13,451
You mean the Mystery of the Mary Celeste?

10
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,551
Oh, yeah! That's the one!

11
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:17,751
The Mystery of the Mary Celeste?

12
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:18,752
Yeah.

13
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:23,451
It's a famous unsolved case from the 19th century.

14
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:28,152
If I remember right, a crew of ten people disappeared into thin air,

15
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:33,152
and then the boat was found adrift.

16
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:35,951
There was hot soup and silverware left out,

17
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:39,352
making you thinking they were still eating.

18
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:44,152
The situation is similar.

19
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:48,652
What was that?

20
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:52,851
Kuchiishi!

21
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:55,051
You're Kuchiishi the chef, right?

22
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:57,051
Yes.

23
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:59,952
Get it together! Can you tell me what happened?

24
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:03,052
Dad.

25
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:06,151
"Curse"

26
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:08,751
Ran, get an ambulance and call the police!

27
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,752
-Got it! -Look, Pops!

28
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,052
Footprints?

29
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:29,552
"Curse"

30
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,451
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

31
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,551
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

32
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,651
The word "Curse" and five sets of footprints.

33
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,851
What happened during this meal?

34
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:40,551
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:42,551
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:45,452
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:30,796
"The Mystery of the Michelin Starred Restaurant"

38
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:38,695
Thankfully, that head wound isn't very severe.

39
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:43,595
Can we ask you a few questions, Kuchiishi?

40
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:44,695
Sure.

41
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:49,295
Now, there were five guests at that table? You're certain?

42
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:50,895
Right.

43
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:53,795
They made their reservations a week ago.

44
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:56,995
It was a group from a company called Onda Trading.

45
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,695
I see.

46
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,495
Inspector!

47
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:03,495
It's about the identities of the missing group.

48
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:06,295
Sitting where the glasses are...

49
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:09,495
That was Kozo Kano, 40 years old.

50
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:11,495
We confirmed his ID from his driver's license,

51
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:13,495
which was left behind.

52
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:15,095
We confirmed the guy next to him

53
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,995
from the employee ID in his jacket, which was still on the chair.

54
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:22,096
Kazuki Iketani, 28 years old.

55
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,295
Next to him was a floral handkerchief

56
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:26,895
and a bag containing an employee ID

57
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:30,395
for Mitsuyo Ekuni, 38 years old.

58
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,395
The seat with the ash tray next to her

59
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:35,795
belonged to Tokuro Sahara, 35 years old.

60
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:39,695
We gathered that from the cigarettes and employee ID in his coat pocket.

61
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:43,995
The last one we put together from the smart phone that was left behind.

62
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:47,595
Kaori Manaka, 25 years old.

63
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:50,495
They all work at Onda Trading.

64
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,996
The company homepage confirms as much.

65
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:58,395
Kuchiishi, can you confirm they're who you saw?

66
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:00,495
Onda Trading.

67
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:01,496
Where have I heard that?

68
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:04,395
"Director and President, Teruaki Onda" -Yes, that's definitely them.

69
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:06,895
We haven't been able to contact President Onda,

70
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:10,495
so we had local police check on his home to be safe.

71
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,595
Hey, Officer Takagi.

72
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:16,995
When we came in, there were pictures on the phone.

73
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:18,895
Those are the same people, right?

74
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,495
Yeah, that's right.

75
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,195
I don't know how close they were,

76
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:26,095
but apparently the five of them would go out a lot together,

77
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,895
because there were pictures of them partying in various locations.

78
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:32,396
I bet they planned on taking one here, too...

79
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:36,595
So, all five of them came here?

80
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,095
Right.

81
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:41,295
They came in about an hour ago, in a car.

82
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:44,395
That'd be 20 minutes before we showed up.

83
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:47,996
Wait, back then...

84
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:54,695
What happened next?

85
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:57,195
They made a toast,

86
00:06:57,196 --> 00:07:00,995
and I went into the kitchen to continue cooking.

87
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:03,695
I served the appetizers and soups.

88
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:05,795
And then after about 15 minutes,

89
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,196
I was struck from out of nowhere.

90
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,695
You didn't see who hit you, then?

91
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:14,696
Right.

92
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:19,295
It certainly sounds like someone from that group

93
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:21,496
was the one to strike you.

94
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:26,195
"Ei" -Isn't this...

95
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,596
a mis-written receipt?

96
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:36,295
Hey, Kuchiishi.

97
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:39,396
This is that cake called tiramisu, right?

98
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,195
That's right.

99
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,695
Everyone else was eating dinner.

100
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:47,196
How come one had cake?

101
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:50,195
You get people like that sometimes,

102
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:52,696
who want to start with dessert.

103
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:59,095
I bet the lady who sat here sure loved sweets.

104
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:00,995
That might be the case.

105
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:03,296
That should be obvious!

106
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:06,095
Quit messing with the crime scene.

107
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,595
Sorry!

108
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:09,796
-In that case, get out of the... -One more thing!

109
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:14,596
Did someone break their glass when they did the toast?

110
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,695
I... don't think so.

111
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,195
I would've noticed if they did,

112
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,995
not to mention having to clean up.

113
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:23,095
That's what I thought.

114
00:08:23,096 --> 00:08:26,295
The trash can in the kitchen was empty, too.

115
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:29,596
One other thing, the car outside...

116
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,196
That's enough out of you!

117
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:38,695
You can't just run around on your own.

118
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,395
Sorry.

119
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,195
Let's wait out here together.

120
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:43,496
Okay.

121
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,495
Isn't that...

122
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:54,995
What did you say?

123
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:56,495
Understood!

124
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:57,696
Inspector!

125
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,396
It's about Onda Trading.

126
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:02,395
Three years ago,

127
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:06,395
the company was under suspicion for smuggling industrial metals,

128
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,095
and there was an investigation.

129
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:10,495
But one of the other managers

130
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:14,095
left a note claiming they were responsible for all of it,

131
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,595
and committed suicide.

132
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,895
Oh, a difficult case.

133
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:21,895
Then the five employees from this incident might've been involved?

134
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:25,395
Also, the manager who killed himself

135
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:28,395
was named Keigo Kuchiishi.

136
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:31,695
-What? -That's the same family name as the chef!

137
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,895
Inspector Megure!

138
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:36,095
Look what's on Kuchiishi's blog!

139
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:39,095
"Curse" -What happened to my customers?

140
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:41,095
What?

141
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:45,396
Sir, you really shouldn't do this sort of thing...

142
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:48,395
Kuchiishi is gone!

143
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,496
Where'd he go?

144
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:52,296
Is that...

145
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:53,896
"Curse"

146
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,396
Kuchiishi!

147
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:01,195
Don't tell me...

148
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:04,695
Did he walk into the lake, like the five customers?

149
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,495
That's impossible!

150
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:09,495
Takagi, Chiba! I want this lake checked out now!

151
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:12,495
-We can't afford to wait until dawn! -Yes, sir!

152
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,796
"Curse"

153
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,696
I figured as much.

154
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:24,542
Is it really okay

155
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:27,642
that I'm the only one not searching the lake?

156
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:28,842
It's okay!

157
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:31,742
Inspector Megure told me that Officer Chiba

158
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:35,942
was going to check out the lake with the local police.

159
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:37,342
Still...

160
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:41,143
Did Mouri really tell us to look around here?

161
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:43,442
"Curse" -See?

162
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,342
Look closely.

163
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,242
Don't do that, Conan!

164
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,543
You can't just grab evidence!

165
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:53,242
See?

166
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:55,242
That's a map!

167
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:56,442
Yes!

168
00:10:56,443 --> 00:11:00,742
If the lake is over here, then this is the restaurant.

169
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,242
"Warehouse" -And our goal is here!

170
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:04,743
We're almost there.

171
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:11,242
"Ei"

172
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:12,542
Isn't this...

173
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:15,942
Yep. Just like that chef, Eigo.

174
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:18,342
Maybe it's like his signature.

175
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:21,843
So this is a warehouse that Kuchiishi owns.

176
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:25,342
Did you hear that?

177
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:27,042
Open it up, Officer Takagi!

178
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:28,043
Got it!

179
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:38,043
These people...

180
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:41,643
The five missing guests.

181
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:44,842
They're not wearing their shoes.

182
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:48,342
Then does that mean those footprints were...

183
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:52,042
Yep. Kuchiishi put them down.

184
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:55,242
This was all his doing.

185
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:59,042
Pops said that even that wound on his head

186
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:01,443
was part of the plan.

187
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:03,842
What?

188
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:05,642
But why?

189
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,342
And where has he gone?

190
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:11,843
He said that these people should know.

191
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:20,643
"Safe deposit box"

192
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,643
"Teruaki Onda (45), President of Onda Trading"

193
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,442
It's been a while, Mr. President!

194
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,442
Since my dad's funeral.

195
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:41,342
You...

196
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,742
Then you really are Kuchiishi's son!

197
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,642
My father was weak.

198
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,842
He let you people push him around.

199
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:52,942
No, manipulate him into committing suicide, and taking the fall!

200
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:56,243
But that's not gonna work with me!

201
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,443
That's enough!

202
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,742
Great timing! Get him off of me!

203
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:05,542
You're Teruaki Onda, president of Onda Trading, correct?

204
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:08,042
I'm Megure, with the Metro PD's Division 1.

205
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:10,243
Police?

206
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:13,842
I've been waiting for you, Mouri.

207
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:15,842
If you're here now,

208
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:17,742
that means you've solved the mystery, right?

209
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:21,542
Huh? Well... what was it again?

210
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:22,742
Come on, now!

211
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:23,942
We're only here because you told us

212
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,242
where to rescue the missing five people,

213
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,742
and question them about this location.

214
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:30,042
Rescue?

215
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,242
Yes.

216
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,642
We rescued them from where they were being held,

217
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:35,042
took them into custody,

218
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:38,742
and are currently questioning them about the situation.

219
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:41,642
So, Mouri, what's this mystery?

220
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:46,643
Well, to be honest, I have no idea.

221
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:49,043
Huh?

222
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:55,842
Is this...

223
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:57,443
Finally!

224
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,042
The Sleeping Kogoro!

225
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,642
Pardon me.

226
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:06,242
Now, to dissect this puzzle.

227
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:10,842
It had a few similarities with a famous unsolved case,

228
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:14,442
but as to the clues for unraveling it...

229
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,142
Conan!

230
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:17,542
Here!

231
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:18,742
Well, you see,

232
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:22,742
the first thing I thought was weird was the tiramisu.

233
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:24,342
The tiramisu?

234
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:25,343
Yeah.

235
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:28,342
It was the dessert at the seat with the lady

236
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:31,342
who had the flowery handkerchief!

237
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:34,642
It was dinner time when everybody went missing,

238
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:37,342
but one person had tiramisu instead.

239
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,642
And the chef said it was because

240
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:43,543
some people like having dessert first, but...

241
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:47,043
I realized it was a mistake!

242
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:49,642
What mistake?

243
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:50,942
The answer

244
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:54,542
has to do with the pictures that were found on the cell phone.

245
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:56,742
In the pictures of past parties,

246
00:14:56,743 --> 00:15:00,142
there was always one person having dessert.

247
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:05,142
But it wasn't Ekuni, rather Iketani, a man.

248
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:06,442
What?

249
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:08,042
Not only that,

250
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:10,242
but when you always have the same group,

251
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,642
you might have a seating pattern that tends to pop up.

252
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:17,842
And this time, the pictures indicated that was the case.

253
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:21,042
But for whatever reason, that wasn't what happened tonight.

254
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:23,042
The usual seating pattern

255
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:26,343
had different people's things in place.

256
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,742
I'm not sure I follow.

257
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:32,242
What was the point of it all?

258
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:37,342
It was all to make Kogoro Mouri notice something.

259
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:39,042
The truth behind this case!

260
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:41,143
What?

261
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:44,842
When you combined the two of them,

262
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:48,442
it shows a route to the warehouse

263
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:51,042
where the kidnapped people were being held.

264
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:56,242
These "Curse" notes were another part of the puzzle.

265
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:58,342
At first I thought

266
00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:01,542
the five of them were captured at the restaurant,

267
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:06,442
then moved to the warehouse, where they were locked up.

268
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,742
Is that not the case?

269
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:10,842
No. If that were the case,

270
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:13,242
the five of them would've been sitting in the same positions as usual,

271
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:16,542
leaving their own belongings in those seats.

272
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,142
And there was one other thing,

273
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,342
a jacket stained with wine,

274
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:25,342
with a broken piece of glass that had no explanation at the time.

275
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,842
There was no sign of a broken glass or a bottle

276
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,842
in the restaurant's garbage, either.

277
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,742
Which would mean...

278
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,942
Inspector Megure, think back.

279
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:42,642
They began eating 20 minutes before we arrived at the restaurant.

280
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:46,342
But the hood of the car that was parked outside

281
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:51,742
was still giving off heat, like it had only recently been parked.

282
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,842
And that warehouse had a table, with chairs,

283
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:59,442
along with a broken wine glass and bottle.

284
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:02,242
I see! Then you're saying...

285
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:05,842
They were originally lured out to that warehouse,

286
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:07,843
where they were kept locked up.

287
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:10,642
President Onda,

288
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:15,642
you've all been partying in a variety of locations, haven't you?

289
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,942
The pictures in the phone

290
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:20,542
included restaurants, the roofs of skyscrapers,

291
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:22,942
the summits of mountains, beaches,

292
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,542
and even deserted islands.

293
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,442
Using your name as bait

294
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:30,642
would've been enough to lure them to a warehouse with little trouble,

295
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,942
and get them to start toasting among themselves.

296
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:35,942
Warehouse? What are you talking about?

297
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:39,142
Okay, thanks, Officer Takagi.

298
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:42,042
It's just like Pops deducted.

299
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,842
The wine from the warehouse

300
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:47,842
and the wine on the jacket in the restaurant are the same,

301
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:50,542
and it had sleep medication in it.

302
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:52,842
There was also an email from that president

303
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:55,242
asking them all to show up.

304
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:59,342
I don't recall ever sending that email!

305
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:02,643
That's because it was Kuchiishi who sent it.

306
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:07,942
Once they were unconscious,

307
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:13,142
he took their shoes, along with jackets and other belongings,

308
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:17,442
and returned to the restaurant in the car they arrived with.

309
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:20,142
He then placed their things at the table,

310
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:23,543
as if they had been there all along, and served up the food.

311
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:26,442
After that, he made the footprints

312
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:28,642
leading to the lake through the back door

313
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:31,542
to make it look like they had drowned themselves,

314
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,342
placed the "Curse" note,

315
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:39,542
and then hurt himself while waiting for us to arrive.

316
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:42,942
By the way, those notes

317
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:46,542
were actually a message to President Onda

318
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:50,243
using your father's name, weren't they?

319
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,642
Using his father's name?

320
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:57,842
His father's name is Keigo Kuchiishi.

321
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,742
If you take the "Kuchi" from Kuchiishi

322
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:01,542
and the "Ani" from Keigo.

323
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,942
It makes "Curse."

324
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:09,242
Might it have been a signature your father used in the past?

325
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:12,142
Because you use one that's similar.

326
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:14,243
"Ei"

327
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:19,742
In other words, the son of Keigo Kuchiishi, Eigo,

328
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,642
planned to avenge his father

329
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:26,042
by killing off a group of employees.

330
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:28,042
Or, intended to make it look like that.

331
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,043
But the truth was,

332
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:32,542
he was luring President Onda into a trap by making him cautious.

333
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:35,342
That was his true goal!

334
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:37,542
What?

335
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,842
The people who were kidnapped knew where we would go

336
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,542
because they recognized the man who had confined them.

337
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:48,042
And after thinking about what their president would do next,

338
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:51,143
they told me where to find you both.

339
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:56,942
Those are the secret books for your company.

340
00:19:56,943 --> 00:20:02,543
They prove that Eigo's late father was innocent, don't they?

341
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:10,342
It was two weeks ago.

342
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:15,142
I learned completely by accident that my father had been framed.

343
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:18,142
Man, if those books ever see the light of day,

344
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:19,842
this company is done for.

345
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,542
Shh! You're too loud.

346
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:27,042
And for the record, I am not going down with this ship!

347
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:30,442
Yeah. I'm don't want to end up like him, either.

348
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:33,443
Not like poor old Kuchiishi.

349
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,542
They likely had no idea they were in the restaurant

350
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:43,442
of the son of Keigo Kuchiishi, the man they had framed.

351
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,842
I wanted revenge!

352
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,743
Against all of them!

353
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:53,642
But then, Mouri made his reservation.

354
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,042
It felt like a sign telling me to wait.

355
00:20:56,043 --> 00:20:58,442
So, I reconsidered

356
00:20:58,443 --> 00:21:01,742
and realized my father can't rest until I expose their crimes,

357
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:04,242
that I can't redeem him without doing that.

358
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:07,742
And that if I was the ace detective that my reputation suggests,

359
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:11,342
I'd be able to figure out the case from the clues he left,

360
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:13,642
find this location,

361
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:17,343
and expose their crime.

362
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:22,543
You're amazing.

363
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:25,843
Thank you so much.

364
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:30,742
The next day, the secret books were evidence enough

365
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:32,842
"President of Onda Trading" -to get President Onda

366
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:36,042
"And 5 Employees Arrested!" -and the complicit 5 employees arrested,

367
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:37,942
and Chef Kuchiishi's father,

368
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:41,243
Keigo, was cleared of all charges.

369
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:05,043
"Ibaraki Mito Domain Ramen" -Thanks for the food!

370
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:09,742
I got to say, that's really too bad.

371
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,742
That was a Michelin-starred restaurant

372
00:23:11,743 --> 00:23:13,242
those are hard to get reservations for.

373
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:18,142
Maybe Cucina Eigo will open up again someday.

374
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:19,642
I hope so.

375
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:22,242
But the ramen here was good, too!

376
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:23,843
My tummy's full!

377
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:28,142
If we can't eat from the Cucina,

378
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:30,643
then we can at least eat at the kitchen!

379
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,643
You get it?

380
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:36,343
Isn't that funny?

381
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:38,843
We hope you enjoyed the show.

382
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:47,543
Huh? Didn't Pirate's Spirit from race nine win?

383
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:49,942
Seriously?

384
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:52,343
That was the dark horse! This pays out a hundred-fold!

385
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:55,742
One million yen?

386
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:58,743
All right, tonight we're having sushi for dinner, sushi!

387
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:05,743
Who stole my one million yen ticket?

388
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:07,942
Next Conan,

389
00:24:07,943 --> 00:24:11,743
"The Tokyo-Style Detective Show Next Door (Part 1)"
