1
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:10,459
That's it!

2
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,258
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

3
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,558
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,258
Before tackling the Scarlet Case,

5
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:31,658
we head to a karate dojo with Sonoko.

6
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:33,458
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,458
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:37,659
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,990
"Mystery of the Missing Black Belt"

10
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:19,635
Just as expected of you.

11
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:22,435
Makoto, you're awesome!

12
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,135
Yes, yes.

13
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:26,735
What's with that attitude of yours?

14
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:29,435
I went out of my way to get us to come see this, you know.

15
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:32,135
So can't you try looking a bit happier?

16
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:35,735
You forced me to come with you.

17
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:40,235
I actually wanted to USJ with everybody else, you know.

18
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:43,135
We came all the way to Osaka and yet...

19
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:46,235
If you wanted to watch karate, you should've come with Ran.

20
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:49,935
Ran has to look after the children.

21
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,235
And besides, if Ran comes,

22
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:56,235
Makoto and her will get carried away talking about karate, right?

23
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,935
I didn't want to come alone,

24
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:01,936
so there was nobody else I could ask but you.

25
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:04,936
Hi there!

26
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:08,135
Hi...

27
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:10,035
Hiroki, that karate outfit...

28
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:13,135
Mine was worn out so I got a new one.

29
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,935
The youth club practice is going to be starting.

30
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:18,235
Makoto's a guest.

31
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:21,335
Who's that old man over there?

32
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:25,335
He nobody else but Tatsuhito Takami Sensei

33
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,635
of the Tenshin Style Karate 8th generation.

34
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:31,636
Really? What's the relationship between Sensei and Makoto?

35
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:37,435
Well, I guess you could say they're old time acquaintances.

36
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:39,635
When I was in elementary school,

37
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,735
there was a time when I hit a wall and got stuck playing Karate.

38
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:45,335
I just happened to come to Osaka on a family trip,

39
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,236
and met Takami Sensei.

40
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:54,536
He let me practice with him just once.

41
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:00,736
At that practice, I...

42
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:28,436
Win without fighting.

43
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:34,936
Think about the meaning of this phrase.

44
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:42,735
Thanks to that teaching, I am here now.

45
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:44,835
Win without fighting?

46
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,035
What does it mean?

47
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,135
I think it means you shouldn't pick a fight

48
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:51,836
or get offensive from your side?

49
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:57,235
As to the interpretation of words, to each is his own.

50
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:59,835
There is no one correct answer.

51
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:02,635
The youth club practice is starting soon,

52
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,035
so enjoy yourself watching it.

53
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:06,336
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:19,135
Are you okay, Sonoko?

55
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:20,335
I'm fine.

56
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:22,935
I had a cold but I'm over it.

57
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:26,936
By the way, your karate a while ago was awesome.

58
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,535
Thank you very much!

59
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,135
Okay, let's start practice.

60
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:34,835
Yes...

61
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:38,535
I'm always surprised of how fast children grow.

62
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:41,335
That boy over there called Hiroki Kadota,

63
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:42,835
used to have an inflexible body

64
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:45,235
and wasn't good at flexing his body.

65
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:47,735
But now, he's changed.

66
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:51,535
Recently, he acts as a leader for the club.

67
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:54,135
I'm really proud of him.

68
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,335
The one next to him, Katsuto Kawaguchi

69
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,135
also has a bright future to look forward to.

70
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:00,635
He's big built but is timid

71
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:03,335
and couldn't give his all during the real matches.

72
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:08,135
But now, he passed the test and got a black belt.

73
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:11,835
Oh, yes. There's another one, Norio Obashi.

74
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:15,535
He wasn't good at running and always was pooped part way,

75
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:18,635
but now, he finishes the entire course with ease.

76
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:22,435
Is that because your training is good, Sensei?

77
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:26,435
I wonder about that.

78
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:28,935
Thank you so much for coming today.

79
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:33,335
You're indeed a hero to all the children, Kyogoku.

80
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,936
This will become a good memory for them.

81
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:42,135
Sensei, I have a stomach ache,

82
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,835
so can I take off from practice today?

83
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,935
Of course, you may.

84
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:48,935
But are you okay?

85
00:06:48,936 --> 00:06:50,936
Do you want me to take you home?

86
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,235
No, I can go home alone.

87
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:58,735
I'm sure I'll get better if I rest a while.

88
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:01,336
Basic practice. Start!

89
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:15,835
Sensei, what is that?

90
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,735
That's an exhibition of the trophies

91
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:20,435
and medals that were won at tournaments.

92
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:24,535
I said not to, but my students insisted.

93
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:27,635
What's that one at the very top?

94
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,235
That's the belt that has been handed down

95
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:31,335
to the heads of this dojo for generations.

96
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:34,035
It is a crystallization of the blood and sweat of all those before us.

97
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,835
I've devoted myself to practicing all this time

98
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:38,835
so as not to disgrace this belt.

99
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:41,635
Then, what about the belt that you're using now?

100
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:44,335
It's just a regular belt that you can find anywhere.

101
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,235
But you're the head of the Dojo, aren't you, Sensei?

102
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:49,636
Why aren't you wearing that belt?

103
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,835
I'm sorry,

104
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:55,535
but I've got to go now.

105
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:57,335
I wonder what happened?

106
00:07:57,336 --> 00:08:00,435
I hear that after Takami Sensei became the head of the Dojo,

107
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:04,035
his practice was so severe that a lot of people quit.

108
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:07,835
And besides, it seems he doesn't charge children for practicing.

109
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,635
What? You mean he teaches for free?

110
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,735
Let's go running then!

111
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:14,635
Okay...

112
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:18,135
Kyogoku, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

113
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:19,136
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,435
Mr. Takami.

115
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,335
Mr. Kajiyoshi.

116
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:29,235
Please sign the papers today, okay?

117
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:33,535
I'm sorry, but could you give me a little more time?

118
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:35,435
Just what do you mean by that?

119
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:37,735
I'm here because you said

120
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:39,735
you wanted to sell this place as soon as possible.

121
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:43,335
I'm willing to pay you a good price for it, too.

122
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,836
I have a guest now, you see.

123
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:49,735
Okay, I guess I'll come back.

124
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:51,635
What's with those three?

125
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:53,735
I think they're debt collectors for black-market financing.

126
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:54,835
What?

127
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,735
They're planning to take this away from him

128
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,335
if he isn't able to pay back the money.

129
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:03,636
If they sell the land, they can make loads of cash on it.

130
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:09,135
Sensei, is it true that you're selling this place?

131
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:11,135
I'm old already.

132
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:15,335
It's about time I return that black belt and retire.

133
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:16,836
No way.

134
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:19,435
Unfortunately,

135
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:24,235
there isn't anyone fit to succeed the Tenshin Style Dojo yet.

136
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:28,635
So, I decided to close it.

137
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:31,935
But the way I see it, Sensei, you're still...

138
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:35,635
I don't have the energy that I used to have anymore.

139
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:39,036
The vigor to wear that black belt, that is.

140
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,236
Excuse me for a moment.

141
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:48,335
Takami Sensei. If you close this place,

142
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:51,235
what will become of those children?

143
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:55,235
I will ask if other Dojo's will be willing to accept them.

144
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:59,335
Those children came here because they adored you, right?

145
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:01,036
That's too irresponsible!

146
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:12,836
Kyogoku, what did you do?

147
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:17,436
The belt's gone!

148
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:21,335
Kyogoku, don't tell me that...

149
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:24,735
If it were me...

150
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:26,536
What would you do?

151
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,910
Makoto, is it true?

152
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,810
Will you explain?

153
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:39,510
I want you to take back your statement of closing the Dojo.

154
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,811
What?

155
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,229
I'm sorry. I've already made up my mind.

156
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,029
Then, I challenge you to a match, Sensei.

157
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,829
If I win, you will continue operating the Dojo.

158
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,629
If you win, Sensei,

159
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,530
I will return the belt to you.

160
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,229
You don't want to compromise, do you?

161
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,830
No.

162
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,929
All right.

163
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,029
Will do.

164
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,729
-Sensei! -Makoto, don't do that!

165
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,230
Please!

166
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,629
What shall we do? I can't believe this is happening.

167
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,529
Hey.

168
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,629
Makoto, please don't!

169
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,029
You're scaring the children, too!

170
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,230
Makoto!

171
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,329
Shoots!

172
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,729
Sonoko!

173
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,129
Makoto is not the perp.

174
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,629
He's just protecting the real perp.

175
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,929
What?

176
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,729
The one who has the key to the exhibition room is...

177
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,029
Only me.

178
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,929
There is one more place you can enter from.

179
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,429
It's the little window on the wall.

180
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,129
Even children can't go through a window of that size.

181
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,729
The down pipe can be used.

182
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,329
Using that, you can climb up to the small window.

183
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,429
The down pipe is corroded and worn out.

184
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,129
It's useless.

185
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,129
Only Kyogoku could've taken the belt after all.

186
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,130
If you so insist, why not check him?

187
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,929
It's not here.

188
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,129
Maybe he hid it somewhere.

189
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,829
We were surprised at the sound of Makoto breaking the lock of the Dojo

190
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,729
and came running in here.

191
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,229
So, Makoto had no time to hide the belt.

192
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,629
Sensei.

193
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,929
She's right.

194
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,129
Do you know where the belt is?

195
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,929
Yes.

196
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,429
Where is it?

197
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,929
Hiroki Kadota, Katsuto Kawaguchi,

198
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,129
and although he's not here, Norio Obashi,

199
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,629
those three know where the belt is.

200
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,630
What?

201
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,829
You've been planning it for a while, haven't you?

202
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,229
About taking away Takami Sensei's belt.

203
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,029
Is it true that you guys took it?

204
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,030
Why?

205
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,129
But that's strange.

206
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,329
We were out running with the children.

207
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,029
They were both with everyone right through.

208
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,829
Was the running course the same as usual?

209
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,029
Yeah. There's a park about 5 minutes from here.

210
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,229
We call out the names of the children once there.

211
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,829
And from there, we run alongside the river.

212
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,229
We cross the third bridge, then run on the opposite side,

213
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,729
return to the park, and roll call once more.

214
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,729
Then finally come back here to the Dojo.

215
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,629
How would you explain this?

216
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,629
Even if you heard the voices,

217
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,529
you didn't check all their faces, did you?

218
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,229
How about it?

219
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,729
No. It's true we didn't check their faces.

220
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,129
The children switched during the first roll call at the park.

221
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,129
That is, Hiroki and Norio Obashi who went home before everyone else.

222
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,029
Norio pretended to be Hiroki and ran with everyone.

223
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,229
What the...

224
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,929
Hiroki who fled alone from the park

225
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,229
came back to the Dojo.

226
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,729
He went quietly in back so we wouldn't see him,

227
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,929
climbed the wall

228
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,429
and took the belt from the exhibition corner through the small window

229
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,029
and went out again.

230
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,129
That's ridiculous!

231
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,229
A child couldn't possibly climb that wall alone without even using a rope.

232
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,029
He can climb.

233
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,729
But it's all worn out already.

234
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,529
What if it's a child who is small and flexible?

235
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,829
Hiroki, is it true?

236
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,830
Did you take the belt?

237
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,829
If he puts his body through the small window

238
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,830
and stretches his hand over,

239
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,829
he could somehow manage to reach the belt.

240
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,429
But at that time,

241
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,330
his collar got hooked onto the rim of the window.

242
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,629
As proof of that, on the karate outfit that seems to be Hiroki's...

243
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,629
There is fray.

244
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,029
Hiroki carried his karate outfit to the park

245
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,830
and waited for everyone to come back after running.

246
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,129
But, what about the belt that he took?

247
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,129
There's no place to hide it.

248
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,629
Katsuto Kawaguchi.

249
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,130
Will you take off your belt?

250
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,429
This is...

251
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,929
The switch at the park after running was not only people.

252
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,729
The belts were also switched.

253
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,530
Since Katsuto just got his black belt, he could wear it.

254
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,730
Norio!

255
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,129
Why? Why did you do something like this?

256
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,730
We wanted you to continue running this Dojo, Sensei.

257
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,229
We heard you talking on the phone, Sensei.

258
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,529
You said that you were quitting

259
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,929
because you lost your enthusiasm for karate.

260
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,429
We wanted to continue practicing here more.

261
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,429
We wanted you to teach us more about Karate, Sensei.

262
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,929
Sensei, you were saying on the phone

263
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,529
that you got a hold of that belt that you worked for

264
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,829
and so you have no regrets.

265
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,029
That's why we thought that if the belt went missing,

266
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,129
you would want to do karate again.

267
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,629
You guys...

268
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,730
Don't quit, Sensei!

269
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,129
Please continue the Dojo. Please!

270
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,230
Please...

271
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,129
You understood how the children felt, didn't you, Makoto?

272
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,029
That's why you returned to the Dojo,

273
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,829
realized that the belt was missing

274
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,729
and figured out immediately who did it, too.

275
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,329
Hiroki and the others executed this plan

276
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,529
all because they didn't want Takami Sensei to quit.

277
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,729
They'd been planning this over a long period of time.

278
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,630
Long period of time?

279
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,829
Yes.

280
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,429
In order to climb the wall and get to the small window,

281
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:32,029
Hiroki needed to flex his stiff body.

282
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,029
That's because Hiroki was the only one

283
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,829
who could climb the half broken drain pipe

284
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,330
and go in through the small window.

285
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,829
Katsuto tried his best to pass the test for 1st dan

286
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,229
so that he could wear the black belt,

287
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,229
because the only one who could wear an adult black belt

288
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,129
was Katsuto who had big built.

289
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,529
And Norio tried his best at running that he wasn't good at

290
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,529
because he had to run in place of Hiroki

291
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,130
and make sure that he wouldn't lag behind.

292
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,130
You guys...

293
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,629
My, my. Are you busy?

294
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,230
Just as I promised, I'd like to have your signature.

295
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,529
Take off your shoes.

296
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,929
What?

297
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,429
This is a sacred Dojo.

298
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,529
Wearing shoes here is prohibited.

299
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,329
Who are you?

300
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,230
It's none of your business. Stay out of this.

301
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,029
Mr. Kajiyoshi.

302
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,429
I'm sorry,

303
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,530
but will you forget about the thing about selling this place?

304
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,129
I seem to have been mistaken.

305
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,329
I thought I had finished doing all I had to do,

306
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,029
but I still have a lot to learn.

307
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,829
I need more training.

308
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,029
These children taught me that.

309
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,929
So for them

310
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,329
as well as for me...

311
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,330
I still need this dojo.

312
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,929
Hooray...

313
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,629
Cut out the joke!

314
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,829
What makes you think I'll say "oh, is that right"

315
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,730
and back down at this point?

316
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,629
You either repay all the money you borrowed right this minute,

317
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,329
or let go of this land.

318
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,530
You've only got one of two options.

319
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,529
What? You wanna fight?

320
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,630
Never mind. Go get him!

321
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,130
Don't get ahead of yourself!

322
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,630
Will you please leave for today?

323
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,830
Win without fighting.

324
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,830
I've still got a long way to go.

325
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,730
Come, let's start practice.

326
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,729
But it sure was great that he got to discuss it over with a lawyer.

327
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,829
The company that Kajiyoshi worked for

328
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,829
was pitch black when investigated.

329
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,629
They were loan sharks.

330
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,529
Police investigation is going to start

331
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,330
so I'm sure he'll be able to work out his debts, too.

332
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,429
Sonoko, thank you very much.

333
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,929
Thanks to you, we may be able to keep the dojo open.

334
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,829
Not at all.

335
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,529
You were as awesome as ever, Makoto,

336
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,830
that I'm glad I came to watch you.

337
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,729
Sonoko, are you okay?

338
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,629
You seem to have a slight fever.

339
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,829
I'm sorry!

340
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,829
No big deal.

341
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,229
You may have caught a cold again.

342
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,529
Take this.

343
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,730
Thank you, Makoto.

344
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,429
Are you all right? Your face is red.

345
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,329
I'm fine.

346
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,029
I'm perfectly fine.

347
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,529
I'm going to have a load of fun with Makoto from now, you see.

348
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,830
What's the matter?

349
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,529
Hey, don't tell me...

350
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,629
Please, my lady.

351
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,329
Hey, what's this?

352
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,229
Don't tell me it was you?

353
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,129
I'm sorry. I called them.

354
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,129
You shouldn't take colds lightly.

355
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,229
A cold leads to all kinds of illnesses.

356
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,230
So, you've got stay in bed until you're completely well.

357
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,829
Hey, let me go!

358
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,630
I'm going to go with Makoto to USJ from now!

359
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,529
They left.

360
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,329
No, let me down!

361
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,330
I'm going to USJ!

362
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,429
After this, I'm sure that Sonoko will

363
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,529
end up appreciating what Kyogoku did.

364
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,029
Because after this, there was to be a gigantic case

365
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,829
that would even get the TV stations involved

366
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,130
that we would be encountering.

367
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,330
"Next Episode"

368
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,230
It came from downstairs!

369
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,229
This is...

370
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,229
There's blood on it too,

371
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,429
so I guess it's safe to say that it was used to commit the crime.

372
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,829
Officer Chiba, where did you find this?

373
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,029
Well, it was in the trash bin of the condo.

374
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,230
What?

375
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:11,630
Next Conan, "The Socialite Couple's Secret"
