1
00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:04,627
A new tragedy occurs at the House of Death.

2
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:06,027
Mr. Shusaku Akashi,

3
00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:09,227
husband of Aoi who passed away three year ago

4
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:12,627
was confined to a room and starved to death.

5
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:14,627
Just before his death,

6
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:18,627
Mr. Akashi had painted the wall on one side of the room entirely red.

7
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:20,827
What on earth did he want to relay?

8
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:25,827
Just when questioning of the former residents of the house began,

9
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:30,827
one of them, musician Shiro Naoki, is murdered.

10
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:33,327
Like Mr. Akashi, he was found sitting on a chair

11
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:37,027
facing the wall that was painted entirely red.

12
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:39,927
Inspector Morofushi, who used to be one of Aoi's classmates,

13
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:43,527
despite the warning of another classmate, Inspector Yamato,

14
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,527
goes off to investigate on his own.

15
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:49,427
A text mail comes from Inspector Morofushi,

16
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:51,927
and written is the sentence,

17
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,327
Koume dies.

18
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:58,127
The House of Death is enveloped in flames.

19
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:02,027
Although Inspector Morofushi is rescued from the fire

20
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,627
by Officer Uehara in the nick of time,

21
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:06,027
Inspector Morofushi is unconscious due to a blow on his head.

22
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:08,427
The meaning of the sentence, Koume dies, is still unknown,

23
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:11,527
the mystery of the case seemed unfathomable.

24
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,727
However, Ran's casual remark

25
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:16,627
drops a ray of light onto the mystery.

26
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:17,727
It is...

27
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:21,327
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

28
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:23,727
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

29
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:25,727
We're finally approaching the climax.

30
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:27,927
It's time to unravel the mystery of the red wall and real killer.

31
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:29,627
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:31,327
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,927
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:22,078
I get it!

35
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,878
Just looking at this red wall

36
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,978
isn't going to help us get to the answer of the dying message.

37
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:34,778
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Empty Fort Strategy)"

38
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,678
I see.

39
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:41,478
That's why the chairs of the first murder site

40
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:44,478
were painted black and white.

41
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:45,678
Yep!

42
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:48,778
It seemed that the victim, Mr. Akashi

43
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,578
liked chess too!

44
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:53,878
If so, why did the culprit

45
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,678
paint the wall of the second murder red?

46
00:03:57,678 --> 00:04:00,078
Because he was convinced that even if it were left that way,

47
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:03,478
no one would be able to figure it out.

48
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:04,478
I get it!

49
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,078
The dying message...

50
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,278
Was not the red wall to begin with!

51
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:12,078
Someone other than the culprit who would've had to do so is...

52
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:15,778
Nobody else but Shiro Naoki!

53
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:17,178
Finally...

54
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:22,678
You've finally reached that conclusion.

55
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,678
Ko... Koume?

56
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,878
You've regained consciousness!

57
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:30,178
Are you okay, moving around like that?

58
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:32,078
Yes. I guess so.

59
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:35,878
If so, let's go nab the culprit on the double!

60
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:39,078
Mochi that is drawn on the ground

61
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,878
cannot be consumed.

62
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:44,978
It's a pity that the deductions that we have reached

63
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:47,078
are no more than mochi drawn on the ground.

64
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,578
It's not edible at all.

65
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:52,378
In other words, you're saying that we have no proof.

66
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:56,378
But Mr. Shiro Naoki said

67
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,678
that he would soon be going to a place called Lecce in Italy,

68
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:03,278
so if you want to find him, come look for him there, right?

69
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:09,778
Oh, that's very meaningful.

70
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:12,178
If so, I've got a great idea.

71
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,978
That goes for me too.

72
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:15,178
Hey!

73
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,478
Leave this to me, of the Prefecture Police Department Headquarters!

74
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:19,878
Oh, no way.

75
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,278
How about doing this, then?

76
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,478
Describe your strategy in one word

77
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:26,678
and display it on the screen of your cell phones

78
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:28,378
and show it to each other?

79
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:32,378
Just like Koume and Zhou did before the Battle of Red Cliffs!

80
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:35,678
All right.

81
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:37,878
Geez, what a hassle.

82
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:43,278
Here goes.

83
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:45,178
Ready, get set.

84
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:51,878
Just as I thought after all.

85
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:54,378
The Empty Fort Strategy!

86
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,378
"Empty."

87
00:05:57,778 --> 00:06:00,378
I wish you'd cut it out, inspector.

88
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:03,478
Being called out like this so many times.

89
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:05,978
You're going to run us out of business.

90
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:10,078
It's true that we used to live in this house before.

91
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,978
But, I think it's just a coincidence

92
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:15,878
that all of our alibis for last night are ambiguous.

93
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:17,078
Didn't I tell you that

94
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:19,278
we were near the house that burned down

95
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,478
because we were summoned over by text mail?

96
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,278
In the first place, did you solve the mystery of the red wall?

97
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:29,278
We haven't solved that mystery yet.

98
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:33,278
But, it seems that Mr. Shiro Naoki who became the second victim,

99
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:35,878
have caught on to something.

100
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:37,678
Do you have any idea what it could be?

101
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,278
I wonder.

102
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:42,178
I only know that he was in need of money.

103
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:45,478
He was saying he was going on a trip soon.

104
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,778
That's right, to a place in Italy called Lecce.

105
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:52,978
Then maybe he was going to walk over there

106
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:54,878
to the place called Lecce

107
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:58,078
to hide something important!

108
00:06:58,078 --> 00:07:00,778
Besides, it seems that he also said

109
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,978
to come to look for him there after he's gone.

110
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:06,078
Why would he walk over?

111
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:09,578
Because Italy is shaped like a shoe, isn't it?

112
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:11,678
At any rate!

113
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:14,778
If you want to investigate us any further...

114
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:18,178
Do that after you find necessary proof.

115
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:20,778
We don't have all the time in the world too, you see.

116
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,378
See you.

117
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:23,678
If you will excuse me then.

118
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:29,878
We've done what needs to be done,

119
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:33,378
so now we sit and wait, right?

120
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:34,778
Those who travel a 100 miles

121
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:37,078
regard 90 miles as only half.

122
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:39,178
We should keep on our guard.

123
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:40,778
Yeah.

124
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,778
We can't afford not solving this case, after we've come this far.

125
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:53,278
PC60, PC60.

126
00:07:53,278 --> 00:07:55,278
A taxi robbery occurred in the industry area...

127
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:57,878
Darn. Just as I thought,

128
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,178
there are officers staked out even in back of Shiro's apartment.

129
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,678
So, it was a trap after all.

130
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:06,078
What? A taxi robbery?

131
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:07,178
Near here?

132
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:09,678
Yeah, they want us there on the double.

133
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:17,678
What happened? Are they going to leave?

134
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:20,578
Which means that, this apartment is going to be empty.

135
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:28,278
No, wait.

136
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:31,278
The drunkard that fell forward in front of the apartment just now

137
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,278
and the man wearing the mask

138
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,578
that've been loitering around from a while ago.

139
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:38,278
One of them could be an officer.

140
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,278
Sir, you'll catch cold sleeping in a place like this!

141
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,178
Shut up! Stay out of this!

142
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:49,278
Idiot! Who gives a hoot about the chairman...

143
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:52,578
I guess the drunkard's not an officer.

144
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:55,078
Hey, you. Are you all right?

145
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,278
You're so drunk.

146
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:02,178
I can go another two or three shops!

147
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:04,678
Hey!

148
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,278
Oh, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:11,378
I broke my leg!

150
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,978
Are you all right?

151
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,278
Hey, jerk!

152
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:18,678
Give me a million yen to pay for what you did!

153
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:20,578
1 million yen?

154
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,778
I don't have that much money!

155
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:25,278
Then, give me your wallet and all!

156
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:26,478
No!

157
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:28,178
He's mugging the man?

158
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:30,778
If the man wearing the mask is an officer,

159
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,578
he would never overlook this.

160
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:43,278
Now I can go drink some more.

161
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,378
Are you sure?

162
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:49,278
Darn it.

163
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,178
What should I tell my mother?

164
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:57,978
What?

165
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:01,378
Don't tell me that the man is an underwear thief?

166
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:10,178
Hey! He's going into Shiro's room now.

167
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:16,178
Absurd! If he does that...

168
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:21,378
The officers staking out outside of the apartment will get him.

169
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:25,478
They're gone.

170
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:27,878
Right, the police cars that were staking out here

171
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,878
went to the taxi robbery site too.

172
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:37,378
The man who went in a while ago's

173
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:39,378
coming out from Shiro's room.

174
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:43,278
A mugger, underwear thief and a break in.

175
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,578
No doubt about it! The police aren't staking out.

176
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:57,878
I'll go get the stuff now while they're gone, then.

177
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:01,778
Which one? Which one?

178
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:03,778
Which shoe did he hide it in?

179
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:05,478
Could it be that...

180
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:10,578
you're looking for this shoe?

181
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:14,278
This shoe is a bit different, isn't it?

182
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:16,178
The heel comes off

183
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:21,178
and the memory card of a cell phone is inside!

184
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:22,578
Yes.

185
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:24,578
Right where Lecce of Italy is located on the map,

186
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:26,978
by the heel of the shoe!

187
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,978
Too bad you couldn't find it before I did.

188
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,978
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa?

189
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,204
Who the heck are you?

190
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,604
Oh, come on.

191
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:51,172
We've met so many times, have you forgotten?

192
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:54,172
Conan Edogawa.

193
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,572
A detective.

194
00:11:55,572 --> 00:11:57,872
It's you?

195
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:00,264
But, I'm sure...

196
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:01,964
You...

197
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:03,464
Haven't forgotten...

198
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:04,964
Us!

199
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:06,464
Then the mugging

200
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:08,364
and thief breaking in that I saw a while ago were...

201
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:09,864
Yeah.

202
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,264
It's the Empty Fort Strategy!

203
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:16,264
The Empty Fort Strategy?

204
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,764
With only the police cars withdrawing,

205
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:22,364
you may suspect that the officers are still hiding,

206
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:24,764
but if in the midst of this psychological circumstance,

207
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:27,364
the people who were around the apartment

208
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:29,764
act unlike police officers

209
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:32,164
and further crimes are committed,

210
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:36,664
your suspicion will soon subside.

211
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:39,064
The Empty Fort Strategy

212
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:41,964
is when someone deliberately loosens one's guard

213
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,564
under the pretense of luring the enemy over,

214
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,964
when actually he keeps the enemy away.

215
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:48,864
But ours has the opposite effect.

216
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:54,764
So, you talked about the shoe at the station

217
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:58,764
to lure me out here after all.

218
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:04,364
No, we knew from the start that you would show up here.

219
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:06,264
It bothered me to begin with.

220
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:08,964
I couldn't understand why the culprit also left behind

221
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:13,064
the dying message of the victim of the first murder site,

222
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:15,664
at the second murder site.

223
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:18,164
But, if that red wall was not

224
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,664
a dying message left behind by the victim...

225
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:24,564
Right. If it were painted not by the victim nor the culprit,

226
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,364
but rather, a third person...

227
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:29,764
It's understandable that the culprit would deliberately

228
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:32,864
leave behind the red wall at the second murder site

229
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:36,164
in order to confuse investigation of the police.

230
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:38,164
Are you saying that the third person

231
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:40,064
is Mr. Shiro Naoki?

232
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:41,664
Yeah.

233
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:42,864
If someone other than the culprit

234
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:46,564
were to have painted over Mr. Akashi's red paint,

235
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:50,564
the only thinkable thing is that he would've written in katakana.

236
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:54,964
"I was killed by Naoki".

237
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:57,464
In other words, that you,

238
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:59,664
Naoki Midorikawa is the culprit!

239
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,964
I see. So, Mr. Shiro Naoki who came to beg for money,

240
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:06,164
happened to coincidentally find the message,

241
00:14:06,164 --> 00:14:07,964
thought it was referring to him

242
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:11,564
and painted the wall entirely red.

243
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:14,364
If it were written in katakana rather than Chinese characters,

244
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:16,164
he wouldn't have made that mistake.

245
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:20,064
That's probably because he wrote using spray paint.

246
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:22,664
The fine details of the characters would disappear with spray.

247
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:27,464
And, while he was spraying red paint on the wall,

248
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,064
he realized that

249
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:31,664
the "Naoki" that was written there

250
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:34,264
was not his last name, Naoki, but, rather,

251
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:36,964
the name of the only person that Mr. Akashi used to call by name,

252
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:41,864
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, he was referring to you.

253
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:46,064
And, he took a picture of the half-erased characters with cell phone,

254
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:48,664
and decided to blackmail you.

255
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:49,764
Isn't that right?

256
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,664
Yeah, right.

257
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:57,864
That's why I strangled Shiro in this room where he called me over to.

258
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,464
Darn!

259
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,264
If only Shiro didn't come into the room

260
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:03,164
where I starved Shusaku to death.

261
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:06,364
If only I had painted the entire wall red.

262
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,164
Don't tell me

263
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:11,864
you still don't understand the meaning of the red wall, sir?

264
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:15,464
The dying message would only be complete

265
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,264
after the culprit himself paints the entire wall red.

266
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,364
What do you mean?

267
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:22,964
Do you know what an after image of a complementary color is?

268
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,964
After image of a complementary color?

269
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,964
It's a phenomenon of which after staring at a certain color for some time,

270
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:28,864
then looking at a different place after that,

271
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:33,564
the complementary color that was being looked at a while ago remains!

272
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:36,564
You see, the surgical gown that surgeons wear

273
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:38,564
is light green colored, right?

274
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,864
That's because when they have to look at red blood during surgery,

275
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:44,164
the after image of the complementary color green

276
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:45,664
gets in the way of concentration.

277
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:46,864
Therefore, wearing a gown of the same green color

278
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,564
softens the effect.

279
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:52,164
In other words, that red wall was also a dying message

280
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:54,664
using the after image supplementary color effect!

281
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:56,464
In that room,

282
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:59,064
the white chair faced the red wall

283
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:00,964
and the black chair was facing the white wall,

284
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:02,564
and both were nailed to the floor.

285
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:06,464
This was done to set the rail to solve the message!

286
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:09,764
Mr. Shusaku used to like playing chess.

287
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:11,564
In chess, the white piece gets to go first

288
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,464
and the black follow.

289
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:14,564
In other words,

290
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:18,664
after sitting in the white chair staring at the red wall,

291
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:21,664
if you sit in the black chair and stare at the white wall,

292
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:24,764
the after image of green, the complementary color of red,

293
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:29,864
will show up vividly on the white wall.

294
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,664
Midori (green), which means you,

295
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:34,364
Mr. Midorikawa.

296
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:36,664
That's why Mr. Akashi

297
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:39,164
threw out all the other paints he had from the window,

298
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,664
except for the red paint.

299
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:44,864
So that the wall wouldn't be painted using any other color.

300
00:16:44,864 --> 00:16:46,864
In other words, he assumed that

301
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:51,264
you would be the first to discover his dead body

302
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:54,464
and erase whatever he wrote and left behind.

303
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,464
He outwitted you by scheming it

304
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,964
so that you would disclose yourself as the culprit

305
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,664
by painting the entire wall.

306
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:03,064
That was the dying message he left behind.

307
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:05,164
It's indeed as the saying goes,

308
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:08,864
"Koume's men follow his orders even after his death!"

309
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:10,264
Exactly.

310
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:17,464
By me painting the entire wall, eh?

311
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:21,564
What a guy.

312
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:24,164
He goes and paints over an important portrait

313
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:28,564
and ruthlessly kills a precious person, and yet...

314
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:31,064
You mean, that portrait...

315
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:32,764
Yeah.

316
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:34,164
The portrait that Aoi kept looking for

317
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:36,364
until she collapsed from a heart attack

318
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:41,364
that Shusaku drew of her long ago.

319
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:44,164
That portrait was found!

320
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,364
It was underneath another totally different portrait

321
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:48,464
that I bought a year ago!

322
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:50,664
Underneath?

323
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:54,864
I bought it because it looked a bit like Aoi.

324
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,964
But, I decided to check for myself anyway.

325
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:59,464
I had it checked by X-Ray,

326
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:02,164
and found Aoi's portrait as it emerged

327
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,964
from underneath that drawing!

328
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:06,564
That guy Shusaku

329
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:09,364
painted Aoi's portrait all white

330
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:12,064
and drew another drawing in place of it!

331
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:14,364
Oh no.

332
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:15,764
It's true that Shusaku's drawings

333
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:18,864
started to gain attention these past two to three years.

334
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,164
I understand that he couldn't help but do something like that back then,

335
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:26,164
because when he drew that picture,

336
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:28,464
he didn't even have the money to buy a canvas.

337
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:32,664
Why didn't he tell Aoi about it?

338
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:36,164
If he had only said something about it to Aoi,

339
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:39,964
she wouldn't have had to die.

340
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:41,264
Why did he keep quiet

341
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:43,864
and locked himself in room to continue painting?

342
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:46,164
I locked him in the room to give him a taste of his own medicine,

343
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:50,064
to understand how terrible Aoi may have felt.

344
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,264
The day after Aoi passed away.

345
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:00,764
When I visited that house,

346
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,664
a portrait was being burned in the yard.

347
00:19:05,164 --> 00:19:07,864
It was Aoi's portrait with paint

348
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:10,564
that wasn't completely dried yet.

349
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:11,664
Do you mean that

350
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:14,964
the picture that Mr. Akashi was drawing locked up in his room was...

351
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:17,664
I'm sure it was that picture.

352
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,664
He probably locked himself in his room

353
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:22,264
and kept drawing her portrait in order to finish it in time

354
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:25,464
and surprise her with the drawing on her birthday,

355
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,664
that was the following day.

356
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:31,364
No!

357
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:37,064
Just what have I done?

358
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,864
Aoi.

359
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:40,464
Shusaku.

360
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:45,964
No one should interfere with the intimate relationship of others.

361
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:48,464
In other words, no third-party interference is needed

362
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:53,264
when two people have an intimate relationship with each other.

363
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:20,564
Okay, Koume,

364
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,764
I'll leave the rest for you to finish then!

365
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:27,764
Well, you're the one who first solved the mystery of the red wall.

366
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,164
It bugs me a bit,

367
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,064
but I'll leave submitting the report of the case to you!

368
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:34,964
It's just as I thought, after all.

369
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:39,364
It seems that you said you stuck that boy to me

370
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,464
so that he could watch over me.

371
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:47,164
But, doing something like that would be risking too much

372
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:50,064
being that I was on the list of suspects too.

373
00:21:50,064 --> 00:21:54,164
You had no doubt that I was innocent to begin with,

374
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:59,064
but made that boy accompany me anyway, didn't you?

375
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:01,964
You chose him as a partner to pierce through the truth of the case.

376
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:04,964
Hey, he's still a kid, you know.

377
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:08,364
When we the police were getting frustrated

378
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:10,964
at the scene of the second murder,

379
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:13,664
deducing that it was the culprit challenging the police,

380
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:16,064
that boy kept his cool and remarked.

381
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:20,664
But, I wonder if the culprit wasn't scared?

382
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:23,364
To copy the dying message without even knowing

383
00:22:23,364 --> 00:22:27,464
about the murder site in detail!

384
00:22:27,464 --> 00:22:29,564
If he didn't mention what he did,

385
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:33,664
I wonder if we would've ever arrived at the truth of the red wall.

386
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:36,364
Much less, the place where the evidence was hidden.

387
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:39,064
We arrived at the answer because the boy

388
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,864
mentioned information about Lecce.

389
00:22:41,864 --> 00:22:45,264
You planned it so that I would solve the case this way,

390
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,764
give me credit for it

391
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:51,364
and get me to return to the Nagano Prefectural Police Station...

392
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:54,064
but that's all uncalled for.

393
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:57,064
If our positions were reversed,

394
00:22:57,064 --> 00:23:00,464
you would've done the same, wouldn't you?

395
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:05,164
I would've worked it out more cleverly.

396
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:08,264
So, you wouldn't have realized a tinge of what I was doing.

397
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:10,764
Oh, I see, I get it!

398
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,464
This case is mine!

399
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,964
You can stay at the local police for life, then!

400
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,964
But, Kansuke.

401
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:27,464
I really appreciate you letting me meet the boy.

402
00:23:27,464 --> 00:23:30,164
Thanks to him, it's come back to me.

403
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:36,764
A phrase that I love, from a book that I love with all my heart,

404
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:42,464
"The boy, as if he had seen through the entire truth,"

405
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,564
"remarked quietly with cool eyes"

406
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:45,764
"and seriously,"

407
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:49,864
"started disclosing the truth."

408
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:51,064
"Right."

409
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,764
"Just like that famed strategist,."

410
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,164
"Koume Shokatsuryo."

411
00:23:58,264 --> 00:24:01,764
The rainbow colored trademark is what makes it popular!

412
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:03,364
A kidnapping!

413
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:05,364
Black Rainbow?

414
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:06,964
SIT?

415
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:08,564
The Metropolitan Police Department Investigations

416
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,264
1st Division Special Crime Section.

417
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:13,264
I don't see why both of you had to come along with me.

418
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:16,764
You're the one who said you needed camouflage, dad.

419
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,664
Anytime, anywhere.

420
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:21,864
You can never tell where or when the culprit is watching.

421
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:24,064
Next Conan,

422
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:30,864
"Rainbow Colored Kidnapping"
