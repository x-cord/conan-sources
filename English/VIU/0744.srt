1
00:00:00,555 --> 00:00:05,055
"Karuizawa"

2
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:10,655
"Saturday Bowl"

3
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:16,928
I did it! Strike!

4
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:18,328
As expected of you, Ran!

5
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,628
You're good!

6
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:23,228
Too bad about tennis, but bowling is fun, too!

7
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:25,928
Well, there's a guy who's pissed for not being able

8
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:29,828
to view tennis girls with mini skirts and also drink himself away.

9
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:31,728
Hey! It's your turn next, Conan.

10
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:34,128
-Okay! -Give it your best shot, Conan.

11
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:36,228
You can do it, brat.

12
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:41,228
So? Who is it that you want me to meet?

13
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:43,828
It's someone who's been waiting for 4 hours

14
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:45,728
at the tennis court in the pouring rain.

15
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:47,328
I think he'll be showing up soon

16
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:49,228
after he changes into dry clothes.

17
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:51,928
Stop keeping me in suspense and tell me.

18
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:55,728
I came all the way here in this rain on my motorbike, you know?

19
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,728
Who are you?

20
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:06,228
Do you want to fight?

21
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:12,728
Jeet Kune Do?

22
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:14,428
He dodged me?

23
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:25,428
Very interesting.

24
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:27,828
I'll beat you to a pulp!

25
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:33,228
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

26
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:34,928
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

27
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,828
The person that Sonoko favors makes his appearance.

28
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:39,128
A hair-trigger situation at the bowling alley.

29
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:40,728
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:42,528
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,928
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:30,586
"Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part 1)"

33
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:37,086
Very interesting.

34
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:39,086
I'll beat you to a pulp!

35
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,086
No, Masumi!

36
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,386
He's the one!

37
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:45,886
The one whom Sonoko wanted you to meet!

38
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,886
He's my boyfriend, Makoto Kyogoku.

39
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:54,486
She's my classmate, Masumi Sera.

40
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:57,086
A... A woman?

41
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:58,486
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:02,186
I thought you were some womanizer who was hassling Sonoko.

43
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:03,986
No problem.

44
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:07,086
I'm always mistaken for a man anyway.

45
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:10,086
Geez. Why didn't you stop them right away, Sonoko?

46
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:14,786
Well. I wanted to see them have it out.

47
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,486
-Mr. Kyogoku. -What if they...

48
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:18,486
-get hurt? -Here are your glasses.

49
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,886
-I'm sorry... -Thank you.

50
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,886
Well, it's no big deal.

51
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:26,186
I wanted to have it out a bit more with him.

52
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:29,286
Jeet Kune Do... Who taught you that?

53
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,286
My big brother did.

54
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:34,186
He was three times stronger than me, though.

55
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,086
But...

56
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:39,386
I thought you said your big brother had passed away?

57
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:41,486
Yeah, that's what I heard.

58
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:44,486
But weren't you talking on the phone

59
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:46,986
with your big brother the other day?

60
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,186
Yeah.

61
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:50,986
So you were listening to our phone conversation?

62
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,686
I have another brother.

63
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:56,086
The middle child who's super smart.

64
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,386
Unlike my eldest brother who passed away and me,

65
00:04:58,386 --> 00:04:59,586
he took after my dad.

66
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:01,986
He doesn't look like me, though.

67
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:05,686
He seems to be in the middle of an important job right now,

68
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:08,586
and he won't tell me his whereabouts or anything.

69
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:10,286
But at times, he helps me make deductions on cases

70
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:12,786
on the phone or by text mails.

71
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,086
He told me during the last case

72
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:18,286
that there was something wrong with my deduction.

73
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:20,186
But I figured since you were also there,

74
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,586
you'd be able to revise it if something came up.

75
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:26,986
I wouldn't, but Shinichi would be able to.

76
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:34,286
Don't tell me that she knows that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

77
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:37,586
By the way, Sonoko...

78
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:41,886
Did you goof when laundering those clothes?

79
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,686
Goof?

80
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:46,386
Your collar's stretched out,

81
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:49,286
and your underwear is showing.

82
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:53,386
This is called off-shoulder, and I'm showing it on purpose!

83
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,386
Besides, the brassiere is being shown deliberately, too!

84
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:57,286
Deliberately showing brassieres?

85
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:01,286
You mean that underwear is something you wear to show people?

86
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:03,386
That... That's right.

87
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:07,486
Sonoko came all dressed up for you, Mr. Kyogoku.

88
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:10,486
By the way, Mr. Kyogoku,

89
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,986
you're bleeding from the back of your right hand.

90
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:15,586
Did you get hurt when you were having it out with Masumi just now?

91
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,486
No, I got hurt outside a while ago.

92
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:18,986
Excuse me.

93
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:20,186
I'm sorry for what happened just now.

94
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:23,286
"Michiko Monna (30), Jr. High Maths Teacher" -Are you okay?

95
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:26,686
Yes. All I got was a scratch.

96
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,586
How about your friend?

97
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:31,386
He's fine. He asked for it.

98
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:33,986
My friend is taking him to the car right now.

99
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,386
-Did something happen? -No.

100
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:38,786
When I went out to buy a change of clothes,

101
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:41,286
her male friend hassled me.

102
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:44,186
So I punched him in the abdomen.

103
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:46,086
He may not look it,

104
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,586
"Masaki Sunami (29)" -but he works as a PE teacher for Jr. High School.

105
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:51,086
"Jr. High Science Teacher" -He's normally a serious teacher,

106
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:55,386
but Mr. Tanba changes whenever he gets drunk.

107
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:57,886
So, how is he now?

108
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:00,086
He's asleep in the car.

109
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,986
He was mumbling "I'll kill him"

110
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,886
in his sleep though.

111
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,986
By the way, what shall we do after this?

112
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:09,486
That's right.

113
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:12,886
Well, I was actually going to have him teach me how to bowl, but...

114
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:15,186
Teachers!

115
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:18,786
You seem to be in a fix.

116
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:23,986
If you like, I could show you how to do it.

117
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:30,886
It's your hips! Your hips!

118
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:33,586
Bring your hips a little bit more towards this way!

119
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,786
-I see... -When you're holding the ball,

120
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:37,786
make sure your leg that is the axis, the ball and your head

121
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:40,286
are in a straight line, understand?

122
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:43,386
-Yes... -Okay! Try it!

123
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,486
-Fantastic! -Right! That's the way!

124
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:54,786
You did great! Just perfect!

125
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:58,186
Well, it's really my honor

126
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,886
to be able to coach you beauties!

127
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:02,286
Thank you.

128
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,086
That old man

129
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,786
is really going to be arrested for sexual harassment one day.

130
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:19,086
Makoto, give it your best shot!

131
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,986
And this guy will probably be arrested

132
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:30,686
for damaging properties one of these days.

133
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,486
I think I'm not cut out

134
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:35,086
for dainty competitions like this after all.

135
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,586
I... I guess so.

136
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,886
Besides, I just got back today,

137
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,186
and I'm sort of groggy from jet lag.

138
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:45,886
Then, would you like to take a quick nap in dad's rental car?

139
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:48,686
I'm holding the keys for him.

140
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:51,386
I guess I'll do that, then.

141
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:56,986
Just when I'm supposed to be on a date with Makoto...

142
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:58,286
Well, no big deal.

143
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:01,686
We're eating with him later anyway!

144
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,986
Michiko, where are you going?

145
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,686
I'll go check on Mr. Tanba.

146
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,986
-I'm a bit worried about him. -I see.

147
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:11,686
I'll bring him with me after he sobers up.

148
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,386
What? He's gone?

149
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:18,086
Mr. Tanba wasn't in the car?

150
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:21,886
No. It looks like he got out of the car and left.

151
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:25,086
Then, why isn't he coming to the bowling alley?

152
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,086
Beats me.

153
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:29,086
Maybe he's asleep behind the car or something.

154
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,686
Cut out the joke!

155
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:33,086
It's been raining the whole time, you know?

156
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:34,686
Well, yeah. But...

157
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:37,386
Excuse me. If you're looking for someone,

158
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:41,386
just leave it to me, Kogoro Mouri.

159
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:43,586
My dad's a detective.

160
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:45,186
Kogoro Mouri?

161
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:46,886
Did you mean the renowned detective?

162
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,486
Mr. Tanba?

163
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:51,886
Mr. Tanba!

164
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:55,586
Are you there, Mr. Tanba?

165
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,886
Mr. Tanba!

166
00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:00,686
This isn't good. He's not sitting anywhere between the cars.

167
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:04,086
Maybe he went to drink again at another shop?

168
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:07,686
Don't tell me that he's harassing somebody again?

169
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:09,686
Then, let's go and look for him at the shops.

170
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:11,386
-Huh? -Okay.

171
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:13,886
Hey! You guys help us look

172
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:15,786
-in the nearby shops, too. -What?

173
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,286
But how?

174
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:20,286
We don't know what he looks like.

175
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,286
This is his picture.

176
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,586
If you like, I can forward it to you.

177
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:25,586
Okay.

178
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:31,386
Hey, our rental car was parked around here too, right?

179
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:33,386
-Mr. Kyogoku... -Right.

180
00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:35,586
But if he's hassled Makoto,

181
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:39,486
he would probably beat the guy to a pulp.

182
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,186
Well, I don't think he'll beat the guy to a pulp, though.

183
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:44,186
"Yakitori"

184
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:02,586
Darn it. He's nowhere to be found.

185
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:03,986
He's not over here either.

186
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:05,986
He hasn't come back to the car either!

187
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:08,786
It seems like his cell phone is switched off, too.

188
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:13,286
I wonder where he is.

189
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:19,486
What is it? What's that sound?

190
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:25,486
We've tried looking under the cars as well,

191
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,686
but it seems that he's not in this parking lot after all.

192
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:32,186
If so, we'd better call the police and ask them to search for him.

193
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:36,786
What... What's the matter?

194
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:39,286
The... The toilet door was unlocked.

195
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:43,386
So I opened it, and inside it...

196
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,837
Palpebral conjunctivitis, petechiae,

197
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:02,437
and foam coming out from his mouth.

198
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:04,337
His face isn't swollen,

199
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:07,537
and there are no strangulation marks on his neck either.

200
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:09,637
-Was he drowned to death? -Was he drowned to death?

201
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:13,337
Also, there are no marks of him being restrained on his legs or arms,

202
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:16,637
and the fact that his clothes are drenched...

203
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,637
What?

204
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:21,737
Are you saying that after he was drowned somewhere,

205
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:24,137
he was carried over to this toilet?

206
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:25,337
Yeah.

207
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:28,237
Judging from the death spots and rigor mortis seen on him,

208
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:31,937
he was probably killed just about an hour ago.

209
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:34,637
It was just around the time we started to look for him

210
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:37,137
and headed to search the shops around here.

211
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:40,337
And before we got back here,

212
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,237
the corpse was thrown into this toilet compartment,

213
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:43,837
and the culprit escaped.

214
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,837
No way...

215
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:48,037
Who on earth...

216
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:51,737
This teacher had a pretty sturdy body.

217
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,037
He might have been killed by more than one person

218
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:57,837
or by someone who is really strong.

219
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:59,337
Hey...

220
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:05,637
Did something happen?

221
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,937
So, the victim of the murder is

222
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:14,337
Mr. Masahiro Tanba, aged 32,

223
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:17,537
a PE teacher in Jr. High School.

224
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:19,937
And the one who discovered the corpse

225
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:22,537
is Ms. Sunami Masaki, a science teacher

226
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:25,737
from the same Jr. High School. Is that right?

227
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,337
Yes.

228
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:29,737
Then, will you please tell me

229
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:32,037
how exactly you went about discovering the corpse?

230
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,237
Yes, sir.

231
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:37,337
Mr. Tanba, my colleague, Michiko and I

232
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:40,837
were planning to play bowling here today.

233
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,537
But he ended up wasted after drinking beer

234
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:46,037
when we came here in a car,

235
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,537
and got into trouble after getting violent in town.

236
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,737
We decided to let him sleep it off,

237
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:53,337
so I took him back to Michiko's car.

238
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:54,937
Colleague?

239
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:57,337
Does that mean that you're also a teacher at Jr. High?

240
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,337
Yes. I teach mathematics.

241
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:01,737
I see.

242
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:03,237
And? What happened after that?

243
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:06,337
After bowling with Sunami for about an hour,

244
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:09,937
I went to the car to check on him.

245
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:12,137
He went through a lot,

246
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,237
so I thought I shouldn't keep him alone for too long.

247
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,937
But when I went there, he wasn't in the car.

248
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:19,937
So we all ended up searching for him immediately.

249
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:21,737
Who did you mean by "we all"?

250
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,937
The people whom we happened to become acquainted with

251
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:25,437
at this bowling alley.

252
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:28,737
It's me, Kogoro Mouri here.

253
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:31,137
I see. It's Mr. Mouri!

254
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:35,037
After that, we searched the parking lot, but couldn't find him.

255
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:39,237
So, thinking that maybe he went out drinking somewhere again,

256
00:14:39,237 --> 00:14:40,937
I split up with the girls

257
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:44,537
and searched the pubs in this vicinity for about an hour.

258
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:46,137
But since we still couldn't find him,

259
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:49,037
we came back to this parking lot again.

260
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:52,737
We figured that he might have gone back to the car by then.

261
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:57,437
And just as we thought, he did come back.

262
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,737
He went into the toilet here in this parking lot

263
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:02,237
as a cold, drowned corpse.

264
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,837
Drowned?

265
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,937
-Is that so? -Yes, sir.

266
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:08,637
We can't conclude anything until after the autopsy,

267
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:10,537
but judging from the circumstances of the corpse,

268
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,637
that's most likely it.

269
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:14,937
So, what's the estimated time of death?

270
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:17,337
A little before or after 5.00 pm.

271
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:20,237
I see. Around 5.00 pm?

272
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:23,137
That's just around the time we left this parking lot

273
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:25,537
and started searching inside the pubs.

274
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:26,937
Yeah.

275
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:32,837
But why didn't you check inside the toilet to begin with?

276
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:35,337
It was locked with a padlock.

277
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:39,337
There was also an "Out of Order" sign on the door.

278
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:41,737
A sign, you said?

279
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:44,037
I saw it, too!

280
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:47,237
But the second time we came back here,

281
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,437
that sign was peeled off,

282
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:52,837
and the padlock was gone.

283
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:55,937
So I opened the door of the toilet compartment,

284
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:59,137
and I found Mr. Tanba...

285
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,737
That means the victim was carried off by someone

286
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:05,537
between the time when Ms. Sunami brought him to the car

287
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:09,937
and the time Ms. Michiko came to check up on him.

288
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:11,437
So while Mr. Mouri, you and the others

289
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,037
went out to search the pubs for him,

290
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:15,137
he was drowned somewhere else.

291
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:17,837
And before you and the others got back here,

292
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,737
his corpse was placed inside the toilet compartment.

293
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,137
Is that right?

294
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:23,737
Yeah. That's the story.

295
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:27,237
By the way, is there any chance that someone

296
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,437
was after Mr. Tanba's life?

297
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:32,037
I don't know. But when he got drunk, his personality would change

298
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:34,837
and he would hassle anybody in sight.

299
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:40,537
Therefore, he said that he wouldn't drink at all today.

300
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:42,737
Inspector Yamamura!

301
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:45,137
There is a bruise found on the stomach of the victim.

302
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,337
A bruise?

303
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:49,337
You're right.

304
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:52,437
It was probably me.

305
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:55,337
Since he was drunk and picked a fight with me,

306
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:57,337
I punched him in his solar plexus.

307
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:58,837
He picked a fight?

308
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:02,937
He shouted loudly when our eyes met.

309
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,437
You're quite a pushover, aren't you?

310
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:07,637
You were looking for him together with Mr. Mouri

311
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:09,537
and the others, weren't you?

312
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:11,837
No. I was taking a nap

313
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:15,237
in Mr. Mouri's car that's parked here.

314
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:22,637
We'll arrest you immediately on charges of murder!

315
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:24,637
Hold it, Yamamura.

316
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:26,337
Would anybody kill someone

317
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,937
just because the person picked a fight with him?

318
00:17:27,937 --> 00:17:30,037
What are you saying...

319
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:32,337
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

320
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:37,237
He confessed to what he did, thanks to my skillful tact.

321
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:40,437
He just said he had a motive and no alibi.

322
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,937
But... But you can't just arrest him

323
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,037
based on something like that, can you?

324
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:48,337
He's just like his usual self, that klutz.

325
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:51,937
Just what do you think you're talking about?

326
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,337
Makoto isn't the culprit!

327
00:17:55,337 --> 00:17:58,937
Then, can you prove his innocence?

328
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:01,437
Yes! Of course, I can!

329
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:04,737
Because... Because Makoto is...

330
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:06,537
Makoto is?

331
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,837
A very fantastic, kind and good person!

332
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:14,137
That's why!

333
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:21,137
You're not providing him with any evidence.

334
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:24,337
Inspector Yamamura! Take a look at this.

335
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,537
There are burn marks on his left shoulder.

336
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:28,937
It's most likely

337
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:31,937
that the victim was rendered unconscious with a stun gun or something.

338
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:33,037
Stun gun?

339
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:35,537
If the culprit used a stun gun,

340
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:38,137
I don't think this guy is the culprit.

341
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:39,737
Why not?

342
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:42,937
Because all he needed to do was to punch him once in the stomach

343
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:44,637
to knock him out.

344
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:47,837
And besides, if he strikes another punch on the same spot,

345
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:49,837
it would be lethal without leaving new traces.

346
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,637
But what if he deliberately used a stun gun just to deceive everyone?

347
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,637
It's hard to think that this Iron Karate Man

348
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:58,437
would be walking around with a stun gun

349
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,837
to protect himself.

350
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:03,237
Iron Karate Man?

351
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:06,237
He has won many championships at a lot of major tournaments.

352
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:08,637
Right! He has won 400 games and lost none.

353
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:11,437
He's the Prince of Formidable Kick Attacks!

354
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:14,737
Geez. You should've come right out and told me.

355
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,837
Why didn't you tell me so to begin with?

356
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:21,237
You met him during the red handkerchief incident.

357
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:24,537
Yamamura, are you sick or something?

358
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:25,537
Huh?

359
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:28,837
Well, you used to talk in a funny way before,

360
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:31,337
but now...

361
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,337
I used to talk like that

362
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:35,437
just to get everyone off their guard.

363
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:36,937
Now that I've become an inspector,

364
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:41,237
I don't have to use childish talk like that anymore.

365
00:19:43,237 --> 00:19:44,437
Is that so?

366
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:48,137
Then, if you were in this parking lot the whole time,

367
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,637
didn't you see any suspicious people?

368
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:52,637
No. I was sleeping like a log.

369
00:19:52,637 --> 00:19:55,837
I see. Sleeping like a log...

370
00:19:57,837 --> 00:19:59,237
Stop!

371
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:01,237
Wait for me!

372
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,137
That was close.

373
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:09,237
This place is a bit tilted, it seems.

374
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:12,137
Yes, it seems that the land is a bit tilted

375
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:14,437
due to ground sinkage.

376
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:18,137
They said they'll begin the repair work from next month.

377
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:19,837
I see.

378
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:21,837
Ground sinkage...

379
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:25,037
Wait a second. If so,

380
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:29,337
the slanted mud marks found on this wall...

381
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:31,037
Don't tell me...

382
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:37,137
-It's raining. -Oh, no. It started raining again.

383
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:39,937
Let's take shelter in the bowling alley for now.

384
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:42,337
Let's continue talking there.

385
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:52,637
What's up, Conan?

386
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:54,837
You'd better hurry and go, too.

387
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,437
Well...

388
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:58,637
That ventilation hole of the toilet over there.

389
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:00,637
-Doesn't it seem strange? -What?

390
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:02,937
It's the only spot where the water doesn't drip over,

391
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:05,137
but leaves behind droplets instead.

392
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:10,237
It's a bit sticky.

393
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:13,637
Maybe something was pasted on there?

394
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:15,537
Hey, you two.

395
00:21:15,537 --> 00:21:17,537
You two should hurry and go inside, too.

396
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,137
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir.

397
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:29,137
There are water droplets likewise, around the edges of door, too.

398
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:32,537
It's as if somebody sealed the place off with masking tape.

399
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:36,237
He didn't suffocate, but drowned to death, right?

400
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:37,537
Yeah.

401
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:40,337
Besides, there are no similar water droplets

402
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:43,037
around the ventilation hole at the bottom of the door.

403
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:46,137
Even if the door were to be sealed, this would do no good.

404
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:47,837
True.

405
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:49,437
Besides that,

406
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:52,937
wasn't there some kind of smell when we first got here?

407
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,337
Yeah.

408
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,837
-The smell of kerosene! -The smell of kerosene!

409
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:57,837
You two!

410
00:21:57,837 --> 00:22:00,437
Didn't you hear what I told you a while ago?

411
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:01,537
Yes, we did.

412
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,637
We'll get going right now!

413
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,337
There's a burn mark on the ceiling?

414
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:51,437
That's why I'm telling you to hurry

415
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:54,337
and ask around the pubs in this vicinity.

416
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:55,937
Makoto!

417
00:23:55,937 --> 00:23:58,037
-Let him be! -Huh?

418
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,637
Hey, tomboy.

419
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:02,837
You help set up the trick.

420
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:06,137
You know how to work this trick too, don't you?

421
00:24:06,137 --> 00:24:11,537
Next Conan, "Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part 2)"

422
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,437
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,437
"Witch"

424
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,337
What's up, Ran? Why are you staring at me?

425
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:37,637
Karate vs. Jeet Kune Do.

426
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:39,737
Ran's on fire.
