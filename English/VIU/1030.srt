1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,269
Now then. I finished my investigative report.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,980
Here in Koneru City...

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,020
Maybe I'll go for a drink this afternoon.

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,939
What happened? Are you all right?

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,670
While I was waiting for the light to change, someone suddenly pushed my back.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,920
I was nearly hit by a car.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,800
Did anyone see the culprit?

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,430
Can you think of any reason someone would want to kill you?

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,430
Does anyone have a grudge against you?

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,840
I can't think of anything.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,060
No, maybe I did something to them during my blank year.

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,600
Blank year?

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,089
Are you Mori Kogoro-san, the great detective?

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,860
Yes.

15
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:01,120
My name is Esaka Ritsuo.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,750
Please find the past that's been erased from my memory.

17
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,060
Find the past?

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,639
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,379
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,809
A whole year lost!

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,659
With his life in danger, he searches for his memories!

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,289
Always determining the one truth

23
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,079
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,910
his name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,510
"The Blank Year, Part One!"

26
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,670
What do you mean, you lost a year's worth of memories?

27
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,720
It happened one evening last week.

28
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,340
Before I knew it, I'd lost consciousness at the station.

29
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,390
Apparently I slipped down the stairs and hit my head.

30
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,110
When I returned to my workplace...

31
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,860
Esaka, what have you been doing until now?

32
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,920
You disappeared for a whole year after going out on a job.

33
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,090
A year?

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,620
That was when I first learned about it.

35
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,789
I thought I'd left that morning and returned that evening,

36
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,630
but an entire year had actually passed.

37
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:12,439
Something must've made him suffer memory loss while he was out on a job.

38
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,150
And one year later, something cured him of his amnesia.

39
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,779
But it was too late.

40
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,579
I was fired a long time ago,

41
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,000
and when I returned to my apartment, someone else was living there.

42
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,410
Like a sad Urashima Taro.

43
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,169
But I can't recall where I was or what I was doing for a whole year.

44
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:45,289
So you regained your previous memories and lost your memory of the past year instead.

45
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,129
Just like in that old movie "Random Harvest".

46
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,440
After thinking about it for a week, I thought these might lead somewhere.

47
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,940
I examined their usage history.

48
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,630
I went all over the place every day, but I always left from and returned to Koneru Station.

49
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,570
Maybe you lived in Koneru City.

50
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,909
I thought so, too, so I was walking around in the hope that I would remember something.

51
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,950
That's when it happened.

52
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,440
Maybe I did something to incur someone's enmity.

53
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,720
But I still want to know how I lived.

54
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,039
It is eerie not to know.

55
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,600
Koneru City, right? Let's talk another look around.

56
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,360
Mori-san...

57
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,490
I, Mori Kogoro, shall find the year that vanished from your memories.

58
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,870
One year is exactly twice as long as this person was missing for.

59
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,120
Oh, right. This guy suddenly disappeared, too.

60
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,130
He was found dead in the mountains of Wakabadai three days ago.

61
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,739
He was partially skeletonized, but he'd clearly been murdered.

62
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,389
It didn't take long to identify him as Kisugi Akira, who'd been missing for six months.

63
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,709
Apparently they're having trouble finding the culprit who killed and buried him.

64
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,190
He was a con artist, and a lot of people had grudges against him.

65
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,780
Sounds like he was a bad person.

66
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,280
Well, not that he matters.

67
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,290
Koneru Station

68
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,170
I can't remember anything, no matter what I look at.

69
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:53,050
But if we find someone who knows you, we can ask them about your blank year, right?

70
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,039
That's true.

71
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,810
If you showed up in this neighborhood with memory loss,

72
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,560
then maybe you visited that police box.

73
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,790
Is that your police box?

74
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,950
Yes. What about it?

75
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,110
I believe this man visited you about a year ago.

76
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,149
I don't recognize him.

77
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,960
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

78
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,220
We'll have to search on foot then.

79
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,890
Even though we split up and asked around, we came up empty-handed.

80
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:43,730
There is a way to figure out what happened during your blank year besides finding someone who knows.

81
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,520
How?

82
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,289
What was that for?

83
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,160
It's shock treatment. You remember now, right?

84
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,660
We could try slapping you really hard, too.

85
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,800
He seems like he'd actually do it.

86
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,909
I know I'm the one who asked for your help, but you've done enough.

87
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,680
Let's go, Mori-san.

88
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,840
You're giving up?

89
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm afraid to know after all.

90
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,279
If someone tried to kill me, I must've done something really awful.

91
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,780
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

92
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,780
It's hard to believe he's someone who'd make enemies.

93
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,160
That's why we need to find your past, Esaka-kun.

94
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,440
If someone has a grudge against you because of a misunderstanding, you need to clear it up.

95
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,920
Maybe it's not a misunderstanding! I'm scared!

96
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,150
Esaka-san!

97
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,860
It's that patrol officer from earlier.

98
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,740
Mister, look.

99
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,490
A burglar?

100
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,250
How brazen of him to disguise himself as a police officer.

101
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,370
There was no point in asking him since he was a fake officer.

102
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,730
You're right. All right, let's go.

103
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,589
I-I said forget it!

104
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,550
No!

105
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,270
Yeah, I remember him.

106
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,140
He visited you a year ago?

107
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,449
Apparently he was bewildered and suffering from memory loss

108
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,150
according to the person who brought him here.

109
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,079
Maybe he was robbed,

110
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,059
but he didn't have any identification on him or even a phone.

111
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,160
I checked the missing persons reports, too.

112
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,219
But you didn't find him.

113
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,170
After all, more than 80,000 people go missing a year.

114
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,670
What happened to Esaka-san after that?

115
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,630
The person who brought him here, Kinbara Takuzo-san, said he'd take care of him.

116
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,459
If we can find that person, we'll know what happened during your blank year.

117
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,430
And probably whoever holds a grudge against you over a misunderstanding.

118
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,610
I'm afraid of a possible misunderstanding,

119
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,010
but if Kinbara-san took care of me, then I need to thank him.

120
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,450
This is the place.

121
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:44,950
Yes?

122
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,059
I'm Mori, a detective.

123
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,460
I see. One moment, please.

124
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,090
Taro-kun?

125
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,720
Looks like this guy is Kinbara-san.

126
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,880
But didn't he just call him Taro-kun?

127
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,720
Thank you for waiting.

128
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,230
Taro-kun?

129
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,209
Where have you been this past week?

130
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,230
Taro? My name is Esaka Ritsuo.

131
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,420
Could it be?

132
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,240
Your amnesia's been cured?

133
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:30,620
Since not having a name for you was inconvenient, they must've temporarily named you Taro-san.

134
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,660
Yeah, Koneru Taro-kun.

135
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,250
That's right.

136
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,890
I'm sorry, but I have no memory at all

137
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,140
of being called that or you taking care of me.

138
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,150
What?

139
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,400
I see. I understand.

140
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,900
Your amnesia's been cured, and instead...

141
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,089
You lost your memories of the past year.

142
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,910
We came because we wanted to know how Esaka-kun spent that year.

143
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,190
So that's how it is. In that case, let's invite them over, too.

144
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,600
I'm sure they'll come running.

145
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,209
A-Are they angry?

146
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,789
Then there's no mistaking it.

147
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,690
I must've done something to incur their enmity!

148
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,450
Does everyone here have a grudge against Esaka-kun?

149
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
How dare you suddenly vanish like that.

150
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,880
We've been worried about you this past week.

151
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,630
Worried?

152
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,260
But I'm glad you're all right.

153
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,770
And that you remembered who you are and where you're from.

154
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,400
It's a little sad that you don't remember us, though.

155
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,819
Let me reintroduce you. This is Hida Keisuke-kun, the construction company president.

157
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,409
Welcome back, Taro-kun.

158
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,019
Mizutani Toko-san from the Koneru Credit Union.

159
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,410
I'm glad to be able to talk to you again.

160
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,169
Cram school student Chimura Mamoru-kun.

161
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,670
It's kind of embarrassing to be formally reintroduced.

162
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,019
These three from the neighborhood took pity on you and your memory loss,

163
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,429
so they helped out here and there.

164
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,180
They kept encouraging and supporting you.

165
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,679
You did more than any of us, Kinbara-san.

166
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,149
You looked after him since you consider yourself the steward of the neighborhood.

167
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,190
All I did was ask my dad for a little favor.

168
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,599
Mamoru-kun's father let you live in an apartment he owns,

169
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,440
and you worked at Hida-kun's construction company.

170
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,320
At construction sites all around the city.

171
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,200
So that's why you went all kinds of places every day.

172
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,960
Toko-san frequently brought you meals when she cooked.

173
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,960
It's embarrassing. I'm not much of a cook.

174
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,630
So Esaka-san owes these people a great deal, too.

175
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,139
Sounds like you were living with support

176
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,730
from the goodwill of the kind-hearted Kinbaras and these three.

177
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,560
Yeah.

178
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,460
Thank you for the past year.

179
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,630
I'm so glad you're doing well.

180
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,110
I don't know how to thank you.

181
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,579
We've learned how you spent the past year,

182
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,010
but one question remains.

183
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,270
This afternoon, Esaka-kun was nearly killed by someone here in Koneru City.

184
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,400
Did anyone have a grudge against me?

185
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,280
Of course not.

186
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,030
People loved you. You did nothing to make people hate you.

187
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,370
That's right. You're overthinking it, Taro-san.

188
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,410
Then it really must be a misunderstanding.

189
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,699
That's inconceivable, too.

190
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,649
You're probably imagining that someone tried to kill you.

191
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,070
I can only assume that's the case.

192
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,819
But...

193
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,150
Maybe it was just my imagination.

194
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,930
If the people close to you say so, then maybe nobody has a grudge against you.

195
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,489
Maybe you weren't pushed.

196
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,090
Maybe someone just happened to bump into you.

197
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,110
That's right! More importantly, we need to celebrate.

198
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,610
After all, you're doing well.

199
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,120
And you've recovered from your amnesia.

200
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,540
Do you drink?

201
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,410
I enjoy a bit now and then.

202
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,120
Oh, you enjoy it endlessly.

203
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,680
We don't have to wait for Kinbara-san's wife?

204
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,979
Tae-san's frail. She's always in and out of bed.

205
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,690
I made someone like that worry this past week?

206
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,690
If only I'd visited sooner.

207
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,409
Aren't you glad you didn't run away earlier?

208
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,190
You tried to run?

209
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,110
Mori-san!

210
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,869
No, Shi-chan! No!

211
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,620
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,000
Come on.

213
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,550
I don't like dogs.

214
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,380
Especially not barking dogs like Shishimaru.

215
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,409
A stray bit me on the butt when I was in kindergarten.

216
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,770
Since then, I've been afraid of dogs.

217
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,019
Shishimaru?

218
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,400
You remembered Amano-san's dog Shishimaru?

219
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,660
You may not like dogs, but one helped you remember something.

220
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,160
See? Shock therapy is effective.

221
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,530
The memories that had been completely closed off to me are returning.

222
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,420
Yakitori Izakaya

223
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,529
It's no use.

224
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,940
I thought I'd be able to remember something besides the dog's name, but I can't.

225
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,690
It's all right. You don't have to try so hard. Right?

226
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,440
Yeah.

227
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,570
We called your phone a bunch of times, but no one answered.

228
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,079
I think I lost it when I fell down the station stairs.

229
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,160
Mister, you lose your phone all the time when you get drunk.

230
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,850
It's rumbling out there. It'll probably strike again.

231
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,569
Thunder...

232
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,159
You don't like thunder either?

233
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,989
It's not that.

234
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,840
I felt like I remembered a scene of particular interest to me.

235
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,769
I wonder what it was. Thunder... dogs...

236
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,989
Dogs have something to do with it, too?

237
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,860
Then that's not a memory, it's a desire.

238
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,750
You wish dogs would be struck by lightning and burnt to a crisp.

239
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,129
How cruel, Mori-san. How could you wish for dogs to be struck by lightning?

240
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,179
Oh, no. I was just speaking for Esaka-kun.

241
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,180
Not even I'd wish for that.

242
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,279
I'm going to pop home for a minute.

243
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,560
I'm worried if she's remembered to take her medicine.

244
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,689
Kinbara-san really loves his wife.

245
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,690
I see.

246
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,739
It looks like rain.

247
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,920
There's that, too, so I thought I'd go get umbrellas for everyone.

248
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,589
He really is a nice person.

249
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,870
That's why he took care of you when you were at a loss.

250
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,880
Not just Kinbara-san. All of you, too.

251
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,380
I wish I could remember.

252
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,189
You will eventually.

253
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,140
Something will make you remember.

254
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,170
They're right.

255
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,060
I'm sure something will make me remember.

256
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,949
Three days ago, Kisugi Akira-san was found dead

257
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,499
in the mountains near Wakabadai outside the city.

258
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,379
According to those with connections at the investigation HQ,

259
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,649
they've determined that he was killed and buried six months earlier on June 10th.

260
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,170
Police are currently working on identifying the culprit.

261
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,179
It didn't bother me until now,

262
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,310
so why am I so interested in it?

263
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,159
But I feel like they're connected somehow.

264
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,000
Thunder... dogs...

265
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,235
Two Days Later

266
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,999
It's been two days.

267
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,799
Maybe he's been able to remember something.

268
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,200
Should we try shock therapy again if he hasn't?

269
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,360
That's one way to do it.

270
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,999
Didn't he say it's up ahead?

271
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,810
Huh?

272
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,810
Inspector!

273
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,440
Mori-san.

274
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,000
You again?

275
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,610
I know someone who lives at this apartment.

276
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,490
What happened?

277
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,490
C-Could it be?

278
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,990
Esaka-san?

279
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,669
Then your acquaintance must be...

280
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,750
The autopsy revealed that he died last night around 7PM after consuming a poison.

281
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,800
Judging by the circumstances, it was almost certainly a suicide.

282
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,760
Suicide?

283
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,010
Apparently he regretted some bad choices he made.

284
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,520
So he killed himself?

285
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,940
Really? Was this really a suicide?

286
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:50,450
What we believe is a suicide note was left on that computer.

287
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,529
You said it was locked.

288
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,109
Was the door chain on the front door locked, too?

289
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,619
No, the chain wasn't locked,

290
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,170
but both keys were here.

291
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,460
One in the back of the desk drawer, and one in that jacket pocket.

292
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,960
Hey, listen.

293
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,740
The next episode of Conan is "The Blank Year, Part Two!"
