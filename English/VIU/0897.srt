1
00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:10,193
General, the tiger is afraid of me and won't come out!

2
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:14,993
Every night this tiger leaves its screen and causes trouble!

3
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:17,593
If you insist that I capture it,

4
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:20,593
then you must drive it out of the screen!

5
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:22,394
Then I, Ikkyu...

6
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:28,094
shall tie him up for you!

7
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:31,593
While preparing for the school play,

8
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:35,494
Ms. Wakasa accidentally ruined the tiger screen.

9
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:40,693
The Youth Detective Squad went to Ms. Wakasa's apartment

10
00:00:40,694 --> 00:00:43,094
to help her repaint a new screen.

11
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:47,693
After finishing the screen, while eating dinner,

12
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:51,094
we heard loud music coming from the neighbouring apartment.

13
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:54,593
Since the music wouldn't stop,

14
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:57,994
Genta went to her neighbour's apartment to complain.

15
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,994
It finally stopped.

16
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:07,194
What's wrong, Genta?

17
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:21,193
The unconscious man was professional golfer, Teigo Banno.

18
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:24,393
The murdered woman was Mr. Banno's girlfriend

19
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:26,993
and model, Kurumi Iiyama.

20
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:31,993
The words "I love you" were written on Mr. Banno's right cheek in red.

21
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:34,693
At the crime scene were polaroids of

22
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,993
what appeared to be a white woman's hand

23
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:39,994
writing the words on his face.

24
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:47,294
Mr. Banno claimed the woman with white hands murdered Kurumi, but...

25
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:50,894
What is this smell?

26
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:55,493
It's coming from Kojima's right hand.

27
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:56,893
What? Me?

28
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:59,094
But I'm not wearing any makeup.

29
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,093
I knew it.

30
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:04,893
Knew what?

31
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:07,793
Didn't I say I'm not wearing makeup?

32
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,393
No, I'm talking about the perp.

33
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:12,493
What? The perp?

34
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:16,193
Conan, have you already figured out who the perp is?

35
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:20,594
The person who killed the model, Kurumi Iiyama, is...

36
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:26,993
the professional golfer, Teigo Banno, after all.

37
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:29,594
-What? -What?

38
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:32,793
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

39
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:34,893
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

40
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:37,393
The boyfriend who appears to be a victim did it?

41
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:39,793
Expose the secret of the realistic-looking photo!

42
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,393
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,493
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:45,794
His name is Detective Conan!

45
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:31,294
The Woman with White Hands (Part 2)

46
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:36,293
But like he said,

47
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:41,993
his right hand was behind his head in the polaroid.

48
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:44,093
It's hard to imagine

49
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:47,793
someone could write so clearly on their own face.

50
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:49,893
That's the thing.

51
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,993
I haven't solved that yet.

52
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:56,493
Sorry you got caught up in this.

53
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:57,693
It's fine.

54
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:00,093
-It's not your fault. -What's this piece of paper?

55
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:03,893
-But you only came here -A convenience store receipt?

56
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,194
-because I ruined the screen. -It's dated this morning.

57
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:10,793
Come to think of it, Ms. Wakasa.

58
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:11,794
Yes?

59
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:14,493
You were late this morning, which was unusual.

60
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:15,893
I wonder why?

61
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:18,893
Why?

62
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,793
When I checked my fridge as I was leaving this morning,

63
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:24,293
I noticed it was empty.

64
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:27,393
I rushed to the convenience store to buy more groceries.

65
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,393
When I go shopping after school,

66
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:31,793
most things are sold out.

67
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,493
Really?

68
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,694
I see.

69
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:41,793
Oh, don't tell the other teachers.

70
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:43,293
Got it.

71
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:45,293
I hope the rest of you won't tell, either.

72
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:46,493
Understood.

73
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:48,094
You can count on us.

74
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:26,094
Inspector Megure!

75
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:29,893
How'd it go, Takagi?

76
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:35,993
There really was a woman wearing a broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses.

77
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:37,793
I see.

78
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:41,793
Several of the residents saw her.

79
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:44,193
The security camera footage also captured her

80
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:48,193
riding up and down several times.

81
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:50,693
Her face was hidden by her hat, though.

82
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,393
I thought so.

83
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:55,093
-We found the weapon. -What?

84
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:58,893
It was the 5-iron in Mr. Banno's golf bag.

85
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:00,993
The 5-iron?

86
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:04,793
Also, it is belived that the camera inside Ms. Iiyama's bag

87
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:09,093
have been used to take the polaroid

88
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:12,293
and the pen used to write the note.

89
00:07:12,294 --> 00:07:17,193
Unfortunately, the perp's fingerprints weren't on either one of them.

90
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:18,893
I see.

91
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:23,794
Was this really the work of a crazy fan like Mr. Banno claims?

92
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,893
We'll pursue that possibility for now.

93
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:32,293
Takagi, go to Mr. Banno's management agency

94
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:34,693
and check his fan letters

95
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:38,693
for anyone whose handwriting matches the "I love you" note.

96
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:39,894
Yes, sir!

97
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:49,493
Sounds like the police suspect the woman we saw.

98
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:50,793
Yeah.

99
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:54,693
But the killer is that professional golfer, right?

100
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:58,593
Yeah. I could tell the moment I met him.

101
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:01,193
There were two strange things about him.

102
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:04,193
What? Strange things?

103
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:05,993
But I can't figure it out.

104
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:09,094
How did he write on his own face?

105
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,993
What are you doing, Haibara?

106
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:19,693
She's trying to see if she can write on her own face

107
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:22,693
by using her phone like a mirror.

108
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:25,693
There are apps to make your screen reflective.

109
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:29,593
I'm using one of those to write on my cheek.

110
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:31,594
But it's not working.

111
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:35,793
What?

112
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:38,993
Ai, it looks like you have a spiral on your cheek.

113
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:40,094
A spiral?

114
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:48,893
"Permanent Marker" -This is a permanent marker!

115
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,393
Conan.

116
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:54,293
Don't laugh at Haibara so much.

117
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:56,094
Yeah, but...

118
00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:58,493
Oh, my.

119
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:01,494
Looks like Genta got tired and fell asleep.

120
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,293
Wait! Genta, wake up!

121
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:09,094
You're sleeping on the tiger painting!

122
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,794
Sorry.

123
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,993
What are you laughing at?

124
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:20,493
Genta, you look like a tiger.

125
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,993
Your sweat must have dissolved the paint

126
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:25,093
and made it stick to your cheek.

127
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:26,593
This is bad.

128
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:30,293
It's okay. This should be easy enough to fix.

129
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:32,493
Sorry.

130
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:34,993
Geez. It's all over me.

131
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:36,693
Don't touch it.

132
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:38,893
I'll wipe it off for you.

133
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,693
Thanks. It hurts...

134
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:43,793
Aren't you going to erase the spiral on your cheek?

135
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:46,594
I accidentally wrote it with permanent marker!

136
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:52,494
I see. I was overthinking it.

137
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,893
What?

138
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,693
You didn't find anyone with matching handwriting?

139
00:09:58,694 --> 00:10:01,093
Did you check all the fan letters?

140
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:03,693
Yes, about 50 of them.

141
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:06,493
"Fan Letters" -What? Only 50?

142
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:07,494
Yes.

143
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:12,793
Teigo Banno's agency only had this month's fan letters.

144
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:15,593
They apparently disposed of the rest.

145
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:16,893
I see.

146
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:18,193
In any case, find that letter

147
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:20,193
even if it means turning the agency upside down.

148
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:24,493
Mr. Banno's girlfriend, Kurumi Iiyama, was murdered

149
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:26,993
and the words "I love you" were written in red pen

150
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,393
on his right cheek

151
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,693
by this woman with the white hands.

152
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:32,694
Yes, sir!

153
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:35,794
Inspector.

154
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:39,993
I've told you everything I know.

155
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:42,893
Can I go now?

156
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,993
The media seems to have gotten wind of the incident,

157
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:49,493
and have begun gathering around the apartment building.

158
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:52,293
And I'd like to stop by my agency

159
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:54,294
to discuss my next golf tour.

160
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:57,693
You're discussing your golf tour

161
00:10:57,694 --> 00:11:01,293
when your girlfriend has been murdered?

162
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,193
Like that lady teacher said,

163
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:07,893
I invited Kurumi here to break up with her.

164
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:10,693
I'm surprised she was murdered

165
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,793
but since I no longer had feelings for her,

166
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:15,293
I'm not that broken up about it.

167
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:19,393
Anyway, the killer is that woman with the broad-brimmed hat

168
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,393
and sunglasses.

169
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:25,293
It was probably that woman in the photo with white hands.

170
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:27,293
Hurry up and find her.

171
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:28,894
They'll never find her.

172
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:31,793
Conan?

173
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,893
We'll never find her?

174
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,893
What does that mean?

175
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,893
Because that woman...

176
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:40,893
is Mr. Banno.

177
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:41,894
What?

178
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:43,293
What was that?

179
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:46,093
Please, Ms. Wakasa.

180
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:49,093
We need you to wait in your apartment until we contact you.

181
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:51,893
Oh, but...

182
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:56,493
These children claimed to have figured something out.

183
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:57,893
Figured something out?

184
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:59,893
Yeah. It's Genta's hand.

185
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:00,994
It hurts!

186
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:05,493
Try smelling it.

187
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:07,893
Doesn't it smell like something?

188
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,093
You're right. It smells like cosmetics.

189
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,193
That's right.

190
00:12:12,194 --> 00:12:16,193
That's the smell of foundation that women use when doing their makeup.

191
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,993
Foundation?

192
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:20,593
What's that doing on Genta's hand?

193
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:23,293
Remember how we said we came into this apartment

194
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:27,393
and found the body because the music wouldn't stop?

195
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:28,993
It got on Genta's hand

196
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:32,393
when he banged on the door to get inside.

197
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:37,493
And if you're wondering what that was doing on the door,

198
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:41,594
it's because the woman we saw banged on the door, too.

199
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:48,393
Ms. Wakasa, do women put foundation on their hands?

200
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,193
No, not normally.

201
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:54,693
Then maybe the suspicious woman we saw

202
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:58,193
was a dark-skinned man wearing foundation to make himself paler

203
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,193
and pretending to be a woman.

204
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:02,393
I see.

205
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:06,393
But what makes me that man disguised as a woman?

206
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:08,193
I'm just dark-skinned.

207
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:12,693
Because when we first met you,

208
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:15,694
you said two strange things.

209
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,907
What two things?

210
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,608
You still have something on your face.

211
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:35,507
Hey, where is it?

212
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,107
What's on my face?

213
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,108
See?

214
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,907
Normally when someone tells you that you have something on your face,

215
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:44,007
you unconsciously try to touch it.

216
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,807
Isn't that what you did, Genta?

217
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:51,307
Yeah. You'd be curious what color or how much of it was on you.

218
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:54,607
But you didn't.

219
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:58,407
You have something on your right cheek.

220
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:00,807
Something? Like what?

221
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:04,907
So your fingers wouldn't smudge the words you'd written.

222
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,208
I see.

223
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:10,207
So you knew there were words written on your cheek

224
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,807
that would become an important piece of evidence later.

225
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:15,307
No!

226
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:17,007
It's not that I knew.

227
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,807
I just thought so instinctively.

228
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:22,407
Since Kurumi was bleeding on the floor,

229
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:26,007
I thought there might be something bad on me.

230
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:28,107
In that case...

231
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,108
Do you know what this is?

232
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,707
It's the character for love.

233
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,307
What about it?

234
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,607
What? You don't know?

235
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:42,907
One of Ms. Iiyama's fans uploaded the signature

236
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:45,707
"To Yuto Adachi, With love" -they received at one of her events.

237
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:50,207
I traced and enlarged the character for love that she wrote.

238
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,807
When I used my phone as a mirror

239
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,507
to show you the message on your cheek,

240
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,107
remember what you said?

241
00:14:57,108 --> 00:15:00,007
You said it wasn't the dead woman's handwriting,

242
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:02,808
but you don't even know what her real handwriting looks like.

243
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,307
See?

244
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:07,207
It's written in red.

245
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,507
"I love you"

246
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,007
I love you?

247
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:13,207
Did you make the dead woman write that?

248
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,908
No! This isn't Kurumi's handwriting!

249
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,007
Really?

250
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:22,107
This is Kurumi's handwriting?

251
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:24,707
I did think it looked similar.

252
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:30,307
But like I said, the "love" Kurumi wrote

253
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:32,707
and the "love" on my cheek

254
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,507
were written by two different people.

255
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:38,907
It's obvious enough that it's not Kurumi's handwriting.

256
00:15:38,908 --> 00:15:40,407
So you can tell?

257
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:42,507
Yeah, in a single glance.

258
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,708
In that case...

259
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,907
"Love"

260
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,108
Do you know which of these is Kurumi's?

261
00:15:56,008 --> 00:16:01,107
You looked at the mirrored characters reflected on the phone

262
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:04,407
and instantly knew it wasn't Kurumi's handwriting.

263
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,607
Well...

264
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:07,608
But it's hard to tell whose it is when reversed,

265
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:10,907
even if it's familiar.

266
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:13,407
It was just a feeling!

267
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:17,007
I just had a feeling it wasn't hers!

268
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:19,407
Officer, the photo.

269
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:20,408
Here.

270
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:21,408
In any case,

271
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,907
the important thing is this polaroid the killer took!

272
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:25,908
Look!

273
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:28,807
My right hand is behind my head,

274
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:31,807
so the white woman's hand in the front isn't mine.

275
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:35,707
Plus, I couldn't have written so clearly on my own face.

276
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,907
If you think I did it,

277
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:41,207
tell me how I took this photo.

278
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,407
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

279
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,807
You ready?

280
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:48,507
-Yes. Go ahead and fall like Conan told us. -Got it.

281
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,707
Hey, what are you kids doing?

282
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,908
Just watch.

283
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,907
When you frame the scene like this,

284
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:59,507
doesn't Mitsuhiko's left hand look like Genta's right hand?

285
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:02,407
I see...

286
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:04,907
If you hid her fingertips behind your head,

287
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:09,307
your girlfriend's left hand could have looked like your own right hand.

288
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:13,707
But our skin colors and sleeves are different.

289
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,607
That's easy.

290
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:20,407
You can make your girlfriend's skin look darker

291
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:22,407
by using a dark foundation.

292
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,408
For her sleeve,

293
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,207
you could cut the sleeve off another similarly colored shirt

294
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:30,307
and wrap it around her left hand under your head.

295
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:31,907
Then what about this message?

296
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:35,707
Are you saying I wrote this on my own face?

297
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,108
No, you didn't write it.

298
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,407
You pressed it onto your face, right?

299
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,408
Like a stamp.

300
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,807
First you wrote the words "I love you"

301
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:50,107
on a clear plastic file using permanent marker.

302
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:51,907
Then you flipped it over

303
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:55,807
and traced the words with a non-permanent marker.

304
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,207
After killing your girlfriend

305
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,107
and taking a photo of yourself with nothing on your face,

306
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:02,007
you created the stamp.

307
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:05,207
Then you pressed the non-permanent marker side of the file

308
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,308
onto your cheek.

309
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:10,107
See?

310
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:14,107
Now it looks like the words were written on your cheek.

311
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:15,707
I see.

312
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,807
Then you colored your right hand white using foundation,

313
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,207
applied nail polish and a scrunchie,

314
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,608
held the pen and took a picture of yourself,

315
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,707
creating that trick photo.

316
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,207
So is this what happened?

317
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,407
Having decided to murder Kurumi,

318
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,607
you disguised yourself as a woman

319
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:39,007
and lurked around your apartment

320
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:41,407
to give the other residents the impression

321
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:44,207
that there was a suspicious woman stalking you.

322
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,607
When Kurumi arrived,

323
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:49,107
you killed her with your golf club

324
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:52,907
and took the trick photo using the technique Conan just described.

325
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:55,807
Then you played loud music from your stereo

326
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:58,507
so your neighbour, Ms. Wakasa would come

327
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:00,807
and discover the body,

328
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,807
and showed us the trick photo

329
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,208
so we would believe the suspicious woman did all this.

330
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,707
In other words,

331
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:15,907
my initial theory about the imaginary girlfriend

332
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:18,907
was right on the mark?

333
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,207
Ai, you're so cool.

334
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,208
If only you didn't have that spiral on your cheek.

335
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:27,007
What about proof?

336
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:30,307
The proof's probably in that bag

337
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:32,407
you're trying to take out of the apartment.

338
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:37,507
The clear file, foundation, scrunchy,

339
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:41,107
and sleeve you put on Kurumi's left hand.

340
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:44,107
You wouldn't want anyone to see you leaving the apartment with those

341
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:46,708
so you could throw them away.

342
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,308
Shall I take a look inside your bag?

343
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,007
It was Kurumi's fault.

344
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:05,307
I wanted to go on my international tour with a blank slate.

345
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:08,907
But she demanded 100 million yen for breaking up with her!

346
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:14,307
I doubt your international tour would've gone well anyway.

347
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:15,707
What?

348
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,907
You probably lost the favor of the God of Golf

349
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:23,307
the moment you used a club as a weapon.

350
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:25,407
What was that, you brat?

351
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:26,408
Move!

352
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,107
Stop!

353
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,308
Watch out!

354
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,408
You...

355
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,607
Ms. Wakasa!

356
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:40,207
It hurts...

357
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,907
Are you okay?

358
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,908
Yes. He pushed me and I fell.

359
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,407
Is it true that there was a murder

360
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:57,807
in the home of professional golfer, Teigo Banno?

361
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,507
Who died?

362
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,907
Do you have a suspect?

363
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:02,207
Hold on!

364
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,607
Wait for our announcement for the details.

365
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,907
This guy did it.

366
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:09,207
-What? -Mr. Banno did it?

367
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,107
So you were just subduing him?

368
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:15,407
No, I just fell because he pushed me.

369
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,807
No, stop!

370
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,107
Could we get your name?

371
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:19,407
Oh, actually...

372
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,607
Hey!

373
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:21,907
She's Teitan Elementary School

374
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:24,007
Class 1-B's assistant homeroom teacher.

375
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:26,008
Ms. Rumi Wakasa.

376
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,208
This is hopeless.

377
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:37,608
I don't know whether she's clumsy or lucky.

378
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:18,308
"Grade School Teacher Saves the Day, Rumi Wakasa!"

379
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:25,108
Grade school teacher saves the day, Rumi Wakasa.

380
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:39,208
Now that's clever.

381
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:47,408
"Next Episode" -Why are we having cake first thing in the morning?

382
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:51,908
It's good!

383
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:58,607
Do you not care if you never get to eat Amuro's cake again?

384
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:01,908
That can't happen! We have to catch the perp!

385
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,208
Okay.

386
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:13,108
Next Conan, "The Melting Cake!"
