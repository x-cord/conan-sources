"Full Time Result"

3
00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:05,547
They are taking it in right from the start.

4
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:06,647
They are.

5
00:00:06,648 --> 00:00:11,847
Eventually the Japanese will understand what gambling is all about.

6
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:14,147
It is 8 by 2 now.

7
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:17,147
Should we proceed with buying?

8
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:18,747
Don't worry.

9
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:20,448
It is taken care of.

10
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:24,847
When the countdown reaches zero,

11
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:27,248
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

12
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:31,347
Though it started with some ominous English,

13
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:33,347
today's episode is set in a soccer stadium!

14
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:34,947
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:36,647
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:39,048
His name is Detective Conan!

"The J League's Bodyguard"

18
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,439
Japan's performance at the World Cup was disappointing,

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,439
but tonight's key match will determine

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,039
the latter half of the J League season.

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,139
"Yasuaki Iwasada (40)" -Indeed.

22
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,039
"J League Employee" -The fans must know this,

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,539
as tickets are sold out.

24
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,639
The merchandise sales are also up by 30 percent.

25
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,139
Is that what's important to you?

26
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,839
Is 30 percent not enough?

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,339
It's not about the numbers.

28
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,139
Then there's tonight's match.

29
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,939
If the Spirits win,

30
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,339
given the remaining schedule...

31
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,739
That doesn't interest you?

32
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,939
What?

33
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,739
Nothing.

34
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,839
In any case, don't disappoint our fans.

35
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,639
Yes, sir. You can count on me.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,839
"Toto Stadium"

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,939
Normally, only the team and their staff

38
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,039
use this entrance.

39
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,739
Only players and coaches can enter

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,939
the locker rooms down this hallway.

41
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,139
"Gamba Osaka" -Those doors are open right now,

42
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,739
but when the teams are inside, they're closed.

43
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,339
After that, they're not opened again

44
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,239
until the game's over.

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,439
In other words, no matter how close you are to your opponents,

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,440
you can't even talk to them.

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,839
What? Naturally, you can't use phones either.

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,339
I wasn't going to ask that.

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,439
Ai, you've been talking so much.

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,939
Is something up?

51
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,739
She's just overflowing with excitement

52
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,739
because we're at the stadium.

53
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,839
I'm the star here.

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,039
I just let you kids tag along with me.

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,739
You got that?

56
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,239
I'm surprised.

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,739
With a girl who knows so much about the stadium in your group,

58
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,739
you don't need me.

59
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,439
If it's something you like, you'll do well at it.

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,839
Something we like?

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,239
Since Big Osaka will be playing tonight,

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Mr. Higo...

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,639
Sorry.

64
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,239
Should we check out the locker rooms while we can?

65
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,839
What? Really?

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,139
Aren't the rules strict?

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,939
Yeah, but the teams haven't entered yet.

68
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,339
Now's our only chance.

69
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,739
-Let's go! -You'd better be grateful, kids.

70
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,639
Who do you have to thank for this valuable experience?

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,939
Me?

72
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,039
The old man's bragging

73
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,739
because the game between Tokyo Spirits and Gamba Osaka

74
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,639
will be played here at Toto Stadium tonight,

75
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,039
and he's been given the honor of opening the game.

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,240
He's truly a great detective.

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,539
-It's so fancy! -It's wonderful!

78
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,839
Is this the locker room?

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,139
This is the lounge.

80
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,039
The players relax here before the game.

81
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,640
The locker room is back here.

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,839
We can't sit in these, can we?

83
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,439
You totally can.

84
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,739
-We can? -Really?

85
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,939
-Me, too! -Don't get it dirty.

86
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,339
I feel like a player after a match.

87
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,839
I bet sitting on this makes you better at soccer.

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,439
I know.

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,439
There's no way it does.

90
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,539
I found it!

91
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,739
Hide's autograph!

92
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,739
How can you tell?

93
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,239
The number 11's written next to it.

94
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,539
So that's how.

95
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,539
The Spirits' number 11 player

96
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,139
-is Hideo Akagi. -Yeah.

97
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,539
Miss, are you a fan of Hide?

98
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,539
Yeah. I heard Hide's coming back today.

99
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,739
He's been taking time off due to an injury.

100
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,439
I brought him a special sports drink.

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,039
Really? Special?

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,239
Don't do it.

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
"Yuichi Tonozuka (45), Tokyo Spirits Roupeiro"

104
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,539
Accepting gifts of food or drink before a match

105
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,639
will get you a yellow card, miss.

106
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,639
Mr. Tonozuka, it's okay.

107
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,539
I'll explain it to her.

108
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,339
You'd better be.

109
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,239
See you later.

110
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,739
-What a creep. -I agree.

111
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,539
A yellow card?

112
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,639
Did I do something bad?

113
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,839
Sorry, sorry. It's not like that.

114
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,339
I know you brought him a special drink,

115
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,139
but he can't drink it right now.

116
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,439
But he has an important match coming up.

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,039
It'll make him feel better.

118
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,739
Yeah, you're right.

119
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,039
She's going to cry. She's about to cry.

120
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,739
What if he's accused of doping?

121
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,339
He'll be out for longer than he was for his injury.

122
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,639
He won't be able to play again.

123
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,639
-Doping? -But it only contains honey and...

124
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,739
It's not like that.

125
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,639
Nobody would suspect you.

126
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,139
It's just a rule to follow before games,

127
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,239
especially in professional sports.

128
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,639
You wouldn't want anyone to suspect Hide of doping, would you?

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,939
-Do you think I'm up to something? -What makes you say that?

130
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,639
Sorry. These kids don't get it.

131
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,139
You're right.

132
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,139
Do you want to see the doping control room

133
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,439
next to the infirmary later?

134
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,439
They'll be testing a few players after today's match, too.

135
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,039
"Too"? You mean they do it every time?

136
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,939
It's not only done after big matches?

137
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,739
Why does everyone suspect the players of doping?

138
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,339
We do it because we don't.

139
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,439
We trust the players.

140
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,339
Isn't it amazing that not a single player's

141
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,639
been disqualified from the J League for doping?

142
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,039
Yeah.

143
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,239
I guess I'll be taking this home, then.

144
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,439
No, no.

145
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,839
You can't give it to him now,

146
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,639
but you can later.

147
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,339
-Really? -Trust me.

148
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,739
That's great.

149
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,439
Now he won't get an upset stomach during the game.

150
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,039
What does that mean?

151
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,539
What else did you put in there besides honey?

152
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,139
-She mentioned green juice. -Doesn't the stadium

153
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,739
keep an official sports drink?

154
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,839
-Ya. -Official?

155
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,339
They're that strict about it?

156
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,239
The packaging is only sold at the stadium.

157
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,039
Since the bottles are sealed,

158
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,039
you don't have to worry about their contents.

159
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,339
They're often placed by the goal posts.

160
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,239
You sure do know a lot.

161
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,939
Do you even need me to show you around?

162
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,139
She's special.

163
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,539
Let's go buy some!

164
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,939
I'll buy him some, too!

165
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,139
I thought we'd head to the locker room now.

166
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,339
What do you want to do?

167
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,739
What do we want to do?

168
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,239
What does that mean?

169
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,039
The team's bus will be arriving soon,

170
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,339
so now's our only chance.

171
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,939
No one told us that.

172
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,539
Why would we need to discuss it with you kids?

173
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,539
We won't be able to stay

174
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,839
once the players arrive.

175
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,139
We're going to check it out.

176
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,240
You guys do what you want.

177
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
-We'd like to go! -Wait!

178
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,139
I can't take you into a locker room

179
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,239
when players are present.

180
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,139
They'll be going over their formations before the match.

181
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,939
You kids really do know a lot.

182
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,039
"Dressing Room for Tokyo Spirits" -I'm disappointed.

183
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,539
I wanted to give the coach my strategy.

184
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,739
"Players Room" -The coach?

185
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,639
-What are you talking about? -They'd definitely win.

186
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,039
Maedono will be changing his compression shirt at halftime.

187
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,239
Put his on top.

188
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,139
Yes, sir. I know.

189
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,939
"I know"?

190
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,239
Didn't you mean, "I understand, sir?"

191
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,039
"Risa Miyamoto (22), Tokyo Spirits Roupeiro" -Sorry.

192
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,539
I'll put Mr. Maedono's compression shirt

193
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,739
on top of his uniform.

194
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,939
If you don't say it out loud,

195
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,539
I won't be sure if you've actually done it.

196
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,939
Sorry to bother you, sir.

197
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,439
We won't touch anything.

198
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,539
Just let me show them around.

199
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,139
And check the drinks again.

200
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,739
Yes, sir. I'll go check the drinks.

201
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,139
Keep an eye out for any unfamiliar squeeze bottles.

202
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,039
Squeeze bottles?

203
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,939
He really is a creep.

204
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,240
I couldn't agree more.

205
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,239
I see. That happened?

206
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,939
Don't be mad, though.

207
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,939
He's prouder than anyone of being a roupeiro.

208
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,539
Popero? Is that a tasty food?

209
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,239
Roupeiro. It means equipment manager in Portuguese.

210
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,039
-Equipment manager. -Are you a Poupeiro, too?

211
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,239
It's with an "h" sound.

212
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,839
The players haven't arrived yet,

213
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,939
but all their equipment is here.

214
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,739
-You're right. -I see.

215
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,939
The players don't have to carry anything themselves.

216
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,439
That's not all roupeiros do.

217
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,839
What do you mean?

218
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,939
They maintain every player's spikes, clothes, and drinks.

219
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,839
They even know everyone's favorite candies.

220
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,139
They allow the players to focus on the game free of stress.

221
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,639
Simply put, that's their job.

222
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,739
Right? Right? Isn't she amazing?

223
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,139
You're amazing, big sister!

224
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,639
-You know all of that? -Do you ever get it wrong?

225
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,139
No, no.

226
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,439
Mr. Tonozuka's the one who does that.

227
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,939
I'm still learning.

228
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,039
I'd get in trouble if I called myself a roupeiro.

229
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,839
No way. Mr. Tonozuka said you know more

230
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,239
about the players' preferences than he does now.

231
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,139
You can't be serious.

232
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,939
-He's lying. -That guy complimented someone?

233
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,839
He must be up to something.

234
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,139
You kids are tough.

235
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,939
I'll scold them later.

236
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,440
"J League's 25th Anniversary"

237
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,639
-Hide! -Hide!

238
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,540
-How do you feel about today's match? -Hide, you can do it!

239
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,339
-Mr. Akagi! -Mr. Hide.

240
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,939
Excuse me. Do you have a minute?

241
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,139
What's with the formality?

242
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,739
This little girl has a gift for you.

243
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,339
Have you recovered from your injury?

244
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,739
I mean, of course you have.

245
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,539
I hope this makes you feel better.

246
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,839
I'll be rooting for you!

247
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,939
Thanks.

248
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,139
I couldn't ask for a better gift.

249
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,539
Tonight's game is in the bag now.

250
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,139
Alright, I'd better get going.

251
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,139
Thanks for your support.

252
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,839
Yes, of course.

253
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,539
-Ayumi! -Don't die!

254
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,639
-She's out cold. -We haven't watched the game!

255
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,040
It's not my problem.

256
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,839
I'm starting to get nervous.

257
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,939
It's because I put this on.

258
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,939
Mr. Mouri, you have a great figure.

259
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,939
-It looks great on you. -Is... Is that so?

260
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,339
Big sister, I gave my drink to Hide!

261
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,839
I made an exception.

262
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,439
Then Mr. Akagi will have leftover drinks tonight.

263
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,939
I'm lucky.

264
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,539
If he doesn't need them, I'll drink them.

265
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,940
Why don't you buy one for yourself?

266
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,739
Time to make the shot!

267
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,439
Pops, calm down.

268
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,240
Conan.

269
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,140
Mr. Endo!

270
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,525
I can't get any distance on it.

271
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,825
Maybe I'm practicing the wrong way.

272
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,725
"Yasuhito Endo (38)" -It's amazing that you're even trying

273
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:20,125
"Gamba Osaka" -that shot.

274
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:21,625
-Mr. Mouri. -Yes?

275
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:24,325
Did you call me?

276
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,925
I'm a huge fan of yours.

277
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,225
-Can I shake your hand? -Sure.

278
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:32,125
Since I heard you were opening tonight's match,

279
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,025
I thought I might get to meet you.

280
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:35,625
I feel so lucky.

281
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,225
Don't say that.

282
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:38,525
Did you kids see that?

283
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,525
This is how people who understand true value react.

284
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:42,725
Really?

285
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:44,825
Is Endo in a slump?

286
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:46,625
Mr. Endo's so cool.

287
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:48,125
You're into that?

288
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:51,225
Mr. Mouri, we should get ready for the opening ceremony.

289
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:52,725
Is... Is it time?

290
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:54,125
Good luck.

291
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:55,825
Thanks. Good luck.

292
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:59,525
All right! Time for a hat trick!

293
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,326
How are you going to do that?

294
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:03,625
Thank you for waiting.

295
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:06,725
Today's opening ceremony will be conducted

296
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:11,725
by the great detective, Kogoro Mouri!

297
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:14,125
This isn't good.

298
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:18,525
Tonight's opening ceremony will be a penalty kick.

299
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:22,325
Goalkeeper Masunaga, don't misread the situation.

300
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:24,625
I can't! I can't do it!

301
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:27,225
What is that? It's not funny.

302
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,326
Pops.

303
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:36,025
This is really embarrassing.

304
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:38,026
"Medical Office"

305
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:41,325
You've definitely got diarrhea.

306
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,225
It's easy to tell.

307
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:45,025
I can't move...

308
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:46,925
It's coming again!

309
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,425
I'm going to the bathroom!

310
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,125
What did he have for lunch?

311
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:53,325
Ran's curry rice.

312
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,725
-Didn't you eat that, too? -Yeah.

313
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:57,425
Then maybe you'll get it, too.

314
00:13:57,426 --> 00:13:58,525
I'm fine.

315
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:01,325
Why doesn't this bathroom have any doors?

316
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,525
I should keep my voice down.

317
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:06,025
That's the bathroom for testing doping.

318
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:09,025
Of course there's no door.

319
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,825
But I can't relax here.

320
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:12,225
It's not my problem.

321
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,826
If you want a regular bathroom, go outside.

322
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:22,526
No...

323
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:28,426
-Go... -Do it!

324
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:34,525
This is the drink Pops had.

325
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,025
Should we examine it?

326
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,525
Here?

327
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,326
Who do you think I am?

328
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:02,026
"Information"

329
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:13,526
Why?

330
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:19,625
Goal!

331
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,925
Endo's left foot takes the first point!

332
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:24,325
Yeah.

333
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:26,326
I think that's what happened.

334
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,626
Can I count on you?

335
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:30,926
Thanks.

336
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:36,125
You don't look happy.

337
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:40,025
This was found in a trash can in the kitchen.

338
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,625
They cut beneath the cap

339
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:44,725
and removed the plastic after softening it

340
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:47,326
by submerging it in hot water.

341
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:51,225
I hope they didn't burn themselves.

342
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,125
What did you discover?

343
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:55,725
The water contained

344
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:59,925
rhubarb, aloe, senna, and bisacodyl.

345
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,025
In other words, laxatives.

346
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:06,225
-Just laxatives? -Yeah, just laxatives.

347
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:07,926
It won't kill him.

348
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:10,126
Why?

349
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,125
Maybe they don't like detectives.

350
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:13,225
No way.

351
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,525
Wait, where's the plastic bottle?

352
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,625
-I threw it out. -Seriously?

353
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:18,425
Are you treating this as a case?

354
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,425
But there's a victim.

355
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:22,525
That old man doesn't qualify as a victim.

356
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:25,325
-Isn't that kind of mean? -Not at all.

357
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:27,325
It's almost halftime.

358
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:31,026
The roupeiros will be busy preparing for the second half.

359
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,325
Will the Sleeping Kogoro be making an appearance?

360
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:40,425
He's alone in the VIP room.

361
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:41,525
How is he doing?

362
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:43,425
The medicine they gave him is working.

363
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,426
Everything works on him.

364
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:49,925
I'll tell them once the second half starts.

365
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,725
In a natural and cute manner.

366
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:53,825
The second half is starting.

367
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,525
The Spirits are behind by one point.

368
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:58,626
Will they be able to tie things up and make a comeback?

369
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:05,425
Come in.

370
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:06,725
Excuse me.

371
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,825
Sorry for asking you to come here.

372
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:11,025
It's fine.

373
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:14,325
It's my first time in this room.

374
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,325
Have the others arrived yet?

375
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,625
You're the only one I called here,

376
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:20,825
Ms. Risa Miyamoto.

377
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:22,925
Just me?

378
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:24,725
That was brutal.

379
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,425
You must've seen that opening ceremony.

380
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:30,925
Three days of my practice has gone down the drain.

381
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,525
It was a disaster.

382
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:35,225
Is your stomach feeling better?

383
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:37,925
Is my stomach feeling better?

384
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,925
Since it was so lame,

385
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:43,825
I did my best to pass it off as back pain.

386
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:47,825
But I see now. You knew.

387
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:50,525
-Mr. Mouri, I... -Ms. Risa.

388
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,825
I heard you.

389
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:56,326
"Stop him. Please notice."

390
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,725
While you were checking the drinks in the locker room,

391
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:06,225
you deliberately brought me Akagi's drinks.

392
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:10,125
Couldn't you have left it

393
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:11,925
at Akagi's locker?

394
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,325
If I hadn't drank it,

395
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,126
were you going to put it back?

396
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,125
It was a gamble.

397
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:22,325
I bet my life and my fate on you,

398
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:25,825
the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

399
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:28,825
I've never gambled before.

400
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:31,025
And I won.

401
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,425
You won?

402
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:34,325
Yes, I won.

403
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:36,525
Are you saying you shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you,

404
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:41,125
even if you know it's the wrong thing to do?

405
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,326
You really are amazing.

406
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,825
It was two years ago.

407
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:50,726
I was studying abroad to become a roupeiro.

408
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:53,925
I made a friend there

409
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,625
who was also an aspiring roupeiro.

410
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,825
We became co-signers for each other's loans.

411
00:18:59,826 --> 00:19:02,525
But your friend disappeared,

412
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:06,825
and you took on the debt.

413
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:08,825
I can only describe you as amazing.

414
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:10,425
When did you look this up?

415
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:12,525
We just met today.

416
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,725
This may come as a shock to you,

417
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:16,425
but your friend

418
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:18,725
and Rodriguez who pretended to be a good person

419
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:22,725
and discussed your loan with you,

420
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:27,525
are both part of the same evil totocalcio organization.

421
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:28,726
But...

422
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,325
Mr. Rodriguez said...

423
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:33,625
Mr. Mouri!

424
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,225
Mr. Tonozuka!

425
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,725
I'm sorry.

426
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,726
I heard everything. I...

427
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:42,225
Please forgive her!

428
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,525
Please don't! This was my...

429
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:45,925
Don't get the wrong idea!

430
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:48,725
I'm not doing this for you!

431
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:53,025
I don't need a roupeiro who causes problems

432
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,325
for the team and players!

433
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:58,325
It's not fair. Gamble, my foot.

434
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:00,925
If Mr. Mouri hadn't noticed...

435
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:02,825
Are you saying it's our fault

436
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,425
because we didn't notice?

437
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:06,425
Shouldn't you have come to me

438
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:08,825
or Iwasada first?

439
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,725
Did you think you could scare us

440
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:13,225
with the trouble you caused?

441
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:14,625
Mr. Mouri!

442
00:20:14,626 --> 00:20:17,325
She said Hide was moving strangely

443
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:18,725
during the first half.

444
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:21,725
She suggested we swap out

445
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:25,125
the spikes on just his right side.

446
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:29,425
She... She's learned so much.

447
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:30,925
What am I talking about?

448
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:33,825
This has nothing to do with you.

449
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:37,725
Basically, what I'm trying to say is...

450
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:42,725
I'm responsible for whatever she's done!

451
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:45,225
So...

452
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:47,625
Please forgive her!

453
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,725
Please!

454
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:50,826
Sir...

455
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:53,626
Great!

456
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:56,326
It's over.

457
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,225
If she'd taken things more seriously,

458
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,325
she could've done things directly!

459
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,425
-She... -Look around

460
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:07,725
and you'll see people committing foul play everywhere.

461
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,525
But here in Japan,

462
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:12,325
we have a thorough early warning system.

463
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:15,625
Match fixing and other evil deeds

464
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,625
haven't occurred once

465
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:20,325
since the J League was formed.

466
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:22,925
That's the noble truth

467
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:25,825
of the J League you loved.

468
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:30,425
Akagi's overtime goal has brought the game to 1 by 1.

469
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:33,126
It's a draw.

470
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,626
Tonight's game ended in a draw.

471
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:40,726
The players...

472
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,926
are returning.

473
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:07,525
I told you. I don't know what you're talking about!

474
00:23:07,526 --> 00:23:09,025
I didn't have diarrhea!

475
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:10,925
I'm hanging up!

476
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:13,825
Who would admit to that? It's embarrassing.

477
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,325
Didn't I tell you?

478
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:19,025
Mr. Mouri said he doesn't know anything about it.

479
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:21,125
There's no victim or physical evidence.

480
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:23,225
Nothing's going to happen to you.

481
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:27,625
Anyway, about that totocalcio organization you mentioned...

482
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:31,225
I can't believe they arrested all of them in a day.

483
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:33,325
Did some busybody

484
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:36,526
put a powerful organization on the job?

485
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:41,326
I have no idea what you're talking about.

486
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:44,525
"Next Episode" -Even in Tokyo,

487
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:46,526
there are places like this.

488
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,325
The air's clear and the view's excellent.

489
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:52,725
What a great place to drink sake.

490
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:54,226
Cheese...

491
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,125
Isn't that because you suggested

492
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:59,926
the three of us go somewhere together?

493
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:02,226
Now, now.

494
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,326
What is that?

00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:08,825
