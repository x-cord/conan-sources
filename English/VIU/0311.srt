1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,985
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:06,885
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:08,485
The contact is a matter of life and death this time.

4
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:11,085
What will Gin and Vodka do?

5
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:12,685
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:14,585
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:16,486
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,870
After getting a clue from Mr. Itakura who had been murdered

9
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:00,770
of how to get in contact with the Black Organization,

10
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:04,371
Dr. Agasa and I came to his villa.

11
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:09,071
While we were there, we get a call from Vodka.

12
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,870
Hey, what's going on?

13
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,070
You're there, aren't you?

14
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,070
I know you're at the villa.

15
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:23,470
Hurry up and answer me,

16
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:25,670
Mr. Itakura.

17
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:26,971
Hey!

18
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,870
Oh, sorry. It's so dark in here

19
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,271
that I was having trouble picking up the phone.

20
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:37,470
I pretended to be Mr. Itakura

21
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:40,170
and talked Vodka into making me promise to meet him

22
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:42,070
at the coin locker located in the basement

23
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:44,071
of the Kenbashi Subway Station.

24
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:49,170
All right, I got them.

25
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:52,170
But on our way there,

26
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,671
Dr. Agasa's car went flat on a mountain path.

27
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:00,170
So, we got a car that was passing through to give us a lift,

28
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:03,471
and was somehow able to make it to Tokyo, but...

29
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,371
Strange.

30
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,171
There's something fishy about them.

31
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:13,871
Don't tell me that...

32
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:18,171
Don't tell me that they're...

33
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:25,771
"Contact with the Black Organization (Desperate Battle Edition)"

34
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,070
We're almost there, you guys.

35
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,271
Your destination, Kenbashi Station.

36
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,770
But isn't that place still under construction?

37
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:39,270
The train won't come even if you go there.

38
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:42,470
We live near the station.

39
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,471
How convenient.

40
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:47,170
I guess so.

41
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,170
Hey, Shinichi, are you really going to go?

42
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,670
Yes.

43
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:56,471
I've come up with something I gotta do before that, though.

44
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,770
I don't know what you're up to,

45
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:04,771
but will you cut out talking secret in my car.

46
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,470
Oh, I'm so sorry.

47
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:10,270
Hey! I told you not to smoke!

48
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,271
Oh, that's right.

49
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:12,870
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:15,570
I'll throw it away right away.

51
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,670
Hey. Don't throw litter out of the window.

52
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,571
Throw it away in the ashtray.

53
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:28,570
You got loose change mixed with cigarette butts and ash.

54
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,370
No matter how rich you are,

55
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,970
you'll be punished for doing something like this.

56
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,171
I guess it can't be helped.

57
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,470
Because these two people

58
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:39,271
are robbers.

59
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:42,471
What?

60
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:52,470
Just what do you mean, Shinichi?

61
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:56,170
This is probably not his car.

62
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,970
They probably abandoned the car

63
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:00,670
they made their getaway with in the mountains,

64
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:03,670
and stole this car from somebody who happen to pass by.

65
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,470
The legal owner of this car probably doesn't smoke,

66
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:10,570
so the owner probably kept his loose change in the ashtray

67
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,971
to pay highway tolls with ease.

68
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:16,870
He put his cigarette butt inside the ashtray without realizing this,

69
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,570
so even after he did,

70
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:21,671
he probably kept using it as an ashtray.

71
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,970
Until they gave us a lift, that is.

72
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,270
No way, sonny.

73
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:28,970
I put the coins in there to spite him

74
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:31,270
because I hate smokers.

75
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,271
There's still other evidence that this car is not his.

76
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:37,770
You drove from where you could

77
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,070
judge your position from the driver's seat

78
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,370
because you're not used to driving cars

79
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:43,070
with steering wheels on the left, right?

80
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:46,070
That's why you were driving near the center line

81
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:48,571
and got honked at a time and again.

82
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:50,670
When you backed the car up,

83
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:54,370
you looked to the left, which is more difficult to see behind,

84
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,770
and that's probably the same reason

85
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:58,071
why you were having trouble shifting gears with your right hand.

86
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,870
Moreover, when turning the curve

87
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:05,071
you turned on the wipers instead of the blinker, right?

88
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:09,370
You forgot that foreign cars with the steering wheel on the left,

89
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:11,370
have blinkers and wipers on the opposite side

90
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,171
as that of Japanese cars.

91
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:16,470
There's still more.

92
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:18,771
When we first got into this car...

93
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:23,570
If you opened the left door, I could've got in right away,

94
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,970
but I was wondering why you let me in

95
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:27,370
from the door on the side of the road.

96
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:29,470
But I figured out why at the checkpoint

97
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:32,071
after what Officer Yamamura said.

98
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:36,570
The seat that you're sitting on right now

99
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:40,070
is stained with the blood of the other robber,

100
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:43,870
the man who was shot in the leg and sitting there till a while ago.

101
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:48,970
And that other man is probably in the trunk.

102
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,370
He's probably hiding there

103
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:53,170
so you could get through the checkpoint.

104
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:56,870
Then why did they give us a lift?

105
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,170
Of course if they were just some ordinary car thieves,

106
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:01,970
they wouldn't have done so.

107
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:06,170
But they did so to help them get through the checkpoint.

108
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:08,270
They can throw the police off guard into thinking

109
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,770
that it's a family trip or something,

110
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:13,170
if a boy and an old man are with them, right?

111
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:17,071
That's how I figured out who they were.

112
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,470
The only people who would give us a lift

113
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:22,970
despite stealing somebody else's car

114
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:26,971
had to be the jewelry shop robbers on the run.

115
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:43,170
Sonny, you're pretty smart, aren't you?

116
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:47,670
I'm not all that sure if being too smart at your age

117
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,571
is all that great.

118
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,271
Shinichi.

119
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,070
Well, now that you know, we've got no choice.

120
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:02,871
We're going to need you to stick around with us a while longer then.

121
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,070
So the problem now is,

122
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,570
where we get rid of this old man and kid?

123
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:20,770
How about Kenbashi Station that's under construction

124
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:23,670
that they wanted to go to?

125
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,870
There's nobody there.

126
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:26,970
Besides, the construction workers

127
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:30,470
won't be coming until after daybreak.

128
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:33,770
By the way, sonny, why didn't you tell the police

129
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:36,270
about us at the checkpoint?

130
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:38,270
You already knew by then

131
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:41,370
that we were the jewelry shop robbers, didn't you?

132
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,971
I didn't want to lose time.

133
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:48,870
If I turned you in to the police at that time,

134
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,270
we would have to go through questioning

135
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:51,770
because we were riding the same car.

136
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:54,370
Then, I would be late for my important appointment.

137
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:57,371
Besides, we could catch you anytime anyway.

138
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,470
Sonny, you sound pretty confident, don't you?

139
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,871
I like people like you.

140
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:06,970
Talk as cheeky as you like while you can.

141
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,870
Even if you cry for help,

142
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:11,171
I'm not going to forgive you. Don't you forget that.

143
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,670
Hey?

144
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,170
He won't be getting up for a while

145
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:21,070
because I fired an anesthetic needle into him.

146
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,970
Anesthetic needle?

147
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,771
Hang on!

148
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,570
You brat, what a thing to do!

149
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:42,970
Cut it out.

150
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:44,970
You may have been able to deceive the jewelry shop

151
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:46,470
with a dingy model gun like that,

152
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,670
but you can't fool me.

153
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,771
What? Who are you, anyway?

154
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:56,170
Conan Edogawa. A detective.

155
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,871
Detective?

156
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:00,971
Oh, right, be careful over there.

157
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:04,070
It's a ball firing belt.

158
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:07,970
Gas is inside a special rubber and it turns into a soccer ball.

159
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:10,970
But this rubber is very elastic.

160
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:13,570
When you move the dial to maximum,

161
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,271
it inflates a large as an advertisement balloon.

162
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,870
I'll be on my way, then.

163
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,270
Dr. Agasa, please call the police and tell them

164
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:29,170
that you caught the jewelry shop robbers.

165
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:33,170
Hey, are you really going to the place of the deal?

166
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:34,770
Don't worry!

167
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,670
Since this is one station away from Kenbashi Station,

168
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,970
even if the police were to come,

169
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,870
they won't call off the deal.

170
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:46,270
No, that's not what I'm worried about.

171
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,471
See you, then!

172
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,470
If something comes up, I'll contact you with the detective badge,

173
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:55,070
so don't come near Kenbashi Station till then!

174
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,971
Hey, Shinichi!

175
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:04,670
It's almost time.

176
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:07,071
Is everyone in position?

177
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:11,371
Okay, don't let one mouse get through.

178
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:29,853
"Coin Locker"

179
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:39,353
Hey, Itakura.

180
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:47,453
Itakura, that rat's not here yet.

181
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:07,153
A check?

182
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:14,653
This is the same amount we paid Itakura.

183
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:22,853
This is the system software that we asked Itakura to make.

184
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:25,352
What an idiot.

185
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:26,952
He gives back the money we paid him,

186
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:29,553
and went chicken leaving just the stuff behind.

187
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:33,953
Okay, I got him!

188
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,452
Yes, it's me.

189
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:40,552
That Itakura should be somewhere nearby.

190
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,153
Go get him and bring him here!

191
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:47,052
What? The only ones who entered the station

192
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:49,252
are a drunkard and a kid?

193
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:51,553
It can't be! Look for him!

194
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:59,352
Just what are you up to?

195
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:00,552
Boss.

196
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,252
Gin.

197
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:05,652
The deal's supposed to be midnight tomorrow.

198
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:09,052
He complained that tomorrow wasn't good for him,

199
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:10,953
so the time was changed.

200
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:14,552
So, you exchanged e-mails with him

201
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:18,052
and he used you to his advantage.

202
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:21,552
No, I'm the one who set the time.

203
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:24,452
He received the e-mail at his villa

204
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:27,652
and said that there was a black-out

205
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,253
so I talked to him directly on the phone.

206
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:35,452
I couldn't get rid of him

207
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:38,352
but got a hold of what we were after.

208
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:40,953
And besides, he's got a pretty bad heart.

209
00:14:42,353 --> 00:14:44,953
He'll croak over soon either way...

210
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:49,253
Why do you think this was stuck on with tape?

211
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:54,052
To get your fingerprints.

212
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,653
You can't take off the tape with gloves on, you see.

213
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:02,052
And...

214
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,152
if the one you're waiting for doesn't show up,

215
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,553
you get irritated and light cigarettes.

216
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:11,052
If the saliva on this is checked,

217
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:15,853
they'd even be able to find out your blood type.

218
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:20,552
Boss.

219
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,652
He's even trying to track down

220
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:25,252
the location of the base of our operations.

221
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:29,052
Look. There's a communicator on the inside of the CD case.

222
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,052
He sure is some sly fox.

223
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:34,852
That Itakura.

224
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:37,053
No, it's not Itakura.

225
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:40,752
In a place where there is a drastic difference in temperature,

226
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:42,652
the sympathetic nerves are stimulated

227
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:45,252
and a great load is placed on the heart.

228
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:46,752
I don't think a guy with heart problems

229
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,452
will go out of his way to a villa

230
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:51,252
in the mountains in the blizzard.

231
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:55,553
Then... then, who was the guy that I talked to on the phone?

232
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,853
Probably some wiz that he hired or something.

233
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:03,553
But he made one mistake.

234
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:06,452
This case.

235
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,552
The fingerprints seem to have been wiped off,

236
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:11,052
but it's still warm.

237
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,752
Which means...

238
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:17,453
Yes. He should still be hiding somewhere nearby.

239
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,153
This is bad.

240
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,852
If things keep up as is, they'll find me.

241
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,452
What now?

242
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,053
What can I do?

243
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:56,552
The only place left is there.

244
00:16:56,553 --> 00:17:00,553
A sly fox is no more than a cornered rat now.

245
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,353
Cut out your blabbering.

246
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,653
Boss.

247
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:38,153
There's nobody here.

248
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:41,553
So, what now?

249
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,753
Boss?

250
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:58,953
Boss?

251
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:12,753
There's no way a grown adult could hide in a place like this.

252
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:17,052
Nevermind.

253
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:18,952
We'll change our appearance and get out of here.

254
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:21,752
He may have called the police.

255
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,252
What?

256
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:27,052
You mean the guy who Itakura hired?

257
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:28,352
Yes.

258
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:32,052
Be careful, there's no next chance.

259
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:36,253
It seems that some rat is snooping around us.

260
00:18:37,553 --> 00:18:40,553
A fox detective.

261
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:46,452
What now? Should I go after them?

262
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:47,852
No, it's too early yet.

263
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:51,352
They may be lying in wait after pretending to leave.

264
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:52,952
But what is it?

265
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:55,653
What are those guys trying to do anyway?

266
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:00,452
Ai said that they made her make queer drugs,

267
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:02,952
but Mr. Itakura is a system engineer.

268
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:06,952
He has nothing to do with drugs.

269
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:10,652
A software that he abandoned making for the sake of mankind.

270
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:14,252
What on earth...

271
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,153
what on earth is it about?

272
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:32,053
Well, good work, Dr. Agasa.

273
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,852
Yes, well, I guess.

274
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:35,853
I'm sure you're tired,

275
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:38,252
but I'm going to have to ask you to come to the station with me

276
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:39,652
for questioning.

277
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:40,653
Yes.

278
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:42,053
Inspector, excuse me.

279
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,552
I'll see you later, then.

280
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:45,852
What is it, Officer Chiba?

281
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:49,053
About the wound of the suspect...

282
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:53,452
Shinichi.

283
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,453
What's going on?

284
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:58,953
Shinichi.

285
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:39,752
Footsteps?

286
00:21:39,753 --> 00:21:42,052
Somebody's...

287
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:44,053
somebody's coming.

288
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:51,752
Darn. My body...

289
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:53,253
It won't move.

290
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,552
Ai?

291
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,852
Just what are you doing in a place like this?

292
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:06,852
What?

293
00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:08,952
What are you doing here yourself?

294
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,752
Both Dr. Agasa and you didn't come back even after morning came,

295
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:15,652
so I used your spare pursuit glasses and came looking for both of you.

296
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:17,852
It... it's morning?

297
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:21,252
Little lady, did you find your friend?

298
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:22,253
Yes.

299
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:24,152
Okay then, you're getting in the way of work

300
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:25,953
so out you go.

301
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:30,153
Hey, wait, Shinichi.

302
00:22:43,953 --> 00:22:45,252
I see.

303
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:48,752
I fainted in there because of lack of oxygen.

304
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:50,752
And?

305
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:53,653
Just what are you doing in a place like this?

306
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:58,653
I didn't get to sleep, so I was sort of taking a snooze.

307
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,052
Do you think that's answering my question?

308
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:05,452
Oh, well, what's the difference?

309
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:07,652
Let's hurry home and get some grub.

310
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,352
I'm starved.

311
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,752
Hey!

312
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:12,452
Where's Dr. Agasa?

313
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:15,752
Dr. Agasa's fine. He's at the police station.

314
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:17,452
Now for the next news.

315
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,052
Yesterday at about 5 pm,

316
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:22,852
the body of a man was found at Hotel New Baker.

317
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:24,952
The body was identified as that of a computer graphic designer,

318
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:28,253
Mr. Taku Itakura, age 45.

319
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,253
Don't tell me...

320
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:39,253
Hey, what's up?

321
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,553
It's nothing.

322
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:01,252
"Next Episode" -While you're at it, that old man

323
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:02,552
is the minister of the left

324
00:24:02,553 --> 00:24:04,752
and belongs on the fourth step to the very right.

325
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:06,452
So don't get it wrong.

326
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:09,552
You know so much despite being a boy.

327
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:10,652
Yes.

328
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:14,352
I helped Ran a lot when I was a kid.

329
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:17,952
It seems that grandma is not the only one who disappeared.

330
00:24:17,953 --> 00:24:21,453
Look, the hanging scroll of the Thunder God is gone, too.

331
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:25,052
