1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:07,114
Sergeant Momosaki Toko, who went to karaoke with Naeko Miike after work,

2
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:09,615
was found dead the next morning.

3
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:13,615
Next to her body was a bent 100 yen coin,

4
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:18,205
and there were traces suggesting that Sergeant Momosaki had been pointing at something.

5
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:25,715
Then, Lieutenant Yagi who was at the karaoke box with Miike and Sergeant Momosaki...

6
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:30,994
I asked one of your colleagues from work.

7
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:33,225
They said you'd be here if you weren't at home.

8
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:37,184
Japan's police truly are exceptional.

9
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:38,564
I knew it!

10
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:40,725
You're the one who killed Toko!

11
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:54,354
And next to her body is a 100 yen coin stuck inside her phone.

12
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,734
Just like the one found next to the body of the officer

13
00:00:56,735 --> 00:01:01,245
discovered in the park this morning, it was deliberately bent.

14
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,975
100 yen coins are engraved with a cherry blossom.

15
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:10,135
It goes without saying that the cherry blossom is the emblem of the Japanese police.

16
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:13,075
Th-Then this is...

17
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:16,425
Yes, without a doubt.

18
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:23,525
This case is a serial murder of female police officers.

19
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:29,865
Furthermore, Lieutenant Miyamoto Yumi, who noticed something about both their bodies...

20
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,934
I know I took the mini patrol car,

21
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,865
but since I'm helping the investigation, go easy on me.

22
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:49,505
Wh-Who's there?!

23
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,755
Oh, just my imagination.

24
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:58,785
Jeez. I'm jumping at shadows.

25
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:06,275
Let's see. This area is...

26
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:15,764
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

27
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:17,664
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

28
00:02:17,665 --> 00:02:19,194
A black shadow closes in on Yumi!

29
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:21,424
How far will the case's darkness spread?

30
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,034
Always determining the one truth

31
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:24,834
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

32
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:27,205
his name is Detective Conan!

33
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:11,235
Target: MPD Transportation Department (Part Three)

34
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:17,914
Well, I just got home.

35
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:20,796
I couldn't have seen any suspicious figures.

36
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:23,895
Then do you know anything about this female police officer?

37
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:26,895
I haven't seen her.

38
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:28,685
I see.

39
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:33,164
Was she pushed from that apartment building?

40
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:36,155
Yes. That's what we believe at this time.

41
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:38,054
How horrifying.

42
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:41,665
And there was that incident just the other day, too.

43
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,384
"That incident?"

44
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:46,335
Did something else happen at that building?

45
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:52,574
Remember the woman who committed suicide by jumping from a nearby building?

46
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:55,834
I heard she was a resident of that building.

47
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,054
Suicide?

48
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,064
Yes.

49
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:02,765
Don't the police know more about it than I do?

50
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:07,894
When no foul play is suspected, the MPD isn't called to investigate the case.

51
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:10,145
The local jurisdiction investigates it instead.

52
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:13,494
When did that suicide occur?

53
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:17,025
I believe it was a week ago.

54
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,905
A week ago?

55
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:22,504
I'm sorry, but could you tell us more about the incident?

56
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,984
Do you know the name of the woman who died?

57
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:27,875
No, I don't know who she was.

58
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,125
What was that?

59
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:33,925
It came from that apartment building.

60
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,854
Sh-She's dead!

61
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:39,174
There's a dead policewoman!

62
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:39,935
What?

63
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,095
Thank you!

64
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:51,605
That mini patrol car... Could it be?

65
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:01,985
Yu...

66
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,335
Yumi?

67
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:11,885
No!

68
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,985
You're kidding.

69
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,315
Yumi...

70
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:26,485
Yumi!

71
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:30,435
Huh?

72
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:36,645
Whoops. I fell asleep.

73
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:38,195
Huh?

74
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,944
Y-Yumi?

75
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,295
Sorry!

76
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:47,304
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

77
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:49,955
Yumi-san asked me for a favor.

78
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:51,835
Yumi-san?

79
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:54,124
What are you doing here?

80
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,354
Oh, good timing.

81
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:57,285
Uh, okay.

82
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,614
Apparently Yumi-san noticed something

83
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:03,345
and asked to lie on the ground in the same position as the body.

84
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:05,595
Come on, please?

85
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:09,814
You don't mind, right? You and I are friends.

86
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:14,645
Yeah, but we're not even that close.

87
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:19,594
Oh, please. That close?

88
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:23,325
You're such a naughty boy, Takagi-kun.

89
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:25,524
I'd better report this to Miwako.

90
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:27,705
No, wait!

91
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:31,274
I forgot the specifics of our conversation,

92
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:34,544
but in any case, it seemed like Yumi-san had an idea,

93
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:39,414
and forensics had finished examining the scene, so I thought it'd be all right.

94
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,804
I didn't think she'd fall asleep.

95
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:43,314
Did we scare you?

96
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:45,485
Yeah, sort of.

97
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:49,164
I was up all night playing mahjong, so I'm so sleepy.

98
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:52,465
Anyway, sorry I forgot to call you.

99
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,025
So, what did you notice?

100
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:04,405
When I saw the photo of Yagi's body you sent me,

101
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:09,585
I realized what was in the direction Yagi forced herself to face.

102
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:14,174
Since we drive past this alleyway on our patrols,

103
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:18,295
anyone from the Transportation Department would know what's there.

104
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:24,924
Yagi faced this direction before she died because she knew that was here.

105
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:27,675
She wanted us to focus on that.

106
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:35,205
A no parking sign?

107
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:37,364
What does it mean?

108
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:41,695
That sign's the only obvious thing in that direction.

109
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:47,614
Sergeant Momosaki, who was killed first, was pointing at a swing set in the park.

110
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,204
What does that have to do with this?

111
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,205
Try to remember, Miwako.

112
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:57,144
What else was in the direction Momosaki pointed besides the swing set?

113
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:57,835
What?

114
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,215
Besides the swing set?

115
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:03,925
What else was there?

116
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:11,175
There was something!

117
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,684
A no parking sign!

118
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:18,124
That's right. Momosaki wasn't pointing at the swing set,

119
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,844
but the no parking sign behind it.

120
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:24,184
Since Yagi knew the same sign happened to be here,

121
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:27,575
she forced herself to face in its direction.

122
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:32,124
Yagi realized what message Momosaki was trying to convey with that sign,

123
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,274
and this happened when she went to confirm it.

124
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:39,125
But she was trying to tell us something until the very end.

125
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:44,304
But that would mean the no parking sign...

126
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:48,774
...is some kind of direct hint to the identity of the suspect.

127
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:52,504
Something that led Lieutenant Yagi here.

128
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:55,975
It must be the three men Yumi-san mentioned.

129
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:59,164
The three traffic violators Sergeant Momosaki

130
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:04,355
and Lieutenant Yagi arrested one week ago.

131
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:08,984
One of them must have parked illegally.

132
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,785
About that...

133
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:17,144
Aono was using his phone while driving and didn't have his license.

134
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:20,795
Akamine was driving a motorcycle against traffic without a helmet.

135
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:25,795
Shiroyama was driving with an expired inspection and wasn't wearing his seat belt.

136
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:29,644
None of them parked illegally.

137
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,805
Then why point at a no parking sign?

138
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:34,253
Who knows?

139
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:38,633
If anything, I guess their names contain the characters

140
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:41,484
for the red, blue, and white used in the sign.

141
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:47,114
But that doesn't tell us which of them did it.

142
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:50,493
Or how Yagi arrived here.

143
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:53,864
None of them have present addresses in this building.

144
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:57,053
Come to think of it, what about the building's security cameras?

145
00:10:57,054 --> 00:11:02,373
Apparently this building doesn't have security cameras installed.

146
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:05,283
The opinions of the residents are divided.

147
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:06,174
Oh, my.

148
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:09,963
And I just received a call from the forensic investigators.

149
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:14,134
They figured out the last number Lieutenant Yagi tried to call.

150
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,733
Well, we may have figured it out,

151
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:21,274
but calling the number 7155 didn't connect us to anyone.

152
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:27,774
Perhaps her mind was hazy since she was on the brink of death.

153
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:31,784
No, she wasn't trying to call that number.

154
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:36,573
She pressed the call button because she wanted to preserve the number 7155.

155
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:39,914
That way it would be left in the phone's records even if the suspect broke her phone.

156
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:45,483
7155... Seven thousand one hundred fifty-five?

157
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:47,303
Seven-one-five-five...

158
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,674
It doesn't seem to be a play on words.

159
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:53,883
Maybe it's the request number for a song.

160
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:58,173
They went to karaoke just before they met the suspect.

161
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:01,264
Didn't Miike go with them?

162
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:03,814
M-Miike?

163
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:07,133
Could you call her and check?

164
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:12,984
Yeah, but she seems like her memory would be worse than a cat's.

165
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:15,583
A cat? Mike (calico)?

166
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:16,864
Oh, it's just a nickname.

167
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,483
Cats have bad memories?

168
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,614
What? Isn't that what they say?

169
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:23,624
No, no.

170
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,673
Why am I thinking about that now?

171
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:29,384
Oh, right. Takagi-kun.

172
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:31,823
It's still unclear how it's connected,

173
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:35,643
but a week ago, one of this building's residents committed suicide.

174
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:40,394
Really? Sounds like we should ask the local jurisdiction about that.

175
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:45,954
That girl in the Transportation Department might look like my first love, but...

176
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:51,134
She's someone else.

177
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:55,594
I can't keep holding onto that forever.

178
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:04,544
Miyamoto-san Incoming Call Reject Answer

179
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:07,294
Miike here.

180
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:10,543
What? 7155?

181
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:12,934
A karaoke request number?

182
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:19,393
I don't remember every song everyone sang.

183
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:22,153
You've got the brain of a cat after all.

184
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:24,703
What? What does that mean?

185
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:28,314
You know, like how people say cats have small brains.

186
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:30,814
It's not brains, it's foreheads.

187
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:36,074
A person might say their yard is the size of a cat's forehead to mean it's really small.

188
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:40,454
And these days, you don't enter numbers to request songs at karaoke places.

189
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:42,353
What? Seriously?

190
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,264
Some of them even use phone apps.

191
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:50,464
In any case, let Miwako know if you think of anything relating to 7155.

192
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,464
Got it.

193
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:56,714
But we're both officers of the Transportation Department.

194
00:13:57,134 --> 00:14:00,473
You should let the violent crimes unit handle the case

195
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:03,354
and go home and get some sleep,

196
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:04,724
Yumi-san.

197
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:18,874
Yumi... Yumi... Yumi!

198
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:28,389
We'll stay to canvas the area a little longer.

199
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,988
Yumi-san, you really should go home.

200
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,399
Okay. Later.

201
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,788
So, what will you do?

202
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:40,408
Between me and Shiratori-kun, we can probably handle this area.

203
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:46,868
In that case, I'll go ask the local jurisdiction about that suicide.

204
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,268
Please do.

205
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:51,659
Then I'll go the park where the first murder took place.

206
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:57,909
I might find something related to 7155 in that park.

207
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,469
Good idea. Thanks.

208
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,449
I'm falling asleep the second I get home.

209
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,448
You're finally back.

210
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:22,438
We saw it on the news.

211
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:24,449
Who are you guys?

212
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:28,678
We heard two lady cops were killed one after another.

213
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,178
So we were guarding your mini patrol car for you.

214
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,209
You owe us a fee.

215
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,468
What? Are you stupid?

216
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:41,129
What's your problem? You're just a miniskirt officer anyway!

217
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:51,809
Should a cop be speaking like that to a law-abiding citizen?

218
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:59,408
Excuse me. They're with me.

219
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,039
It seems they can't hold their liquor.

220
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,319
Just imagine they're speaking nonsense and ignore them.

221
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,199
What? Who are—

222
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,958
You're with me, right?

223
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,789
Uh, yeah. I'm starting to feel like I am.

224
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:24,989
Then perhaps it would be best if you got some fresh air to sober up.

225
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:28,639
Y-Yes! I'll do that!

226
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:32,418
Sorry for the trouble.

227
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:36,089
No problem. Thanks, I think.

228
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:43,569
Tell your friends to take care.

229
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,958
And tell them not to drink so much.

230
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,279
I will.

231
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:59,079
Brother, protect Yumi-tan! You have to!

232
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,679
Wh-Who's there?!

233
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,219
Oh, just my imagination.

234
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:09,089
Jeez. I'm jumping at shadows.

235
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:15,809
She doesn't look like a woman who needs protection to me.

236
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:28,109
7155... 7155...

237
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,109
I don't see anything.

238
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:36,359
Huh?

239
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,909
Detective Chiba, what are you doing here at this hour?

240
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:45,169
C-Conan-kun! I could ask you the same thing.

241
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:49,669
I saw the body of the policewoman here this morning.

242
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,388
At first I thought she was pointing at the swing set,

243
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:59,498
but I thought she might be pointing at the no parking sign behind it instead.

244
00:17:59,499 --> 00:18:01,339
That's why I came here.

245
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:07,348
The same sign was near the second female officer who was murdered.

246
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:10,819
So he's been to the crime scene in Haido City, too.

247
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,868
Both of the victims belonged to the Transportation Department,

248
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:19,949
so you suspect the traffic violators they arrested, right?

249
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:25,579
So I thought there might be some meaning behind the road signs.

250
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:29,088
Sato-san and Yumi-san said the same thing.

251
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:32,219
But we couldn't figure out anything else.

252
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:35,219
Did you come to confirm their suspicions?

253
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:40,818
There's that, and we also determined that the second victim Lieutenant Yagi

254
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:45,229
entered the numbers 7155 into her phone just before she died.

255
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:51,128
I thought there might be something relating to those numbers at this park, so I came here.

256
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,139
7155?

257
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:58,018
Seven thousand five hundred fifty-five, seven-one and five-five...

258
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,719
71... 55...

259
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,999
Wait a minute. What does the order of those numbers mean again?

260
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:08,639
Conan-kun, it's already after eight.

261
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,159
Don't you need to go home?

262
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:16,908
I told Ran-neechan I'd be staying at the professor's house tonight,

263
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:19,429
but my skateboard ran out of batteries.

264
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:24,498
I know. Could you drive me to the professor's house?

265
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:25,349
What?

266
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,459
Come to think of it, do I have Sato-san's phone number?

267
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,449
Sato-san Miyamoto-san Momosaki-san Yagi-san

268
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,929
Chiba-kun's phone number...

269
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:46,979
I haven't called him since our class reunion.

270
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,719
Excuse me.

271
00:19:55,949 --> 00:20:00,128
I left my car parked with the trunk open in an alleyway.

272
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:03,969
A stray cat jumped in, and it won't stop crying.

273
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,688
Could you search inside my car for me?

274
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:10,858
I'm allergic to cats, so I can't touch it.

275
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,089
Huh? Sure.

276
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,288
7155... No parking signs...

277
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:28,869
Damn. I nearly have the answer, too...

278
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,568
By the way, Yumi-san told me.

279
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:34,759
She said you studied road signs together.

280
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,299
Huh? Yeah, I guess.

281
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:44,058
I had no idea Japanese road signs were based off English ones.

282
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:47,309
I doubt most people know.

283
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,558
When I said that to Yumi-san,

284
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,858
she responded that it was only natural for a Transportation Department officer to know,

285
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:57,318
that there was no way she wouldn't know such common knowledge.

286
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,819
You think that's true?

287
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,618
England...

288
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:08,329
Japanese road signs are based off English ones...

289
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:15,629
That's it! So that's how it is!

290
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,568
Listen, Detective Chiba...

291
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,219
Oh, sorry. Someone's calling.

292
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,349
Hello? Hello?

293
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,669
Hey, what are you doing?!

294
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,709
Damn! You had two phones?

295
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,639
Hello? Hello?

296
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,409
Ch-Chiba-kun...

297
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:46,609
You know who the culprit is?

298
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:50,338
For the dignity of the police, we must arrest him!

299
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:51,119
Yes, sir!

300
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:54,799
The Sleeping Kogoro's adviser...

301
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:57,869
I suppose I'm not surprised.

302
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:01,379
There are a lot of patrol cars driving around.

303
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:08,389
So I recommend you release me immediately and turn yourself in!

304
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:13,749
The next episode of Conan is "Target: MPD Transportation Department, Part Four!"
