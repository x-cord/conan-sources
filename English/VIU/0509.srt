1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,502
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:04,802
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:06,602
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:08,402
The words "red", "white", and "yellow" written in the diary.

5
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:10,602
They are important hints to solving the case.

6
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,002
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:13,702
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:16,002
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,048
"Red, White, Yellow, and Youth Detective Squad"

10
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:05,348
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

11
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,148
"Submit your problems here!"

12
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:09,848
"Youth Detective Squad, 1st Grade Class B"

13
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,148
There's nothing inside.

14
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:16,448
We received no requests for jobs today, too.

15
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,948
It's boring.

16
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:21,648
Well, it just goes to show that it's peaceful, right?

17
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,048
Right, right.

18
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,448
Who could it be? At this hour of the day...

19
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:30,748
What a bummer.

20
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,648
This is weird.

21
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:33,648
Hello.

22
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:36,248
Hi, cool kid.

23
00:02:36,248 --> 00:02:38,648
Did you just finish your class?

24
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:41,348
Jodie?

25
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:42,848
What's up?

26
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:46,048
I tried calling your number several times but couldn't get through.

27
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:47,948
After the "Shiranpuri" case,

28
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,948
my phone went dead, so I bought a new one.

29
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:52,148
A lot of things happened,

30
00:02:52,148 --> 00:02:54,548
so I got myself a new number to start anew.

31
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:57,848
Of course, I also managed to give my new number

32
00:02:57,848 --> 00:03:00,348
to her who snuck into the Organization.

33
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,148
"Her"? You mean Rena Mizunashi?

34
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:06,848
Yes. She gave me a call shortly after that.

35
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:08,948
She must've somehow called me in a hurry,

36
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:11,548
so it was a very short one,

37
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:14,048
but she clearly said...

38
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,148
A new member of the Organization has started making his move.

39
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:19,648
He's a hunter who is immensely skilled in gathering information,

40
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:22,748
has fantastic observation ability and keen foresight.

41
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:25,248
His code name is Bourbon.

42
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,348
Beware of him.

43
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,248
It was short call containing only that information.

44
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:34,848
Judging from her harsh tone of voice,

45
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,548
that hunter is probably outstandingly brilliant.

46
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:40,448
And his target is most probably

47
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:45,048
the brown-haired girl that was called Sherry by the organization.

48
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:46,348
Let us wait and see.

49
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:49,248
-I guess so. -There's no one in the classroom.

50
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:53,548
As for the FBI, we wish we could guard her tightly.

51
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:54,848
But if we do so right now,

52
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:58,648
we'll be exposing her whereabout to those people.

53
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:00,348
So, we're going to avoid seeing her for a while

54
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:03,148
and leave things up to you to handle.

55
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:04,448
Keep on your guard

56
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:06,248
and protect her the best you can.

57
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,548
Okay.

58
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:11,148
All right. If something comes up, contact me through this number.

59
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,948
Code name...

60
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:20,048
Bourbon.

61
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:23,848
By the way, what are we going to do after this?

62
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:26,048
The rain is pouring heavily.

63
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:29,448
Then, let's go to Doc's house and play games.

64
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:30,848
Okay. Let's go!

65
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:35,248
So? What do you plan to discuss with Doc,

66
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:37,048
renowned detective?

67
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:41,948
That phone call just now was from Jodie of the FBI, right?

68
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,248
Well...

69
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:46,148
Everything will be fine.

70
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:48,648
You've got nothing to worry about.

71
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,048
"You"?

72
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,248
You're hiding something from me again, aren't you?

73
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:54,648
I mean, it's not like anything has happened yet.

74
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,448
We have a case.

75
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:59,648
Are Conan and Ai the case?

76
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:02,048
No, behind you.

77
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:13,148
I see.

78
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:15,048
So, let me organise

79
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,948
the story told by you, Kaito Sugiura from 1st Grade Class A.

80
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:21,548
Your father is the landlord of a small apartment,

81
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:23,948
and there are three residents living there.

82
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:28,448
One of the three residents is making suspicious moves every night,

83
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:31,348
so you want the members of Youth Detective Squad

84
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:33,348
to find out what he's doing, right?

85
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:34,948
Yes.

86
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,648
Okay. Why don't we all spend the night at his house tonight

87
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:40,448
and stake out the resident?

88
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:41,548
That sounds good!

89
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,148
Tomorrow is a Saturday, so there's no school either.

90
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:45,948
You're right.

91
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:48,448
Not today!

92
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:53,048
I'll be playing Othello with my dad tonight.

93
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:56,448
Is that why you tried to put the request letter

94
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:59,948
into our shoes cabinet after we left school?

95
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:03,048
Because you didn't want to pass up playing Othello with your father tonight.

96
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,248
Yes.

97
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:09,448
But then, we would've only seen your letter on next Monday.

98
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,548
I see.

99
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:14,548
So, what kind of suspicious thing does that person do at night?

100
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:17,048
I think it'd be better if you come and spend the night tomorrow

101
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:21,548
and see for yourselves, Kuroshi...

102
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,548
I mean Edogawa.

103
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:24,548
Okay.

104
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:27,248
Oh, right. You can come in the afternoon if you like.

105
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:30,248
I'd like you to see my room and visit the apartment too.

106
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:32,748
Okay then. How about we go together tomorrow afternoon?

107
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:33,748
Sure.

108
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:36,948
The address is 2-23, Beika-cho,

109
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:39,248
and the name of the apartment is called Mokubaso.

110
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:42,648
See you again tomorrow, Kuroshi...

111
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,148
Edogawa.

112
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,848
Bye!

113
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:48,348
Okay.

114
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:50,848
Why did he only call out to Conan?

115
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:53,248
Besides, why did he keep saying "kuroshi"?

116
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:56,648
Maybe he was trying to say "yoroshiku".

117
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:02,748
2-23, Beika-cho, Mokubaso...

118
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:05,248
Do you know that apartment?

119
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:09,248
No. I think it is near Doc's house.

120
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:10,448
Yes.

121
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:14,348
I always pass by that apartment on my way home from school.

122
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:18,248
It's a small and old apartment, but it seems pretty nice.

123
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:36,448
Beika-cho...

124
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:39,248
Block number 2...

125
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:45,648
The street number is 23.

126
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:50,048
Mokubaso...

127
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:55,348
It's right here, isn't it?

128
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:57,048
No... no way.

129
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:59,248
It's completely burned down by fire!

130
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,648
Oh, no.

131
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:04,148
Come to think of it, I heard sirens in the middle of the night.

132
00:08:04,148 --> 00:08:06,448
Then, what about the boy?

133
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:10,548
What happened to Kaito?

134
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:13,148
Could he be trapped in the fire and...

135
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:14,348
No way.

136
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:17,948
No. The boy named Kaito is fine.

137
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:20,148
He suffered slight burns

138
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,248
"Inspector Yuminaga" -but was rescued by the firefighters,

139
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,348
and is asleep at the hospital now.

140
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:26,148
Really?

141
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:28,048
What a relief!

142
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,548
Inspector Yuminaga.

143
00:08:30,548 --> 00:08:32,348
Aren't you the kid staying at Mouri's place?

144
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:34,948
I haven't seen you since the Akauma arson case.

145
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,248
Right.

146
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:39,748
Inspector Yuminaga is the one who was in charge

147
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:42,448
of the arson case in the past that we encountered

148
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,448
when Heiji Hattori was here in Tokyo.

149
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:49,748
So, did anybody die in this fire?

150
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:52,048
Fortunately, there are no casualties.

151
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:54,948
But the father of the boy named Kaito, who is the landlord here

152
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,448
is in the Intensive Care Unit right now.

153
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:00,548
So during the fire, the other members of the boy's family

154
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:04,248
and the residents of the apartment got away safely?

155
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:07,348
His mother happened to be on a trip.

156
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,948
I called the hotel where she stayed at a while ago.

157
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:13,148
She was really shocked and said she'd be right back.

158
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:15,548
There are three other residents,

159
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:19,248
but all three of them happened to be away when the fire occurred

160
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:21,648
and came back in the morning.

161
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,948
They went out?

162
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:24,748
But the fire occurred at night, didn't it?

163
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:28,248
Yes, at around 2.30 in the morning.

164
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,548
Well, all three of them are adults,

165
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:32,848
so there's nothing strange about them going out late at night

166
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:34,548
and coming home in the morning.

167
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:38,348
I bet the one who set the fire is one of the three people!

168
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,448
What?

169
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,848
Kaito told us yesterday that one of the three residents

170
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:45,248
is doing something suspicious at night!

171
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:49,248
We came to confirm that and ended up seeing this!

172
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,348
I see.

173
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:53,148
Inspector Yuminaga.

174
00:09:53,148 --> 00:09:56,148
This was found among the burnt remains.

175
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:57,748
What is this?

176
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:03,348
This is... It's Kaito's diary.

177
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:09,348
The last page is dated July 4th.

178
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,948
That was yesterday.

179
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,248
"The weather was bad this morning.

180
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:15,948
I had to hurry and go to school

181
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,248
while the Red Person could sleep in."

182
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:22,448
What does he mean by "the Red Person"?

183
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:27,748
"I fell at the front door after coming home from school,

184
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:31,648
but I was glad the White Person was going out.

185
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:35,048
The Red Person, the White Person and the Yellow Person

186
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,348
are all out tonight.

187
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:37,948
It's just daddy and me tonight.

188
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:40,548
I wish I could play for longer,

189
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,948
but the members of the Detective Squad will be coming tomorrow,

190
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:45,048
so I guess I'll go to bed early.

191
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:46,148
I wonder who it is?

192
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:49,148
Somebody came home in the middle of the night

193
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,948
and is arguing with daddy.

194
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:53,548
It's the Yellow Person.

195
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:54,948
I wonder if daddy found out

196
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:57,548
about the suspicious things he was doing?

197
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:00,148
I'm scared. Let's just cover my ears and sleep.

198
00:11:00,148 --> 00:11:03,448
I've got to tell Conan about this after I get up."

199
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:07,348
So the one who set the fire is the yellow guy.

200
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:08,948
Inspector Yuminaga.

201
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:11,748
What are the three residents like?

202
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:16,848
Hey, can you bring the three of them here?

203
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:18,048
Yes, sir.

204
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:37,848
This feeling...

205
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,548
Eyes that glare a prey down.

206
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:45,448
This pressure is almost as if my guts are being hollowed out.

207
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,148
What's the matter?

208
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:51,248
They're here.

209
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:53,548
They're nearby.

210
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,748
The members of the organization!

211
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,029
They're here.

212
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,129
There's no doubt about it.

213
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,229
Why would members of the organization come here?

214
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,029
What could possibly bring them here?

215
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,829
No, I've got no time to waste on thinking about it.

216
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:25,429
I've got to run.

217
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:27,829
I've got to hurry and get out of here,

218
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,229
or everyone else would...

219
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:34,629
It disappeared.

220
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,929
-Hey, are you okay? -Yes...

221
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,429
Are you feeling sick?

222
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,429
Are you all right?

223
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,029
Please cooperate a while longer

224
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,229
and answer the questions the officer asks you.

225
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:46,929
Please come this way.

226
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:54,229
So, who's the suspicious one among the three?

227
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,729
How would we know?

228
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:58,729
That's what we came to find out from Kaito.

229
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:02,129
Why didn't you say so from the beginning?

230
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:06,129
What do those three people do?

231
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,829
Starting from the right...

232
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,629
"Ryuhei Hosoi (25)" -the man with the band aid

233
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:12,129
is a carpenter, Mr. Ryuhei Hosoi.

234
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,729
"Subaru Okiya (27)" -The one with glasses

235
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:17,229
is a post-graduate student, Mr. Subaru Okiya.

236
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,929
"Ginya Makabe (29)" -And the plump one

237
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:22,229
is a freelancer, Mr. Ginya Makabe.

238
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:25,929
I wonder which one among them is the Yellow Person.

239
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:29,829
Inspector, what's this "yellow person" all about?

240
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,929
Oh, right. Take a look at this.

241
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,529
It's a diary written by the son of the landlord.

242
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,629
And it seems like Kaito asked these kids

243
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:43,229
the day before the incident

244
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:45,929
to check on a resident who was acting suspicious.

245
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,329
We're not ordinary kids!

246
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,229
We have an official name.

247
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,529
We're the Youth Detective Squad!

248
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:54,929
Right, it is written in the diary.

249
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:57,429
What bothers me is that the residents of this apartment

250
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:00,129
are referred to as colours.

251
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:03,529
From what is written here, it seems like this Yellow Person

252
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,929
is unmistakably the culprit.

253
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,629
Even so, we can't tell

254
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:11,929
which one of them is the Yellow Person.

255
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,329
None of the three has a name that relates to colours.

256
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,329
No one's wearing yellow clothes either.

257
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:19,529
They work as a carpenter,

258
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:21,829
a post-graduate student and a freelancer respectively.

259
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,829
None of those jobs reminds us of colours.

260
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:27,629
Red, white and yellow.

261
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:29,629
They sound like colours of flowers.

262
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:34,229
There's a black one.

263
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:35,929
-The Black Person? -See.

264
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,529
That tanned man.

265
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,529
If it refers to skin colour, the one with glasses

266
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,129
is the White Person.

267
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:47,129
Anyway, let's delve deeper and look for

268
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,529
the culprit who is the Yellow Person

269
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,929
and find out what he did.

270
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:57,129
Gosh. How many times do I have to repeat myself?

271
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,829
During the night of the fire,

272
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,829
I was drinking with my boss and other fellow carpenters.

273
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,229
But we've just confirmed

274
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:09,529
that you disappeared not long after 1 am.

275
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,429
Yes. I was totally wasted

276
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:15,529
because I hadn't drunk in a long time.

277
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,129
I was trying to clear some alcohol out of my body,

278
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:20,029
so I lay down on a bench and fell asleep.

279
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,829
When I woke up, it was already morning.

280
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:26,329
So, that means nobody was with you at around 2.30 am

281
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:29,929
when the fire occurred?

282
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,529
No, there wasn't.

283
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,029
What happened?

284
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:35,029
There's a band aid on your face.

285
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:36,629
Did you get into a fight or something?

286
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,829
Who's that kid?

287
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:40,529
Just answer him.

288
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:44,029
I accidentally hit my face with a block of wood at work.

289
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,129
I'm still a newbie at it.

290
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:48,429
See. I have wounds everywhere.

291
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:51,429
By the way, what's your favourite colour?

292
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,029
Colour?

293
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:54,929
The blue colour of the sea.

294
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,729
I like to go surfing occasionally.

295
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:01,629
No, I went driving alone that night.

296
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,929
Whenever I get stuck writing the thesis I have to hand in to my professor,

297
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,429
I go driving for a change of mood.

298
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,629
Where did you drive to?

299
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:12,529
The tree-lined street along Teimusu River.

300
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,029
I always go there

301
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:17,529
because the greenery makes me relaxed.

302
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,229
I'm also the one who waters the plants

303
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,329
in the yard of this apartment every day.

304
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:24,829
It seems like the landlord isn't all that interested

305
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,429
in taking care of the yard.

306
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:31,229
If so, do you like the colour green?

307
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:32,829
Not really.

308
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:35,329
If I have to pick a colour,

309
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,829
I'd say my favourite is black.

310
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,229
It hides the part inside of me

311
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,329
that I don't want anyone to know about.

312
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:44,429
But then, I also dislike the colour black

313
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:47,329
for the same reason.

314
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,329
I went to a theater in Haido-cho last night to watch movies.

315
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:55,629
It was an all-night movie from 10 pm to 5 am.

316
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:57,129
It was a continuous showing

317
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,629
of three movies of the "Monster Gomera" series.

318
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,729
-Did you go alone? -Yes.

319
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,329
An online friend who was supposed to go with me

320
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,429
suddenly couldn't make it.

321
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:07,829
An online friend?

322
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,329
My hobby is day-trading,

323
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,829
so I have friends who exchange information about it with me online.

324
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,629
Day-trading? Do you mean stock exchange?

325
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:20,829
Well, it's just a hobby,

326
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,729
so I make very little money out of it.

327
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,129
I heard you're a freelancer.

328
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,429
Are you able to make a living from it?

329
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:29,929
I'm registered as a temporary staff

330
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,229
and get paid on a day-to-day basis.

331
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:33,129
Is your job...

332
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:35,529
related to construction?

333
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:40,429
Because there's a lot of dirt in your fingernails.

334
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:42,829
No. It's...

335
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:46,129
from a survival game that I played the other day.

336
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:49,129
I ran around in the mountains.

337
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:50,929
I was beaten so bad that I ruined my clothes

338
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:53,729
because the paint wouldn't come off.

339
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,529
Then, is your favourite colour

340
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,929
the colour frequently used on camouflage outfits?

341
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,929
-Navy... -Yes.

342
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,129
Navy green.

343
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:07,029
Officer, do our favourite colours

344
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:09,129
have anything to do with the fire?

345
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,229
Well, there are a lot of things involved.

346
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:14,929
Mitsuhiko.

347
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,229
Will you help me?

348
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,229
Sure.

349
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,829
Stay still and walk backwards from here.

350
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:23,029
That's all I need you to do.

351
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,529
You want me to step backwards?

352
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:27,429
-Is there anything behind? -Don't look elsewhere.

353
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:30,629
Just keep looking at me.

354
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:33,229
-Can you do that? -Yes.

355
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:37,229
He's here.

356
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,529
He must be somewhere around here.

357
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,929
The member of the Organization

358
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,829
who made me feel the pressure.

359
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:47,729
I've got to hurry and figure out who it is.

360
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,629
If I don't do something quickly,

361
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,429
I'll end up getting these children involved.

362
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,629
Ai, it hurts.

363
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:58,729
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

364
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:01,129
Yes! I'm fine!

365
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:04,829
I just scrapped my elbow a bit.

366
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:06,729
Here.

367
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,229
Use this, it's a band aid.

368
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:12,329
Thank you! Isn't this yours?

369
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,629
Don't worry about it.

370
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:16,129
I have it on me all the time because people tell me to keep it handy

371
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:19,029
since I hurt my head a lot.

372
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,529
If it has nothing to do with their favourite colour,

373
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,629
what on earth does he mean by the Yellow Person?

374
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:29,129
Inspector.

375
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,729
Don't you think it's a bit risky to believe everything

376
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:33,629
the boy has written in his diary?

377
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,929
He might have made them up.

378
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:37,529
I don't think so!

379
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:39,129
He told us

380
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:42,129
that somebody was doing suspicious things at night!

381
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:45,529
It didn't sound like he was making up a story!

382
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:49,229
Right. Besides, if officers find children who did something bad,

383
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:54,629
you start by asking adults around them to get an idea

384
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:57,829
on how the child's character is, right?

385
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,829
So, it's possible if it's the other way around, isn't it?

386
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:03,229
Although Kaito's a child,

387
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:06,029
he observed the residents very closely

388
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:08,529
and gave them nicknames.

389
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:11,829
It's like Copper Beeches.

390
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:13,629
This is a dialogue that Holmes said to Dr. Watson

391
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,729
in "The Adventure of the Copper Beeches".

392
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,229
"Dr. Watson.

393
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:21,929
In order to grasp the character of a child,

394
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,929
you always start by checking his parents, don't you?

395
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,229
Don't you think it can also work the other way around?"

396
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:33,729
Was that how he said it?

397
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:36,029
So you like Holmes too.

398
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:39,329
Yes, I had every one of the books,

399
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:42,029
but they're all burnt now.

400
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:44,229
Let's not talk about Holmes for now.

401
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:47,029
We can't ignore this diary all together.

402
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,629
Sir.

403
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:51,529
May I have a look at the diary?

404
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:53,429
Sure, here you go.

405
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:54,929
Thank you.

406
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:56,629
-Inspector! -Yes?

407
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:58,329
Did you find something else?

408
00:20:58,329 --> 00:20:59,629
Yes.

409
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,629
Many toy cars were found

410
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:03,829
from the area around Kaito's room.

411
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,829
Toy cars?

412
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,129
It's not surprising that toy cars can be found

413
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:09,529
in a child's room, is it?

414
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,329
But there are too many of them.

415
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:14,629
I think there are over 100 of them.

416
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:16,229
What is this?

417
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:17,529
What do you mean?

418
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:18,629
What is it?

419
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:21,429
Look at this. The word "edogawa"

420
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,329
has been erased and re-written repeatedly.

421
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:24,729
It's a little black here.

422
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:27,329
Maybe he tried to write it in Kanji.

423
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:31,729
No. Isn't the faded writing below it Katakana?

424
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:34,129
Could it be "kuroshi"?

425
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:37,629
-Kuroshi? -It's Kuroshiro.

426
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,729
When I called the hospital a while ago,

427
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:42,129
Kaito's mother told me something.

428
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:43,629
Kaito called her,

429
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:45,229
saying that a very smart boy

430
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:47,329
who rapidly solves the cases in his school

431
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:48,929
would be coming over the next day

432
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:50,829
and he was so happy about it.

433
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:53,629
She said that the nickname Kaito gave that boy

434
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,029
was Kuroshiro.

435
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,329
Then, the "kuroshi" Kaito kept saying yesterday...

436
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:01,629
it referred to Conan!

437
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:04,929
But why did he call him Kuroshiro?

438
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,029
Well.

439
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:08,729
I guess we'll have to wait for Kaito to recover

440
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:11,029
and ask him then.

441
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,729
No.

442
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:15,329
There's no need to do so.

443
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,229
I, Kuroshiro,

444
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:25,329
will now reveal the truth as clear as black and white.

445
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:27,329
As well as which one among them

446
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:31,129
is the yellow arsonist.

447
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:01,529
The night the fire broke out,

448
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:03,829
the three of you went out

449
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:06,629
and came home in the morning, right?

450
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:10,229
That means someone's lying!

451
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:14,129
I already know which one among the three

452
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:16,229
is the yellow arsonist.

453
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:17,529
What?

454
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:19,729
Oh, no! Over there right now...

455
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:21,729
Shinichi?

456
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,929
Shinichi's back.

457
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:29,029
Next Conan, "Conan VS Double Code Mystery"

458
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:45,629
Like this!

459
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:47,829
Next Conan's Hint:

460
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,529
"Toy car"

461
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,329
Is that a dish with pig ears?

462
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,529
That's a snail.

463
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,219
Are you his parent?
