1
00:00:01,547 --> 00:00:02,947
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:02,947 --> 00:00:04,247
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:06,347
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:08,247
Coffee cups and cake tell of the truth of the case.

5
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:10,247
The real killer and sad truth.

6
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:11,847
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:13,547
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,547
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,357
A program called "24-Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri"

10
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:00,358
is scheduled to be produced.

11
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:03,057
"Maiko Kusumi (29)" -Along with Mr. Shogo Somei,

12
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,857
"Shogo Somei (35)" -the president of the program production company,

13
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:08,457
"Raisaku Nakame (52)" -we headed off to the house

14
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:11,857
of Tohto TV's producer, Mr. Raisaku Nakame.

15
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:14,757
However, when we got there, the front door was locked,

16
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,957
and no one answered the door bell.

17
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:21,257
After hearing from President Somei

18
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:23,557
that Mr. Nakame had been contemplating suicide,

19
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:26,557
we called the condo manager and made it into the room.

20
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:29,557
Mr. Nakame!

21
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:32,757
In the room, we found the body of Mr. Nakame,

22
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,857
who had drunk poisoned coffee lying dead on the floor.

23
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,657
The spilled coffee on top the table

24
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:41,557
indicated traces of deception.

25
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:44,857
The possibility of it being a murder increased.

26
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:47,957
Moreover, the coffee that had spilled on the floor indicated

27
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:49,757
that someone was in the room

28
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:52,457
with Mr. Nakame at the time of his death.

29
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:54,957
The mystery of the case grew deeper.

30
00:02:54,957 --> 00:03:00,957
How did that person get out of this room that had a locked front door?

31
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:04,957
And who is the one that poisoned Mr. Nakame to death?

32
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:10,857
"Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 2)".

33
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:14,157
It means

34
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:18,357
that the killer may still be hiding somewhere in this room.

35
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:20,257
Check every nook and cranny.

36
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,457
Yes, sir...

37
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:23,657
Takagi, hold it.

38
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:24,657
Yes?

39
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:28,757
President Somei could be the one who schemed this trick

40
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:33,557
and went into the room first to hide the traces of his trick.

41
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,357
Go and check

42
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:38,257
if he's really on sick leave from his company.

43
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:39,457
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:43,257
"Somei Productions" -Huh? How is President Somei feeling?

45
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,657
Well.

46
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,857
It seems he hasn't been feeling too well the past two or three days.

47
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:49,357
He wasn't at work today either.

48
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:51,057
Is that right?

49
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:52,857
Did he mention

50
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,657
which part of his body isn't feeling well?

51
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,457
No, it's not anything like that.

52
00:03:57,457 --> 00:03:59,557
I think it has something to do with work.

53
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:01,257
Work-related?

54
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:04,257
I think it's because the special he was planning on went down the drain.

55
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:06,357
What? A special program?

56
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:09,657
Do you mean the one that Detective Mouri was going to be featured?

57
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:12,257
Oh, so you know about it.

58
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:15,957
Yes, it's that "24 Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri" program.

59
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:19,557
What about the meeting that was supposed to take place with Mr. Nakame?

60
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:20,957
It was cancelled as well.

61
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:24,357
The president said he'd personally apologize to Mr. Mouri,

62
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:26,457
but I wonder if he really did.

63
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:29,757
Well, that isn't what's important now.

64
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,057
Oh, yes. That's right.

65
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,357
Speaking of the president,

66
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:35,957
I saw him today around sundown at a pharmacy nearby.

67
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:38,357
What time was that?

68
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:40,057
I think it was around 6.30 pm.

69
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:41,857
6.30 pm?

70
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:43,757
6.30 pm...

71
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:46,757
If that's true, it's a perfect alibi

72
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:50,757
because the company is quite some distance from here.

73
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,757
I wonder why he didn't even mention it.

74
00:04:57,557 --> 00:05:00,657
Yes, Mr. Somei came at around 6.30 pm

75
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:02,657
to buy stomach medicine.

76
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:06,057
But why would the police want to know something like that?

77
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,057
Well, you see.

78
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:11,057
Mr. Somei inadvertently got himself into a certain incident.

79
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:14,957
Do you mean the one that has to do with that famed Detective Kogoro Mouri?

80
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:16,957
While he was here, he answered a call,

81
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:20,457
and I heard Mr. Somei saying, "Detective Mouri".

82
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:21,757
Well...

83
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:27,757
Wait. He got another call before that one.

84
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:30,157
Do you know who it was from?

85
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,857
I'm sure that it was a woman.

86
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:34,157
A woman?

87
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:36,457
He called her Maiko.

88
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:39,057
-Maiko? -Maiko?

89
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,057
It's the woman who came to the detective office

90
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:44,557
with Mr. Somei the other day.

91
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:50,057
She called Mr. Somei at that time.

92
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:56,257
This is...

93
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,657
Could it be...

94
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:06,357
The reason why President Somei rushed into this room first was because...

95
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:08,557
His real intention was...

96
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:17,257
The aroma of coffee.

97
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:18,857
Just as I thought.

98
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:21,057
No one's here after all.

99
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:24,057
Was that window locked?

100
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:27,057
Yeah. Just to be sure,

101
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:29,157
we checked the veranda after opening the window.

102
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:30,957
Don't you open the window

103
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,757
because it's raining pretty heavily.

104
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:39,557
The window was closed,

105
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:43,357
but the lace curtain is wet.

106
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:44,557
Come to think of it,

107
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:47,057
when President Somei came to this condo,

108
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:49,357
his jacket was wet.

109
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:52,057
So, how was the veranda?

110
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:54,757
Could someone have gone to the room next door

111
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,757
or gone down from there?

112
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:58,157
No, no way.

113
00:06:58,157 --> 00:07:01,357
The veranda's blocked off by a wall from the room next door,

114
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,657
and there is no trace that the emergency escape ladder

115
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,957
was used to get down to the veranda below.

116
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:08,257
Besides, we're on the 20th floor.

117
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:11,357
It may be a parking lot right below here,

118
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,457
but if someone were to use a rope and try to make it down,

119
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:17,257
I'm sure that someone is bound to notice.

120
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:21,457
Well, I guess you could use a hand glider to fly like Thief Kid,

121
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:24,457
but it would be quite difficult in the rain.

122
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:28,457
If so, there's only one answer.

123
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:32,457
The one and only sad truth.

124
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,757
May I be excused to leave?

125
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,157
It's getting pretty late

126
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:46,857
and I'm starting to feel unwell again.

127
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:49,857
No. Please wait a while longer.

128
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:52,957
Hey, did you confirm whether he really is unwell or not?

129
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:56,657
Yes, I called President Somei's company

130
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:58,357
and found out that he's having stomach trouble.

131
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:01,857
He also took leave for two to three days.

132
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,957
I was also told that an employee saw him

133
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:08,657
at a neighborhood drugstore today at sundown around 6.30.

134
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:10,457
About 6.30 pm?

135
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,657
That's the estimated time of death of the body.

136
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:15,757
Yes. I also called the drugstore,

137
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:19,757
and confirmed he was buying stomach medicine there at the time.

138
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:22,057
Which means he has an alibi?

139
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:26,957
Yes. And that program "24 Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri"

140
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:28,857
has already been cancelled.

141
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,457
So, I can't figure out

142
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:33,157
why he took Mr. Mouri over to Mr. Nakame's residence

143
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:36,257
to have the meeting as scheduled without saying a word about it.

144
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,457
I guess he did come to hide

145
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:42,557
traces of a locked room murder trick.

146
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:46,457
If so, we've got to figure out the trick first.

147
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:49,557
In cases like these,

148
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:53,157
if things go as they usually do, Mouri would come up with something.

149
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,557
He would make strange sounds like "Hinyo" or the like.

150
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:56,157
That's right.

151
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:59,057
Well, comments that Conan makes out of the blue

152
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:01,857
lead to hints on solving the case at times too.

153
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,257
Why?

154
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:05,757
Why not?

155
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:07,457
I said no, so it's a no.

156
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:09,157
Stop saying strange things, will you?

157
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:10,857
What is it he should stop saying?

158
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:13,457
Is it something important to do with the case?

159
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:16,457
No. He said that he's hungry

160
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:20,857
and wants to eat that cake that's on the table.

161
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:24,357
Because nobody's eating that cake, right?

162
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:26,257
Then, why can't I eat it?

163
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:28,157
Well, you see, Conan.

164
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:30,457
The cake is an important evidence,

165
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:32,357
and we've still got a lot of examining to do.

166
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:33,657
No way.

167
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,457
I'll bet you're planning to eat it later with Inspector Megure.

168
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:39,757
No, no. We won't do such a thing.

169
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:43,257
Anyway, there's just enough for two.

170
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:45,057
-What? Just enough for two? -What? Just enough for two?

171
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:47,557
See, take a good look at that cake.

172
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:50,457
It's sliced in the middle.

173
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:55,157
-It's true! -But why?

174
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:57,257
-This means... -Maybe...

175
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:00,357
someone suddenly felt like eating more cake?

176
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:03,157
The rest of the whole cake was in the refrigerator,

177
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:06,457
so it could be cut into any size they like.

178
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:10,357
Oh, boy. When did Pops check out the refrigerator?

179
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:12,457
Ran does that a lot too.

180
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,857
She buys extra cake saying that it's for our guests,

181
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:17,157
and ends up eating two servings by herself.

182
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:20,357
That's why she's grown in all the wrong places.

183
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:23,057
What does that have to do with this case?

184
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,057
Speaking of growth,

185
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,457
if you give coffee to a tree, will it help the tree grow?

186
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:30,057
Giving coffee to a tree?

187
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:32,357
What nonsense are you talking about?

188
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:36,457
But I smell coffee from that plant over there.

189
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:39,657
Let me see.

190
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:42,357
He's right.

191
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:45,657
Maybe it does help the tree grow.

192
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:51,057
This pencil holder smells of coffee too.

193
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:55,957
That man called Mr. Nakame must've really liked coffee.

194
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:03,857
I get it!

195
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:08,157
Maybe the placement of the coffee cup and the cake on the table

196
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:10,157
wasn't like this initially.

197
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,757
But rather...

198
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,557
What do you think about this?

199
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:37,157
It increased to a serving for two people.

200
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:39,557
I see.

201
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:42,157
You move the cake to one plate,

202
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:45,157
then place the plate that is emptied under the coffee cup,

203
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:47,257
making it look like a saucer.

204
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:50,657
You pour your own coffee into the planter,

205
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:53,357
then put writing tools into the other coffee cup

206
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:56,057
to make it look like a pencil holder, completing the deception trick.

207
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,257
This was done to make it look as if no one was here with Mr. Nakame

208
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:02,357
when he drank the poisoned coffee.

209
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,757
But who would do something like this?

210
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,457
The killer.

211
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:10,757
It was to make it look as if Mr. Nakame had committed suicide.

212
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:13,657
So who is that killer?

213
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,157
Well...

214
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:18,057
That's...

215
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,550
Something's strange.

216
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,150
Why are you making that sound again?

217
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:31,051
Come on, it's the third time today.

218
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:35,651
But there are some things missing on the table.

219
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,051
What?

220
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:40,651
There are two pieces of cake, two plates and two coffee cups.

221
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:42,051
Nothing's missing.

222
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:43,951
It's the fork.

223
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:47,451
One fork that is needed to eat the cake is missing.

224
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:49,851
You're right.

225
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:52,151
The fork for the plate that was used as a saucer isn't here.

226
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,651
That means it's somewhere in this room.

227
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:55,951
Like in the kitchen?

228
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:59,751
No. If the killer had time to hide it into the the kitchen cabinet,

229
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:03,651
the coffee cups would've been brought to the sink too.

230
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:07,651
I didn't have time, so I hid it in my pocket.

231
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,351
If I didn't shout as soon as I saw Mr. Nakame's dead body,

232
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:15,151
I would be suspected, right?

233
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,851
Does that mean you killed Mr. Nakame?

234
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:19,051
Yes.

235
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:23,251
After all, he did give me a pretty bad time, work-wise.

236
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:26,651
I killed him just as you had mentioned, inspector.

237
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,751
I came here with the cake,

238
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,051
put poison into coffee,

239
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,651
then told him I had urgent business to attend to and left.

240
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:36,351
I warned him to chain lock the door for safety reasons

241
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,051
before leaving.

242
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,151
Back then, I was bothered about my portion of cake and coffee cup

243
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:44,551
that I left on the table.

244
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:47,751
So I told Mr. Nakame I'd put them away before leaving.

245
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:51,251
But he told me to hurry and go if it was urgent.

246
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:53,951
That he would clean up the place.

247
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:57,151
So I came back to this room with Mr. Mouri

248
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:59,451
to hide the coffee cup and cake.

249
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:02,251
I guess it was useless after all.

250
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:05,451
But there are eye-witness reports of you being at a drugstore

251
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:09,051
in your neighborhood at around 6.30 pm.

252
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:10,151
Who saw me?

253
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:13,851
An employee of your company and the sales clerk at the drugstore.

254
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,351
It's true that I went to buy medicine today,

255
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:19,951
but that was a little after 5.00 pm.

256
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,251
I'm sure they got the time wrong.

257
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:25,651
Then, what about the coffee stain?

258
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:29,051
Judging from the way the coffee spilled on the floor and stained it,

259
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:34,751
it happened when someone was sitting on the chair.

260
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,951
Well, I spilled the coffee deliberately.

261
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:41,151
Deliberately?

262
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,451
When I came into this room with Mr. Mouri,

263
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:47,351
I spilled the coffee deliberately before pouring it into the planter.

264
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:50,751
Doing so would make this look like an impossible crime, wouldn't it?

265
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:55,751
But when I touched the stain right after Conan told me to do so,

266
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:57,551
it wasn't wet at all.

267
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:59,751
Do you remember when you touched it?

268
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,751
No, I don't remember the time.

269
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:05,451
But I'm sure it was 30 to 40 minutes after we received the call.

270
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:07,951
You're not really sure, are you?

271
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:10,651
It probably dried up because some time had passed.

272
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:13,551
Besides, if I wasn't the one who stained the floor,

273
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,651
who else could've done it?

274
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:18,751
How did that person lock the door up

275
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,751
and where did that person disappear to?

276
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,151
Yes. The person disappeared

277
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:25,051
to the world beyond.

278
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,851
What do you mean by the world beyond?

279
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:33,251
Oh, well. That's what I'd like to know...

280
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,551
Dad, don't tell me that...

281
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,151
It's finally coming.

282
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:46,151
Yes. The mystery that everyone wants to hear.

283
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:49,351
How did the murderer make it out of this room

284
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:51,251
and where did the killer disappear to?

285
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,651
The answer is the world beyond.

286
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:58,851
The person fled to the underworld that is totally out of our reach.

287
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,951
Hey, I don't understand a word you're saying.

288
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:03,151
Don't... don't tell me

289
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,651
that Mr. Nakame schemed it himself before committing suicide.

290
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:07,151
-What? -No.

291
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:09,751
It's not Mr. Nakame's own doing.

292
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,951
Think about it.

293
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:14,651
The window of this room was closed.

294
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:17,451
Why did the curtain still get wet?

295
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:20,351
And when we arrived at this condo,

296
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:22,451
why was President Somei's clothes wet

297
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:25,851
despite having been in the car all the while?

298
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:30,451
At around 6.30, the estimated time the murder was committed,

299
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:33,051
there was another person who called President Somei

300
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:35,751
besides me.

301
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:40,951
And that killer is a person that President Somei wants to protect

302
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:45,851
even if he himself were to be taken as the murderer.

303
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,651
Wait, don't tell me that it's...

304
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:53,151
Yes. The one who killed Mr. Nakame

305
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:56,751
was an employee at President Somei's company,

306
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,651
Ms. Maiko Kusumi.

307
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:12,851
She probably came here with the cake

308
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:15,851
and made Mr. Nakame drink poisoned coffee.

309
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:19,551
She made sure he was dead,

310
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:23,451
then jumped out from the veranda and took her own life.

311
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,151
It can't be...

312
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:26,951
So, the call that Mr. Somei received on his phone

313
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:30,251
at the time of the crime was from her.

314
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:34,651
She probably called to tell him that she was going to commit suicide.

315
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,751
She told President Somei,

316
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:40,451
the person she cherished and trusted most about it.

317
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:42,151
That... That's not true!

318
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:43,951
She didn't do anything!

319
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:45,751
I schemed all of this on my own!

320
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:47,551
-She did nothing! -You came here

321
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:50,551
so that she wouldn't be seen as a killer, right?

322
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:53,351
You tried to make it look as if she was never here

323
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:56,051
and that Mr. Nakame committed suicide, right?

324
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:57,351
In case the worst happened,

325
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:59,851
you would set yourself up as the killer in her place.

326
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,651
So the curtain was wet

327
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:07,551
because she left the window open after going out to the veranda.

328
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:11,751
Yes, and President Somei's the one who closed it.

329
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:13,651
He also shouted

330
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,951
to let me know that he found the corpse.

331
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:19,551
Wrong, wrong! She didn't do it!

332
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:21,951
I did it. I'm the one who did it!

333
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:24,651
Inspector, please arrest me!

334
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:27,651
Don't you mind leaving her the way she is?

335
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:33,051
If you're arrested as is,

336
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:38,051
she's going to be left confined in this cold rain.

337
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,051
The wet body of Maiko

338
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:43,651
who jumped to her death

339
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:46,351
from the 20th floor to the parking lot,

340
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,851
that you carried into the trunk of your car.

341
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:02,751
Maiko...

342
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:07,751
Check the trunk of the car right now.

343
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:08,951
Yes, sir.

344
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:32,051
Later, Maiko's body was found

345
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:34,651
inside President Somei's car trunk,

346
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:39,051
and the mystery of this locked room murder case was solved.

347
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:43,151
According to the last phone call that Maiko had made to President Somei,

348
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:46,851
after Producer Nakame's request for a commission was rejected,

349
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,851
the TV show was cancelled.

350
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:51,851
He threatened that Somei wouldn't be able to work in industry anymore.

351
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:52,951
Maiko couldn't bear watching Somei

352
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,751
who was looking more and more haggard because of the threat,

353
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,351
thus committed the murder.

354
00:19:58,251 --> 00:20:00,751
Hiding her intention to kill within her,

355
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:01,751
she didn't tell President Somei

356
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:06,951
that she had resigned from the company a day before committing the murder.

357
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:09,251
However, just before taking the death plunge,

358
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:13,751
she finally got to tell him how she really felt about him

359
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:17,651
using her thin voice

360
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,751
which was overshadowed by the sound of the rain.

361
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:36,251
"The Following Day"

362
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,651
What?

363
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:40,351
Did you eat the cake that was in the refrigerator?

364
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,251
Yeah, I ate my portion.

365
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:45,751
That's strange.

366
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:47,951
While you were out, mum said she came

367
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,151
and put three pieces of cake that she bought inside the refrigerator.

368
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:52,751
But there's only one piece left.

369
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:56,251
Take a good look. There are two pieces, aren't there?

370
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,751
You're right!

371
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:01,951
Wait, this piece seems to have been cut into two.

372
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,951
The cellophane around the cake isn't wrapped too nicely either.

373
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:08,951
It seems to have been rewrapped or something.

374
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,951
Is... Is that so?

375
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:14,551
There's whipped cream on the knife.

376
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:15,751
You ate the cake, didn't you?

377
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:17,751
You ate two pieces all by yourself.

378
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:19,551
Watch it. That's a knife.

379
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,251
Cake...

380
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:28,251
You can have my portion, Ran.

381
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:30,551
I'm not hungry.

382
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:34,451
Conan.

383
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:36,751
Okay, I'll give mine to you too, dad.

384
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,551
What? Really?

385
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:49,351
I don't think I'll be eating cake for a while.

386
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:54,351
Not until the rain stops, at least.

387
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:05,551
Thief Kid! I'm over here!

388
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,551
Unless you ride something like a hot air balloon,

389
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:12,651
it's impossible for to make it through this net.

390
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,951
By teleportation.

391
00:24:14,951 --> 00:24:17,651
He's going to flee using teleportation.

392
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:19,851
I'll see you in 10 seconds

393
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:22,551
after I travel through time and space.

394
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:27,651
Next Conan Special, "Thief Kid's Teleportation Magic"

395
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:46,251
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,251
"Black and white"

397
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:50,151
Next week is a special! Thief Kid faces off against me!

398
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:52,851
Ready! 1, 2, go!
