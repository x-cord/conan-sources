1
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:03,767
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:05,167
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:06,967
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:08,667
A white cup with black lingering scent.

5
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,667
An astounding locked room murder, an invisible murderer!

6
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,167
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:13,967
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:16,267
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:59,476
"Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 1)"

10
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,976
"24 Hours Close Up With Kogoro Mouri"?

11
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:13,376
Yes, it's aired at 9 in the morning on Monday, a golden hour.

12
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,376
There are many programs where we cover the daily life of police,

13
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:21,376
but this time we're focusing on a private detective.

14
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:23,076
"Shogo Somei (35)" -However, private detectives cannot afford

15
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,376
"President of Production Company" -to have their faces become known

16
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:28,276
or to have anyone figure out the way they conduct their investigations,

17
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:31,076
so we were turned down many times.

18
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:33,576
But since you're very famous, Detective Mouri,

19
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,676
we think that the viewers will be glued to the screen if you appear.

20
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:38,676
We would really like you to accept this offer.

21
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:42,576
But you'll be watching me for 24 hours straight, won't you?

22
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,376
Oh, if you don't want the cameras filming you,

23
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,176
just let us know and we'll do away with them.

24
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:50,076
"Maiko Kusumi (29)" -You can check the film before it airs

25
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:52,676
"Production Company's Employee" -and cut the ones you don't want aired.

26
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:53,976
But...

27
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:56,676
You haven't been getting too many job calls recently, have you?

28
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,076
Yes.

29
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:01,876
It may be a problem to film 24 hours a day because you'll be drinking beer

30
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,376
and listening to the horse races from morning.

31
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:06,176
And at night, you'll be playing Mahjong.

32
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,476
Don't you have work?

33
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:11,576
Well, I sort of don't right now.

34
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:12,976
Hey.

35
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:19,676
Well, then. Why don't you prepare something for me?

36
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:22,676
You can make up an unsolved murder case or something.

37
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:24,376
Wait, dad!

38
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,076
Make one up?

39
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:28,076
I don't think that's a good idea.

40
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:30,876
But maybe we should ask the staff anyway?

41
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,676
It doesn't have to be a murder case.

42
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,876
We could look for cases that would draw the interest of people

43
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:37,276
-or a troublesome situation. -No, no!

44
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:39,376
Even if it's not something we made up,

45
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,576
once word goes out that our staff asked him to do the job,

46
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,376
people will suspect that we made it up.

47
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:46,776
It would also give Detective Mouri a bad reputation.

48
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:52,476
Besides, considering the time we have until it's aired,

49
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:55,376
we don't have time to make up something like that either.

50
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:57,076
That's true.

51
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:58,376
Excuse me.

52
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,376
Yes?

53
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:02,876
Are you dating each other by any chance?

54
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,276
-What? -What?

55
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:09,676
You're both wearing a pair watch.

56
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:11,176
Oh, no.

57
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:15,176
This is something she gave me for my birthday.

58
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:17,876
I liked the design,

59
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:19,676
so I couldn't help getting the same watch for myself too.

60
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,176
Well. She has been with me right from the time the company was established

61
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:26,076
and has been taking care of me,

62
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,476
so she's like a wife to me.

63
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:40,476
But what a shame.

64
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:43,076
I was so sure that Mr. Mouri would accept the offer,

65
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:45,776
so I already made arrangements to see Mr. Nakame.

66
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,076
Mr. Nakame?

67
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,476
The producer of Tohto TV.

68
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:51,076
In fact, Mr. Nakame had asked me

69
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:58,176
to take you over to his house together with the program production staff.

70
00:04:58,176 --> 00:04:59,976
That's what you get for deciding things on your own

71
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:02,576
without asking me first.

72
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:05,076
I thought that you would immediately take the job

73
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,676
after seeing the name of the narrator of the program.

74
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,076
Narrator?

75
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,876
Yeah. Her name's on the planning report that I gave you a while ago.

76
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:22,176
Yoko, my dear!

77
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:27,676
Is Yoko coming to that arrangement meeting too?

78
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:30,276
Yes, of course.

79
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:33,076
I will gladly accept your offer!

80
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:35,776
Pops is a genuine simpleton.

81
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:40,376
Mr. Mouri has accepted the job.

82
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:44,276
It seems that using Yoko Okino as bait worked after all.

83
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,676
Yes, I heard that he was a fan of hers,

84
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:47,976
but I didn't know that he was that big of a fan.

85
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,476
Well, make sure he doesn't find out that it's a special program

86
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,576
"Raisaku Nakame (52)" -that's will be aired

87
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:54,076
"Tohto TV's Producer" -in place of a program that's going to be dumped

88
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:56,676
because of low viewer rating.

89
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:59,176
Yes, of course.

90
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,176
Mr. Mouri was all for it.

91
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,376
It's a program that is bound to catch the interest of the viewers

92
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,976
and will never be thought as a program aired in place of another program.

93
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,876
And don't forget about the other stuff too.

94
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,076
The other stuff?

95
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,976
The kick back.

96
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:14,476
To inflate the invoice of the production fee

97
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:17,276
and give me the extra cash that comes up.

98
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,076
We'll be making big cash.

99
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:22,776
Well, I refused a while ago, didn't I?

100
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:23,876
Is that so?

101
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:28,276
I thought I could work with you after your long absence. What a shame.

102
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:30,676
Wait a minute, please.

103
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:33,876
Well, if you hand her over to me,

104
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,176
I won't push things so far.

105
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,276
Her?

106
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:40,076
Maiko who works for you.

107
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:43,376
-What? -You weren't aware, were you?

108
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,476
The only reason I gave work to a small production company like yours

109
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:47,176
that was practically ousted from this world

110
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:50,076
is because she's my favorite.

111
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,276
I want to have an efficient girl like her

112
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:56,276
to work with me as my secretary.

113
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:59,876
Moreover, she's beautiful and has a nice figure too.

114
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:02,676
Well, I can't agree to that either.

115
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:05,476
Well, we can discuss the details

116
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:09,276
when you come over to my place with Detective Mouri.

117
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:18,876
Is anything wrong?

118
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:21,276
No, it's nothing.

119
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:29,776
"Somei Productions"

120
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,776
Yes, this is Somei Productions.

121
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:34,876
Yes.

122
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,976
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

123
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,976
Talk about being late.

124
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:09,476
It's more than 30 minutes past the scheduled time.

125
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:12,676
Yoko. Yoko.

126
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:16,476
Well, I guess someone doesn't seem to mind at all.

127
00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:22,676
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Mouri.

128
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,076
No problem at all.

129
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:28,276
I'll go and park the car in the parking lot then.

130
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:34,976
Where's my dear Yoko?

131
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:38,776
Maybe she's already at the producer's house.

132
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:42,576
His jacket was pretty wet.

133
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:48,376
What? Yoko can't come?

134
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,876
It seems something suddenly came up,

135
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:54,576
so the formal arrangement meeting will be set for another day.

136
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,076
None of the staff is here either today.

137
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:01,476
Are you all right?

138
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:02,476
What?

139
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:06,476
You look a bit more tired than the last time we saw you.

140
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:09,676
Well. I've got a lot of things on my mind.

141
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:11,876
"2003, Nakame"

142
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,776
No answer.

143
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:18,676
Maybe he went out somewhere because we're late.

144
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:20,776
I... I don't think so.

145
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,076
We've got no choice. Why don't we come back some other time?

146
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,676
Besides, Yoko's not here either.

147
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,376
Please wait.

148
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:30,776
Maybe something's wrong.

149
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:33,076
Huh? Like what?

150
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,276
Well, the fact is,

151
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:38,376
Producer Nakame has been acting strange lately.

152
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,976
Remember the news some time ago

153
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,576
about Tohto TV's made up program scandal?

154
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:47,176
Yeah, the scandal about the travel program.

155
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:48,276
Yes.

156
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:52,076
Although Mr. Nakame had nothing to do with the scandal,

157
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:54,776
he felt responsible for it because he's the one

158
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,876
who started the program.

159
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:00,176
Recently, whenever he went drinking,

160
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:02,376
he would complain about it.

161
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:04,076
He said he wanted to die.

162
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:06,776
-What? -That... That's why

163
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:10,376
he might have fallen into depression again while waiting for us.

164
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,776
Then go and explain the situation to the condo manager right away

165
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:14,976
and get a spare key!

166
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:17,376
-Right this minute! -Yes, sir!

167
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:26,576
-Thanks for the trouble. -No problem.

168
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:29,476
The door's chain-locked.

169
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:32,376
It seems he's inside the room after all.

170
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:35,676
Mr. Nakame! Is anything wrong?

171
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,876
We've got no choice.

172
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:39,376
Let's cut the chain lock and go inside.

173
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,976
Will you please do it?

174
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:42,276
Yes, sir.

175
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:48,476
Mr. Nakame, we're coming in!

176
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:50,876
Where are the slippers?

177
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,676
You can go in with your shoes on.

178
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,376
Mr. Nakame had lived abroad for quite some time.

179
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,576
Oh, I see.

180
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,576
I'll go check the living room on this side.

181
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,976
Mr. Mouri, would you please go check the study on that side?

182
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:05,076
-Okay. -Mr. Nakame!

183
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:07,876
What shall we do, Conan?

184
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,876
Should we go inside too?

185
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:11,976
You stay here at the front door, Ran.

186
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,976
Mr. Nakame!

187
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:15,776
What's the matter?

188
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,376
-Stay right there! -Hey, wait!

189
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,876
Mr. Nakame!

190
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:22,276
Please hang on!

191
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:25,476
Mr. Nakame! Mr. Nakame!

192
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:29,276
Hey, what's the matter?

193
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:31,876
I came into the living room and found Mr. Nakame on the floor.

194
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,376
-He's not moving. -What?

195
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,476
I smell the scent of almond from his mouth.

196
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:42,776
Cyanide poisoning.

197
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:45,676
He must've mixed it in his coffee and drunk it.

198
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:48,076
It... It's my fault.

199
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:50,876
It's all because I was late. That's why Mr. Nakame...

200
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,376
Stop blaming yourself

201
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:56,176
and call the police and ambulance right away!

202
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:57,476
Yes, sir.

203
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:03,976
Hello, is this the police?

204
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:06,976
There's a dead person.

205
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,176
Please rush over here.

206
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:12,176
The address? The address is...

207
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:14,976
Tohto Sky Mansion, 20th floor.

208
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:29,876
As expected, this is not suicide...

209
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,676
but it's homicide.

210
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:35,176
And the one who schemed this is probably...

211
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:39,276
Could it be...

212
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,691
A special program featuring a detective and staying with him for 24 hours.

213
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,691
Yes, sir.

214
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:52,691
In order to make arrangements for the program,

215
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,791
you came here to the TV producer's residence.

216
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,091
You rang the doorbell, and since there was no answer,

217
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,791
you entered the room and found the producer,

218
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:06,691
Raisaku Nakame dead after drinking the poisoned coffee.

219
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:08,091
Yes.

220
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,891
Since there was no answer,

221
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:12,691
we had the condo manager open the door for us.

222
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,191
It was chain-locked, so he cut the chain.

223
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:17,091
This is what we found when we came into the room.

224
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:20,491
And? You were asked to accept this job offer

225
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,891
and came to make arrangements with President Somei

226
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:25,191
of this program production company.

227
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:28,491
And the detective who unfortunately

228
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:34,591
encountered this case by accident happened to be you again, Mr. Mouri?

229
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,491
Yes, inspector.

230
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:39,191
Don't you think it's strange?

231
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,291
I mean, it's not like we're shooting a mystery series or something.

232
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,891
Why is it that you always happen to...

233
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,191
No, I guess I'll stop here because it's kind of ridiculous.

234
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,391
That... that's true.

235
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:54,691
So what's the cause of death? Was it due to cyanide poisoning after all?

236
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:56,691
As for that...

237
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:58,291
How was it, Tome-san?

238
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,291
I can't say much about it until the results of the postmortem are out.

239
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,291
But there's probably no mistake about it.

240
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:12,091
The time of death is estimated to be a little before 6.30 in the evening.

241
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:16,291
Anyway, it's amazing that you went as far as

242
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,891
to cut the chain lock of the door to get in.

243
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,991
It's because of what President Somei told us.

244
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:25,391
He said that Mr. Nakame had always thought about committing suicide,

245
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:28,491
so we thought it was urgent.

246
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,791
I see.

247
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,991
Inspector, we can't drop the possibility of this being a murder case yet.

248
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:36,191
What? Why not?

249
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,291
Isn't this a case of suicide

250
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:42,291
since the door was chain-locked from inside?

251
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,191
Well, it's true that this room was locked.

252
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:48,291
However, just because he drank poison,

253
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,091
it doesn't mean that he committed suicide.

254
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,991
Is... Is that so?

255
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,891
The killer could've come to Mr. Nakame's room with the cake

256
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:58,591
and insert poison into the coffee.

257
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:00,991
He then said that he had to leave because of urgent business.

258
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,291
Upon leaving,

259
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,291
the killer could've told Mr. Nakame that it's dangerous nowadays

260
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,391
to make him use the chain lock for safety reasons.

261
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:09,191
In that case, this situation is very easy to set up.

262
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:11,291
After the killer left the room,

263
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:16,191
all Mr. Nakame had to do was sit down and drink the poisoned coffee.

264
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:17,791
I see.

265
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:22,991
By the way, where were you around the estimated time of his death?

266
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:24,791
Are you suspecting me?

267
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,791
No, but you're the first one who found him,

268
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,591
so I'm asking just to be sure.

269
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,391
I haven't been feeling too well recently.

270
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,091
So, I took off from work and slept at home.

271
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:41,991
I got a call from Mr. Mouri just around 6.30 pm.

272
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,491
He reminded me that I was supposed to meet Mr. Nakame at 7.00 pm.

273
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:46,991
So, I came here.

274
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:51,091
I was sleeping all day, so I'm feeling a lot better now.

275
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:53,591
Hold it! Does that mean that you had forgotten

276
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,291
that we were supposed to have an arrangement meeting?

277
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,791
Yes, I'm sorry.

278
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,491
Did you pick up the call on your home phone?

279
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:02,491
No.

280
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,391
I picked it up on this cell phone.

281
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:06,691
Then, is there anyone who can prove

282
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:09,591
that you were sleeping all day in your room?

283
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:10,991
There isn't.

284
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:14,591
Proof? Are you suspecting me after all?

285
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,191
No, no. This is just for confirmation.

286
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:22,391
Why did you make that sound?

287
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:26,291
Strange. The bottom of the saucer of the cup...

288
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,991
Don't go touching stuff!

289
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:30,191
Didn't I tell you not to touch anything?

290
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:33,191
See, there are traces that coffee spilled.

291
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:34,691
What?

292
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:37,891
Normally, if the coffee spilled while the coffee cup was on the saucer,

293
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:41,091
there should be a circular trace of coffee on the saucer,

294
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:44,091
but there isn't any circular trace on this table.

295
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:48,391
All it has are two thin streaks.

296
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:52,391
There's no coffee underneath the saucer either.

297
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,991
That's true.

298
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:56,991
Maybe these two thin streaks

299
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:00,791
are that of the coffee cup and the handle of the cup.

300
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,191
If you leave the cup of coffee toppled as is,

301
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,491
the parts that touch the table

302
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,891
like the coffee cup and the handle won't leave traces underneath.

303
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:13,891
If so, after Mr. Nakame drank the poisoned coffee and fell onto the floor,

304
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:17,091
someone deliberately put the coffee cup back on the saucer

305
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:22,291
and placed it on the table after the coffee dried up?

306
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,691
But who would do something like that?

307
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:26,891
And for what reason?

308
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:29,691
We can't tell the reason yet,

309
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:32,891
but it's obvious who did it.

310
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:36,391
The only person who could've done that after the coffee dried up

311
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:40,791
would be the first person who entered this room and found the dead body.

312
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,991
It couldn't be anyone other than President Somei, right?

313
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:47,591
Hey, Conan. What are you saying?

314
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:49,091
That boy sure says strange things.

315
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:53,191
No. It's true that you're the only one who could do it.

316
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:57,491
It would take just about an hour for the spilled coffee to dry up.

317
00:17:57,491 --> 00:18:00,691
The estimated time of murder is around 6.30 pm.

318
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:04,791
We entered this locked room shortly after 7.30 pm

319
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,391
or rather, before 8.00 pm.

320
00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:10,691
So, the spilled coffee would've dried up.

321
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:13,791
I'm sure that you went into the room before everyone else

322
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,791
in order to hide evidence that you failed to erase

323
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,291
using the saucer of the coffee cup.

324
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,891
Isn't that right?

325
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,891
What kind of evidence is that supposed to be?

326
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:27,191
The only thing that was found underneath the saucer that the cup was on

327
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,691
was the trace of spilled coffee, right?

328
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,491
Why would I have to go out of my way to hide something like that?

329
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,791
The trace of the spilled coffee?

330
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,491
Hey, please let me go, Ran!

331
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:45,291
-Ran! -Hey! Conan.

332
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,491
No.

333
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:58,391
This is no ordinary murder.

334
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:01,291
This is an impossible crime!

335
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,891
What's the matter, Conan?

336
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,791
What's with that frightening look of yours?

337
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,191
Hey.

338
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,191
Don't you think there's something strange

339
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:10,791
about this spilled coffee?

340
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,991
Like I said, the saucer was...

341
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:14,891
It's the floor. The floor.

342
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:17,891
Huh? What's strange?

343
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:21,491
The spilled coffee went from the table to the chair.

344
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,391
Then it spilled along the leg of the chair

345
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:26,791
and dripped onto the carpet on the floor.

346
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,691
That's the front leg to the left.

347
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:33,191
Look slightly to the front part of the front right leg of the chair.

348
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,991
There is a round empty space around the coffee stain.

349
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:39,491
This shows that when the coffee spilled,

350
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:42,991
the front right leg of the chair was there, right?

351
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:44,091
Yeah.

352
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,191
Why did the chair move?

353
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:49,791
Because for some reason, he moved it

354
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,691
when he came into this room.

355
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,591
That's enough!

356
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,291
But isn't it strange

357
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,691
where the stain is, if he moved it

358
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:00,091
after the coffee dried up?

359
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:03,891
That's why. Take a good look.

360
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:07,891
First, the chair was placed this way.

361
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:09,291
See.

362
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,891
If you match the stain to the right front leg,

363
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:14,491
the stain on the other side falls out of place.

364
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,891
So that means when the coffee first spilled,

365
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:20,991
the chair was placed this way.

366
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:22,091
But before the coffee spilled

367
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:24,291
and went down the left front leg of the chair,

368
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,891
the chair moved this way, right?

369
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:30,791
That's true, but the chair couldn't have moved on its own.

370
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,791
Other person couldn't have been sitting in the chair either.

371
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:38,391
Yes.

372
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:40,791
This is obvious proof that when the coffee spilled,

373
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:45,791
someone was sitting on this chair.

374
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,291
Right, Pops?

375
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,891
Yeah.

376
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:52,491
Hold... Hold it there!

377
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:57,291
That means if the front door was locked and chain-locked too,

378
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,991
and all that was found in the room was the dead body,

379
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,291
don't tell me that...

380
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,491
It's an impossible crime.

381
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:08,391
It's a locked room murder.

382
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,791
It could be that when we entered the room,

383
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:15,991
the killer was still hiding inside, and escaped amidst the commotion.

384
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,891
I don't think so.

385
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:23,591
Because I stayed by the front door after Conan told me to do so,

386
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:27,591
but no one other than the police went through the door.

387
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:29,491
What?

388
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:32,591
Yes. This is an impossible crime.

389
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,591
A locked room murder.

390
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:37,191
The TV producer, Mr. Raisaku Nakame

391
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:40,291
drank poisoned coffee and was murdered.

392
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,591
The coffee that spilled on the table dried up,

393
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:48,391
and deception was schemed by placing a saucer under the coffee cup.

394
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,591
Based on this situation,

395
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:52,191
it was deduced that when Mr. Nakame drank the poisoned coffee,

396
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:56,091
the killer was no longer in the room.

397
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:58,191
The only one capable of scheming the deception

398
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,991
would've been Mr. Somei, the first one who entered the room.

399
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:06,391
However, from the coffee stain found on the floor

400
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,991
that was out of place from the position of the leg of the chair,

401
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:10,391
it became clear

402
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:14,191
that someone was sitting on that chair at the time the coffee spilled.

403
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:16,491
If that someone is the killer,

404
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:19,691
how did he get out of this room?

405
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:21,691
When we arrived at the condo,

406
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:25,091
the front door was locked and even chain-locked.

407
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:28,091
This locked room murder...

408
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:31,991
What kind of trick did the killer use?

409
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:02,191
Why are you making that sound again?

410
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,591
Come on, it's the third time today.

411
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:06,791
He said that he's hungry

412
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:10,191
and wants to eat the cake that's on the table.

413
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:14,391
The aroma of coffee. Just as I thought.

414
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:18,391
If so, there is only one answer.

415
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:23,191
The one and only sad truth.

416
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:28,091
Next Conan, "Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 2)"

417
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:46,491
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:48,591
"Cake"

419
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:50,491
-I want to eat some cake. I want it. -No, that's not the hint.

420
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:51,791
-I want to eat it. -Read it the other way around.

421
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,070
You mean, "ekac"?
