1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:02,005
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:03,805
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:05,705
The unlucky day calendar is a point of concern.

4
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,405
An apparition is created from a nightmare.

5
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:09,405
Homicide despite tight security.

6
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:10,805
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,806 --> 00:00:12,605
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:15,006
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,290
Evil spirit?

10
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,290
You're asking me to get rid of the curse of an evil spirit?

11
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,990
Yes. Well, to put it straightforwardly...

12
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,990
You see, a detective solves cases.

13
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:09,690
Of course,

14
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:13,090
we've asked priests and clairvoyants to try and perform exorcisms,

15
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,890
but nothing seems to be working so far.

16
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:18,290
So we have gone for the last resort, the Mouri Detective Agency

17
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,790
in hopes that you may be able

18
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,790
to solve this paranormal phenomena scientifically.

19
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,690
And? Just what is that paranormal phenomenon?

20
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,390
It all started with a nightmare

21
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:30,390
that the master of the house had seen two years ago.

22
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,690
A nightmare?

23
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:33,290
He jumped up from bed

24
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,990
screaming in a chilling voice that wasn't from this world.

25
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:35,991
And when I opened the door,

26
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:37,990
he said, "It's a curse. I'm going to be killed."

27
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,490
He keeps on repeating those words again and again.

28
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:43,190
But that was only a dream, right?

29
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:46,091
Of course, that's not the only thing!

30
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:50,790
Six months after that, the brakes of this car that the master was riding

31
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,490
went out of control and he barely escaped a big accident.

32
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:56,190
Isn't it right, Mr. Watabiki? You remember it, don't you?

33
00:02:56,191 --> 00:03:01,190
Yes. I didn't realize that the brake oil was leaking.

34
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:03,290
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:07,290
Because of that accident, the master came down with a heart ailment.

36
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,590
His eye became sunken and his hair turned completely white.

37
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:14,390
But it can also be considered a mere accident.

38
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:16,390
In what way is an evil spirit involved?

39
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,390
We can't help but think it's the doings of an evil spirit.

40
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,590
With this kind of card being sent to us.

41
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:24,390
Card?

42
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:31,191
"Atone your sins before I shall awaken. I am the fifth soul."

43
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:38,291
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (The Case)"

44
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,990
And when did you get this card?

45
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,090
Around a little after New Year's Day last year.

46
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,690
It was in the mailbox.

47
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:49,090
At first, we thought it was just a prank,

48
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:54,090
but when I showed it to the master, his wife was also very surprised.

49
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:56,490
-His wife was also surprised? -Yes.

50
00:03:56,491 --> 00:04:01,390
Then six months later, the dish cabinet suddenly toppled over.

51
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,890
Furthermore in April of this year,

52
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:06,090
a strange sound was heard from inside the house

53
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,890
where only the master and his wife were supposed to be.

54
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:11,890
Was there something in common about the days when strange things happened?

55
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,590
Like things always happened on Friday the 13th or something like that.

56
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:17,190
No.

57
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,890
The days were at random,

58
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,890
but the date was always on the 4th.

59
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:25,890
Then maybe something happened on the 4th previously?

60
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:30,190
But no one has any idea.

61
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,990
Today is October 3rd,

62
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:36,690
so tomorrow is the problem date, the 4th.

63
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:38,891
That's true.

64
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:45,190
It seems that strange things happened five times so far.

65
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,990
Do you remember what year and what month it was?

66
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:50,590
No, I don't.

67
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,091
I do!

68
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:57,290
At first,

69
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:01,290
two years ago on February 4th, the master had a nightmare.

70
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,390
Then he got into an accident in the same year on July 4th.

71
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:08,390
A year ago, on February 4th, a strange card was found in the mailbox

72
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:12,090
and on July 4th the same year, the dish cabinet fell.

73
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:16,091
On April 4th this year, a strange sound was heard from inside the house.

74
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,890
You've taken notes of everything!

75
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:23,890
Yes. I have to write things down because I'm so forgetful.

76
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,490
He's just like you, Conan.

77
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,691
Right.

78
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:36,890
Maybe the sender of this card is up to something.

79
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:40,590
By the way, don't you sense anything about this card?

80
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,790
Sense something? You mean like something spiritual?

81
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,690
Well, you know...

82
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,191
Well, if you don't sense anything...

83
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,790
I heard differently!

84
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,290
I thought we were going to have just one guest?

85
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:03,690
I'm sorry. My daughter insisted on coming so.

86
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,190
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:08,190
No, I'm not angry at you people!

88
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:11,690
I'm angry at this old man here who didn't bother to contact me!

89
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:13,490
Old man...

90
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:14,990
Namika.

91
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,390
I've got to go and shop for more stuff then.

92
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:20,590
You sure have a perky daughter.

93
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:23,190
No. She's the chef.

94
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:24,290
Chef?

95
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:29,490
Her father used to be the chef for the Kunitomo family.

96
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:33,491
But he died of an accident and she succeeded him.

97
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,090
She's still so young.

98
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:40,390
Come to think of it, he also took after his father.

99
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:41,990
That's right, Mr. Watabiki!

100
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:46,890
The master will be going to the University Hospital at 20:00 tonight.

101
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:48,790
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,490
Huh?

103
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,190
Out of ink?

104
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:54,191
Here!

105
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,090
Use this.

106
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:58,891
Thank you.

107
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,691
I'm sorry. Please don't be offended.

108
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:13,090
I experienced food poisoning when I was a child.

109
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:16,790
And since then I've become a neat paranoiac.

110
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,690
Here you go. Thank you.

111
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:21,391
Okay.

112
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:24,290
Conan?

113
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,490
We're going to leave you behind.

114
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:28,090
Leave him! Leave him!

115
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:31,090
The master and his wife?

116
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:34,890
I saw them a while ago in the third floor bedroom.

117
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:36,590
Okay.

118
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:37,890
Huh?

119
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,290
What is it?

120
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,990
You sure look like the chef we saw a while ago.

121
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,490
It hurts!

122
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:45,090
Dad!

123
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,090
Of course we look alike!

124
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,090
Namika is my daughter.

125
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,990
No wonder.

126
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:54,690
And please don't point your finger at me, okay?

127
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,990
I have belonephobia.

128
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,790
I see.

129
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,090
Belonephobia?

130
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,991
Dad.

131
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:08,990
If you have a message for the master, shall I go relay it for you?

132
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:12,090
No. I'll go see him myself.

133
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,691
By the way, Shigeko. That picture...

134
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,690
Will you please fix it in place?

135
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:23,091
I think it is about five millimetres tilted to the right.

136
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:26,990
Huh?

137
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,890
Five millimetres?

138
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:31,090
Yes, sir!

139
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,590
Thank you.

140
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:35,391
Shall we go, then?

141
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:49,290
What a strange place for a door to be.

142
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,990
Oh, that's the door

143
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,090
that a friend of Mrs. Kunitomo installed

144
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:56,690
after they received that weird card.

145
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:59,491
It's quite some door.

146
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:06,491
You push the passcode like so and place your index finger here.

147
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,690
Who is it?

148
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:15,890
I'm Akatsuka, the steward.

149
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:18,890
I've brought Detective Mouri with me.

150
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,991
I'll open the door right away.

151
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:25,190
Like so.

152
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,290
Fantastic!

153
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,790
It's made so that the bell doesn't ring inside

154
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:34,090
unless it's the registered fingerprints of a family member.

155
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:36,190
It's just like some science fiction movie.

156
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:38,491
It's not science fiction at all.

157
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:46,790
There are condos equipped with fingerprint recognition machines nowadays.

158
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:50,290
Although it's not that all widespread yet.

159
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,291
Right.

160
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,790
This is Mrs. Yasue Kunitomo, and the person to the left

161
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:59,390
is the person who made the door, Mrs. Kunitomo's friend, Mr. Sekiguchi.

162
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:03,990
It seems that someone who was inside opened this door a while ago,

163
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:06,490
but what if nobody is on the third floor either?

164
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,190
No one can open the door.

165
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,890
Except for my husband whose fingerprints

166
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,690
are set inside the fingerprint recognition machine.

167
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:14,790
Anyone in this house can go out

168
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,991
by placing his finger on the machine though.

169
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:20,090
I'd like to give it a try.

170
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:21,491
Don't touch it!

171
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,590
When someone from outside places his finger on the machine,

172
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,290
the alarm within the house will go off

173
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,390
and the people from the security office will rush over here!

174
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:31,390
It hurts.

175
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:34,590
I also thought that we should put up surveillance cameras too, but...

176
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:36,990
I told him not to do it.

177
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,890
A camera at the front entrance is okay,

178
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:42,190
but I'm setting up such exaggerated security precautions

179
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:46,090
in this fine house that my father had built.

180
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,990
I think it has enough exaggerated security precautions already.

181
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:52,690
You're Mr. Mouri, the renown detective!

182
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:54,691
Yes.

183
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:59,190
I'm Kunitomo, the one who asked for you.

184
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,390
It hurts...

185
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:03,090
I'm counting on you as far as the investigation is concerned.

186
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:04,191
Yes, sir.

187
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,290
I shall give you a quick tour of the house then.

188
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,691
Thank you.

189
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:18,790
Kid, hurry up!

190
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,491
Okay!

191
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:29,990
Are you sure it's okay calling a detective over?

192
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:32,490
If he finds out about the, you know what...

193
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,990
He won't. There's no evidence of it anywhere anymore.

194
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,990
But from what was written on that card...

195
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,590
That's why we hired a detective.

196
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:45,690
To have him catch the one who is blackmailing us

197
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:48,391
and find out how far he knows, right?

198
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:52,891
Wait! I'll go get your medicine right away.

199
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,091
Here, your medicine!

200
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,890
Hey, are you okay?

201
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,090
At the rate you're going,

202
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,890
you're going to drop dead before we catch the culprit.

203
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:10,090
Watch your mouth!

204
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:12,990
You're the one to blame for what happened to begin with, you know!

205
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:15,890
That's why I'm here, aren't I?

206
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:18,590
Tomorrow's the X Day in question, right?

207
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:19,790
Yes.

208
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,691
The day that this mansion's mouse begins to move.

209
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:48,254
And?

210
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,755
How is it?

211
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:53,454
How?

212
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:54,654
It's good of course.

213
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,554
Oh, no. I'm not talking about the food,

214
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,355
but the investigation.

215
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:02,755
I can't say yet, for now.

216
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:08,354
Even if someone were to set it up,

217
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,654
so that the dish cabinet would fall or queer sounds would be made,

218
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:14,054
I'm sure the gadgets would've been retrieved by now.

219
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:15,454
Not again!

220
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:17,654
Wearing gloves when eating.

221
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:20,154
Everything's washed clean. How rude!

222
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:21,454
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:25,354
It's about time I take the master to the hospital.

224
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:28,755
Why don't you at least drink your coffee before you go?

225
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:36,354
Those two get along well, don't they?

226
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:40,154
Yes. Their parents were best friends and they're childhood friends.

227
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,954
Excuse me. Could I have some coffee, too?

228
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,255
Here.

229
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:47,855
Huh?

230
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:52,254
Here, give it to me.

231
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,754
I'm sorry, mother.

232
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:56,854
She's acrophobic,

233
00:13:56,855 --> 00:14:00,854
so she can't go near a window that's more than second floors high.

234
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:04,854
By the way, that steward is a meticulous perfectionist

235
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:07,154
and hates things that are crooked.

236
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:11,455
Even if it's a tablecloth, if he finds that it's crooked...

237
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:13,755
See!

238
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,554
What is wrong with this house?

239
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:25,355
Neat paranoiac, onephobia, acrophobe, and a meticulous perfectionist.

240
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:28,654
I took the job only because

241
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:33,154
I thought we could spend the night at the mansion of a tycoon in Shizuoka.

242
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:34,954
Conan, we should've stayed home

243
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:37,654
if this kind of spook story was going to come up, right?

244
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:39,454
What're you looking at?

245
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:40,854
Oh, well...

246
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:44,254
The dates of the five incidents that happened here.

247
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,054
The first one was two years ago on February 4th.

248
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:48,954
The next one was on July 4th.

249
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,754
Last year, it also happened on February 4th and July 4th.

250
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:54,554
And this year, it's April the 4th, right?

251
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:57,054
I wonder why it's April 4th only this year?

252
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:59,154
Beats me. If it's the 5th,

253
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:04,354
Dad was out on February 5th and July 5th last year and two years ago.

254
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:05,355
Huh?

255
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:08,554
Don't you remember? You went to a wedding, helped people move

256
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:10,554
and went on a trip with the community committee.

257
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:11,555
Come to think of it,

258
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:14,554
I went to a wedding on the 5th of April this year, too.

259
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:19,754
A lucky day is usually chosen for weddings, trips and moving, right?

260
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,454
Yes.

261
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:22,654
Right.

262
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,954
Which means the day before those days are all Butsumetsu?

263
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:29,254
Butsumetsu?

264
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:30,654
Wait!

265
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:32,154
If I remember correctly, the supermarket

266
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:35,354
will be having a grand opening on October 5th, the day after tomorrow.

267
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:36,954
So what does that mean?

268
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:39,554
Does that mean that tomorrow, October the 4th is Butsumetsu

269
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:41,054
and something's going to happen?

270
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,355
To be exact, it's already today.

271
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:46,655
What was that?

272
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,255
What was that sound?

273
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,255
A shoe?

274
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:24,854
Mr. Akatsuka? This is Yasue.

275
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,954
We got a flat tire so we were a bit stalled.

276
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:32,154
We're late, but we should be arriving there soon.

277
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:36,054
What? Mr. Sekiguchi?

278
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:40,554
Yes. On the veranda where your bedroom is.

279
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:43,154
We called the ambulance and the police right away,

280
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:45,854
but the only person who can enter the third floor is Mr. Kunitomo,

281
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,954
so no one has gone in yet.

282
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,655
Please hurry back!

283
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:53,254
What on earth is going on?

284
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:57,254
It's a curse. It's an evil spirit after all.

285
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:58,555
Dear?

286
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,055
Here is your medicine!

287
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,654
Mr. Watabiki, please hurry!

288
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:09,555
Yes! I'll try my best.

289
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:18,354
The victim is Mr. Toshimichi Sekiguchi, age 43.

290
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:24,455
The estimated time of death is 4 hours ago between 20:30 to 21:00.

291
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:30,254
Mr. Sekiguchi was your friend, Mrs. Yasue Kunitomo.

292
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:33,354
Yes. We were classmates in high school.

293
00:17:33,355 --> 00:17:35,655
He is the president of a security company now.

294
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,854
Which means that the fingerprint recognition device installed

295
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:42,854
at the entrance of the third floor was put there by Mr. Sekiguchi, right?

296
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,254
Yes.

297
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:49,254
Would you please tell me where you were between 20:30 and 21:00?

298
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:52,955
I was in the car. On my way to the hospital with my husband.

299
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:57,354
My husband has a heart ailment so on the 3rd of every month,

300
00:17:57,355 --> 00:18:00,954
we go to doctor acquaintance of ours to have him checked.

301
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,654
What time did you leave the house?

302
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:05,154
I think it was just about 20:00.

303
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:07,654
Are you suspecting us?

304
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:13,854
I'm sure that Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo left here at 20:00!

305
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:16,154
I see.

306
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:18,954
I came here to the 3rd floor

307
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:23,454
at 5 minutes to 20:00 in order to take the two to the car.

308
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:28,254
Besides, at that time, Mr. Sekiguchi was alive.

309
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:30,754
I see.

310
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:36,054
Could Mr. Sekiguchi have committed suicide?

311
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:40,654
Well, there are some queer points as to his death.

312
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:43,554
The position of the rope that he put his neck through

313
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,854
is much too close to the railing of the veranda!

314
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:49,154
Well, he could've done so even if he was close.

315
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:51,954
But he would've had an extremely difficult time doing so.

316
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:56,954
So this may be homicide made to look like a suicide.

317
00:18:56,955 --> 00:19:00,854
Well, we can't tell whether it's suicide or homicide yet, but...

318
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:05,054
This card that reads, "I atone my sins of 13 years ago"

319
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:08,154
is sure to be the key to solving the case.

320
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:11,155
Mr. Mouri, where did you get that?

321
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:16,654
I found it in Mr. Sekiguchi's clothes before the police got here.

322
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,254
You shouldn't do stuff like that on your own.

323
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:23,554
Right, that's why I gave him a good licking.

324
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:25,554
Huh?

325
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,654
Isn't that right, kid?

326
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:30,654
What is this card anyway?

327
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:32,654
A sin of 13 years ago?

328
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,054
Beats me.

329
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:37,554
It kind of looks to be a dying message, too.

330
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:39,954
But I guess we can ask the three who went pale

331
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:42,555
when they saw this card for the details?

332
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:47,254
What seems to be the matter?

333
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:50,255
Does something 13 years ago come to mind?

334
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,854
It was just about 13 years ago.

335
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:58,854
The master's cruiser had a marine accident.

336
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:00,454
Marine accident?

337
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:05,154
Yes. Back then, every year, just about this time,

338
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:10,554
it was usual practice for all of us here to go cruising on master's boat,

339
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:12,554
but it got stranded off shore the Suruga Bay.

340
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:13,854
Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo

341
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:16,154
and Mr. Sekiguchi who just happened to be sailing that day

342
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:18,454
somehow made it to safety.

343
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:21,154
And what about the others?

344
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:24,854
The whereabouts of everyone else is unknown.

345
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:27,754
The ship that sunk hasn't been found yet either.

346
00:20:27,755 --> 00:20:32,654
Could it be that Mr. Sekuguchi caused the ship to sink

347
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:35,454
so someone had a grudge against him?

348
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,154
Well, I hate the sea.

349
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,954
So I never went with them.

350
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:44,155
Since you two were saved, you know what happened, don't you?

351
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:48,454
The reason why the ship sank.

352
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,354
No. Because I was sleeping

353
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,654
when Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly shouted to run for it.

354
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:56,655
We were desperate to flee that we didn't know what was going on.

355
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:01,054
Is there anybody here that is the bereaved family of a victim

356
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,854
of that accident and working here?

357
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:04,554
Yes.

358
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,554
Which means that this case may also be connected

359
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:10,754
in some way to the five others incidents that happened here.

360
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:13,454
Five incidents?

361
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,454
It happened.

362
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:17,854
Mr. Kunitomo had nightmares.

363
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,254
The car brakes didn't function.

364
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:23,354
The dish cabinet falls down in the middle of the night.

365
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:24,954
And strange sounds are heard

366
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:26,655
at a place where no one is supposed to be there.

367
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:34,654
And to top things off is this card that was found directly in the mailbox.

368
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:36,855
Please wait a minute.

369
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:42,154
It looks exactly like the card that was found in on Mr. Sekiguchi.

370
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:46,554
Moreover, if all the incidents are happening on "Butsumetsu the 4th",

371
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,254
it's natural to think that someone in this house

372
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:52,154
is up to something, isn't it?

373
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:55,854
I see. Someone who is still working here

374
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:59,454
and is a bereaved family member of the victim of the accident.

375
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:00,954
That person may have thought

376
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:04,355
that Mr. Sekiguchi was responsible for the accident and killed him.

377
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:10,154
So please call the people who fit in to this category here.

378
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:12,155
Yes, sir.

379
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:15,354
Mr. Sekiguchi's wristwatch...

380
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,055
Something's engraved on it.

381
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:20,554
"E" and "N"?

382
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:23,254
"E" and "N" would usually mean...

383
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:26,354
Huh? Maybe not...

384
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:27,855
Which means...

385
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:59,654
"Next Episode."

386
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:02,354
This is absurd!

387
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:05,454
The thing that bothers me is that rope.

388
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:07,555
If my deduction is correct...

389
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,254
Mrs. Kunitomo!

390
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:12,454
It's a curse after all.

391
00:24:12,455 --> 00:24:14,955
I'm sure Mr. Kunitomo also saw that ghost!

392
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,855
Hurry up and open the door!

393
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:21,754
Intruder!

394
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:27,655
Next Conan, "The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Suspicion)"

395
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:45,854
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:47,654
"Fingerprint."

397
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,654
-Conan, show me your fingerprint. -Okay.

398
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,154
Your fingerprint is just like Shinichi's.

399
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,655
Surprised?
