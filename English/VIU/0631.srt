1
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:09,423
Oh no! I'm late!

2
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:21,623
You're late.

3
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:23,723
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,723
Where're Genta and Mitsuhiko?

5
00:00:30,723 --> 00:00:32,423
Oh boy.

6
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:40,023
-What the? That hurts! -I'm sorry!

7
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:41,323
My hand slipped.

8
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:44,423
It's because you twirl it around exerting too much strength.

9
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:46,223
I've only got two more days to go,

10
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,423
so that's why I get a bit carried away!

11
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:51,623
The renovation of the flower clock that took quite a while

12
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:53,323
has finally been completed

13
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:55,223
and an event celebrating the renovated flower clock being displayed

14
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,923
is going to be held.

15
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:57,923
Ayumi was chosen as

16
00:00:57,923 --> 00:01:02,023
one of the grade school baton twirlers to perform there.

17
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:04,423
That's why she practices like this every morning.

18
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:14,923
It's him.

19
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,823
Like the fog clears.

20
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:23,923
Let's see through love and crime as well.

21
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:25,723
A mysterious incident that occurs at a park.

22
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:27,623
The flower clock knows the truth.

23
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:29,223
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,123
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:33,523
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:20,123
"The Flower Clock Knows"

27
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:25,323
-So, he's the stalker? -Yep.

28
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:27,423
He was here yesterday and the day before yesterday, too.

29
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,923
I'm glad we came to serve as your bodyguards!

30
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:32,223
-Yes. -You can count on us!

31
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:35,123
Hey, hey. Cut it out, will you?

32
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:37,223
Ayumi's afraid, can't you see?

33
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:38,423
Be careful!

34
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,723
You don't know what kind of person he could be.

35
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,723
He stinks of liquor!

36
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:53,723
What's wrong?

37
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:55,423
Are you okay?

38
00:03:58,223 --> 00:04:00,923
If he climbs up some place like that drunk...

39
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:02,623
Is he drunk?

40
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:05,523
Yeah, he really smelled of liquor.

41
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:11,323
If he falls from that height,

42
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:13,123
he's gonna be more than wounded.

43
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:31,923
I'm sorry, everybody.

44
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,723
For making you get up so early.

45
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:35,023
It's okay

46
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:37,323
because we all agreed to do so.

47
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:40,623
Besides, we can't let you go to a place

48
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:43,423
where a man like that appears all by yourself, you know.

49
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:45,423
Thank you, Ai.

50
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:49,923
I know I've seen that cap and coat somewhere before.

51
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,423
Do you know him?

52
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,723
I can't really say.

53
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:56,223
I'm sure I could tell if I saw his face, though.

54
00:04:56,223 --> 00:05:00,123
Didn't you get to see his face when he exhaled on you?

55
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:03,223
He was wearing his cap deeply over his head, you see.

56
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:05,723
"The next day" -I wonder if he's coming today, too.

57
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,923
If he comes, I'll make sure we disclose his identity today!

58
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,323
Sure thing!

59
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:19,523
Isn't he the one?

60
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:26,123
Is he dead?

61
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:27,623
Yeah.

62
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:31,823
A scratch wound on his cheek.

63
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:34,523
Did he get it cut by the tip of the needle?

64
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,323
He sure is skinny, isn't he?

65
00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:44,323
Paint?

66
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,923
So, he was a stalker!

67
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:52,923
He was after Ayumi who was practicing from early morning!

68
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:54,823
He came yesterday, too!

69
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,823
He seemed totally wasted!

70
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,223
And he climbed this arch.

71
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:01,823
He climbed this arch drunk?

72
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:04,423
He almost dangerously fell off.

73
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:07,923
The dead body was pretty stink with liquor, too.

74
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:09,323
Inspector!

75
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:13,223
He's the security guard who made rounds around this park last night.

76
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:14,723
Thank you for coming.

77
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:19,123
About what time did you make your rounds around this flower clock?

78
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:21,623
I start my rounds from 3:00 a.m.

79
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:24,223
I came and checked the area around this flower clock

80
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:26,523
about 3:50 a.m.

81
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,123
Did you see the dead body then?

82
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:29,823
No, it wasn't there.

83
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,523
There were no signs of the flowers being messed up either.

84
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:36,923
This is an accident.

85
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:38,223
Mr. Mouri.

86
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,423
What brings you here?

87
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:42,123
Ran told me to come get Conan

88
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:44,623
because he hasn't come home yet, so...

89
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:47,623
The stone that stands for "6" on the face of the clock

90
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:49,723
is located right below the arch.

91
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:53,323
In other words, he climbed the arch drunk, fell

92
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:56,423
and hit his head on this stone.

93
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:58,223
I guess that's what roughly happened.

94
00:06:58,223 --> 00:06:59,723
It looks to be so.

95
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:05,023
And the man died between 03:50 to 04:30.

96
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:07,323
Since the man had a scratch wound on his cheek

97
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:09,623
that was made by the long hand of the clock,

98
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:11,423
I think that after the man fell,

99
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,923
the hand of the clock pointed to 30 minutes.

100
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:17,223
What time did you all come here?

101
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:19,023
Let's see...

102
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:22,023
About 05:20.

103
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:26,823
In other words, the man got wounded on his cheek at 04:30.

104
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:30,923
Okay, then Mr. Mouri,

105
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:33,623
will you take the children home?

106
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,923
Huh? You mean you want me to take them home?

107
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,023
You came to pick them up, didn't you?

108
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,523
This case is an accident,

109
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:42,623
so all I have left to do is to confirm the man's identity.

110
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:44,723
I've got a rough idea who is he already anyway.

111
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,623
Huh? What's that?

112
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:49,123
Isn't he a painter?

113
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,923
He had paint traces on his hand.

114
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:56,423
He could've got something like that on himself anywhere.

115
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:58,623
But he had old paint stains

116
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:01,423
that were deep into the wrinkles of his palm too,

117
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:04,323
so I'm sure he's somebody that used paint all the time.

118
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,623
It's just as Conan says.

119
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:08,723
Well, that's the way it is.

120
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,923
So, there's no need for Sleeping Kogoro

121
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,223
to come to the scene this time.

122
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:14,023
I guess not.

123
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:16,123
Okay, you guys, let's head home!

124
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:17,423
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

125
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:21,523
What is it all of a sudden?

126
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:23,523
I remember now!

127
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:26,223
I remember where I met that man.

128
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:29,223
He came over to our store once to buy liquor!

129
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,323
Thanks to Genta's father's testimony,

130
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:34,123
we found out that the man was a factory worker

131
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:36,323
at a sign factory in the neighborhood.

132
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:37,623
No doubt about it.

133
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:40,223
This is Shosaku Yoda, who works for us.

134
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:42,623
So, he got drunk and died.

135
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,223
Just as would be expected of him.

136
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,323
Did he have a bad habit with liquor to begin with?

137
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:48,323
Yeah.

138
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:51,723
When drunk, he used to feel brave and get violent.

139
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:54,323
Super awesome!

140
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:57,023
That's Yoda's last work.

141
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:59,823
Huh? It's broken.

142
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:03,023
The other day, Yoda tried to put the sign up while drunk

143
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:05,323
and fell along with the sign.

144
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:08,523
Ever since then, he became afraid of high places,

145
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:12,123
rested work and soaked himself in liquor.

146
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:13,823
Afraid of high places?

147
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:15,323
But he...

148
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:25,023
Will you please give us the details?

149
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:29,723
The culprit got the better of us.

150
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:31,623
Just what do you mean, Conan?

151
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:34,623
Mr. Yoda was afraid of heights.

152
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:37,523
How could a person like that climb up the arch?

153
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:42,423
Then, who was it that appeared before us?

154
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:44,523
Most probably the culprit.

155
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:47,923
Without knowing that Mr. Yoda had become afraid of heights,

156
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:51,023
he pretended to be Mr. Yoda and repeated weird actions.

157
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,323
By doing so, he wanted to make a homicide look like an accident.

158
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:56,323
No way.

159
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:59,323
He probably used Ayumi who was practicing

160
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:01,923
to set her up as an eye-witness.

161
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:03,123
How ruthless!

162
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:05,623
How dare he use Ayumi for something like that.

163
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:07,723
-He can't be forgiven! -Right!

164
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:10,723
Let's find the culprit for her sake!

165
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:11,723
Yes!

166
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:14,723
Check the scene of the crime 100 times.

167
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:17,923
That's the basis of an investigation!

168
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:20,323
Right.

169
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:21,423
Hide!

170
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,723
"Kyoichiro Kawaguchi (30), PE teacher" -Mr. Kyoichiro Kawaguchi.

171
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:29,123
You're a PE teacher at a high school in Niigata, aren't you?

172
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,123
Yes, that's right.

173
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:34,223
You know Mr. Shosaku Yoda, don't you?

174
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:36,523
Of course, I know him well.

175
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:40,023
He's one person I can't stop hating.

176
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,523
Mr. Yoda who was working as an art teacher

177
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:45,523
at the same high school as you three years ago,

178
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:46,923
fell in love with your lover who was also

179
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,523
an English teacher at the same high school

180
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,123
and took her away from you.

181
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:54,723
Mr. Yoda who aggressively made her go driving with him one day,

182
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:56,423
got into an accident along the way

183
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,123
and only she ended up dead.

184
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:01,423
That was no accident.

185
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:03,223
Yoda made it look like an accident

186
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:05,423
and killed my lover!

187
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,623
You've been staying over at a business hotel

188
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:11,623
in front of Haido Station since a week ago, haven't you?

189
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:14,323
I came to look for Yoda

190
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:16,523
because I heard rumors that he was in this area.

191
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,223
By the way, where were you

192
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:23,023
between the hours of 03:50 to 04:30 last night?

193
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,723
You want my alibi?

194
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:26,523
I sure am lucky.

195
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:28,423
What do you mean?

196
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:31,523
Please contact 119

197
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:34,023
and ask them when I called the ambulance.

198
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:35,523
Ambulance?

199
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,623
I'm a scatterbrain, you see.

200
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,523
I mistakenly drank a button type battery

201
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:42,423
along with the medicine tablet I took.

202
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:44,723
That's why I called an ambulance.

203
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:46,423
Well, but after I was examined at the hospital,

204
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:49,523
it turned out that I just drank a plain button so all was well.

205
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:51,123
Pretty sure it was about 3:30

206
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:53,023
when they transported me to the hospital.

207
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:56,123
And it was after 4:30 when they discharged me.

208
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,723
From that hospital to this park,

209
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:02,523
no matter how I hard I try, it would take 20 minutes.

210
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,623
You can also confirm with the hospital.

211
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,223
By doing so, you'll find that

212
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:09,223
it was impossible for me to commit the crime.

213
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:11,723
Please check well.

214
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,523
That man has an alibi

215
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:21,223
that he was at the hospital from 03:30 to 04:30.

216
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,323
He put the victim to sleep using sleeping pills

217
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:24,523
and wounded the cheek of his victim

218
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:26,623
with the hand of the clock beforehand.

219
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:28,023
After leaving the hospital,

220
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:30,323
he could've hit the head of the victim using the stone

221
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:33,323
that is used on the face of the clock and killed him.

222
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:34,323
No.

223
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:37,923
His estimated time of death is between 04:00 and 05:00,

224
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,023
so time wise it's possible.

225
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:41,123
But, as for the wound on his cheek,

226
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:44,223
it seems there's no doubt that it was put there after he died,

227
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,923
so it would be impossible.

228
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:47,223
Is that so?

229
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:49,223
In addition, it seems that

230
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:52,923
small pieces of the stone were found on the wound,

231
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:55,523
so there's probably no doubt that the crime was committed here.

232
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:59,423
You sure do know a lot.

233
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:03,823
No. Well, Pops got the information from the police.

234
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:06,123
So, you used Detective Mouri's voice again

235
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:08,223
and got information from the police, huh?

236
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:11,623
The paint that was on the victim's hand,

237
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,923
wasn't there anything characteristic about it?

238
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:15,523
No, I was told that

239
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:17,623
it was ordinary paint that you could find anywhere.

240
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,723
Since he was a sign maker,

241
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:21,223
I guess there's nothing strange about him

242
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:22,923
having paint on his hands, is there?

243
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:26,923
It seems that he'd been absent from work recently.

244
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:29,123
Despite that it bothers me

245
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:30,723
that he had new paint traces on his hands.

246
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:32,423
I see.

247
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,423
What's this door?

248
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:37,723
The device room of the clock, right?

249
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:40,523
What's the matter, Conan?

250
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:43,423
The chain sealing the door off has been broken into.

251
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,223
What's going on?

252
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,323
Hey, hey!

253
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:48,623
Just what're you doing there?

254
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,623
This chain's been broken.

255
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:53,023
What?

256
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,123
True. Who'd do something like this?

257
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:59,523
This is the clock's device room, right?

258
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:02,823
Right. But when they renovated the flower clock,

259
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:05,023
they started using a thing called "moveless drive"

260
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:08,523
in which the movable parts are built in,

261
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:10,423
so it should be empty inside.

262
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:13,423
It's being used as storage space.

263
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:15,623
Paint is spilt on the floor.

264
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:18,523
It's the same color as the one that was on the victim's hands.

265
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:23,623
It's dried.

266
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:25,423
So, this isn't where he got the paint on.

267
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:28,423
Hey, what's going on?

268
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:32,023
Hey!

269
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:35,923
This is...

270
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:40,623
Are you all right, all of you?

271
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:41,923
Conan?

272
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,323
Sonny, let's go.

273
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:48,943
Did you figure something out?

274
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:50,043
Yeah.

275
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:53,543
I'm pretty sure that the guy called Kawaguchi is the culprit.

276
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:56,343
But he's got an alibi, you know?

277
00:14:56,343 --> 00:15:00,043
I hear that the stones on the face of the clock are fixed on tightly,

278
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:03,243
so I'm sure that the crime was committed near the flower clock.

279
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:06,343
And the only time the culprit could've committed the crime

280
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:09,043
without messing up the flowers on the face of the clock

281
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,943
and wound the victim with the needle of the clock is around "30..."

282
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,043
However...

283
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,243
The only time he could've committed the crime would've been 04:30,

284
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:17,743
but he had just left the hospital around that time.

285
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:19,843
Let's play see-saw next!

286
00:15:21,443 --> 00:15:23,143
Genta!

287
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,743
Are you all right?

288
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:26,343
Ouch, ouch...

289
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,843
I hit my head.

290
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,843
You scraped your cheek.

291
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,343
I get it!

292
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:35,243
That's how he did it!

293
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:36,743
Conan!

294
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:38,743
Let's go after him!

295
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:53,643
It's just as I thought.

296
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:56,343
Conan, what's wrong?

297
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:58,443
Did you figure something out?

298
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:01,143
-Yeah. -Hey, you guys!

299
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,143
What're you doing there?

300
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:06,043
Just the right timing to get here, Pops.

301
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:09,143
Hurry on home and do your homework!

302
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:11,043
And, Mr. Mouri,

303
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:14,043
what is it you wanted to talk to us about?

304
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:17,743
A drinking friend of mine knows Mr. Yoda

305
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,943
and told me something unexpected about him.

306
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:22,943
Something unexpected?

307
00:16:22,943 --> 00:16:27,843
The fact is, last month while putting up a sign, Mr. Yoda fell down

308
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:31,443
and since then have had a fear of heights!

309
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:34,043
I've heard about that already.

310
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:38,043
Huh? Then, what about the traffic accident

311
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:40,443
when he ended up killing a woman?

312
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,543
I've got a report on that, too.

313
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,543
That woman was my lover.

314
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:49,443
Who could you be?

315
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,043
My name's Kawaguchi.

316
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,143
I'm a prime suspect for now.

317
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,243
Is that correct?

318
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:58,343
Now all the performers have gathered.

319
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:01,643
Mr. Kawaguchi, what brings you here?

320
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:03,443
I figured that I'd come to see

321
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:07,343
the place where Yoda died before leaving for Niigata.

322
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:10,243
No, I can't let you leave yet.

323
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:13,443
But you did confirm with the hospital, didn't you?

324
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:17,243
If so, you must've found out that I'm not the culprit, correct?

325
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:20,143
So, if you will excuse me.

326
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:22,543
Hold it!

327
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,043
No, I said nothing.

328
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:29,443
I'm spinning, spinning.

329
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,243
Round and round...

330
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:35,743
I'm not finished with my story yet, Mr. Kawaguchi.

331
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:40,043
So, you're the famous Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

332
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:42,543
What more do you have to say?

333
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:43,743
Inspector.

334
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:47,943
Would you please let me hear Mr. Kawaguchi's alibi?

335
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,643
Okay. He was at the hospital

336
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:53,143
between the hours of 03:30 to 04:30 last night.

337
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:56,543
From that hospital to here it takes 20 minutes.

338
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,943
In other words, I couldn't have committed the crime.

339
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:02,243
Which means, you could've come here by 05:00.

340
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:04,843
Even if I came here at 05:00, I couldn't have done anything.

341
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:06,343
No.

342
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:10,443
You locked Mr. Yoda up in the device room of the flower clock

343
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:13,443
and came back at 05:00 to kill him!

344
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,843
What?

345
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:17,443
Don't be ridiculous.

346
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:20,943
Otherwise, there would be no wound on the cheek of the victim.

347
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:23,243
It's 5:00 sharp right now.

348
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:28,043
Just 12 hours ago, Mr. Kawaguchi hit Mr. Yoda's head against the stone

349
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:31,543
by the "6" of the flower clock and killed him.

350
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,343
Then, with the long hand that indicated "12",

351
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:36,043
he wounded the cheek of the victim

352
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:39,143
and lay the dead body near the "6".

353
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:43,543
How can I go to "12" without messing up the flowers?

354
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:45,643
If to the "5" on the face of the clock,

355
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:49,743
you could step over it without messing up the flowers.

356
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:52,643
You carried Mr. Yoda's dead body

357
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:55,043
and walked on the needle of the flower clock,

358
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:58,743
went over to the long hand that was on the "12"

359
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:01,843
and made the wound on Mr. Yoda's cheek.

360
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:05,343
Then, you walked back on the needle and returned.

361
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,943
Do you have proof?

362
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,143
You know, evidence!

363
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,443
No use bluffing courage

364
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:14,443
because the flower clock saw all that you did,

365
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:16,943
and told me about it.

366
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:18,443
What?

367
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:22,543
There is a slight blood stain on the place "12".

368
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:24,143
What?

369
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:28,843
Actually, the stone and the needle do not touch each other,

370
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:29,943
but since you walked on the needle

371
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:31,743
in addition to carrying Mr. Yoda while you did so,

372
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:35,043
the needle bent and now touches the stone.

373
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,943
And the blood of Mr. Yoda's cheek that you wounded

374
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,743
flowed through the needle

375
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:42,243
and stained the stone.

376
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:46,443
If we inspect it, I'm sure it'll match Mr. Yoda's blood.

377
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:50,043
But that doesn't prove that I did it, does it?

378
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:51,743
If we check the shoe prints on the needle,

379
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:55,143
your shoe prints are sure to be detected.

380
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:56,743
Not talking of the short hand,

381
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:58,943
as far as the long hand is concerned,

382
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:01,543
the amount of time the stone can support a person's weight

383
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,443
without squashing the flowers is but a minute.

384
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,243
It would've been impossible for you

385
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:07,743
to make a round trip to wound Mr. Yoda's cheek

386
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:11,343
and more so to erase your shoe prints.

387
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,443
Well...

388
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:14,743
Mr. Kawaguchi.

389
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:17,043
Although you're not aware of it,

390
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:21,543
Mr. Yoda left a message saying that you killed him.

391
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:23,843
That's ridiculous.

392
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:26,343
Conan! Show the Inspector the way!

393
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:27,943
Yes, sir!

394
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:29,843
Follow me!

395
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:33,343
You too, Mr. Kawaguchi!

396
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:41,543
Is Mr. Yoda's message left behind here?

397
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:43,343
I don't see anything like that around.

398
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,743
He's right!

399
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:49,943
What...

400
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,343
This is...

401
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:58,043
Florescent paint was spilt on the floor.

402
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:01,143
It started to shine after it got pitch dark.

403
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:02,743
What did you say?

404
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:04,943
Pops told me that

405
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:07,843
florescent paint doesn't shine in the dark

406
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:09,943
unless you first shine light on it.

407
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:11,943
He went on to say that since this place was dark all the while,

408
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:14,743
during the time that Mr. Yoda was being confined by Mr. Kawaguchi,

409
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:16,543
it didn't shine.

410
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:17,843
I see.

411
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,143
Since he went in and out only at night,

412
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:21,143
so no one would see him,

413
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:24,243
no light came in even if he opened the door!

414
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,743
But, where is the message?

415
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:29,543
Over there!

416
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:32,543
This is...

417
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,843
The culprit is...

418
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:36,543
Kawaguchi!

419
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:39,143
Mr. Yoda, who was confined here,

420
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,543
noticed that paint was spilt,

421
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,843
and left behind his final message.

422
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:46,443
However, it was coincidentally the same color paint

423
00:21:46,443 --> 00:21:49,743
as the florescent paint that was spilt on the floor.

424
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:55,743
Therefore, Mr. Yoda's message became invisible in bright light.

425
00:21:55,743 --> 00:21:58,643
We will investigate this room thoroughly.

426
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:00,943
We'll look for evidence of Mr. Yoda's confinement

427
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:04,343
as well as the traces of you having gone in and out of this room too.

428
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:06,643
Darn it!

429
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:09,443
I thought that this was a perfect plan, and yet!

430
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:11,843
This can't be! It just can't be!

431
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:43,243
The display ceremony of the flower clock

432
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:46,643
was held a week later than scheduled.
