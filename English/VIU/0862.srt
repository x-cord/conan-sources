1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,550
Since the murdered victim

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,750
was found holding the scissors that Dr. Agasa invented,

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,150
I, as well as Mr. Subaru Okiya accompanied him

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,050
to the scene of the crime.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,050
Was the water left running

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,050
from the faucet in the bathroom, by any chance?

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,650
Yes, it seems so.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,550
But how did you know?

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,850
Mr. Akai.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,450
Is there something to this case?

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,050
You've already realized too, haven't you, sonny?

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,850
It resembles the Koji Haneda murder

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,350
that occurred 17 years ago to a tee.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,950
Furthermore, when the body

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,650
was being carried out past us.

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,650
Sweet...

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,550
Scent.

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,050
There seems to have been some gooey substance

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,250
like honey on the wound of the body for some reason.

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,650
The scissors that the victim was holding,

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,950
the cup that fell to the floor and cracked.

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,450
The scent of honey that was on the corpse,

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,950
the faucet with the water running.

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,450
How did the perp kill Mr. Hiyama?

25
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,750
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,050
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

27
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,050
Scissors, a cup and sweet honey.

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,350
A variety of evidence ties it all together.

29
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,150
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,350
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,650
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:11,018
"The Same Crime Scene as 17 Years Ago (Part 2)"

33
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:14,718
But this sure is an odd case.

34
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:18,618
The victim was killed holding scissors

35
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:22,218
and honey was on the wound of the corpse

36
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:25,018
and on top of that, the faucet

37
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:28,518
was left with water running from it, right?

38
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:30,618
Even if Mr. Senba, who didn't have a murder weapon on him

39
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,818
is not the perp,

40
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:36,718
how on earth did the perp make it into this annex

41
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:39,118
with iron bars on all its windows?

42
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:49,718
Wrong.

43
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:51,418
The perp...

44
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:53,018
Is...

45
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:56,218
"Kazunori Senba (50), Former Candy Shop Owner" -Mr. Senba.

46
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,218
Really?

47
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:02,818
Yes, we know how he committed the murder.

48
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,718
But we still haven't found the murder weapon.

49
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,818
Hey.

50
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:11,618
You men frisked Mr. Senba, didn't you?

51
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,018
Yeah.

52
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:18,018
Back then didn't Mr. Senba have anything strange on him?

53
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:19,718
Something strange?

54
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,318
Right, he had a small figurine

55
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:25,018
about this size in a plastic bag.

56
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:28,218
Yeah. Together with a small catalog

57
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,318
with the series of that figurine in it.

58
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:31,818
He said it was a freebie from one of the candies

59
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,318
and that he was going to give it to his grandchild as a gift.

60
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:38,118
It seems that the shop is already gone, though.

61
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:39,918
Nothing else?

62
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,918
No, all he had were a wallet, a handkerchief and a key.

63
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,118
Come to think of it,

64
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:50,018
a colored ball that I used to buy frequently at a candy shop

65
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,218
when I was a child came flying.

66
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,918
A colored ball?

67
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,418
Yeah. A little before Mr. Senba showed up,

68
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:00,918
a yellow one about this size came flying.

69
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,618
I gave it over to the police detective, though.

70
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:04,718
Since a park

71
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,018
is on the other side of this fence,

72
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:09,618
maybe a child was playing baseball or something.

73
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:12,718
Nobody came to get the ball, though.

74
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:16,018
About that ball, do you know which direction it came flying from?

75
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:19,918
Yes, since I heard something hit the roof,

76
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,118
I went farther inside towards the annex.

77
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:25,518
If I remember correctly, I found it rolling just about here.

78
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:28,718
At that time, did both of you leave the entrance?

79
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:30,918
No, only I did.

80
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:33,018
Did you find anything besides the colored ball?

81
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,618
No, just that one ball.

82
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:41,518
Sir, this small window isn't barred.

83
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:42,918
Where does this lead to?

84
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,118
To the restroom.

85
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,318
That's on the opposite side

86
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:47,518
of the changing room with the corridor between it.

87
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:51,118
Well, there are no bars on this window

88
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:55,018
because even a child couldn't make it through, a window so small.

89
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:00,918
A slipper that stepped on the shards of a cup,

90
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:03,818
honey that was found on the wound,

91
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,618
a colored ball that hit the roof.

92
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:10,718
A catalog and a figurine that was in a plastic bag,

93
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:12,718
the small window of the restroom.

94
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:15,118
Come to think of it...

95
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,318
the sound was quite loud though,

96
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:20,618
like clank-clank, despite it being a colored ball.

97
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:23,318
Don't... don't tell me that...

98
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:25,618
He put the murder weapon in there?

99
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:30,718
Doc!

100
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:31,918
Is something the matter?

101
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,018
Oh, no... Well...

102
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:38,318
It's no big deal really but...

103
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:39,718
See... see that.

104
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:41,918
Ants...

105
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:47,518
Ants are moving in a line.

106
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:50,218
That surprised me, you see.

107
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:52,818
But Doc, you have a lot of illustrated encyclopedias

108
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,618
of insects and such, don't you?

109
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:56,618
Well, that's true, but...

110
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:05,218
In photos, it's easy to view them

111
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,818
as cute little insects,

112
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:08,918
but actually seeing them moving around

113
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,818
it's a different story, you see.

114
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:14,118
If it's inside, it's a different story?

115
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,818
Hey, sonny, come over here.

116
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,918
I guess we've found the murder weapon...

117
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,718
we were looking for.

118
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:34,518
What?

119
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:37,318
You've figured out who the perp is and the trick he used?

120
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,018
Is it true, Dr. Agasa?

121
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:42,718
Well, rather, it's these two that figured it out, you see.

122
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:44,518
Yes, we've figured it out.

123
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:45,718
Yep.

124
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:47,918
How Mr. Senba brought

125
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,618
the blunt murder weapon into this annex.

126
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:54,318
Come on, I explained it to you already, didn't I?

127
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:58,418
That they frisked me before I came into this annex.

128
00:07:58,418 --> 00:07:59,618
Hey, you guys,

129
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:02,218
I didn't have any blunt object on me back then, did I?

130
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:04,018
-Well, no. -Same here.

131
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:07,718
But he had a plastic bag with a figurine

132
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:12,118
and a small catalog of the series of it in the bag, right?

133
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,118
So... so what?

134
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,918
If so, you would've had to have that too,

135
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:19,118
but why didn't you have it?

136
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:21,318
Just what is that supposed to be.

137
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:23,918
The round plastic capsule.

138
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,018
Because what you had was the contents that were inside the capsule, right?

139
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:29,518
It seems that the catalog wasn't inside

140
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,618
the plastic bag together with the figurine either.

141
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:32,718
Oh, that?

142
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:36,918
I didn't need it so I threw it away somewhere.

143
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,118
Conan.

144
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,118
Here, I went and bought what you asked for,

145
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:42,118
the capsule toy, honey,

146
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:44,318
the colored ball and a big marble.

147
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:49,218
But did the perp really use these things?

148
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:52,318
Yep. First, you open the capsule.

149
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:56,818
And with the tape that holding the two halves together,

150
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:58,818
cover the holes in the capsule.

151
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:03,218
Then, put the marble into the capsule

152
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:06,718
and pour honey on top of it.

153
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:10,018
Then you place the lid back on.

154
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:11,718
There, all done!

155
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,718
All done? What's all done?

156
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:17,318
Will you throw this capsule and colored ball

157
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:19,918
onto the roof of the restroom?

158
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,718
What? You want me to throw it?

159
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,018
Yep!

160
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:24,218
Okay.

161
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:29,218
Throw it so it gets on the roof!

162
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:30,418
Okay.

163
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:32,818
There!

164
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:38,818
What?

165
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:41,218
The colored ball came falling.

166
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:43,318
But the capsule hasn't come down yet.

167
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:46,718
Will you stay there a while and keep watch, Officer Takagi?

168
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:48,218
Okay.

169
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:51,018
Then, let's all go into the annex.

170
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:52,018
Yeah.

171
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,118
After being frisked and entering the annex,

172
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,018
what did you say you did?

173
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,018
Like I said.

174
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,018
I was waiting for Hiyama to come out and answer

175
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,818
but since he didn't, I took the liberty of entering on my own.

176
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:09,518
Rather, I think this is what you said to

177
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:11,218
Mr. Hiyama who came to the entrance.

178
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:14,218
That you wanted to use the restroom.

179
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,718
Use the restroom?

180
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:20,618
Yes. But of course, it wasn't because nature called him.

181
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:24,418
But rather to retrieve the murder weapon.

182
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:25,418
What?

183
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,458
At any rate, let's go to the restroom.

184
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,758
I guess it's about time it's arrived.

185
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,258
Arrived?

186
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:45,258
You'll see.

187
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,458
Opposite to the changing room where Mr. Hiyama was murdered,

188
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,658
is the restroom, and inside the toilet.

189
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:57,558
The small window below the wall.

190
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,358
Up ahead after you open it.

191
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,958
See, as you can see.

192
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,858
That's...

193
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:12,858
the capsule that Officer Takagi threw up on the roof a while ago.

194
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:16,058
Why is that capsule outside the small window

195
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,758
that you stretched your hand out to?

196
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:20,558
Did you hand it over to him, Officer Takagi?

197
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,558
No, I didn't do anything.

198
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,258
Then, how?

199
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:27,158
Inspector Megure, you saw a while ago yourself, right?

200
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:29,658
Velocity causes the colored ball to fall

201
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:32,558
if the roof is tilted.

202
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,358
But as to this capsule, even if you tilt it...

203
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:38,558
See. It won't roll as much because the honey

204
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,358
is all over the marble ball.

205
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:42,458
I... I see.

206
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,958
So unlike the colored ball that fell right away,

207
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,358
it rolled slowly and went inside the downspout,

208
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:54,758
moving slowly

209
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:57,558
then fell all the way down like rainwater

210
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:00,558
and came out of the exit of the downspout.

211
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:03,858
The downspout is a bit tilted at the edge

212
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:06,958
so that rainwater flows easier.

213
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,858
Is... is that so, Officer Takagi?

214
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:11,258
Yes, sir!

215
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:15,158
After a while, it came out of here.

216
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:18,258
By the way, Mr. Senba threw the capsule in together

217
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:21,558
with the colored ball from outside the fence,

218
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:24,658
to camouflage the sound when it hit the roof.

219
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,858
If the bodyguard falls under the impression

220
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:29,358
that the sound was caused by the colored ball,

221
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:31,958
he would leave the place immediately.

222
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,558
But I wonder if you can kill somebody

223
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:37,458
using a marble ball like this?

224
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,658
If what he put in the capsule was not a marble ball

225
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:44,458
but a heavy iron ball and put it in his sock

226
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,858
to create a weapon called blackjack,

227
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:49,558
the ability to kill a person would extremely increase.

228
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:52,658
The fact that honey was found on Mr. Hiyama's head that was wounded

229
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:56,258
when he was struck with a blunt object is proof of it.

230
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,258
Right, Mr. Senba?

231
00:12:58,258 --> 00:12:59,358
What...

232
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:00,658
What about the blood?

233
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:03,958
If I punched somebody so bad that he bled to death,

234
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,058
I would have gotten blood splattered on me too, isn't it?

235
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:10,058
But there's no blood anywhere on my clothes.

236
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:12,758
Didn't you get naked in the restroom?

237
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,058
It looked as if you hurried and put your clothes,

238
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:17,958
being careful not to get blood on them.

239
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:23,758
You washed off the blood that got splattered on your body,

240
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:26,558
using the shower in the bathroom next to the changing room, right?

241
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:29,658
You wiped off your wet body using toilet paper

242
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:31,958
and flushed it down the toilet.

243
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:35,258
Isn't it right, Doc?

244
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:36,558
Yeah.

245
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:41,458
You're always enthusiastic about revealing the truth of cases,

246
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,658
but today you're a bit quieter, aren't you?

247
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,758
I... I just thought that I'd leave things up to the young ones this time.

248
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:50,858
That's right.

249
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:53,858
Mr. Senba who retrieved the iron ball from the toilet,

250
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:56,358
put it in his sock,

251
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:59,458
got naked and called Mr. Hiyama

252
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,158
telling that the water of the toilet kept running.

253
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,958
Then Mr. Hiyama

254
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,858
was struck by Mr. Senba with the iron ball inside the sock,

255
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:10,358
and although he fled into the changing room

256
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:11,558
inside the bathroom on the other side,

257
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:13,358
Mr. Senba broke the door down,

258
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:16,058
and although the victim tried to resist by throwing a cup at him,

259
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:20,158
he was finished off.

260
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:22,058
I guess you were planning to wash off

261
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:24,058
Mr. Hiyama's blood and the honey that was on your sock,

262
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:27,558
as well as your body in the bathroom,

263
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:30,058
you figured if your socks got wet and you wore slippers with them on,

264
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:33,158
it would look unnatural.

265
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,258
That's why you deliberately stepped

266
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:38,958
on the shard of the cup that Mr. Hiyama threw and hurt yourself,

267
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,958
to create an excuse for removing your socks.

268
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,558
Then, after you quickly put your clothes back on,

269
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:49,258
you returned to the front entrance

270
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:52,158
to tell the bodyguards that you found

271
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,358
Mr. Hiyama killed in the changing room.

272
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,458
When they went off to the changing room to confirm it,

273
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,858
you hid the murder weapon

274
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:02,358
under the porch of the main house.

275
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:05,658
Well, the capsule with the iron ball inside it

276
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,458
that the ants were gathered around

277
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,158
have been found by the forensic officers.

278
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:13,458
And although you stepped on the shard of the cup with your heel,

279
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,058
the fact that blood was found all the way inside the slipper

280
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:19,758
will prove that the blood there was Mr. Hiyama's.

281
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:24,258
Of course, you have some on your body, too.

282
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,358
Luminol reaction cannot be washed off

283
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:29,358
by rinsing off just once with water, you see.

284
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:32,858
Yeah.

285
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:36,758
I'm sure it's on my body.

286
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:39,158
Because when I washed it off in the bathroom,

287
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:43,158
the tiles were smeared bright red with his blood.

288
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,558
Then, was your motive for killing him

289
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:47,858
because he bought your property, after all?

290
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:50,558
Yeah, because he talked my son and his wife into doing so

291
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:53,458
while I was in the hospital.

292
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,958
Moreover, the traffic accident that landed me in the hospital

293
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,858
was something that Hiyama had ordered his henchmen to set up.

294
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,758
Are you sure about that?

295
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:04,158
Yeah.

296
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:06,858
I pressed him for an answer before finishing him off,

297
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:08,558
he was blabbering things like,

298
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,358
"Please forgive me and I'll pay for your hospital charges".

299
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:14,358
That candy shop was a precious one

300
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,258
that I had inherited from my Grandfather and yet.

301
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:19,758
I was really shocked when I came home from the hospital.

302
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:22,258
The shop was demolished to pieces

303
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:26,158
and a huge iron ball was hanging in the air.

304
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:28,358
That's why...

305
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:31,358
I shattered his head with an iron ball, too.

306
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,858
I'm nothing more than the owner of a candy shop after all.

307
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:38,958
I couldn't fake it through.

308
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,458
I could never trick a kid, especially.

309
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:53,058
If so,

310
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:56,058
what of the scissors that the victim was holding?

311
00:16:57,358 --> 00:17:00,758
It was Mr. Hiyama's dying message.

312
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:03,058
Dying message?

313
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:06,658
The letters on the shards of the cup on the floor

314
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,058
were F, U, A and R.

315
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:12,258
And the letter that was stuck to the shard on the slipper

316
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:13,458
was D.

317
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,858
FUSAE BRAND.

318
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:18,758
If you exclude the letters F, U, A, R, D and rearrange them,

319
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:21,058
you get SENBA.

320
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,558
I see.

321
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,058
But the door of the changing room that he fled into

322
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,658
was about to be broken down by the assailant.

323
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:30,558
So, it's hard to believe that he could so skillfully

324
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,758
cut out the small letters printed in the cup.

325
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,258
I... I see.

326
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:37,158
It's chemomechanical effect.

327
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:39,158
Chemomechanical?

328
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,558
Yeah.

329
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,158
When you try to cut glass with scissors

330
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:45,558
it'll shatter to pieces,

331
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:49,358
but if in water, since the molecules of water come in

332
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,258
between the glass becomes fragile

333
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:54,458
making it easy to cut as if it were paper.

334
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:58,258
Can you really cut glass in water?

335
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:00,358
Will you show us?

336
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:03,558
Rather, although it can be cut easily like paper,

337
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,458
little pieces will still scatter about so it's very dangerous.

338
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:11,458
I really don't want to cut Fusae's cup.

339
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,958
But then why didn't he

340
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,958
leave the letters SENBA behind?

341
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,058
It would've been a lot more comprehensible.

342
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,058
Because it would be too easy that way.

343
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:26,658
If the perp sees his name,

344
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:28,258
he'll definitely hide it.

345
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:30,258
I... I guess so.

346
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:33,958
Maybe that's why he threw the cup that he cut

347
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,258
the letters out from towards Mr. Senba, no?

348
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:39,258
By doing so, the perp would be under the illusion

349
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:41,558
that the cup cracked because it hit the wall.

350
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,058
He would never think that the letters that were cut out

351
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:45,158
are more important.

352
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,558
It wouldn't be possible for the perp...

353
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,858
To immediately recognize this.

354
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,258
I see, I see.

355
00:18:57,258 --> 00:19:00,458
Holding the scissors and the faucet with the water running

356
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,858
were hints pointing to the what you may call effect

357
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,758
and the shards of glass with the letters SENBA printed on them,

358
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:09,158
were probably flushed down the toilet.

359
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:11,158
I see, I see.

360
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:12,158
So that's...

361
00:19:12,158 --> 00:19:13,458
What?

362
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,958
Where's everybody?

363
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,358
Conan?

364
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:19,158
Hey, wait for me!

365
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,858
Gosh.

366
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:48,458
Hey. Is it okay, Shinichi?

367
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,658
Don't you have to attend interrogation

368
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:52,058
for the case after this or something?

369
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:53,258
The computer.

370
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:56,158
Your computer was in the Beetle, right?

371
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:57,558
Yeah.

372
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,558
Is everything okay, Shinichi?

373
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:04,158
I found it.

374
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,158
Rather, where's Mr. Akai?

375
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:40,158
What's up?

376
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,258
Calling me so suddenly?

377
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:48,358
Will you take my tablet out of the dashboard (glove box).

378
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:56,258
I found it.

379
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,458
The article about Koji Haneda's case

380
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,858
hasn't been deleted yet.

381
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:04,158
If I remember correctly the letters found on the hand mirror were...

382
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,258
PTON.

383
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:11,758
The letters that were originally written on the hand mirror were...

384
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:14,358
"Put on mascara".

385
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:17,758
If you exclude the letters PTON,

386
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:19,358
the remaining letters would be

387
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:25,258
UMASCARA.

388
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:27,158
There sure a lot of As.

389
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:29,458
Could it be the name of a Japanese person?

390
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:33,158
If "CA" can also be read "KA",

391
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:34,358
then the thing that comes to mind is...

392
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,458
Asaka.

393
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,058
The suspect Asaka?

394
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:47,058
If you exclude the letters ASACA from UMASCARA,

395
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:49,758
the remainder would be UMR.

396
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,158
Then if you rearrange them...

397
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:33,658
Rum.

398
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:46,058
"Next Episode" -Spirit Detective, Gaito Hotta?

399
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,058
What?

400
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,958
You're going to disclose the truth about the Koji Haneda murder case?

401
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:54,158
Someone just ran from the balcony.

402
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:56,658
Haneda...

403
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:57,958
Koji.

404
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,858
What's the matter, Officer Takagi?

405
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:01,058
Oh, it's nothing.

406
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:02,958
It seems that something got on my finger

407
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,458
when I slapped the desk a while ago.

408
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,058
I wonder if this is salt?

409
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,258
Next Conan,

410
