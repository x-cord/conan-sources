1
00:00:02,453 --> 00:00:04,252
Anyway, I had no idea

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:08,852
they count like this in Germany and France.

3
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:11,552
Shinichi used to do that all the time.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,752
He said he got it from his mom.

5
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:19,552
Right, Mom tried to act cool by mimicking French people.

6
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,852
Hey, kid.

7
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:24,352
Is this how they count to three in Europe?

8
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:29,352
No. I saw on TV that even in Europe, there are exceptions.

9
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:31,552
England is the same as Japan.

10
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:34,152
They count to three

11
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:39,153
using their pointer finger, middle finger, and ring finger.

12
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:43,653
I knew it. Of course.

13
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:50,952
During the Red Woman case, Sera...

14
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:53,852
That's a pretty thin bat though.

15
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,252
Can you hit a ball with that?

16
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,052
She said something like that.

17
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:03,352
Maybe she was thinking of cricket since that's popular in England.

18
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:07,552
Cricket bats are flatter and thicker than baseball bats.

19
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:10,952
And according to American manners,

20
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:12,152
after cutting your food with a knife,

21
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:14,552
you switch your fork to your right hand.

22
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:18,453
You eat with your fork in your left hand in Japan and England.

23
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:20,952
Wait a minute.

24
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:23,752
Didn't Sera say this, too?

25
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:29,552
That's how I know Conan's pretty good at football.

26
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:33,852
Americans don't call soccer "football".

27
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:38,252
Which means Sera studied in England,

28
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:40,752
not America.

29
00:01:40,753 --> 00:01:44,253
But why did she lied about going to England?

30
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:48,153
Wait a minute.

31
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:50,453
England...

32
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:52,952
I'm afraid.

33
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:55,553
I feel like I've been possessed.

34
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:58,253
England...

35
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,253
Who are you?

36
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:04,653
England...

37
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:07,553
One enthralled by the God of Death.

38
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:10,653
You're a magician!

39
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:12,953
That's it!

40
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,453
I remember now!

41
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,652
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

42
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:24,052
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

43
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:28,252
While looking into Sera's secret, I recalled a case on the beach!

44
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:29,952
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,852
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:34,253
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:19,548
"The Magician of the Waves (Part 1)"

48
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:26,348
"10 years earlier..."

49
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,248
It's been a while.

50
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,347
Shuichi.

51
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:50,547
It's been seven years.

52
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:53,347
You've grown, Shukichi.

53
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:55,747
You're starting your third year of high school now?

54
00:04:55,748 --> 00:04:56,847
Yes.

55
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:59,447
Come on, say hello.

56
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:01,048
This is your first time meeting, right?

57
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:05,147
Nice to meet you.

58
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:06,448
I'm Masumi.

59
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:09,248
Who's the kid?

60
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:12,947
Have you forgotten?

61
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,547
She's your sister.

62
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,647
I sent you photos.

63
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,447
Come to think of it,

64
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:22,347
Mom had a baby bump before I left for America.

65
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:23,747
Unbelievable.

66
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:26,047
Anyway, where's Mary?

67
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:28,247
I thought you came here together

68
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:30,847
after she went to meet you at your hotel.

69
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:34,147
We had a bit of an argument at the hotel.

70
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:37,347
She got me with a chop.

71
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:40,147
Just look at this.

72
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:43,547
I got a few hits in though.

73
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:46,447
She's probably icing them right now.

74
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:49,947
You're the one who needs to cool his head.

75
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:52,147
I let you study abroad

76
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,747
because you said you wanted to study in America,

77
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,747
but now you're saying you actually went to investigate

78
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:58,447
the truth behind your father's case?

79
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:03,647
And on top of that, you're joining the FBI when you graduate.

80
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:07,548
You're like a child enthralled by the God of death.

81
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:11,847
I already have a green card and US citizenship.

82
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:15,147
All I need now is three years of work experience

83
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:19,047
and to pass the written and physical tests.

84
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:20,647
It won't be a problem.

85
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,747
I did struggle to get my driver's license,

86
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:27,147
since I couldn't get used to driving on the right side of the road.

87
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:28,747
In the country we used to live in and this place,

88
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:31,047
they drive on the left.

89
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,247
What about your living expenses?

90
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:34,947
Do you really expect me to send money

91
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:37,347
to someone who'd say something so stupid?

92
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,447
Don't worry.

93
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:42,447
I found a pretty decent job.

94
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:45,848
I'll survive until I can join the FBI.

95
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,947
Unbelievable.

96
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:53,348
I invited you to the beach so you'd come back home.

97
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,247
I hope looking at this peaceful scenery

98
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:01,047
will help you cool your head,

99
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:02,647
and remember the words my husband said before his death

100
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:06,648
as he sent us to this safe country.

101
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:13,847
"Pretend I never existed.

102
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:19,447
I seem to have made some serious enemies."

103
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:20,748
Don't forget his message.

104
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:26,647
Mom, you're the one who's forgotten

105
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:30,148
that our father's body still hasn't been found.

106
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:36,247
Why don't we get some yakisoba at the beach hut?

107
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,348
Okay.

108
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:43,148
I've never met my other brother before.

109
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:49,248
Unlike Shukichi, he doesn't smile at all.

110
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:53,547
I want to see him smile.

111
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:55,048
Okay!

112
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,747
Shukichi, how could you let her do that?

113
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:06,447
It's dangerous.

114
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:09,347
It's no use. He won't smile.

115
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:10,447
Sorry.

116
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,447
Masumi said she wanted to get on top of the parasol.

117
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:18,448
In that case, I'll use what my PE teacher taught me.

118
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:35,847
That didn't work either.

119
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,647
Then I'll use my special technique.

120
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,847
This gets everyone in my class laughing.

121
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:43,848
"Fried Potatoes" -No one can resist laughing at this.

122
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:48,847
Don't play with your food.

123
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:50,347
Huh?

124
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:54,047
No way. This didn't work either?

125
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:55,147
Hey!

126
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:57,247
What are you doing, Masumi?

127
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:58,547
Mom.

128
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:00,747
You're a girl.

129
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,447
You got salt from your chips all over your upper lip.

130
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:06,448
Sorry.

131
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:10,447
Is that a popular joke in England?

132
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:11,547
-Huh? -Huh?

133
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:14,548
You're from England, aren't you?

134
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:19,547
In Japan, we call sliced and fried potatoes

135
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:24,447
covered in salt fried potatoes.

136
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:26,947
In America, they call them french fries.

137
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:29,647
Since you called them chips,

138
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:32,848
I thought you were from England, the land of fish and chips.

139
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:37,647
Anyway, have you seen my son?

140
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:40,147
He's a boy wearing green swim trunks.

141
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:43,647
He should be with a girl around his age.

142
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:44,747
No.

143
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:46,447
I see.

144
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:49,447
Gosh. Where did that kid go?

145
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:51,547
Sorry for bothering you.

146
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:52,747
It's fine.

147
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:55,148
Shinichi, where are you?

148
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,547
Safe country indeed.

149
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:03,847
Even an ordinary person like her

150
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:07,647
can tell where we're from just by the way we speak.

151
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,648
There's no such thing as a safe country, Mom.

152
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,747
Don't worry.

153
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:20,747
Before the men who killed Father discover who I am,

154
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:24,047
I'll send every last one of them to hell.

155
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:25,548
It's totally obvious.

156
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:32,447
That you're a pierrot.

157
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,347
A clown...

158
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:37,447
I was listening to your conversation.

159
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:41,347
You travel to all kinds of countries, right?

160
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:43,548
As far as I know, the only people who do that...

161
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,847
are circus workers.

162
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:52,647
And when I saw your left hand, I knew exactly what you were.

163
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:57,847
I saw that mark on the back of your left wrist.

164
00:10:57,848 --> 00:11:02,547
It's common among people who play the accordion.

165
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,147
Dad said that since they press the buttons

166
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:05,647
while inflating and deflating the instrument,

167
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:09,648
the belt leaves that mark on their hand.

168
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:17,247
Clowns play the accordion during circus shows all the time.

169
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:22,547
And there are all kinds of clowns at the circus,

170
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:29,047
but the only one among them that wear tear makeup are pierrots.

171
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:35,147
You still have some of that makeup under your left eye.

172
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:38,147
You probably forgot to wipe it off since you were in a hurry

173
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:42,648
to come to the beach, but you can't fool me.

174
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:46,247
You're a pierrot!

175
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,748
Am I wrong?

176
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,448
He smiled.

177
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:02,947
Sorry.

178
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:06,447
I've been to three countries,

179
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:08,647
but I'm not part of a circus.

180
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,447
Huh? Really?

181
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:15,847
Wouldn't that make everyone who likes to travel part of the circus?

182
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:18,047
Oh, right.

183
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:21,947
I'm impressed you noticed this mark left by the accordion,

184
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:28,047
but I got this playing requests for customers at a bar.

185
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:31,347
I make good money doing it.

186
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:33,247
And...

187
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:36,947
This mark under my left eye isn't make up.

188
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:40,448
It's a bruise I just got from my violent mother.

189
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,848
So, who are you?

190
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:52,047
I'm...

191
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:53,948
I'm Shinichi Kudo!

192
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:58,348
I'm Sherlock Holmes's apprentice!

193
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,348
Holmes's apprentice?

194
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,647
Shinichi!

195
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:10,147
There you are!

196
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:12,647
Your mom's looking for you!

197
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:13,747
Ran.

198
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:16,648
You were playing Holmes again, weren't you?

199
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:19,547
I wasn't playing.

200
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,048
I'm training to become a detective.

201
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:27,347
If you don't behave yourself, you'll get in trouble.

202
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,847
Those guys seemed really mad.

203
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:33,347
They should be.

204
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:35,947
You brat.

205
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,848
I finally found you.

206
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:42,847
You'll pay for embarrassing me earlier.

207
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:45,447
That was your own fault.

208
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:49,147
You tried to leave without paying for the yakisoba

209
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:52,448
you'd nearly finished by putting a fly in it.

210
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:56,348
If you hadn't said anything, no one would've noticed!

211
00:14:01,948 --> 00:14:05,747
Sorry, but the kid's with me.

212
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:08,047
If you've got business with him,

213
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,448
you'll have to go through me.

214
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:17,447
If you don't mind having your eyes gouged out first,

215
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:19,648
I'll listen to anything you have to say.

216
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:24,848
Sorry!

217
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,647
Amazing!

218
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,747
What do you call that?

219
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,447
A finger jab.

220
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:34,647
It's a blinding technique.

221
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:36,848
It's a Jeet Kune Do technique.

222
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:43,547
Finger jab? Jeet Kune Do?

223
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,248
So cool!

224
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:51,948
Sorry, kids. But could you play with my sister?

225
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:56,247
She seems to be looking for some friends.

226
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:57,548
Sure.

227
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:29,848
-What? -What?

228
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,709
A car!

229
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,809
Fell into the ocean?

230
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,910
Seriously?

231
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,409
He struck his head on the windshield

232
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,209
when the car crashed into the guardrail.

233
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,409
He must not have been wearing his seat belt.

234
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,109
His neck's broken.

235
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,010
He's a goner.

236
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,410
There's a bag in the back seat.

237
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,409
There's a bunch of brand-name watches inside.

238
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,610
They still have their price tags on them.

239
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,210
The window on the passenger side is open.

240
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,810
Looks like there was another person in the car.

241
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,310
He's back!

242
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,009
Stand back, please!

243
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,110
Thank you!

244
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,509
Will he live?

245
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,809
It's too late for that.

246
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,609
What's in the bag?

247
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,109
Clues to determining his identity.

248
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,109
Anyway, I need you to do something for me.

249
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,409
Remember the swimsuit shop at the beach hut?

250
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,909
Ask if any soaking wet customers came

251
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,209
to buy T-shirts, swimsuits, or sandals

252
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,309
after the car fell into the water.

253
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,009
There was another passenger in the car

254
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,510
who escaped and blended in with the crowd.

255
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,809
Well?

256
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,909
Think you can do it, Holmes's apprentice?

257
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,409
Yes. Of course.

258
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,610
Here.

259
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,010
Thanks.

260
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,009
Did you come here alone with that boy?

261
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,009
No, we came with Shinichi's mom.

262
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,209
Could you ask her to call the police?

263
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,809
Tell them a car fell into the ocean.

264
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,009
Sure!

265
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,710
Shinichi's mom!

266
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,809
What about me?

267
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,209
What should I do?

268
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,809
Let me help.

269
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:33,909
Tell the man at the parking lot to stop anyone

270
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,809
wearing wet clothes or a swimsuit from leaving.

271
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,809
They could be working with some bad guys.

272
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,110
Can you do that?

273
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,209
Do you remember

274
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,209
who came to buy T-shirts

275
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,109
after the car fell into the water?

276
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,409
I'm not sure. There were two or three of them.

277
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,209
But I don't remember their faces.

278
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,609
Was there anyone with soaking wet hair?

279
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,809
Everyone's hair is wet.

280
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,209
They're here to swim.

281
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,809
I think there were three.

282
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,309
Huh?

283
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,410
I spent a while at this shop deciding if I should buy this shirt.

284
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,709
Really?

285
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,609
I play shogi.

286
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,910
I have a good memory.

287
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,809
So a car broke through the guardrail above that cliff

288
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,209
and fell into the ocean?

289
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,309
Yes.

290
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,309
And this man was the driver,

291
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:01,109
and you called the police after pulling him from the car.

292
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,709
I'm the one who called,

293
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,710
but he's the one who pulled him from the car.

294
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,009
Who are you?

295
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,809
Just a student studying abroad in the United States.

296
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,110
I returned to Japan and came here with my family today.

297
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,709
Anyway, is it true

298
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,609
that there was another person in the car?

299
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,010
That's what he said.

300
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,009
What proof do you have?

301
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,209
I simply thought there was another person

302
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,510
since the passenger window was open all the way.

303
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,609
The driver's seat was on the right side.

304
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,409
If there's only one person were in the car,

305
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,809
it would be strange for only the passenger window to be open.

306
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,809
The other person most likely opened the window

307
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,409
before the car filled with water and escaped,

308
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,010
blending in with the crowd.

309
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,609
But couldn't they have opened the door instead?

310
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,109
Not with that water pressure.

311
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,809
There's still air inside a car immediately after it sinks.

312
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,609
They couldn't open the door because of the water pressure.

313
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,509
That's why they chose

314
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,509
to open the window and escape through there.

315
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,509
So they abandoned their friend

316
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,709
and fled alone.

317
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,710
No.

318
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:34,409
This man wasn't wearing his seat belt at the time of the accident.

319
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,809
What?

320
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,809
He struck his head on the windshield

321
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,909
when the car crashed into the guardrail.

322
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,609
It broke his cervical vertebrae,

323
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,809
killing him instantly.

324
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,509
It's probably safe to assume the passenger determined he was dead

325
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,609
when they received no response after calling out to him,

326
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,009
so they decided to escape on their own.

327
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,009
But why would they pretend to be one of the crowd here?

328
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,009
If they were a victim of an accident, they wouldn't need to hide.

329
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,109
Probably because...

330
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,709
there was a reason they had

331
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,110
to conceal themselves.

332
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,609
"Next Episode" -I see.

333
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,510
Hey, Mr. Pierrot!

334
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,909
I brought all the customers

335
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,709
