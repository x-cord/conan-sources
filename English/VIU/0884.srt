1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,407
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:01,408 --> 00:00:03,607
The unfinished pop-up book Pops

3
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:05,907
received in the mail

4
00:00:05,908 --> 00:00:09,608
contained a series of bomb threats.

5
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:13,507
It was thought to be the work of the dead author's half-brother

6
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:18,508
with a previous conviction of manufacturing explosives, Takuji Hirukawa.

7
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:21,407
Through the Pops' efforts,

8
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:24,508
the second explosion was successfully avoided.

9
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:30,007
All right.

10
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:31,008
We did it!

11
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:32,208
"Private Caller"

12
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,207
Tick tock, tick tock.

13
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,007
Boom!

14
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,907
Well done, Detective Kogoro Mouri.

15
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,608
But the game isn't over yet.

16
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:49,707
What?

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,708
"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks"

18
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:54,107
"Grandpa Tick Tock is a clockmaker.

19
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:56,907
Tick tock, tick tock.

20
00:00:56,908 --> 00:01:01,108
Deliver the final clock to the middle of the 7."

21
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:05,507
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

22
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:08,007
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

23
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,107
The pop-up book and the final bomb.

24
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:12,507
The mystery of seven takes us in an unexpected direction.

25
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:14,107
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,107
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:18,508
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:03,542
"The Pop-up Book Bomber (Part 2)"

29
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:06,743
"Deliver the final clock to the middle of the 7."

30
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:11,542
Darn it! What does the middle of seven mean?

31
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:14,642
Divide seven by two is 3.5.

32
00:03:14,643 --> 00:03:15,842
"7 is read 'Nana'" -"Nana".

33
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:18,143
Between "na" and "na"?

34
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:20,742
Seven!

35
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,043
"V"?

36
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:25,543
None of them seem right.

37
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:28,643
I have no idea!

38
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:33,242
Hey, you!

39
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:36,342
You really don't remember the answer to the riddle?

40
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:37,742
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:39,742
"Hiroyuki Tomonaga (45), Editor In Chief" -Like I mentioned before,

42
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:41,342
publication was delayed.

43
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:45,143
I was too busy handling the incident to read it.

44
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,142
But I do remember the end.

45
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:49,542
The end?

46
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:52,242
It's not a 100% happy ending.

47
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:54,942
Our company wasn't sure it was appropriate

48
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,942
for a children's book.

49
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:01,142
I thought the same thing after reading it.

50
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:04,142
Although the drawings and pop-ups are really cute.

51
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,642
What do you mean?

52
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,842
Grandpa Tick Tock dies.

53
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:12,643
You learn at the end that he's actually really sick.

54
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,242
But in the epilogue,

55
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:19,542
his grandson takes over his business

56
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:21,342
ten years later,

57
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,542
so that's kind of a relief.

58
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,842
That's right.

59
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:28,942
Seriously? It's not a clue to the bomb's location.

60
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,542
Anyway, what's the answer to the riddle?

61
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:34,342
I don't know.

62
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:35,443
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,943
What does the number seven remind you of?

64
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:42,442
What's expressed in sevens?

65
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,542
Expressed in sevens?

66
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:48,342
Oh, right. Like the seven days of the week?

67
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:49,442
Yeah.

68
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:52,443
Or the seven colors of the rainbow?

69
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:56,242
There are seven notes on a musical scale, too.

70
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:58,842
What's the middle of those?

71
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:00,842
In a week, that would be Thursday.

72
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,142
In a rainbow...

73
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:05,942
I think it's green.

74
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,442
In a musical scale, it's fa.

75
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:11,442
But there are too many things it could be.

76
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,542
Yeah.

77
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:14,642
But what if a bomb were to explode

78
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:16,842
at a location related to those?

79
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:19,542
Inspector!

80
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:21,442
Of course, we can't ignore it.

81
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:23,942
Have the entire department

82
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:25,742
begin searching for the bomb immediately.

83
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,743
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

84
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:32,642
Inspector, I'd only be getting in the way

85
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:34,942
if I stayed any longer.

86
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,342
You're right.

87
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:38,942
Now that the investigation has established a direction,

88
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,542
you're free to go.

89
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:43,343
Thank you.

90
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,843
Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

91
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:51,843
Oh, the picture book.

92
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:54,042
Give me the book, Conan.

93
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:55,742
Excuse me.

94
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:57,743
Don't you need this?

95
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:03,442
Well, that's odd.

96
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:04,443
Until now,

97
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:10,342
the riddles were limited to a single answer,

98
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:13,842
but this time the riddle itself is rather broad.

99
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:14,843
"Kinomiri Park, Midori Elementary School"

100
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,742
"Midori Law Office, Green Green Restaurant" -Why?

101
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,743
"Jupiter Research Center and Observatory"

102
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,642
And I'm also curious about the bomb

103
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:23,543
that Pops threw into the manhole.

104
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:29,942
And finding the unexploded bomb has been put on hold

105
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:33,843
since the entire department has been mobilized.

106
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:37,442
Could it be?

107
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:39,943
-Okay, good. -Hey, Inspector!

108
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:42,742
What is it, Conan?

109
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:47,942
What exactly did the bomber Hirukawa do?

110
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:49,742
What did he do?

111
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,142
Caused explosions, of course.

112
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:54,242
He manufactured explosives,

113
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,942
blew up the safes

114
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:59,742
and cash transport vehicles,

115
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:01,743
and stole a lot of money.

116
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:05,242
What about it?

117
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:07,043
Nothing.

118
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:11,542
That's nothing like this crime which seems

119
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:13,642
to be motivated

120
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:14,843
by resentment.

121
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:32,343
"Megrez Security"

122
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:38,442
Did something happen?

123
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:39,743
I'm not sure.

124
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,743
What? You found the bomb?

125
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:50,442
The garbage collection point at the #3 Thursday Building in Toriya City?

126
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:52,242
We found one, too.

127
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:55,242
"Green Garden" -It's at the orchard in Kenbashi City.

128
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:58,042
It was inside the management office's trash can.

129
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,142
"F.A. Alloy" -We found one at "F.A. Alloy"

130
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:01,542
in Daitoma City.

131
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:05,942
It's a gilding factory known locally as "Fa Alloy".

132
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,043
It was found inside a garbage can.

133
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:12,143
Three bombs at once?

134
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:18,942
Is something wrong?

135
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,042
I'm sorry, but a bomb was discovered up ahead.

136
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:25,542
What? A bomb?

137
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:29,042
We found all three of the bombs!

138
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,042
Tell us how to disarm them!

139
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,742
Hey, answer me!

140
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,043
Answer me!

141
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:47,143
"Wow! Were you surprised?"

142
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:50,542
What?

143
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:53,442
They're all fake?

144
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:55,443
What does this mean?

145
00:08:58,543 --> 00:08:59,543
Darn it.

146
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:02,242
What is Hirukawa trying to do?

147
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,443
It's a trap.

148
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,742
Like the previous riddles,

149
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:08,942
the three fake bombs are trick answers.

150
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:11,142
The real one is somewhere else.

151
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:12,343
-What? -What?

152
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:16,442
Okay, okay.

153
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:19,743
Okay...

154
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:28,443
Okay...

155
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,042
Is something wrong?

156
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:36,243
Hello, officer?

157
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:40,443
Is something wrong?

158
00:09:57,643 --> 00:10:00,643
"Megrez Security" -Megrez Security.

159
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:04,542
Is something wrong, Conan?

160
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:07,442
The Megrez in Megrez Security

161
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:09,343
refers to this star.

162
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,643
That's...

163
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:16,142
A picture of Ursa Major.

164
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:17,742
The Big Dipper?

165
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:18,743
That's right.

166
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:23,942
The seven stars forming the tail of Ursa Major

167
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:26,842
are known as the Big Dipper.

168
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,442
And the center star is Megrez.

169
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,842
So it's the middle of seven.

170
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:32,642
Yeah.

171
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:35,642
Darn it. The culprit included the answer

172
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:39,742
because he knew we wouldn't get there in time.

173
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,943
Inspector Megure, take a look at this.

174
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,342
"Bomb Site, Kanematsu Park"

175
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,442
What is this?

176
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:49,242
A map of the sewer?

177
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:50,442
That's right.

178
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,842
Going from the manhole at Kanematsu Park

179
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:56,943
where Mr. Mouri threw the bomb to here.

180
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:02,742
Did that bomb flow all the way here?

181
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:05,142
Almost certainly.

182
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:10,142
Carried along by the increased water level from yesterday's rain,

183
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:12,943
the bomb most likely stopped at the grate under here.

184
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:16,342
Forensics says it's likely the explosion

185
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,442
was triggered by remote and not by a timer.

186
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:23,642
So, what does that mean?

187
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:24,643
In other words,

188
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:27,442
he always meant to blow up

189
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:30,142
the cash transport vehicle.

190
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:32,142
What?

191
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:34,942
Looks like he's right.

192
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:38,542
He made you throw the bomb in the manhole

193
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:41,742
so it would end up here.

194
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,442
Which means the first bomb

195
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:48,342
was meant to camouflage this, too.

196
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:50,343
I don't believe it.

197
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:54,642
What does he think he's doing?

198
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:55,743
Inspector Megure!

199
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:59,342
What?

200
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,643
You found Hirukawa's hideout?

201
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:07,643
We'll head there.

202
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:12,142
Inspector, we're coming with you.

203
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:13,043
Okay.

204
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:14,842
Hey, wait!

205
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:17,143
How do you know it's his hideout?

206
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:21,343
We received an anonymous tip.

207
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,742
They asked us to arrest the bomber Takuji Hirukawa

208
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,342
since they spotted him.

209
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:30,043
Then they left an address and hung up.

210
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,642
I see.

211
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:35,543
So that's how it is.

212
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:33,880
Well, well.

213
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:37,880
Looks like you've recovered from your injury,

214
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:41,080
Editor Tomonaga.

215
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:44,980
It's as though you were never injured in the first place.

216
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:47,580
What's the meaning of this?

217
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:50,880
By the way, I heard you're going independent soon.

218
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,780
Will you be funding yourself

219
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,380
using the cash Hirukawa stole from the transport truck?

220
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:57,680
What are you talking about?

221
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:59,480
I don't know what you mean.

222
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:01,480
Didn't you see the news?

223
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:02,580
What?

224
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:06,280
Hirukawa's hideout exploded and burned down.

225
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,480
Oh, I just saw that.

226
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,280
According to the forensics team,

227
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,580
even when including the bills thought to have burned,

228
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:15,180
the remaining bills they found in the wreckage

229
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:18,380
didn't add up to the amount that was stolen.

230
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:21,480
I was wondering where the remaining money went.

231
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:24,380
Don't ask me.

232
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:27,380
And apparently the location of the hideout

233
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:29,381
came from an anonymous tip.

234
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:33,580
They said come to arrest the bomber Takuji Hirukawa

235
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,980
since they spotted him.

236
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,880
So what?

237
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:44,580
It sounded like they were using a voice changer.

238
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:47,080
That makes it difficult to determine whose voice it was.

239
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:50,580
What does that have to do with me?

240
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:54,281
The problem isn't the voice, but what was said.

241
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:56,580
What was said?

242
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:57,581
That's right.

243
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:01,681
Hirukawa's name hadn't been released to the press at that time.

244
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:05,980
The only ones who knew it was him were the police, us,

245
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:07,381
and you.

246
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:11,080
No one else could have known.

247
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:14,680
That's because they remembered

248
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,480
when his face was shown

249
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:19,080
during his last bombings.

250
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:20,081
You did?

251
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,880
Me? Why would I remember?

252
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,680
Mr. Mouri, do you think I did it?

253
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:28,880
Yes, I do.

254
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,380
Actually, I'm sure you did.

255
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:36,380
Tomonaga, you were standing behind Hirukawa

256
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:40,181
like an editor guiding a new author.

257
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:46,180
If you think I did it, show me the proof.

258
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:50,680
While the bombs were equipped with timers,

259
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:54,280
they were all rigged to explode by remote.

260
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:59,180
According to forensics, the radio waves from the remotes

261
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,980
only worked at a range of about thirty meters.

262
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:04,480
So what?

263
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:09,280
So only someone at the scene with us could have

264
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:13,980
sped up the timer on the second bomb,

265
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:16,380
or sent me messages accordingly.

266
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:21,181
Only you, Hiroyuki Tomonaga.

267
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,280
Later, you asked the inspector

268
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,880
if you could accompany us,

269
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:28,980
and sent me messages

270
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:32,281
in response to my actions.

271
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:35,381
Am I wrong?

272
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:41,080
You suggested to Hirukawa that he attack the transport truck

273
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:45,080
while making it look like he was out to avenge his brother.

274
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:49,180
You also involved and used me, Kogoro Mouri,

275
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:52,280
to hide your true intentions.

276
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:56,280
And you silenced Hirukawa himself

277
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,681
by using the extra bomb you had him make.

278
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:01,580
Impressive, detective.

279
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,080
What a truly interesting deduction.

280
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:08,380
Once I go independent, why not write mysteries for me?

281
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:10,580
A mystery by a great detective.

282
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:13,680
That's sure to become a best seller.

283
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:16,880
But it's all just speculation. You have no proof.

284
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:21,280
Hardcore mystery fans will surely criticize you for that.

285
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,580
This isn't a mystery.

286
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:25,880
This is an actual case.

287
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:30,580
A confession from Hirukawa would change the story.

288
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:32,480
What are you talking about?

289
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:33,881
He should be dead...

290
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:38,280
At least, that's what they said on the news.

291
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:42,580
No, the news didn't mention anything about that.

292
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:43,981
Neither did I.

293
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,581
You don't mean...

294
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:50,080
That's right.

295
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:51,580
Hirukawa survived.

296
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:54,781
Thanks to Mouri's reasoning.

297
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:59,680
I didn't understand then why a man who'd forgotten

298
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:03,680
the answer to the riddle suddenly started talking about

299
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:06,080
the illustrations in the picture book,

300
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:08,980
but you wanted them to be the same.

301
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,280
You wanted the culprit's suicide

302
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,080
and the illustration in the book

303
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:15,881
to overlap.

304
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,680
Realizing that, Mr. Mouri asked us to drive ahead of the force

305
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:25,580
to take Hirukawa into custody.

306
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:28,280
We passed the police cars on their way

307
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,281
and used the rear entrance to his hideout.

308
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,680
We just barely got Hirukawa out in time.

309
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,480
Without realizing that,

310
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:41,680
as soon as the police surrounded the hideout,

311
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:45,181
you pressed the switch on the remote control.

312
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:50,580
I'm sure Hirukawa will have some interesting things to say

313
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:55,181
once he learns he was used and nearly killed by you.

314
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:03,180
When did you realize it was me?

315
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:07,581
When you said the author left that proof to his brother.

316
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,281
Conan.

317
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,680
Here.

318
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,480
Look at this.

319
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:17,580
This isn't a proof of the book. It's clearly a copy.

320
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:21,281
It doesn't make sense for a proof to be misaligned, right?

321
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:29,880
Hirukawa naturally would have demanded the original,

322
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:32,680
but he said he didn't have it.

323
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:37,480
In other words, you must still have it.

324
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:40,480
Which means you would've looked through it

325
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,880
during this case,

326
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,880
but you lied about reading it.

327
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:47,080
Why?

328
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:51,180
Because you were the mastermind

329
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,681
who planned this crime.

330
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,881
Finally, I have a question for you.

331
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:25,280
Why didn't you give Hirukawa the original?

332
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:26,681
Because...

333
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,780
Because it was a masterpiece.

334
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:35,980
I'm still an editor.

335
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,680
I could tell.

336
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:41,381
Even if he was family, I didn't want to turn it over to a criminal.

337
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:45,581
And tearing out the pages that contained the clues.

338
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:49,080
Even though it was my plan,

339
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,580
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

340
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:56,980
Someday I planned to publish that manuscript.

341
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:57,981
Don't!

342
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,380
Please don't.

343
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:03,381
You don't have the right!

344
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:07,180
It may have been a copy,

345
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:10,481
but you used that wonderful picture book to commit a crime.

346
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:14,281
The author must be crying in heaven.

347
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:18,781
Ran...

348
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:52,980
"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks"

349
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:54,380
Six months later,

350
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:58,980
whether according to the editor's prediction or not,

351
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:00,880
the completed picture book was published...

352
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,880
"Winner of the 34th New Author Award" -and won...

353
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,881
"Recommended by the staff" -the new author award.

354
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:08,180
It was an appropriate farewell gift

355
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:11,480
for the author who passed away before his time,

356
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:14,380
"Picture Book Author, Kenichi Imai" -but that's another story.

357
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:18,680
Seriously, despite all the running I did this time,

358
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:20,980
I don't feel like I accomplished anything.

359
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:23,280
I'm just tired.

360
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:24,980
Whatever, though.

361
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:28,181
Beer tastes better after a good workout.

362
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,680
That's good!

363
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,781
You always say that.

364
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:40,481
That's that.

365
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:45,780
"Next Episode" -We just happened to be in London.

366
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:46,980
Oh, yeah?

367
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:51,280
I'd like to say a line as cool as that.

368
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:53,981
Anyway, are you sure about today?

369
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:56,280
The date.

370
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:57,480
Yeah.

371
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:59,480
After all, today is...

372
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,481
Friday the 13th.

373
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:08,580
Next Conan,

374
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:12,381
"Solving Mysteries at the Poirot Cafe (Part 1)"
