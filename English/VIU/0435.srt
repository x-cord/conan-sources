1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,569
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,469
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,869
Somebody wants to interview the Youth Detective Squad.

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,369
They are excited at becoming the center of attention.

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,069
But a crime is committed!

6
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,569
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,269
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,270
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:02,991
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

10
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:05,991
I apologize for coming at a time when you're so busy.

11
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,191
No problem.

12
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,191
I am...

13
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:10,391
As you can see on my name card.

14
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,892
"Free Writer, Masato Sugimori"

15
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:19,467
I'm Sumiko Kobayashi, homeroom teacher for 1st grade, Class B.

16
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:20,592
Please have a seat.

17
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,992
So you're a freelance writer.

18
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,491
Yes, I am.

19
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:32,191
I thought my name is recently gaining popularity in women's magazines,

20
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:34,591
but I guess, it's not as much as I thought.

21
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:35,691
It's not that.

22
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:38,291
I don't read magazines much, that's why.

23
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,091
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,591
Please don't get upset over it.

25
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:44,091
It doesn't bother me at all.

26
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:48,091
And, what is it that you want?

27
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:51,491
If you want an interview on bullying or something like that,

28
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:54,291
no such thing exists in my class.

29
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,891
Nothing like that.

30
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,291
What I want is to interview

31
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:01,191
the members of the Youth Detective Squad in your class.

32
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:04,191
Huh? Youth Detective Squad?

33
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:07,091
You mean the thing that Kojima and his friends have formed?

34
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:08,491
Yeah...

35
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:12,291
Yeah. I've heard rumours of what those children have done so far.

36
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:17,492
But the group is something that the children formed on their own.

37
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:22,091
In reality, they simply look for lost cats and so on.

38
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:25,091
Hey! Minami! Megumi! Ai!

39
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:27,491
The names all sound familiar.

40
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:30,291
The three cats are said to be violent.

41
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:33,291
But I was informed by the police

42
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:36,791
that they have contributed a lot to solving homicides

43
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:40,591
especially a boy called Conan Edogawa.

44
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,291
Conan?

45
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,991
I see.

46
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:46,491
The title of the interview will be,

47
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,891
"The Youth Detective Squad of the 21st Century!"

48
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:52,492
I'm sure it'll attract a lot of attention.

49
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:57,892
Well, I'm not sure...

50
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:05,991
"The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 1)"

51
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:08,091
"1st grade Class B" -What...

52
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:09,491
An interview?

53
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:12,191
Us, the Youth Detective Squad?

54
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:13,292
Cool!

55
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:16,391
That's right!

56
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:17,591
Yesterday after school,

57
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:21,191
a writer called Mr. Sugimori came here to see me.

58
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:24,291
He said that he'd like to write an article about all of you

59
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:25,892
and asked me to help him out.

60
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:28,791
It sounds interesting!

61
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,891
I'm getting excited!

62
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:32,492
So...

63
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,091
Do you have a cold, Ms. Kobayashi?

64
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:40,691
Not good.

65
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:41,891
It seems so.

66
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:43,691
Although I still don't have a fever,

67
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:47,091
my nose keeps running and I can't stop sneezing.

68
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:49,491
Are you all right, Ms. Kobayashi?

69
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:50,791
Did you take any medicine?

70
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:54,391
Aren't your eyes itchy?

71
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:55,491
Right, right.

72
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:58,291
I was correcting tests until late last night.

73
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,991
I guess my eyes got tired.

74
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:01,891
You've got hay fever.

75
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:04,291
What? No way!

76
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,491
No, I don't.

77
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:08,691
Because I've had immunity against things like that since childhood.

78
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,091
You see,

79
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,291
hay fever occurs when the antigen,

80
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:16,391
in other words, the substance that causes the allergy enters the body

81
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:19,191
and antibodies are created to fight off the antigens are made.

82
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:23,591
They accumulate within the body and when they exceed a certain level,

83
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:25,891
the antigens and antibodies react

84
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,891
and a substance that causes allergy is dispersed.

85
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:32,891
But because the antigen-carrying pollen

86
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:36,091
is limited to being formed only one time a year,

87
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:39,191
it takes quite a long time before they accumulate.

88
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:41,391
So even if there's no allergy when you were a child,

89
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:45,791
there are many cases of people becoming allergic in their 20's and 30's.

90
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,991
Oh, is that so?

91
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:50,991
And? What about the interview?

92
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:52,391
Of course we'll accept it!

93
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:56,291
We, as the Youth Detective Squad should accept it, right?

94
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:57,492
Yes!

95
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:03,391
It looks like it's going to rain.

96
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,691
They sure are late.

97
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:09,391
They're the ones who said we'd meet up 30 minutes beforehand.

98
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:10,392
Listen!

99
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:13,491
30 minutes beforehand. That's when we meet, okay?

100
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:14,991
Don't be late!

101
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:16,791
Understand, Conan?

102
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,991
Me?

103
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:20,991
Yeah, I got it.

104
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:24,192
Really? I hope you keep your word, Genta.

105
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:27,691
Of course I will.

106
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:28,891
Come on.

107
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:31,091
Dress normally tomorrow, you guys.

108
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:34,491
He have to see us as we usually are as the Youth Detective Squad.

109
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,491
You sure are smart!

110
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:38,292
I'm giving it my best shot!

111
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:42,791
Hey, Conan!

112
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,591
Sorry to keep you waiting!

113
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,391
Thanks for waiting!

114
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,691
Sorry, Conan! Did you wait long?

115
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,591
Hey! You guys are late.

116
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:52,291
Just what do you think you're doing?

117
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:56,291
Ayumi was taking her good old time getting ready, that's why.

118
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:59,391
Well, I had a lot of things to do.

119
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:00,691
No big deal.

120
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:02,291
After all, she's a girl.

121
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,591
So let's not make a fuss over it.

122
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,991
I guess I've got no choice.

123
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:09,391
By the way, where's Haibara?

124
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:12,091
I'm right here.

125
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:13,691
Since when was she there?

126
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:16,791
Anyway, what's with you guys? This isn't what we talked about!

127
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,292
How come you're all dressed like that?

128
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:20,892
How do you like it?

129
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,691
Well, it's an interview after all, isn't it?

130
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:26,091
Right, Mitsuhiko?

131
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:30,691
Yes. We should be properly dressed for an interview,

132
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:33,591
because a lot of people will be watching.

133
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:36,092
Yes, yes, exactly!

134
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:44,191
Oh, boy. Why does it have to turn out this way?

135
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:48,191
We're heading for an interview and it starts raining.

136
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,391
God is sure mean.

137
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:51,891
Really.

138
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:54,591
It was so sunshiny yesterday.

139
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:56,091
Why is this happening today?

140
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:59,691
Mitsuhiko, this is your fault for telling us to dress normally.

141
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:01,791
What? What are you talking about?

142
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,491
Talk for yourself, Genta!

143
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:07,891
My Sunday clothes are soaking wet with rain.

144
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:11,191
My shoes are all wet, too.

145
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:13,691
And I just bought them last night.

146
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:16,792
I think you guys are taking things a bit too far.

147
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:21,091
I guess it's no big deal.

148
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:25,591
We can ask them to lend us a dryer or something before the interview.

149
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:28,591
We're being interviewed at the house of the writer, aren't we?

150
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,191
But recent televisions are high definition,

151
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:35,891
so if shots of us entering the house with rain stains are taken...

152
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:38,192
What? Are television cameras coming, too?

153
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,491
Hey, hey. Of course they're not coming.

154
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:46,591
Maybe we're going to be aired on a special program?

155
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,191
Which means that beautiful women announcers will be there, too.

156
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:53,291
I want to be interviewed by Reina Mizunashi!

157
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,392
Me, too!

158
00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:57,891
She won't be coming, right?

159
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:01,191
Because she's in the hospital right now.

160
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,192
Yeah.

161
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:04,991
It seems that the announcer who is a member of the Black Organization

162
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:07,292
is still lying unconscious.

163
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:09,691
Hey.

164
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:12,891
Don't tell me that this interview is their plan?

165
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:14,791
It can't be.

166
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,891
No matter how you think about it,

167
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:18,991
inviting five kids to your house will attract attention.

168
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,891
It's hard to believe that they would go out of their way

169
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:24,891
to do something like leaving clues behind.

170
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:29,191
They do things so that no one notices what they're doing, right?

171
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:30,992
Yes, that's true.

172
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:36,491
Besides, if they want to do something to you or me,

173
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,791
they wouldn't be calling adults over.

174
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,992
Sorry, sorry!

175
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,591
Did you all wait long?

176
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:46,691
Ms. Kobayashi?

177
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,592
She sure looks like Officer Sato.

178
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:50,892
What is it?

179
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:52,291
Hey...

180
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,391
You forgot your glasses.

181
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:55,991
Oh, this?

182
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:58,691
I decided to wear contact lens today for a change.

183
00:09:58,692 --> 00:09:59,692
How do you like it?

184
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:02,191
Not good? You don't like it?

185
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,891
You look just great!

186
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:07,291
Your outfit is feminine and nice, too.

187
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,191
You look way prettier than usual, Ms. Kobayashi.

188
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,691
Thank you! I'm glad.

189
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:16,191
Well, it seems like the writer is good-looking.

190
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,291
No, that's not it.

191
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,291
Really, it's nothing like that.

192
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:23,791
But I think you shouldn't have worn contact lens.

193
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,591
Your eyes are itchy from your hay fever,

194
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,292
so being irritated by the contacts isn't good for them.

195
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:30,891
Okay, okay.

196
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,991
I'll be fine if I wear my glasses, right?

197
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:36,291
Yeah. That's way better.

198
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:40,091
It seems that not much pollen is in the air now because it's raining.

199
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:44,491
But the house of the writer may be full of pollen.

200
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:48,091
And you'd better dust that hairy decoration off

201
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,391
before going into the house,

202
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:53,691
so that you don't scatter pollen all over the house.

203
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:54,791
I guess so.

204
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:55,891
Okay.

205
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:59,492
Ms. Kobayashi, was that writer handsome?

206
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:04,392
Yes, his looks weren't all that bad.

207
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:10,091
He's friendly and easy to talk to.

208
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:13,791
I'm sure you'll be able to get along with him pretty quickly.

209
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:17,391
He's famous for his experience in writing for women's magazines,

210
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:21,291
so I'm sure he's used to coping with children, too.

211
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,991
He's famous.

212
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,391
He's famous?

213
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,891
Which means that he must live in an incredibly huge mansion!

214
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:31,391
He must have his very own chef and patissier, too.

215
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:34,091
I'm sure he'll serve us a fantastic dinner then.

216
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:35,392
I know he will!

217
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:37,891
Well...

218
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:41,692
I don't think so.

219
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:47,292
Here?

220
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:50,191
I guess so.

221
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,791
It's not a mansion.

222
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,592
But an ordinary apartment.

223
00:11:57,692 --> 00:11:59,591
I guess there'll be no television cameras...

224
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:01,692
Or beautiful women announcers.

225
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:05,791
Well, all for the better.

226
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,891
This way you can talk without getting nervous, right?

227
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:11,091
Hey. Did the writer say

228
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:14,291
that he was really going to interview us at his house?

229
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:17,691
It looks to be a small one room six mats house.

230
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:20,391
No. He said he'd conduct the interview at a family restaurant close by.

231
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:21,791
Oh, no!

232
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:25,091
I'm supposed to call him from the bus stop near his house!

233
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,591
Just as I thought.

234
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,391
I've got to call him right away.

235
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:29,791
No need to.

236
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,091
We've come all the way here.

237
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:34,791
We may as well be interviewed at his house and get it over with quickly.

238
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:35,792
I guess so.

239
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:37,692
You need to get it together.

240
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,191
I wonder if he'd be surprised at seeing all of us at once like this.

241
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,391
He might be.

242
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,992
Stay quiet, okay?

243
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,591
I wonder if he's out?

244
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:57,492
No. The morning paper is stuck in the slot, maybe he's still asleep.

245
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,091
The door isn't locked.

246
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,392
Hey, Genta!

247
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:09,492
Mr. Sugimori?

248
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:10,992
No, Ms. Kobayashi! Don't go inside!

249
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,191
Since you're acquainted with him,

250
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,791
if your hair or anything is found in this room,

251
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,392
you could end up becoming a suspect, right?

252
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,891
Please call an ambulance and the police immediately, Ms. Kobayashi!

253
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,192
If we call, they may think it's a child's prank.

254
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:34,691
Okay.

255
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,891
No. There's no need to call an ambulance.

256
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:40,491
His body is completely stiff.

257
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:42,391
He's been dead for half a day already.

258
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:44,291
Stiff?

259
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,792
Dead for half a day?

260
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:51,992
This could be...

261
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:53,563
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

262
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,993
Okay!

263
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:04,150
The victim is Mr. Masato Sugimori, age 32.

264
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,250
A freelance writer, right?

265
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:07,750
Yes, that's right.

266
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:10,050
I had an appointment to see him today.

267
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:12,750
He wanted to interview the children.

268
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,950
And? When you got here, you found him like this?

269
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,850
Yes.

270
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:23,750
By the way, when did you get the request for the interview?

271
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,150
At sundown the day before yesterday.

272
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:28,450
He came to the school.

273
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:32,150
Which means he was still alive until then.

274
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:33,450
Hey, Ms. Kobayashi.

275
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:37,450
You told Mr. Sugimori that we're going to be interviewed, right?

276
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:38,650
Yes.

277
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:43,250
I called Mr. Sugimori before noon yesterday and told him.

278
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:46,050
Do you know at exactly what time it was?

279
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,750
Hold on a second.

280
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:49,950
I'm sure that I got the call on my cell phone

281
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:52,250
in between 3rd and 4th period.

282
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,250
So I can probably tell if I look through the list of incoming calls.

283
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,050
It's 11:22.

284
00:14:58,051 --> 00:15:01,450
Which means he was killed after that time.

285
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:03,650
-Inspector. -What?

286
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:07,351
It seems that the murder weapon is the tripod of this camera.

287
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,150
If the killer came into the room and battered him to death,

288
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:14,650
the killer is most likely an acquaintance.

289
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:17,050
Yes. Being that he's a writer,

290
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:21,050
someone that he interviewed could be the suspect.

291
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,350
Right.

292
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:26,350
He may have written an article exposing someone's deeds.

293
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:28,950
But if he wrote about people in show biz,

294
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:30,550
the fans of the target may have gotten upset,

295
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,450
then we will end up with a whole lot of suspects.

296
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:35,150
I think there are four suspicious people.

297
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,450
-What? -What?

298
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:38,950
Conan?

299
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:41,751
Take a look here at the button of the answer phone.

300
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:47,851
The light's blinking.

301
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:52,750
There seems to be four messages in it.

302
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,650
But, Conan, what makes you think that these four are suspicious?

303
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,650
Look more closely.

304
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,550
At the edge of the button.

305
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,751
Now, do you get it?

306
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:04,950
The blood on it has been rubbed off.

307
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:05,951
What?

308
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:08,950
You're right.

309
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:09,951
So that means...

310
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:14,450
someone pushed the button of the answer phone after the blood splattered.

311
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,050
I wonder who did this?

312
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:18,850
Well...

313
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:21,550
It's after the victim was struck so...

314
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:23,350
If the victim who was barely conscious

315
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:27,150
pushed it himself after the culprit fled,

316
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:30,350
he would've called the police instead of pushing the answer phone button.

317
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:31,750
Besides, inspector,

318
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:35,150
there are no blood stains on the finger of the victim.

319
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:38,150
So that means that the killer pushed the button?

320
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:39,350
Yes.

321
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,150
It's only likely to think

322
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:43,850
that the button was pushed after the victim was struck.

323
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:46,650
Why would the killer do something like that?

324
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,750
Well, most probably because the killer

325
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:51,050
didn't want anyone to find Mr. Sugimori.

326
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,950
If the phone is set on answer phone even if someone were to call,

327
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:56,250
no one would come thinking that he's out somewhere.

328
00:16:56,251 --> 00:17:02,650
But the key of this room is on table and the door wasn't locked.

329
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:03,651
Key?

330
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:11,750
If the killer didn't want Mr. Sugimori to be found,

331
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,551
I think the killer would've locked the door.

332
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:16,750
That's true.

333
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:19,750
Then the only possible thing left would be...

334
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,351
The killer...

335
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,550
Entered the message into the answer phone...

336
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:27,351
In order to establish an alibi.

337
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:32,450
Then it's understandable why the door wasn't locked.

338
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,050
Yeah.

339
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,450
If discovery of his body is too delayed

340
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:38,350
and the estimated time of death becomes uncertain,

341
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:41,350
the alibi that is established will go down the drain.

342
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,850
What?

343
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:45,850
Okay. Let's listen to these right now.

344
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,351
What's going on?

345
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:52,351
What's with this boy?

346
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,350
Okay. Let's hear the voices of the four suspects.

347
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:58,650
Wait! Inspector!

348
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,650
What? What is it?

349
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:03,150
Shouldn't we record it while listening to it, just in case?

350
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,950
That way, we can listen to it repeatedly.

351
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:09,450
We don't want to risk making a mistake and losing the tape.

352
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,251
True.

353
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,250
I'll go ask the forensic officers

354
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:19,050
for a recording device and have them bring it over.

355
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,750
-Do that, will you? -Excuse me.

356
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:22,950
Hey, Conan!

357
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:26,750
Is the killer's voice really inside the answer phone?

358
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:27,850
Yeah.

359
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:31,350
The blood that splattered on the "on" button was partially smeared off.

360
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,850
After killing Mr. Sugimori,

361
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,650
the killer turned on the answer phone

362
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:38,550
and left a message in it to establish his alibi.

363
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:45,050
But the killer could've done so just to confuse authorities, right?

364
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,951
Then take a look at that.

365
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:50,950
There's blood on the door knob of the entrance door.

366
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:54,150
It's evidence that the killer rushed out of this room

367
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:56,650
without realizing that it was there.

368
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:58,850
Oh, you're right.

369
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,351
There's blood on it.

370
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:06,550
The blood smeared on the answering machine button wasn't intentional.

371
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,950
It doesn't look like the killer

372
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:10,950
suddenly tried to scheme something at the last minute either.

373
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:14,150
If there are no fingerprints detected on the blood on the knob,

374
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:17,550
the killer must've used a glove.

375
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:19,251
Slow down a bit.

376
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,551
Aren't you speeding off too much from the beginning?

377
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:29,950
Officer Takagi and Inspector Megure are used to you,

378
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,350
so maybe it's okay.

379
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:34,750
But it's the first time Ms. Kobayashi hears you making a deduction.

380
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,151
She looked flustered.

381
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:39,651
Slow down a bit.

382
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,550
Slow down?

383
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,150
She's looking this way, too.

384
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,650
Not good.

385
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:50,250
I hear you do a lot of things.

386
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:51,850
Like what?

387
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:58,350
Saying things like "Huh" or "Funny".

388
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,351
You know, those deceiving kind of stupid childish remarks you make.

389
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,550
Why, you...

390
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,250
I'm sure you know this,

391
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,550
but if the public learns about your detective work,

392
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:11,050
it'll eventually reach their ears, too.

393
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,050
Yeah, I know.

394
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:17,850
I was planning on keeping my mouth shut during this interview, too.

395
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,850
I wonder about that.

396
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:27,050
Is it true that this victim, Mr. Sugimori, is a writer in demand?

397
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,250
Yes.

398
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:30,450
When he came over to the school the day before yesterday,

399
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:33,250
he himself said so.

400
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:36,850
He told me that his name is becoming rather popular these days.

401
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:41,850
If so, it would seem that he would be living in a better place than this.

402
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:46,850
Maybe Mr. Sugimori was just lying.

403
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:47,851
No. He...

404
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,850
I know.

405
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,951
It's kind of embarrassing acting it out after being told to do so.

406
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,650
Look at that!

407
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:02,451
There's an interesting key on Mr. Sugimori's hip!

408
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,851
Look! A silver horse is attached to it!

409
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:13,451
That person must've loved animals.

410
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:15,851
Hey!

411
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:18,850
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:20,750
It's the key to a Ferrari.

413
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:22,250
You mean that super car?

414
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:24,851
Is that a super car?

415
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,650
But if that's true,

416
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:32,050
it could be that Mr. Sugimori was poor because of the car.

417
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,850
There are people who are tight on their living expenses

418
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:38,150
because they want to spend money on their luxury car.

419
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:41,150
He had the key to this room separated from his car keys,

420
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:43,550
so this shows that he was also most probably a show-off.

421
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:45,750
Hey, Conan.

422
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:49,950
What was that "huh" thing a while ago about?

423
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:54,450
We're looked down upon by adults because of such attitudes of yours.

424
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:58,050
I think it's cute, but maybe it's a bit too childish.

425
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,650
That's right, Conan!

426
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,550
Please don't go around doing stuff like that all on your own.

427
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:04,451
Oh, come on.

428
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,351
But...

429
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:13,851
No matter how I go about doing this...

430
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,251
it's not gonna be easy.

431
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:50,650
"Next Episode" -This is your voice, right, Ms. Kobayashi?

432
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:52,750
Which means that Ms. Kobayashi is the killer!

433
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:53,950
No.

434
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:56,451
There's only one person who has a solid alibi.

435
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:58,451
Wait.

436
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:02,250
Right. Ms. Kobayashi is suspicious of me.

437
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,850
Fever?

438
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:07,850
Come to think of it, all of them had something to do with hay fever.

439
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,950
Hey, kids. I'd like to ask you all something.

440
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:10,951
Here it comes.

441
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:17,251
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 2)"

442
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:35,150
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:37,650
"Sound of the railroad crossing."

444
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:39,250
Movie time!

445
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:40,650
The movie, Requirement of the Detectives.

446
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:42,151
It's Requiem.
