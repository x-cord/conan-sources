Yaiba Kick!

2
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:16,767
Masked Yaiba!

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,567
Cut! Okay!

4
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,667
I was worried since it was raining on and off this morning,

5
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,367
but I'm glad we came to watch the show.

6
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:31,167
Yaiba's action is super cool even in the mud.

7
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,067
I know. It's so intense.

00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:39,567
"Masaya Tatsumi (26)"

9
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,767
Hey, what are you doing?

10
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:44,367
Don't get angry, Genta.

11
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,367
As another Yaiba fan,

12
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:49,667
I understand his desire to watch from the front.

13
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:52,467
Yeah, but...

14
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,467
Are you worried about him?

15
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:57,467
Yeah.

16
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:03,767
Yaiba...

17
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:06,167
I'm not sure what's so interesting,

18
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:09,467
but at the very least, he doesn't seem to be a Yaiba fan.

19
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,067
Where are we?

20
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,767
I'm hungry.

21
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,467
Where are we?

22
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,667
What happened to us?

23
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,367
Conan's missing!

24
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,467
Is it Conan?

25
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,767
Who are you?

26
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,167
It's that man from before.

27
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,967
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

28
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:06,167
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

29
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,667
Something happened at the Yaiba show!

30
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,667
Where did you guys go?

31
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,167
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,867
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,467
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:56,055 --> 00:04:01,955
"The Disappearing Youth Detective Squad"

35
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,089
"2 hours prior"

36
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,189
I'm not sure what's so interesting,

37
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,989
but at the very least, he doesn't seem to be a Yaiba fan.

38
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,989
Cut! Okay!

39
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,989
We're moving locations! Hurry, please!

40
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,089
They're changing filming locations.

41
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,989
What's next?

42
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,289
Over there.

43
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,589
Let's hurry.

44
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,989
Conan, Ai, let's go.

45
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:28,189
Okay.

46
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,589
He's gone.

47
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:30,789
What?

48
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:34,489
What should we do?

49
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,789
Conan!

50
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,089
We're leaving you behind!

51
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:38,989
Haibara, hurry!

52
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:40,689
Okay, fine.

53
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,089
We'll be right there.

54
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,889
That was fun.

55
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,889
Yaiba was awesome.

56
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,289
I'm so hungry.

58
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:58,489
All right! Dumplings, please!

59
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:01,389
-Oh, Genta. -Oh, Genta.

60
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,889
You're still thinking about him?

61
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,089
Yeah.

62

"Toshie Nakama (75)" -Thank you.

63
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,989
Someone, help!

64
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,089
Oh, no!

65
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,589
That's ten thousand yen!

66
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:18,689
Catch it!

67
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,089
Genta!

68
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,889
Catch that bill!

69
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,189
What's going on?

70
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:29,689
Genta, catch it!

71
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:32,689
Hey, wait!

72
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,389
I found it!

73
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,689
Found it!

74
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,489
Found it!

75
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,689
-No way! -Why?

76
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,889
There should only be one.

77
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,989
Let me see those.

78
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,689
Are these...

79
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:03,789
Yeah.

80
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,389
They all have the same serial number.

81
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,289
Which means these are...

82
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,589
Counterfeit bills...

83
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,089
A few counterfeit bills were discovered in the city recently.

84
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:19,489
There is a rumor that an international criminal organization is involved.

85
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,089
That must be it.

86
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,489
Which means...

87
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:24,689
That grandma is a counterfeiter?

88
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:25,689
-What? -What?

89
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,489
Then I doubt she would've asked us to catch it.

90
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,689
Yeah. This one's different.

91
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:36,989
Conan, it's a little damp.

92
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:39,089
It's probably wet from the rain.

93
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:42,689
This is orange juice.

94
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:44,989
It must be that.

95
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,289
A phone?

96
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,489
What does this mean, Conan?

97
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,589
While someone was drinking some juice,

98
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:09,589
a strong breeze blew away their counterfeit bills.

99
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:11,789
They spilled their juice then.

100
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,689
They rushed to gather them up,

101
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,389
but couldn't get them all,

102
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,589
and left without realizing they'd dropped their phone.

103
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,089
Sounds about right.

104
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,689
Amazing.

105
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,189
Way to go, Conan.

106
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:27,689
This is a major incident.

107
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,689
But that means...

108
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,389
Yeah. Eventually, the counterfeiter will realize what's missing

109
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,989
and come back for it.

110
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,889
What should we do?

111
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,889
Isn't it obvious?

112
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,489
The Youth Detective Squad will apprehend him.

113
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:43,689
It's a stakeout!

114
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,089
I think we should call the police.

115
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,489
I'm going to call Inspector Megure.

116
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,889
Stay with them.

117
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:58,989
Got it.

118
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,189
Hello, Inspector Megure?

119
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:07,189
"Metropolitan Police Department" -Conan.

120
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:11,489
What? You're staking out a counterfeiting operation?

121
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,589
"Bella Hikifune (38)"

122
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,589
Now, let's send these to the police.

123
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,489
Hey, wait!

124
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:50,989
Ai, hurry!

125
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,489
She's getting away!

126
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,989
Please hurry!

127
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,189
Gosh.

128
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:05,089
What? Where did they go?

129
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,789
"Tailing the culprit."

130
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,289
Huh?

131
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:32,089
Maybe she took a turn.

132
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:33,189
This way?

133
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,289
That way?

134
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,889
Let's go that way.

135
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:36,889
Hey!

136
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:40,289
She's not here.

137
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,489
-She's not here. -Did she go that way?

138
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:45,089
It's a dead end.

139
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:46,389
Let's go back.

140
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:47,489
Yeah.

141
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,589
When did they get there?

142
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,589
Hello, little children.

143
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:58,889
Playtime is over.

144
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,789
Hand over your phones.

145
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:05,789
That's it. They caught us then.

146
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,489
And made us inhale some kind of anesthetic.

147
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,089
Yeah, that's right.

148
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,289
Almost there.

149
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:17,589
I'm free!

150
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:19,389
We did it!

151
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,289
Me, too. Untie me.

152
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,189
You got it!

153
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,789
Did you really think I'd say that?

154
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:31,789
-What? -There's no way we'd untie you.

155
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:34,589
At first we thought you were a Yaiba fan,

156
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,089
but you're super suspicious.

157
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,689
You heard them.

158
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,989
And we don't know where we are.

159
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,789
Huh? Something's not right.

160
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:16,389
That tower...

161
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,589
I couldn't see it from here before.

162
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:22,989
That's it. There was a container here earlier.

163
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,589
Darn it! Where are they taking us?

164
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,789
Taking us?

165
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:29,889
We're moving?

166
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:35,889
Anyway, where did they go?

167
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,889
The number you have dialed

168
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,589
is either outside the service area or currently powered...

169
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:42,289
What's going on?

170
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:44,589
Haibara.

171
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,089
You guys, can you hear me?

172
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,689
Can you hear me?

173
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:52,189
Conan...

174
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:55,889
Darn it. I can't determine the location of their badges.

175
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,289
You guys!

176
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:00,289
Are you guys okay? Where are you?

177
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,789
Hey!

178
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:06,489
It's that orange juice.

179
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,689
I knew it.

180
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:11,689
You're the one who lost his counterfeit bills in the wind.

181
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,789
Who are you kids?

182
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,189
We are...

183
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:18,589
The Youth Detective Squad...

184
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:22,589
I don't know where we are, but we're moving.

185
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,789
We're trapped in here with that man you found suspicious.

186
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:28,589
The counterfeiter.

187
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,189
You're what?

188
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:32,189
You're moving?

189
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:33,689
And trapped?

190
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,889
So that's how it is.

191
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:56,889
Amazing!

192
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,289
It's money!

193
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,389
They're all ten thousand yen bills!

194
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,789
Just how much is there?

195
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:08,389
How much eel can I buy with this?

196
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,089
None.

197
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,089
They're all counterfeit bills.

198
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,789
"Masaya Tatsumi"

199
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:32,189
Why don't you explain yourself, Tatsumi?

200
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:40,689
That's it!

201
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:58,689
We can't see outside from here,

202
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,489
so we don't know where we've traveled.

203
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,289
The man trapped in here with us

204
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,389
doesn't seem to know where we're going.

205
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:06,389
Come to think of it...

206
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:15,089
It's those footprints.

207
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,189
In that case...

208
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:21,889
Crap! The footprints are disappearing!

209
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,289
Darn it. Where did it go?

210
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,889
You guys, answer me!

211
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,089
Hit back!

212
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,889
We're in here, Conan!

213
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,289
We're in here!

214
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,389
We're in here! We're in here!

215
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,489
Darn it. They're in that one?

216
00:14:57,289 --> 00:14:59,289
If they keep heading this way...

217
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,689
They'll reach the harbor.

218
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,589
Are they traveling overseas from there?

219
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:13,789
Why don't you talk already, Tatsumi?

220
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:17,089
Why is this happening to you?

221
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,789
What does it matter?

222
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,889
They're just some counterfeit bills.

223
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:24,289
I just took a few so I could pay off my debts.

224
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,989
Conan!

225
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,489
We're leaving you behind!

226
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:30,389
Haibara, hurry!

227
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,789
We'll be right there.

228
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:50,889
All right!

229
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:55,789
Hey, wait!

230
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,789
Darn it. Where did they go?

231
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,889
You violated the contract, mister.

232
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:07,689
Why don't you return all the notes you took?

233
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:14,289
That's why she was at that park.

234
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,989
Edogawa, did you get all of that?

235
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:20,289
Yeah. She's probably a mafia.

236
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,689
Mafia...

237
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,089
Probably one specialized in counterfeiting.

238
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:26,589
Am I wrong?

239
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,189
No.

240
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:29,989
But I was just an underling.

241
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,689
I got sick of being worked so hard.

242
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,489
We stopped.

243
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:36,589
It stopped?

244
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,389
Crap. Is the ship leaving?

245
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:47,789
We're being lifted?

246
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:53,989
That must be it.

247
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:08,089
Darn it. Which one is it?

248
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,489
Haibara, you guys!

249
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:16,089
What's going on?

250
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,189
It's like an elevator.

251
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:19,889
I feel sick.

252
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,189
Could it be...

253
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,989
Could it be? Could it be what?

254
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:27,089
Water?

255
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:30,089
What's wrong, you guys?

256
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,089
Answer me!

257
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,789
Haibara! Genta!

258
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,689
Mitsuhiko! Ayumi!

259
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:35,889
Answer me!

260
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,489
Bravo. Toys these days sure are amazing.

261
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:57,389
I called the police on the way here.

262
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,589
You can't escape now.

263
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:01,189
Oh, really?

264
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:06,189
Let go!

265
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,489
We're from the Metropolitan Police Department.

266
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,889
You must be Bella Hikifune, the owner of this ship.

267
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,289
We were told your ship was full of counterfeit bills.

268
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,389
We'll be searching it.

269
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:25,889
We've also been informed

270
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:29,189
that you've kidnapped and imprisoned the child witnesses.

271
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:30,889
Oh, how scary.

272
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:35,189
But as exceptional Japanese policemen,

273
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:38,889
surely you realize this isn't a Japanese ship.

274
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:40,389
If you don't find anything,

275
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:43,089
this will be a major international incident.

276
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,689
How does that sound?

277
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:46,489
Well...

278
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,989
You're welcome to search it if you'd like.

279
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:03,989
If you discover a single piece of evidence...

280
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:08,689
The evidence is right here!

281
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,689
-Conan? -Conan?

282
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,289
Look at that!

283
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:13,289
What?

284
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,389
What is it?

285
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:24,589
Keep it up, everyone!

286
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:27,589
Darn it! I can't do this!

287
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:28,989
I'm at my limit!

288
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:31,189
Help!

289
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,689
I can't swim!

290
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:58,189
You guys. Thank goodness.

291
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:04,989
I was so scared.

292
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,989
We did it. We've been saved.

293
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:12,489
I'm hungry.

294
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:19,989
Could you come with us to the station?

295
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:23,389
Oh, I'm just the owner.

296
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,489
The crew must've done this on their own.

297
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:28,889
Hey, let me see your wallet.

298
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:31,489
You've got a ten thousand yen bill, right?

299
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:33,789
I don't have any counterfeit bills.

300
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:35,089
Not that.

301
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:38,089
The old woman's ten thousand yen bill.

302
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,389
That's it.

303
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,489
What?

304
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,989
But doesn't that make you a thief?

305
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:03,289
You're one cheap mafia.

306
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,489
More importantly...

307
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:08,989
If you've touched the other counterfeit bills with those hands...

308
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,789
But they're soaked. The evidence must be ruined.

309
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,789
You mean these?

310
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,689
Shall we compare your fingerprints?

311
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:29,089
No, there's no need for that.

312
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,889
Amazing. Ai, when did you grab those?

313
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:36,189
You must've been watching while you were following her.

314
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:37,189
Yeah.

315
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:42,989
"Tailing the culprit."

316
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:50,789
Really?

317
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,789
You really are amazing.

318
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,089
No wonder you're a member of the Youth Detective Squad.

319
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,889
That's not much of a compliment.

320
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:00,189
They can hear you.

321
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:02,689
I don't care.

322
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,989
The ten thousand yen note was returned to the old woman,

323
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:33,089
who generously thanked the Youth Detective Squad.

324
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,989
So good!

325
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:45,189
"Next Episode" -Who was that man?

326
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:48,289
Which means the weapon disappeared later.

327
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:51,489
Did someone take it?

328
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:55,989
We should be focusing on the certainty of their alibis...

329
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:58,789
when determining the culprit.

330
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:02,889
This time I'll run down the culprit.

331
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,589
So that's how it is.

332
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:10,689
Next Conan, "A Day Without Conan"
