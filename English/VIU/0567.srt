1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,320
I'm tired.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,020
What? Outdoor Spa?

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,120
Looks like fun to me.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,620
Let's give it a try.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,420
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,520
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,220
What is the alibi trick that was used?

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,020
Taking advantage of the blind-spot?

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,920
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,020
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,420
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:17,889
"Murderous Intent Raining on an Outdoor Spa."

13
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:24,165
There's no use in stalling!

14
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:26,165
"Hideaki Umezu (70)" -Why don't you just hurry up.

15
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:27,665
"Mortgage Company President" -and sign this contract?

16
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:29,465
"Kouichi Maekawa (50)" -I told you many times.

17
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,465
"Hot Springs Park Manager" -that I have no desire to sell this place!

18
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,165
What an incapable successor!

19
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:36,365
You seriously think you can gather customers

20
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,765
by selling octopuses here?

21
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:40,865
It's because of a certain gargoyle perching over my place

22
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:42,965
that the customers are being driven away.

23
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:48,565
Welcome.

24
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:51,465
Be prepared to be disappointed by like this lousy hot spring.

25
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:53,265
-What? -Why?

26
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:56,565
-Now... -It's all right, just ignore him.

27
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:58,465
"Mari Ehara (35)" -This happens all the time,

28
00:02:58,465 --> 00:02:59,665
"Hideaki's First Daughter" -so don't mind him.

29
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:00,765
"Yasuko Umeza (28)" -That's right.

30
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:04,065
"Hideaki's Second Daughter" -My dad always here to pick fights.

31
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:06,865
Enough of that! You're all grown up yet all,

32
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:09,265
you can do is mooch off of me.

33
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:11,765
I'll have you know that you're to be quiet and respect my decisions.

34
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,465
Ouch!

35
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:17,665
"Shousuke Yagihashi (27)" -The reason our president comes.

36
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,565
"Hideaki's Secretary" -to this place is for business.

37
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,865
You got that right.

38
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:24,665
-Let's head inside! -Yes, sir.

39
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:31,165
He says we'll be disappointed? Yet he goes in anyway.

40
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,765
Two adults and one child.

41
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,465
I sincerely apologize

42
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,965
for embarrassing you with our fight earlier.

43
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,365
Who's that guy pushing his weight around?

44
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:42,765
He's the president from a mortgage company.

45
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:47,765
Over the past month he's been frequenting our private spa.

46
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,165
Business harassment.

47
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:55,565
We're going to prepare some freshly caught octopuses.

48
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:58,265
So please come to our restaurant after your baths.

49
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,365
Looks tasty!

50
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:04,365
All right, spa first and octopus later.

51
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,465
Looks like we're starting to run low on octopuses,

52
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:08,365
so I'll go to the coast and catch some.

53
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:09,365
I'll leave this place to you.

54
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,565
Huh? But low tide is at 8:02 pm today.

55
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:16,465
One hour earlier won't make a difference.

56
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:24,065
Amazing! Look at all the variety of baths.

57
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:27,965
I can't decide.

58
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:30,965
Let's check out the iron tub first!

59
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,265
Such a nice bath!

60
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:39,265
Ran, the heat's starting to get to me.

61
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:41,465
Huh? Already?

62
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:47,265
Hey, is it all right for you to get in the spa even when you're injured?

63
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:51,365
No, that's why I'll only take a light dip in the Jacuzzi.

64
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:53,865
I can't wring a towel while I'm like this after all.

65
00:04:56,665 --> 00:05:00,465
Conan, this spa is fabulous.

66
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:02,465
My body's floating on the water.

67
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:05,865
I... I'm heading out now.

68
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,865
Weird child.

69
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,565
Wasn't she...

70
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:22,865
So good.

71
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:27,765
Drinking beer again, aren't you going to driving later?

72
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:32,765
No need to worry. I've decided that we'll stay at a nearby hotel tonight.

73
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,265
That was actually your plan all along, wasn't it?

74
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,065
No, the octopus suckers are getting on me.

75
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:41,865
The arms will move even after they're cut off.

76
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:43,165
Aren't they fresh?

77
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:45,765
I used a harpoon to capture these during low tide.

78
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:49,465
But at other times, I use octopus pots or long-lines to trap them.

79
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,565
How do you figure out where to place the pots and long-lines?

80
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:55,165
I float a buoy to mark the spot.

81
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:58,665
Do other people around here fish for octopuses too?

82
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:01,565
Just me, since I'm specially trained as a fisherman.

83
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:03,065
But I only did when I felt like it.

84
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,765
And my dad suddenly died a year ago,

85
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,565
so I've become this place's manager on short notice.

86
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:12,465
What was that sound?

87
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:15,865
It was probably from the private outdoor spa.

88
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:19,865
Hey! Go check out the private outdoor spa.

89
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:21,065
Sure!

90
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:43,165
President...

91
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,865
Dad...

92
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:46,565
No way.

93
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:50,265
It's no use, he's already stopped breathing.

94
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,465
Please call the police and an ambulance!

95
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:54,765
Ah, right!

96
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:05,465
The deceased is mortgage company president,

97
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:11,365
Hideaki Umezu is frequented this private outdoor spa every night, right?

98
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,865
That's right.

99
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,965
You found him bleeding from his head and sitting in the spa?

100
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,665
It was at exactly 8:00.

101
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:22,765
A loud tumbling and splashing sound came from this outdoor spa.

102
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:25,565
A rock on the cliff was close to tumbling off,

103
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,065
and I was about to schedule a maintenance appointment.

104
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:30,765
Safety management is a great responsibility, you know!

105
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:32,965
I'm truly sorry.

106
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:36,465
So this was an accident. The rock fell from that cliff

107
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:39,165
and hit Mr. Umezu's head.

108
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:41,765
Hey, retrieve that rock immediately!

109
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,365
Yes, sir!

110
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,465
Ah, let me help too.

111
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:50,565
We don't require your help.

112
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:53,565
Oh, I see.

113
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:57,465
This rock is covered in quite a bit of moss.

114
00:07:57,465 --> 00:08:00,365
Bloodstains and hair are attached on it.

115
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:11,465
Looks like the rock broke off and fell from here.

116
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:14,065
Hey, there are friction marks

117
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:16,165
on the nearby rocks around that hole.

118
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,965
What? This is...

119
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,065
Don't tell me someone tried to force the rock out.

120
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:24,965
And caused the scratch marks by wiggling the rock around?

121
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:25,965
In other words,

122
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:29,965
the rock didn't naturally fall off the cliff and hit Mr. Umezu.

123
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:32,365
Rather, someone stood on top of the cliff

124
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:35,765
and threw the rock directly at Mr. Umezu.

125
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,365
This is not an accident, but a murder!

126
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:42,465
But, we did hear sounds resembling a rock rolling down the cliff.

127
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:44,565
Since the rock was heavy, the culprit rolled it over the edge.

128
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,465
I see.

129
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:55,265
At this height, it was impossible for anyone to enter from the outside.

130
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:58,965
In that case, the only passage to get here is from that glass door.

131
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,565
A crime committed by someone

132
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:02,365
from this hot springs park at 8:00,

133
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:04,565
so it seems...

134
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:08,165
All right, everyone gather in the lobby!

135
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:14,765
I'll bring some tea here.

136
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:16,265
Watch out!

137
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:21,365
Hey, you! Where were you looking?

138
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:23,965
I'm terribly sorry!

139
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:28,865
My apologies.

140
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,865
I can't believe that.

141
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:34,665
Mr. Maekawa, there's no need for tea, so please come here.

142
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:37,865
All right.

143
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:39,965
What do you want to talk to us about?

144
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:44,665
Mr. Umezu was apparently murdered by someone!

145
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,565
During the estimated time of death around 8:00 pm.

146
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,365
The relevant parties in the spas

147
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:52,465
of this hot springs park were you three people!

148
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:54,565
I would like to ask what you were doing

149
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,965
and your whereabouts during that time.

150
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:58,265
Nonsense!

151
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,265
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

152
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,065
First, I'll question the person who met with Mr. Umezu last,

153
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:07,065
Secretary Yagihashi, if you please!

154
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,565
Yes, at around 7:00,

155
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:12,965
I was helping the president get changed in the locker room.

156
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:14,465
After I sent the president off,

157
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:17,265
I received a call from work and I returned to the spa

158
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:21,965
about 5 minutes after Mr. Mouri and the others.

159
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,165
Where were you at around 8:00?

160
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:28,565
I was taking a shower. After that I heard the commotion.

161
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:34,865
Well, it's only a short distance from the showers to the crime scene.

162
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:36,565
No way!

163
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:38,465
And the eldest daughter, Mari?

164
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:43,065
I entered the spa some time after the detective's daughter did.

165
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:45,165
And once there, I was in the Jacuzzi the whole time.

166
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:48,165
Here, you can smell the jasmine from my hair, can you?

167
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,065
Jasmine?

168
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:53,465
In order to enhance the healing effects of our Jacuzzi,

169
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,765
we supplement it with herbs.

170
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:57,965
Ran, is that correct?

171
00:10:57,965 --> 00:10:59,065
Yes.

172
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:03,965
I went in the spa earlier than both Mari and Yasuko.

173
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:08,465
The Jacuzzi is right next to the private outdoor spa, too.

174
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:11,665
Looks like Mari had an opportunity to commit the crime as well!

175
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:13,665
Stop blurting out nonsense!

176
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,465
And the younger daughter, Yasuko?

177
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,565
I was talking to a friend on the phone,

178
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:22,765
so I got in the spa about five minutes later than my sister did.

179
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,265
I was at the reclining spa in the far back.

180
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:28,465
But sometime before 8:00,

181
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:32,765
I saw Yasuko headed for the mist sauna.

182
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:35,165
Mr. Yagihashi was there too.

183
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:39,265
Oh, my. What were you two doing in the mist?

184
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,365
We happened to bump into each other at the sauna!

185
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:46,065
And officer, you forgot about the most suspicious party.

186
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:49,365
Our president was about to buyout this hot springs park.

187
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:52,665
Couldn't the manager, Maekawa have held a grudge over this?

188
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:55,365
The female staff member was confirmed

189
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:57,665
to be at the front desk by the security camera,

190
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,865
But Mr. Maekawa, you were not present at all times.

191
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:02,665
Well, since we were running low on octopuses,

192
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:05,865
I went out to catch some at sea around 7:00.

193
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:08,865
From 7:30 to 8:00 I was in the restaurant,

194
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:11,065
and Mr. Mouri can attest to that.

195
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,465
Is that true?

196
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:17,965
Yeah, Mr. Maekawa was with me in the restaurant the whole time.

197
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,765
I see.

198
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:24,465
To recap of the four people relating to Mr. Umezu,

199
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:27,365
all of you except Mr. Maekawa, were in the hot springs park.

200
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:29,965
And had the opportunity to murder him.

201
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:32,365
The older daughter, Mari, was at the Jacuzzi.

202
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:34,565
The younger daughter, Yasuko was at the reclining spa.

203
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,965
And the secretary Yagihashi was in the showers.

204
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,565
These two have motives, as well.

205
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,665
Father was fiercely opposed to the two of them getting married!

206
00:12:42,665 --> 00:12:45,365
If you're trying to incriminate us,

207
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,365
you'd also be one to benefit from this!

208
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,665
How dare you!

209
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:52,565
After all, your business did poorly and you're in debt now, aren't you?

210
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:56,265
You sunk your claws into dad's assets in order to pay it off, didn't you?

211
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:59,665
Don't just go saying whatever you please!

212
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:02,565
Regardless, is it true that you merely

213
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:05,665
"happened" to run into Yasuko at the sauna?

214
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,765
That is...

215
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:09,965
I called him there.

216
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:11,465
Yasuko!

217
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:13,965
I figured since dad opposed our marriage,

218
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:17,465
we had no choice but to elope.

219
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:21,865
We had planned to do just that after this park was bought out.

220
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:23,965
You're just spitting a bunch of rubbish out of your mouth.

221
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:27,665
Officer, don't be fooled by this man's words!

222
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:29,465
Because of his attempt to marry Yasuko,

223
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:32,865
father angrily told him to learn his place!

224
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:36,365
That's why he held a grudge. You ungrateful goon!

225
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,865
This is...

226
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,265
I see.

227
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,065
Mr. Mouri, did you figure out who did it?

228
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:53,265
Yeah, I got it.

229
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,665
I bet that the culprit didn't want to leave their fingerprints behind.

230
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,965
So they used a towel to wrap around the rock

231
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:01,865
before throwing it at Mr. Umezu.

232
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:07,565
In that case, the towel should have moss that rubbed off the rock.

233
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:10,965
You can see the smudges here, can't you?

234
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,365
Could it be that towel...

235
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,965
I don't know anything about it.

236
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,765
Why was something like that inside my bag?

237
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:21,065
Mari, it won't do you any good to say and talk your way out of this.

238
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:24,565
We'll find out for ourselves after having this towel explained.

239
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:25,765
Now, everyone,

240
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,065
I'll explain everything in detail.

241
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:30,465
Please, come to the private outdoor spa!

242
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:33,265
As expected of Mr. Mouri!

243
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:37,365
No good, at this rate...

244
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,765
Ran, what's up?

245
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:42,665
Well, I was just wondering

246
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:46,265
why I was able to stay on top of the water in the float spa.

247
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:48,365
That's easy.

248
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:51,565
Like the Dead Sea, it contains a high concentration of salt

249
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,565
which makes you float.

250
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:55,765
Float?

251
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:57,665
Don't tell me...

252
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,765
Wait, Conan!

253
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:09,065
Found it!

254
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:14,065
This is it.

255
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:17,665
Now I've figured out the trick that the culprit used!

256
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:26,461
Conan! You're always running off at the drop of a hat.

257
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:27,808
Ah, sorry.

258
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:31,633
Actually, Pops asked me to do something...

259
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:35,521
Got it!

260
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:38,621
All right, let's get things started!

261
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:42,121
The reason I named Mari as the culprt it was...

262
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:49,321
Just for laughs!

263
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:52,521
Mr. Mouri, this is no time for jokes!

264
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:54,621
Well, quiet down and listen!

265
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,321
Mari, your right hand is injured, isn't it?

266
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:01,121
Yeah...

267
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:04,921
With a wound like that,

268
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:07,121
it would be difficult to tightly wring a towel.

269
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:09,421
Wring tightly...

270
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:12,821
But that towel was tightly wrung!

271
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:13,821
That's right.

272
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:18,321
In other words, that towel did not belong to Mari.

273
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:22,021
However, the towel did come out of her bag.

274
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:26,821
The culprit put it there. In order to place the blame on Mari!

275
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,721
What was that?

276
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,921
However, it ended up exposing him.

277
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:35,421
He didn't think deep enough about Mari's wound.

278
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:37,421
So, how did the culprit do it?

279
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:39,621
The only one who was able to put the towel in the bag

280
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:42,821
that Mari carried all along is...

281
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:44,821
I'm terribly sorry.

282
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:50,221
Mr. Maekawa, it was you.

283
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:52,621
But Mr. Mouri, at the time of the crime,

284
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:55,921
Mr. Maekawa has an alibi of being with you.

285
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:59,121
Mr. Umezu's fingernails were ragged and dirty.

286
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:05,521
It's possible that Mr. Umezu didn't die after being hit by the rock.

287
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:09,921
But from having his head forced under the water. And being drowned.

288
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:13,121
The reason why Mr. Umezu's fingernails were ragged and dirty

289
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:16,821
was because he was struggling and scratching at the bottom of the spa.

290
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,421
Verify this with forensics!

291
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,621
Yes, sir!

292
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:24,821
However, we rushed here soon after we heard the noise made by the rock.

293
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:28,421
It's impossible to drawn a person in such a short time.

294
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:30,821
Then, when was Mr. Umezu drowned?

295
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:34,121
Look at the disposable shampoo and soap.

296
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,021
None of them were used.

297
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,021
The seats weren't used either.

298
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:41,721
You're right! They weren't used at all.

299
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:46,421
In other words, Mr. Umezu was killed as soon as he entered the spa!

300
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:48,621
What? Around 7:00?

301
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,421
Meanwhile, Mr. Yagihashi,

302
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:55,121
Yasuko and Mari were in the locker room.

303
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,921
The only person capable of committing the crime

304
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:59,721
was Mr. Maekawa.

305
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,921
At that time you went to catch octopuses.

306
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:05,221
Despite the fact that it was an hour too early for low tide.

307
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:10,121
You actually didn't go to catch octopuses, didn't you?

308
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:13,421
And without his suspecting anything,

309
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:17,121
you brained Mr. Umezu with the rock.

310
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:20,921
Then, you forced his head under the water... Drowned him.

311
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,721
What are you talking about?

312
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:28,321
You heard the noise at 8:00 as well, didn't you?

313
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,621
Let's see, if the time of the crime was 7:00,

314
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:34,721
then who rolled the rock at 8:00?

315
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:38,221
After all, Mr. Maekawa was in the restaurant at that time.

316
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:40,321
He used a trick.

317
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:43,221
Conan, do what I just taught you!

318
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,421
Right.

319
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:50,121
Inspector Yokomizo, carry that rock and climb up this cliff!

320
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:53,221
Sure.

321
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:56,821
This rock sure is heavy.

322
00:18:56,821 --> 00:19:00,421
You can see a small harbor down there, right?

323
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:02,921
-Oh, yes. -Ran!

324
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:04,521
Here!

325
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:12,221
This rope was tied to the buoy near the harbor.

326
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:14,921
It's a type of rope called a long-line.

327
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,921
Long-line?

328
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,921
Grab the long-line and pull it straight.

329
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:22,921
Next, tilt the rock just brought up

330
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:24,821
forward at the edge of the cliff.

331
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:27,921
Then use the wooden rod to support the rock.

332
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:30,021
With this, we're all set.

333
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:36,321
Ran!

334
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:38,221
All right!

335
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,821
What's this?

336
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:53,421
The sea entered low tide at 8:00 and had the lowest water level.

337
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:57,721
As such, the buoy floating in the sea went down as well.

338
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:59,221
The buoy pulled the line down,

339
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:02,921
which removed the rod and caused the rock to fall.

340
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:06,721
In other words, he used low tide as his time difference trick.

341
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,921
Low tide?

342
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:10,621
The rope and rod that would've served as evidence

343
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:13,821
flew off the ledge and headed straight into the sea.

344
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,521
It's true.

345
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:18,521
See the part of the ledge that has been clipped away?

346
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,121
Oh, yes.

347
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:24,821
Those friction marks were made by the hooks attached to the long-line.

348
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:26,821
That was pretty telltale.

349
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:30,221
I see, using this method...

350
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:32,421
He could cause the rock to roll down at 8:00

351
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:34,921
even if he were in a different place.

352
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:36,721
It's an interesting deduction,

353
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:39,821
but that's all circumstantial evidence, isn't it?

354
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,821
Do you have any concrete evidence?

355
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:47,521
Mr. Maekawa, why have you kept your pants rolled up all the time?

356
00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:49,921
Why don't you roll them down?

357
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:51,221
What was that?

358
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,921
You can't, right?

359
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,421
When you brained Mr. Umezu with the rock,

360
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,421
his blood splattered on your pants.

361
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:02,421
You only noticed it after you saw forensics roll up his pants

362
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:04,721
to retrieve the rock from the spa.

363
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,421
You then unconsciously glanced at your pants.

364
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:11,421
And hurriedly rolled them up!

365
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,521
The police had already started their investigation,

366
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:19,421
so you couldn't change them without raising suspicion.

367
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,921
We now have decisive evidence.

368
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:27,521
As I thought, you held a grudge against our president

369
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:30,221
because he tried to buyout your hot springs park!

370
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,221
It wasn't just that.

371
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:36,621
A year ago, my father was driven to despair by his debts to Umezu

372
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:40,121
deliberately got drunk and ended up drowning in the spa.

373
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:43,121
I followed my father's will and used his life insurance

374
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:47,121
to reconstruct this hot spring park and tried to regain prosperity.

375
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:50,721
But after all, I'm a man of the sea.

376
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:54,621
In the end, I couldn't do anything about Umezu's buyout,

377
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:58,821
so I figured if he were going to rob me of the place,

378
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:02,621
I'd think up a plan to just bury him

379
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,321
with the entire hot spring park.

380
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:40,121
His snoring is so load I can't sleep.

381
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:50,921
Now I can't sleep at all!

382
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:55,621
"Next Episode" -Here!

383
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:58,521
Officer Shiratori, thank you for your work.

384
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:05,021
She is my destiny, the one who changed my life.

385
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:08,221
Another premonition of love?

386
00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:10,021
A stalker?

387
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:14,421
Oh, yes, I've been feeling such a presence since the other day.

388
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,221
Next Conan,

389
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:26,421
