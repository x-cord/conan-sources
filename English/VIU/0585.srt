1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,419
Ms. Kobayashi witnesses a murder

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,019
during the night of the fireworks.

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:08,419
Never mind, just give me that!

4
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:09,719
I'm going to kill you.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,519
Are you all right?

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,319
The victim is the woman owner of a pawn shop,

7
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,219
Ms. Akira Sumida.

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,919
Among the people who held a grudge against her,

9
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:24,219
three people were brought in as suspects

10
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:27,119
because they had no alibi on the day of the murder.

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,719
However, despite Ms. Kobayashi overhearing quarreling

12
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,019
between the culprit and the victim,

13
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:34,419
she was unable to select a voice

14
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:37,019
that matched the bellowing from the recorded voices.

15
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,719
Ms. Kobayashi is acting strange.

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,019
She for some reason seems to be avoiding Inspector Shiratori.

17
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:45,819
It seems she misunderstood

18
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:48,219
the relationship between Officer Sato and Inspector Shiratori.

19
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,419
Inspector Shiratori visits Teitan Elementary School

20
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,219
to get rid of her misunderstanding but...

21
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:58,419
I've met you long, long time ago.

22
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,519
The little girl that stopped some boys

23
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,719
from shoplifting in a bookstore.

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,919
I was moved by that girl.

25
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:08,719
That's why I became a police officer.

26
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,919
After seeing how courageous you were.

27
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,619
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

28
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,919
Besides, isn't that girl...

29
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:21,919
I think you've mistaken Officer Sato for me, haven't you?

30
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,219
If you will excuse me...

31
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,219
Wait.

32
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,719
Brooding over passing seasons

33
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,719
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

34
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,619
Both love and the case is solved at once?

35
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,619
News about Thief Kid comes bursting in too.

36
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,319
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,119
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,419
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:28,215
"Timeless Cherry Blossom Love Affair"

40
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:31,815
It seems that your trump card...

41
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:34,415
didn't work for you.

42
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,415
It's because you keep putting it off and don't tell her about it.

43
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:40,115
Besides, didn't you change the story too?

44
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:42,615
You didn't become an officer

45
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:46,515
because you saw Ms. Kobayashi bite back at the shoplifters,

46
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,215
but because of the cherry blossom flower decoration

47
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:53,015
she made out of a paper straw wrapper and gave to you, right?

48
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,315
Right, right.

49
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:57,415
It's because Ms. Kobayashi told you that Cherry blossoms are a mark

50
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:59,015
that all people of the police have on them

51
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,215
and that they symbolize strength, kindness

52
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:03,615
and is an awesome flower of justice isn't it?

53
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:04,915
No.

54
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:07,915
I thought it better to tell her that I became a police officer

55
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,415
because I saw how courageous she was.

56
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,715
I think that the words "courageous" and "police detective"

57
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:18,015
made Ms. Kobayashi imagine Officer Sato, who resembled her.

58
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,315
I'll go rephrase my sentence.

59
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:21,115
No good.

60
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:24,315
Making excuses from now would only worsen the situation.

61
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,915
I don't think she'd even give you a chance to talk.

62
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:28,715
What should I do, then?

63
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:30,815
There's only one way...

64
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:35,515
If you arrest the culprit that Ms. Kobayashi witnessed

65
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:38,915
and prove that her testimony was correct,

66
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,415
maybe she'll open her heart.

67
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,415
No, but...

68
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,015
But, weren't there any suspects

69
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:47,415
that matched the voice that Ms. Kobayashi heard?

70
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:48,415
No.

71
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:51,415
She did say that she saw the silhouetted figure

72
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,215
of the culprit flee, though.

73
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:58,215
It seems that all she could tell was that the woman had breasts

74
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,115
and had her long hair bunched and tied in the back.

75
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:03,415
Besides, the mover's truck-like vehicle

76
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:05,115
with large numbers "0" and "9" printed on it,

77
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:07,215
that she also saw hasn't been found either.

78
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:09,515
What kind of people were the suspects?

79
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:12,615
A former leader of a woman motorbike gang

80
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:16,015
with a foul mouth, Ms. Kikuna Kagitani.

81
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,515
And the woman owner of a Japanese cuisine restaurant,

82
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:20,415
who had a cold, Ms. Ryoko Takimoto.

83
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,715
Finally, former high school baseball player who hurt his shoulder

84
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:28,515
and is now working at a host club, Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

85
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:32,215
But at this point it's difficult to pinpoint the culprit

86
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:33,915
based on Ms. Kobayashi's testimony.

87
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:37,115
Then, are saying that Ms. Kobayashi is lying?

88
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,915
Ms. Kobayashi would never lie.

89
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:41,115
No.

90
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:43,515
Then, all we have to do is make a deduction.

91
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:46,615
That is, why Ms. Kobayashi was put under that illusion?

92
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:49,215
-An illusion? -Right. An illusion.

93
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:52,215
Conan!

94
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:57,215
What's up, Conan?

95
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:58,315
Was someone there?

96
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,315
Yes, a suspicious looking silhouetted figure

97
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,215
was looking in on us.

98
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:04,615
Wasn't it the culprit?

99
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:05,915
It's possible.

100
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:09,215
Since it seems that the culprit saw Ms. Kobayashi's face.

101
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:10,415
Idiot.

102
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,415
You can't tell who or where the person is

103
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,115
from by just looking at someone's face.

104
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:17,315
The culprit is probably is a camera brat

105
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:19,215
who relishes sneakily taking pictures of little girls or something.

106
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:20,615
What?

107
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:22,815
Well, staying here isn't going to get us anywhere

108
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,215
so let's head home.

109
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:28,315
Ms. Kobayashi said she'd be working late today again making texts,

110
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:30,815
so she won't be coming out for some time yet.

111
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:32,115
Hey, Conan!

112
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,815
-Please wait! -Conan!

113
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:44,615
Hey, you guys...

114
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:02,615
Yes, this is Teitan Elementary.

115
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:04,415
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

116
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,215
I'm calling from the police.

117
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:08,515
May I speak to Ms. Kobayashi please?

118
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,915
I'm Kobayashi.

119
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:13,515
I said I have nothing more to tell the police.

120
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:16,015
The car with the numbers "0" and "9"

121
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:19,615
that you witnessed has been found.

122
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:20,915
We've taken a picture of it,

123
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:23,515
so I was wondering if you could confirm it.

124
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:27,715
Yes. Then please come with that picture at a later date.

125
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,915
No, since I wanted you to confirm it right away,

126
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:33,315
I had the guard open the gate for me,

127
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:34,515
and I'm already in the school building.

128
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:36,515
I see.

129
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:38,315
Then, please come to the teachers' room.

130
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:40,415
How about the music room?

131
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,815
The thing is, this is my alma mater,

132
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:44,615
and I used to belong to the brass band club.

133
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:48,715
I felt so nostalgic that I was looking around here and there.

134
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,115
Really?

135
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:51,815
I'll see you in the music room, then.

136
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:53,615
Yes, I'll be waiting for you.

137
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,015
This school is his alma mater?

138
00:07:58,015 --> 00:07:59,915
I wonder what year he graduated.

139
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:04,515
Maybe he used to be my classmate.

140
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:18,215
But the music room was renovated last year

141
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:21,015
and all the walls and desks were changed,

142
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:23,215
so how could he feel nostalgic?

143
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:29,315
Besides, his voice just now sounds familiar.

144
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:48,315
"Music Room"

145
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:14,215
Make sure you be careful when you fall.

146
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:23,515
Darn. What the...

147
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:24,915
Who the hell are you?

148
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:26,915
The Metropolitan Police Department First Investigation Division,

149
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:29,415
Criminal Investigation Section 3,

150
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:31,515
Assistant Inspector, Miwako Sato.

151
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:33,115
Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

152
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,615
An officer?

153
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,315
Aren't you a teacher?

154
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:40,815
The real teacher was taken into custody

155
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:43,715
in the corridor by Officer Shiratori

156
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,815
and they switched.

157
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:49,315
Which means that you knew that I'd come here?

158
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,615
Yes.

159
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:53,715
By what Ms. Kobayashi testified.

160
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:54,915
Don't be ridiculous.

161
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,715
She also said unreliable things such as the culprit is a woman

162
00:09:56,715 --> 00:09:59,915
or that she saw a car with the numbers "0" and "9" printed on it.

163
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,915
Isn't she, that teacher?

164
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:04,915
She's not unreliable.

165
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:07,115
The culprit just looked like a woman to her.

166
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:10,615
Your elbow, when she saw the silhouette of you fleeing,

167
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:13,015
just happened to look like the breast of a woman

168
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:16,215
since you had one hand on the shoulder that you hurt.

169
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,115
In addition, since there were several incidents

170
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,215
in which a woman mugger was attacking in that area,

171
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:23,615
it's understandable that she probably intuitively thought

172
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,915
that the culprit was a woman.

173
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,115
Besides, that lady,

174
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:29,515
no matter how you look at her, she's a man.

175
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:31,515
The arguing voices that Ms. Kobayashi heard

176
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:33,415
were that of a man and woman

177
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:36,915
and if the corpse that was found later was that of a man,

178
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:40,515
it's understandable that she would think that the culprit is a woman.

179
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,515
Is this how the deduction goes?

180
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:45,315
Yes. Because she wouldn't possibly think

181
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:47,915
that the shouting voice was that of the victim.

182
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,615
Well... you too seem to have tried to deceive everyone

183
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,015
by cutting off your long hair.

184
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:58,215
And the numbers that Ms. Kobayashi saw on the car at the site

185
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,915
were not "0" and "9" but rather,

186
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:02,615
the alphabets "O and S".

187
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:08,215
It's standing for Osaka Smile Transport Company.

188
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:12,215
They looked like numbers because they were cut off by a wall.

189
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:17,715
That car was that of Dr. Agasa's friend who was moving.

190
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:21,715
I confirmed with the driver of the truck just a while ago.

191
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,315
And he said that he saw you

192
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,615
and the victim go into that alley of the murder site.

193
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:30,015
By the way,

194
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:34,515
you found out that Ms. Kobayashi was an elementary teacher

195
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:37,715
because I called out "teacher" at the scene of the crime.

196
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,815
After all, if a child calls out teacher,

197
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,915
the first thing that comes to mind

198
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:43,515
would be an elementary school teacher.

199
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:46,215
So, you asked around the elementary schools

200
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,515
in the vicinity and found her.

201
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:49,515
You attempted to shut her up, didn't you?

202
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:50,715
Yes.

203
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:52,415
I was going to threaten and scare her

204
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:54,215
before she recalled everything,

205
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:57,815
and stop her from testifying further.

206
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,815
I didn't want to land up in prison

207
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:02,615
just for killing that devil.

208
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:06,515
But that devil lent you 5,000,000 yen, didn't she?

209
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,115
Yes, right.

210
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:11,415
It costs money to continue pursuing a dream.

211
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:15,115
Treatment fee for my shoulder as well as for training.

212
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:18,915
That lady seem to have been a fan of high school baseball,

213
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:21,915
knew me and had high hopes for me.

214
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:26,115
But as soon as she found out that I damaged my shoulder for good,

215
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:27,615
she started acting totally different

216
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,415
and treated me as if I were a broken piece of junk.

217
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,715
I still had hopes of being a batter,

218
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:34,115
but she pressed me every day to give her back what she lent me.

219
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:36,215
She went as far as to tell me

220
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,015
that I could join life insurance so to give her my seal.

221
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:40,715
Which means that the remark of the victim,

222
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:43,515
"Never mind, just give me that" was...

223
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:46,015
Yes, she meant my seal.

224
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,015
She was planning to make me join life insurance then kill me.

225
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:52,815
That's why I killed her before she got to kill me!

226
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:55,415
I did it to continue pursuing my dream!

227
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:56,815
I killed her in self-defense!

228
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:59,715
Criminal Code 36.

229
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:02,515
When someone suddenly wrongly infringes on you,

230
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,715
any action performed out of necessity to protect oneself

231
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:09,215
or another is not to be punished.

232
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:11,515
In case the degree of protection

233
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:14,415
exceeds what is considered enough,

234
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,615
the punishment may be lessened

235
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:17,315
or exempt after taking into account all circumstances.

236
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:20,915
This is the provision described under self-defense.

237
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:23,215
During the time the crime was committed,

238
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:24,915
you had a knife in your possession and had the intent to kill.

239
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:28,315
Therefore, neither of what I just stated applies to you.

240
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:31,915
In addition, using a bat, a tool that should be used

241
00:13:31,915 --> 00:13:35,315
to pursue your dream, as a weapon to shut someone up,

242
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,515
you don't even the tiniest right to talk of your dreams.

243
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:42,415
Criminal code provision 255.

244
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:45,015
Anyone who takes the possessions of another

245
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:47,015
will be punished for stealing...

246
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:50,015
and serve a sentence of less than 10 years.

247
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:57,115
Maybe long ago I met you at a bookstore.

248
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:01,815
So, you finally remembered.

249
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:05,815
From way before these children were born,

250
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:09,015
I was in love with you.

251
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,015
Yes.

252
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:17,915
Dorky.

253
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:19,015
Come, come now.

254
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:20,215
Hey, hey, Conan.

255
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:24,315
Is she the teacher that Shiratori is head over heels over?

256
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:25,915
Yes.

257
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,915
She sure looks familiar.

258
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:29,615
It's you, she looks like you.

259
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:33,115
You mean you served as her double not realizing why you were doing it.

260
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:42,115
Mr. Shiratori.

261
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,115
We're going to go eat lunch from now, would you...

262
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:47,815
No, I'm not going.

263
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:49,615
Because I have this.

264
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,115
See you, then.

265
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:58,415
I'm sure that's home-made lunch made by Ms. Kobayashi.

266
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:00,315
Home-made lunch.

267
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:04,515
Ms. Sato?

268
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,615
Sato!

269
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,615
Please make lunch for me too, next time...

270
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:13,715
Lunch... next?

271
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,015
If you're going to the convenience store to buy lunch,

272
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:18,715
will please get me one too.

273
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:20,515
I'll leave what you'll buy up to you.

274
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,915
As long as it fills me up, anything's okay.

275
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:24,515
Yes.

276
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:28,915
Mr. Takagi, hang in there.

277
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,836
"Second term"

278
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:32,412
Did you see that?

279
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:34,212
Thief Kid's news this morning.

280
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:35,412
I saw it. I saw it.

281
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,512
He seems to have sent out a letter of challenge again.

282
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:42,312
He is after the big jewel owned by Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki.

283
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,012
The horn of the giraffe.

284
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:47,512
It seems to be valuable amber that is embedded with a seed

285
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,812
from several million years ago.

286
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:52,212
But, he's sure sending his letter of challenge out early.

287
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:55,812
Regarding the amber that was discovered at the old temple,

288
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,512
wasn't it just last week?

289
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,612
Well, since they had it advertised on TV

290
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:01,512
and in newspapers every single day,

291
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:03,512
even Thief Kid would take the bait.

292
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:06,912
But wait, do girrafe have horns?

293
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,412
They do. Two small ones.

294
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,412
You're talking about giraffes.

295
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:16,112
The one in question is said to be completely covered in golden scales,

296
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:17,512
is shaped like a deer,

297
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:20,112
has a cow's tail and a horse's hooves.

298
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,612
Growing from its dragon-like head is a single horn.

299
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:26,612
It's a divine beast from Chinese mythology.

300
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:29,612
Then, it's akin to azure dragon and white tiger.

301
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:33,412
So have you been summoned again?

302
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,612
No, I haven't heard anything yet.

303
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,112
How about, Edogawa?

304
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:42,112
Looks like you're having another duel with Thief Kid.

305
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:44,212
Do you have a strategy prepared?

306
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,912
No.

307
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:48,412
Just Conan again?

308
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:52,312
How nice. We want to duel with Thief Kid too.

309
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,012
It can't be helped.

310
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:57,212
Conan is the one who chases Thief Kid away every time.

311
00:16:57,212 --> 00:17:00,612
Members of the Youth Detective Squad, how about a word too?

312
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:03,312
What is it?

313
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:05,812
Will you tell us what you intend to do?

314
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:08,012
Why them too?

315
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:10,412
Haven't you heard about it yet?

316
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:12,512
Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki announced it

317
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:14,912
at the press conference today.

318
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,812
This time, he said that he would ask

319
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:19,612
all the members of the Youth Detective Squad to help him.

320
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:20,612
No way.

321
00:17:20,612 --> 00:17:21,712
Why?

322
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:24,212
Advisor,

323
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:27,012
I have my doubts about letting the children

324
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,412
into the site where Thief Kid is planning to attack.

325
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:33,512
Can't you tell from looking at his letter of challenge.

326
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:37,912
The night of the next full moon at 7 pm,

327
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:40,812
I will go to get a hold of the horn of the giraffe.

328
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:42,312
From Thief Kid.

329
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,512
Let's cut out all childish acts this time

330
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:48,512
and decide victory by adult methods.

331
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:51,912
That guy goofed from his side.

332
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:53,812
Mentioning adult methods,

333
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:55,912
he means don't call children.

334
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:59,212
In other words, Thief Kid is not at home with kids.

335
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,312
Not at home with kids?

336
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:02,612
Right.

337
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:04,612
No matter how good he is,

338
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:08,512
he can't disguise himself as a child who is short.

339
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:11,412
Therefore, my strategy is to call a lot of children

340
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:13,712
that he doesn't want around.

341
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,512
I see.

342
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,312
Moreover, the night of the full moon

343
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,712
that he warned of is the day after tomorrow.

344
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:23,112
It's the day that the typhoon will strike that mountain temple.

345
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:24,912
His hand glider that he's so at home with

346
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:28,112
probably can't be used blocked by the rain and wind.

347
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:32,112
Thief Kid without his wings is no more than a baby.

348
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,412
I will capture Thief Kid along with the Youth Detective Squad

349
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:38,112
in front of the TV camera,

350
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:42,512
and end my autobiography with beautiful victory.

351
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:56,012
You all look good,

352
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,212
in that detective parker.

353
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,712
-Thank you. -Thank you...

354
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:03,412
Then, let me introduce myself.

355
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:06,412
"Juri Shinkai (37)" -I'm journalist Juri Shinkai.

356
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,712
How do you do?

357
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:11,812
The one sitting next to me is cameraman, Mr. Masui.

358
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:13,412
"Shougo Masui (41)" -How do you do?

359
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:16,812
And the one in the front seat is...

360
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,812
Let's see...

361
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:20,212
"Tsutomu Hizumi (38)" -Hello.

362
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:22,812
I'm Hizumi in charge of audio.

363
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:26,812
I heard that the audio man was young man.

364
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:29,212
They couldn't get a hold of him,

365
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:32,512
so I ended up coming here all of a sudden.

366
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,712
I hope that young punk didn't take off

367
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:38,012
because he panicked about the typhoon that's coming.

368
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:45,312
It started to rain.

369
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:54,312
I've been waiting for you members of the Youth Detective Squad.

370
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:58,112
How do you like it? The clothes that I gave you?

371
00:19:58,112 --> 00:20:00,912
Did you make this parker for us?

372
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:03,012
Yes. I thought you'd look more

373
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,612
like the detective squad with uniformed clothes.

374
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:09,112
Thank you. We love it.

375
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:12,612
And? Where's the horn of the giraffe?

376
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,812
The way I see it...

377
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:17,512
there's a large pillar in the center

378
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:20,512
and on all four corners

379
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,912
there are a white, black and green

380
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:25,812
and red pedestal.

381
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:28,412
A copper pedestal.

382
00:20:28,412 --> 00:20:31,612
The color is faded, and the upper part is bumpy.

383
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:33,612
It seems like a statue of something was attached there,

384
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,212
but was taken away.

385
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:37,412
Look. Look.

386
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:39,612
There's what looks to be a keyhole.

387
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:41,112
Yes.

388
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:43,712
Hold it.

389
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:46,012
Hey, don't touch it.

390
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,012
Inspector Nakamori.

391
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:49,912
You should've at least told the brats

392
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:52,812
that a slight electric current is applied to the pedestal.

393
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:55,812
Children don't learn unless you give them pain.

394
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,912
And where's the horn?

395
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:00,212
I'll let you see it right now.

396
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:06,012
By using these four white, black, red and green keys.

397
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:07,312
Inspector Nakamori,

398
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:10,012
I'd like your men to help me.

399
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:14,612
Sure. Make sure you turn the electric current off.

400
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:18,812
Stop the electric current once.

401
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:19,912
Roger.

402
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,712
Are you going to use the keys that are the same color as the pedestals?

403
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:24,012
Yes.

404
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:29,012
What's this sound?

405
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,712
It's the sound of the electric current flowing

406
00:21:30,712 --> 00:21:32,512
to the pedestal being cut off.

407
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:34,512
Each sound corresponds to the green,

408
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:37,012
red, white and black pedestal's

409
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:39,512
electric current being turned off.

410
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,112
Inspector, please send the signal.

411
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:42,312
Okay.

412
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:44,912
-All right. One, two... -What's that sound just now?

413
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,912
-That's... -three.

414
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:57,512
The pillar in the middle is...

415
00:21:57,512 --> 00:21:58,712
Cracking open.

416
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:00,212
Something's coming out...

417
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:01,312
From inside.

418
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:11,712
So, this is the giraffe.

419
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,812
Awesome.

420
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:17,012
So, the yellow jewelry on its head is the...

421
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:20,412
Yes, it's probably the amber that's being referred to

422
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:21,612
as the "Horn of the Giraffe."

423
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:22,812
Beautiful.

424
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,212
Okay. Come whenever you like, Thief Kid.

425
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:32,912
I'm going to get you for sure this time.

426
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:56,412
Darn.

427
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:57,912
If there was only one keyhole

428
00:23:57,912 --> 00:24:00,412
I would guard over my dead body.

429
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:03,412
We'll guard it for you then.

430
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:05,112
Black-out?

431
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,112
Conan.

432
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:09,212
Conan!

433
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:11,612
Thief Kid's card.

434
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:15,412
In other words, Thief Kid and his accomplices...

435
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,512
are still in here.

436
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:20,612
Next Conan,

437
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:27,512
"Giraffe Horn that Vanished in the Dark"
