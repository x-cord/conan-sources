1
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:02,745
At the Mouri Detective Agency,

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:05,645
a man who showed up after following the three ladies,

3
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:07,945
intimidated everyone with his gun and bombs,

4
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:09,745
and besieged the entire place.

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,545
Pops and Ran who were at the scene,

6
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,445
as well as Sera, who we met during the haunted hotel case,

7
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:17,745
all became hostages.

8
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,445
The man's name was Isao Sawaguri.

9
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:24,245
He's the elder brother of Miku Sawaguri,

10
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:27,345
a mystery writer who killed herself at a hot spring inn a month ago.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,945
Sawaguri who refused to believe that his sister committed suicide,

12
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,945
ordered the great detective Sleeping Kogoro

13
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:37,845
to shed some light on the truth.

14
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:40,145
The three ladies he brought here

15
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:43,945
were all amateur mystery writers and friends with Miku.

16
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:46,845
An unmarried woman who is helping her family's stone-dealer's store,

17
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,845
Ms. Tamami Mitsui.

18
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:51,645
Ms. Shinobu Yuchi, the once-divorced,

19
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:53,645
who now works at the neighborhood bakery.

20
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,945
And a homemaker and the wife of a seal cutter craftsman,

21
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:57,945
Ms. Sumika Nihei.

22
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:01,245
Sawaguri suspected that one of them murdered his sister

23
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:05,145
and made it appear to be a suicide.

24
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,745
The three stayed at the same hotel with Miku

25
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:10,845
and visited her room in succession

26
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:13,245
to have her autograph their books

27
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:15,745
just before she died.

28
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:20,045
Although Miku had been posting what had transpired via SNS,

29
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:24,745
she had nicknamed the three Elephant, Fox, and Rat,

30
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:27,945
leaving us wondering about who was who and the order of their visits.

31
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,845
The last to have visited Miku's room

32
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:33,445
and thought to be responsible

33
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:37,145
for disguising her murder as a suicide was the Rat, but who was it?

34
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:42,245
But then, Sawaguri announced that once the culprit is revealed,

35
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:45,545
he would kill her and commit suicide.

36
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:49,045
How am I supposed to rescue Ran

37
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:51,445
and the others without any fatalities?

38
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,445
If all cases were men,

39
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:15,045
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

40
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:16,745
Adrenaline races at the Detective Agency

41
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,645
where Ran takes action in a surprising manner.

42
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,345
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:22,145
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:24,445
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

45
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:54,016
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Sniping)"

46
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,499
Darn.

47
00:03:57,499 --> 00:04:00,399
Trying to play smart with me, little witch.

48
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,399
You've got quite the nerve.

49
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:06,999
You do know what's going to happen, right?

50
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,599
Hold it. It wasn't her, the one who did it was...

51
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,599
It was me.

52
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,499
I was the one who made her do it.

53
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:18,299
Shinichi Kudo did.

54
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,899
Shinichi Kudo?

55
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,199
Shinichi?

56
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,499
Conan's using someone else's voice again.

57
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:32,799
Yeah.

58
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,599
All right. It's getting pretty late.

59
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,499
Time to get to bed, you guys.

60
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:40,499
-But, we... -Hey, just, hurry.

61
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,999
I thought it'd be best if I could also hear the details of the case,

62
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:48,099
so that I'd be able to answer your demand.

63
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,899
Unless, you have any objections against my involvement?

64
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:55,999
No, with a famous high school detective getting involved,

65
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:57,499
I'm all the more assured.

66
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:02,599
Then please tell Detective Mouri to take camera phone pictures

67
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,799
of all the case related materials you brought,

68
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,699
and send them to Dr. Agasa's computer.

69
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,299
You should also send along

70
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:11,999
pictures of the three books Miku autographed.

71
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:15,199
Also, it'd help if you could put me on a speaker phone.

72
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,399
Yes.

73
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:21,199
Hey, hustle up and take them.

74
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,099
I know.

75
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,099
Shinichi.

76
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,199
Why is he on Conan's phone?

77
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,599
Judging from the monitor here,

78
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:38,199
the page appears distorted only on Nihie's autographed copy.

79
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,599
Does it actually look that way?

80
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:43,399
Yes, only the autographed page is wrinkled

81
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,499
as if it were wet once and then dried.

82
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:47,699
Don't tell me...

83
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:48,899
It was you!

84
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,399
It wasn't me.

85
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,699
Plus, if it had gotten wet then,

86
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,699
wouldn't the entire book have become wrinkled?

87
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,599
Suppose so.

88
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,599
Next about Yuchi's autographed book,

89
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,199
it looks like a brand-new copy

90
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,599
without any finger marks or creases.

91
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,299
Is it really the first edition?

92
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,499
Yes, it does say here that it was from the first printing.

93
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,999
It's because I made sure to keep it safe,

94
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,599
given that it's a precious signed copy.

95
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,599
And as for Mitsui, it's a bit torn, isn't it?

96
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,099
It is. I see the tear mark.

97
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,399
That's because after Miku had finished autographing my book,

98
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,399
she was being mean and wouldn't let me use the toilet in her room.

99
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,099
Being mean?

100
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,099
That day, I had an upset my stomach

101
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,699
and even though I really had to unload,

102
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,499
Miku wouldn't let me use the toilet in her room.

103
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:48,899
She refused, telling me it was because she was going to use it soon.

104
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,899
But I knew she was just trying to bully me.

105
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:54,399
Since she also lied about having taken a bath in her room

106
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,199
even though she'd just come back from the large baths.

107
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,399
How'd you know she lied?

108
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,999
Because when I was leaving Miku's room,

109
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:05,899
I accidently put her slippers on,

110
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,099
and they were soaking wet and warm.

111
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,499
When I went to her room,

112
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,199
I lined up her slippers as well

113
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,399
but they were neither wet nor warm at all.

114
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,299
Are you sure you didn't put your own slippers on?

115
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,299
Since it looks like you have greasy skin.

116
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,699
How rude. I have dry skin.

117
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,199
What a noisy bunch of old women.

118
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,399
Cheeping and chirping like a bunch of lilt birds.

119
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,299
Well, I admit I've also been called annoying by my sister,

120
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:41,399
so she gave me the weird nickname of Bush warbler.

121
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,599
Bush warbler?

122
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,299
Bush warbler, Elephant, Fox, and Rat...

123
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,399
I see, I've got it.

124
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,399
Miku's nickname scheme.

125
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,599
It seems this'll come to an end even without having to trouble Kudo.

126
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,499
If that's the case, no doubt the culprit is that person.

127
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:14,799
Looks like you've got that face

128
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,699
you always get when you've figured it out,

129
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,399
but what now?

130
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,899
Even if you've come up with the right culprit,

131
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:22,999
there'll still be two corpses

132
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,799
hitting the floor in that detective agency.

133
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,199
Hey, what do you mean?

134
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,899
What you just said about how this might come to an end

135
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,599
without having to trouble Shinichi?

136
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,499
The reason I propped your cell phone open

137
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:39,899
with the strap mascot and preserved the connection,

138
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,399
was so that Conan could learn about the case

139
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,499
and investigate it for us.

140
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:46,799
The incident happened last month on the 4th,

141
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,699
the same day your neighborhood association

142
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:50,599
went on their hot spring trip, right?

143
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:53,499
What's more, the inn they stayed at was, Furitsukaya,

144
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,599
where that bomber man's sister,

145
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:00,799
novelist Miku Sawaguri, supposedly committed suicide.

146
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,099
Is that so?

147
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:05,699
Yes. There was a fax with information

148
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:08,299
about the neighborhood association's hot spring outing

149
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,699
on your papa's desk.

150
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,899
The fact it was left out

151
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,499
means that your papa didn't go on that outing.

152
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:17,099
Since there were details such as a map to the inn,

153
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,399
and meeting places on the fax,

154
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,499
he would've brought it with him if he had gone,

155
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:25,899
and wouldn't have put it back on his desk upon his return, right?

156
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,499
That's why I left the phone connected,

157
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:30,899
hoping that Conan would get the story

158
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,899
from those who went to the hot spring trip.

159
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,999
But for some reason,

160
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,999
Shinichi Kudo answered Conan's phone.

161
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:40,799
Well, I don't know what sort of connection Conan has

162
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,799
with that famous high school detective,

163
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,399
but that bomber guy is convinced

164
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,299
that his sister didn't commit suicide,

165
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:51,299
and that someone among the three killed her,

166
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,999
he plans to commit murder-suicide with the culprit

167
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,399
once he finds out who she is.

168
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,199
So at this point, I have no choice

169
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,799
but to have him negotiate with the bomber man and talk him down

170
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,499
or so I had thought,

171
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:06,299
but now that's not necessary anymore.

172
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:07,799
How come?

173
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,699
You see that light outside the window?

174
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,499
That's probably proof

175
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:20,099
that the police have arrived at the building across the street.

176
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,199
Sniping Support Unit in position.

177
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,099
We've got eyes-on.

178
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:30,599
And the Takedown Unit?

179
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,599
In position at the agency entrance.

180
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,599
Ready to break through on your order.

181
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,599
Copy that.

182
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,999
Attention, all units.

183
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,499
Suspect is acting alone,

184
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,199
however we have info that he is armed with a handgun

185
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,699
and has a large number of bombs in possession.

186
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,399
Until I give the order standby

187
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,499
but be ready to move on a moment's notice.

188
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:50,799
So the police are here?

189
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,599
First to come was the Special Investigative Team

190
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,599
made up of the Criminal Investigative Department First Division,

191
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:58,499
abbreviated as SIT.

192
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:01,499
When hostage-taking incidents occur,

193
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,099
they roll out with heavy equipment,

194
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:05,699
and if the culprit doesn't respond to persuasion.

195
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,299
They're forcing their way in and taking decisive action.

196
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,999
So even now, they should be on the other side of that door,

197
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,599
on the watch for an opportunity to charge in.

198
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,799
What?

199
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,099
The fact that they're on the roof with the intent to snipe

200
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:28,899
means the Special Assault Team, SAT has also come to back them up.

201
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,899
Did Shinichi call for them?

202
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,599
Well, even if he didn't, they'd still come.

203
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:36,599
Since in order to evacuate the customers from the shop downstairs,

204
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:40,299
he'd have to explain the situation to the police.

205
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:45,399
But, judging from how the police have yet to start talking him down,

206
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,899
it appears they have extreme confidence

207
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,499
in your boyfriend.

208
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,499
He likely requested the police not to make moves

209
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:58,299
and guaranteed to talk the bomber man down himself, I'd wager.

210
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,599
After all, we're dealing with a crazy man

211
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:02,799
who has bombs strapped to himself

212
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,199
and his finger hovering over the switch.

213
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,899
If they make the wrong move and barge in

214
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,999
or snipe in a place that isn't a vital point,

215
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,699
it'd enrage him

216
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,199
and he'd press the switch

217
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,999
and we'd be blown to smithereens.

218
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,699
In order for that not to happen,

219
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,399
he'd either need to be persuaded,

220
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,899
or taken down with one shot.

221
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,499
Hey, what's the hold up?

222
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,399
Haven't you figured it out yet, Shinichi Kudo?

223
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,099
I know we already sent them to your computer.

224
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:32,099
My little sister's posting on SNS just before she was killed.

225
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,599
These postings told of

226
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:36,699
how my sister let each of these three people into her room,

227
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:40,999
and how she autographed first-edition copies of her debut work for them.

228
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,499
And the postings were...

229
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:45,799
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

230
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,099
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

231
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:50,399
that pesky Elephant.

232
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,199
Next to come was Fox.

233
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,499
Trying to stir up an argument again, freaking annoying.

234
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:58,199
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

235
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,899
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

236
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,299
I'll make short work of the autograph

237
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,299
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

238
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,799
Darn, she's still here.

239
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,299
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

240
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:10,899
What should I do?

241
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,099
And her posting ends here.

242
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:14,199
In short...

243
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:18,299
It was one of these three people,

244
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,899
the ones who were the last to come,

245
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,999
that killed my sister and made it look to be a suicide,

246
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,899
that freaking Rat.

247
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,999
Hey, you guys.

248
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,199
Didn't I tell you to go to bed already?

249
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,099
But, we're so worried that we can't sleep.

250
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:38,999
And there was something we forgot to mention.

251
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:41,299
When we went to ask people about the case,

252
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:44,299
most of the neighborhood association members said...

253
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,899
that about two or three days ago,

254
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,999
a brown-haired man in camouflage

255
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,699
had come around asking the same things we did.

256
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,799
That man had shown them a book

257
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,599
and some photographs while asking

258
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:59,299
whether they had seen any of the three women

259
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,699
loitering around the inn

260
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,399
with his sister's debut book in hand.

261
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,999
I see.

262
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,999
So he'd already gone around asking for information.

263
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,899
It seems you've also done your own research,

264
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,299
How far have you gotten?

265
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:15,299
Well...

266
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:18,899
I did sniff out a whole lot about these three.

267
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,899
Sumika Nihei is high-strung

268
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,399
and even went as far as to line up

269
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,399
all the slippers of guests she didn't know.

270
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,999
And didn't get along with my sister

271
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,699
who was sloppy in comparison.

272
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:32,799
And since Shinobu Yuchi had been in the hot spring all the time.

273
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,299
Perhaps she was in fact washing the blood that splattered on her

274
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:39,999
after cutting my sister's wrist?

275
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:43,399
And Tamami Mitsui was seen rushing out of my sister's room

276
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,499
with her book in hand

277
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:49,399
by a guest from a room, three doors down.

278
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,799
So, hurry up and tell me.

279
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,199
Which one was it?

280
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,199
The murderer who my sister nicknamed Rat.

281
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:58,299
How is it?

282
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:59,899
Can you make the shot?

283
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,199
Negative.

284
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,499
The Detective Agency sign on the window glass

285
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:07,599
and Detective Mouri behind it are blocking the target.

286
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,499
Shinichi.

287
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:11,899
Perhaps you're thinking,

288
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:16,199
"Shinichi, why haven't you solved it yet?"

289
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,499
It's all right.

290
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,099
I'm sure he's already figured everything out.

291
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:24,299
That the Rat who killed Miku Sawaguri...

292
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,299
was her, namely Tamai Mitsui.

293
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,899
There's only one reason why he's not saying it,

294
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,399
once the bomber man knows who the culprit is,

295
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,199
he'll commit murder-suicide with her.

296
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,599
Looks like we'll have to use an alternative method

297
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:43,099
in order to prevent having two victims.

298
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:46,299
Although, it'll only turn two into one.

299
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:49,699
Hey.

300
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,699
That cell phone's been connected for quite a long time,

301
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,299
how's the battery doing?

302
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,599
Shouldn't we connect it to the AC adapter?

303
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,399
Right, you're right.

304
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,399
If I recall, it's in the drawer of Mr. Kogoro's desk, right?

305
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,899
Did I put it in there?

306
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,299
Hey, take it out now and connect it.

307
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:13,099
Are you sure?

308
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,699
You don't want to do it yourself?

309
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:18,099
If Kogoro has a weapon

310
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:20,499
or something hidden in that drawer,

311
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:22,199
he could counterattack, you know?

312
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,399
This guy...

313
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,099
Don't tell me...

314
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:27,599
Out of the way.

315
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,299
I'll find it.

316
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:30,899
The suspect has moved towards us.

317
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,799
He's in sight.

318
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,799
It's possible to snipe now.

319
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,199
What?

320
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,399
Do we shoot?

321
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,399
Shoot.

322
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,599
Shoot.

323
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:15,993
What the heck are you doing?

324
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,693
Do you want to die?

325
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,293
It's chilly tonight,

326
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,593
so I think it's best to close the curtains.

327
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:25,293
Also, the AC adapter is inside the cabinet,

328
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,093
I'll get it.

329
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,493
The curtains are closed.

330
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:31,793
Sniping the target is no longer possible.

331
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:32,993
You...

332
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,693
What were you thinking?

333
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:37,593
I'd hate to see someone die in front of me is all.

334
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:39,093
What do you mean you'd hate?

335
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:40,393
Plus...

336
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,593
Shinichi would never allow anyone to die.

337
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:44,593
Never.

338
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:49,093
Now, Shinichi Kudo.

339
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,593
I've sent everything you need for your deduction.

340
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:53,893
Who the heck killed my little sister?

341
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:56,593
If you still don't know, then I've got no choice.

342
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:59,793
Hate to do it, but I'll blow this agency to smithereens.

343
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:01,693
Although all I really want to do

344
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:04,293
is to ice that freaking Rat who killed my sister.

345
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,693
It's all right.

346
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,493
Please calm down.

347
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:09,793
Because I know the identity of the Rat.

348
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:12,893
Really?

349
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:13,893
Yes.

350
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,493
Don't... don't tell me,

351
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,793
he's going to name the culprit?

352
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:19,893
Shinichi?

353
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:22,093
I'll start with Elephant,

354
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:25,193
who was the first to visit Miku's room for an autograph.

355
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:27,993
If her hair hadn't dried from the bath,

356
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:30,893
her body should've been hot and humid too.

357
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:32,893
If she were to autograph in such a state,

358
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:35,993
the heat and dampness would wrinkle the paper, right?

359
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:38,593
So that means,

360
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,393
the Elephant who came first has got to be

361
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:42,893
the one who has the book with the autographed page wrinkled,

362
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:45,293
that is, Ms. Nihei.

363
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:47,193
Nihei has a methodical personality

364
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,893
to the extent of being too high-strung.

365
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:50,393
Unless something like that happened,

366
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:54,193
I bet she'd never treat the book roughly nor crumple it.

367
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:58,193
And when Ms. Nihei went to the room,

368
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:01,193
she said she lined up Miku's slippers too, right?

369
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:06,193
The fact that those slippers were neither wet nor warm...

370
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:08,993
means that Miku didn't go to the large baths,

371
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,993
but without a doubt took a bath in her room.

372
00:19:11,993 --> 00:19:16,593
Since taking a bath in her room would not require her to wear slippers.

373
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:21,893
Why, then, were the slippers accidentally worn by Mitsui

374
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,293
as she was leaving Miku's room soaking wet

375
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,693
causing Mitsui to mistakenly think

376
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:30,193
that Miku had come back from the large bath?

377
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:34,693
The deal with the slippers was that Yuchi came there

378
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:38,593
shortly after taking a bath.

379
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:41,793
And inadvertently wore Miku's slippers on her way out,

380
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:44,793
Yuchi's remaining warm and dampened slippers were then worn by Mitsui.

381
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:47,193
In short, Elephant was Nihei,

382
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:49,893
next to show up was Fox, or Yuchi,

383
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:55,893
and leaving Mitsui to be Rat, the last one to come along.

384
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:58,593
I see, so it was you?

385
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:00,593
The freaking Rat who killed my sister?

386
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:02,493
What the...

387
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,493
You're only basing that decision off some slippers.

388
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:07,393
It wasn't just the slippers.

389
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:09,793
The nicknames Miku gave you all

390
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,493
were in fact based on colors.

391
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:13,793
Color?

392
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:14,993
In Japanese,

393
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:17,893
there are colors bearing the names of animals, right?

394
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:20,193
Like camel-color or Japanese ruddy duck-color.

395
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,493
Are you sure?

396
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:22,793
If you keep talking,

397
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:25,993
we'll really end up with two dead people here, you know?

398
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,293
Moreover...

399
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,493
Right in front of her, who believes in you.

400
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:33,893
The fox-color, or golden brown,

401
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:37,293
would be the color of the bread Yuchi bakes at her workplace.

402
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:38,993
Elephant means ivory-color,

403
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:42,493
the color of the seals Nihei's husband carves.

404
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,693
Incidentally, Miku's brother Isao's nickname

405
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:49,093
Bush warbler would resemble olive-green.

406
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:51,293
Taken from the name of the survival games

407
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:55,293
team Isao serves as the leader of, the Green Cap.

408
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:58,893
And Rat of course means the grayish rat-color,

409
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:02,493
the color of the stones Mitsui's family stonemasonry business deals with.

410
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:07,093
In other words, the Rat that was the last to show up to Miku's room...

411
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:08,793
Ms. Mitsui,

412
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:11,393
it can't be none other than you.

413
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:33,893
Just as expected of the high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

414
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,293
Well done.

415
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,793
The dirty Rat, who freaking killed my sister, Miku

416
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:42,893
and made it look like a suicide, Tamami Mitsui...

417
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:46,393
He's made it clear that you were the one.

418
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:47,893
No, no...

419
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:50,593
I would never kill Miku.

420
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:52,293
Don't play dumb with me.

421
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:57,193
The famous high school detective is saying you're the culprit.

422
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:59,593
But... but it really wasn't me...

423
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:05,893
Any excuses you have I'll hear you out on the other side.

424
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:09,093
My sister's waiting in the other world.

425
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:13,793
Well, don't forget, you two karate kittens.

426
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:17,193
About the fact that I've got bombs strapped to my body.

427
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,993
And that as long as I can kill this witch,

428
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:23,293
I don't mind dying.

429
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,893
Darn.

430
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:29,893
Shinichi Kudo. What the heck are you going to do?

431
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:32,393
Shinichi, please.

432
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,193
Stop Sawaguri.

433
00:22:35,193 --> 00:22:36,993
Shinichi.

434
00:23:58,993 --> 00:24:00,293
I haven't said one word

435
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:04,993
about Mitsui having killed your sister, you know?

436
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:06,893
Then who was it?

437
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:08,793
Who was the culprit that killed my sister?

438
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:12,693
About your sister's debut work... have you happened to read it?

439
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:14,193
The title is...

440
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:15,993
"The Death's Funeral Procession".

441
00:24:15,993 --> 00:24:18,293
Death who killed Miku Sawaguri

442
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:20,293
and made it look like a suicide...

443
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,393
It's you.

444
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:24,493
Next Conan,

445
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:28,593
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Release)"

446
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,793
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,593
"Toilet".

448
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:50,493
-Shall I take the stage from here? -No, that's okay.

449
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:51,993
-What'd you say? -Let Shinichi handle this.

450
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,193
Not you too.
