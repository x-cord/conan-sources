1
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:05,861
I went to the hotel where Sera is residing with Ran and Sonoko.

2
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,061
On our way back home,

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:09,886
there is a murder on the floor below us.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:16,461
-"Keigo Hiura (48)" -Maybe it has something to do with that fax.

5
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:19,061
We got a fax this morning saying,

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,561
"If you don't make his assistant quit, you're going to pay for it."

7
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:26,161
Why didn't you tell me that?

8
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,961
You had all the time in the world to tell me, didn't you?

9
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,061
I see.

10
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:36,061
The killer is...

11
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:37,561
That guy.

12
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:42,961
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

13
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,961
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

14
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,161
The contents of the novel close in on the case.

15
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,161
Who's that girl that resembles Sera?

16
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:50,661
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,261
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,661
His name is Detective Conan.

19
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:40,186
"The Romance Novel with the Unexpected Conclusion (Part 2)"

20
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:43,386
It's Takagi.

21
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:46,886
I've got something I'd like to confirm with you.

22
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:47,886
What?

23
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:51,086
The caps of the shampoo and hair conditioner are gone?

24
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:52,486
You mean in the victim's room?

25
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:53,786
Yes.

26
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:57,386
They're the amenity goods that came in the bathroom.

27
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,886
I looked in the drain but couldn't find them either.

28
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,786
We just went into the front door, you know?

29
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:07,086
Then, were you the ones who knocked the table over too.

30
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,086
Table?

31
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:10,486
The room was virtually untouched,

32
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:13,486
but for some reason only the table was knocked over.

33
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:17,086
And, the beer can that was thought to have been on top of it,

34
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:19,586
was found in the suitcase of the victim

35
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:24,486
and her clothes were drenched with beer.

36
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,686
What kind of suitcase was it?

37
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:29,186
A pretty big one.

38
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:32,986
Although there wasn't much stuff in it.

39
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:34,686
What was in it?

40
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:40,086
Besides her clothes, cosmetics, a tablet and knapsack.

41
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,586
Oh, right.

42
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:45,686
There was an old postcard in the pocket of the knapsack too.

43
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:46,786
Old...

44
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:48,286
Postcard?

45
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:49,386
Yes.

46
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:51,486
It was postmarked 20 years ago.

47
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,286
The sender was Mr. Hiura.

48
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:56,586
It said, "It's quite a cute story.

49
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,786
When I write this kind of story,

50
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:03,386
I'd like to use your name as the heroine's."

51
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:06,186
But the receiver's name wasn't Chiaki Minazuki,

52
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:08,386
but rather, Jun Ota.

53
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,986
Jun Ota?

54
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:14,186
That's the name of the heroine of the serialized novel,

55
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:17,786
"Telephone, Sea, and I" that Mr. Hiura is writing now!

56
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:18,886
Is that so?

57
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:19,886
Yes!

58
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:22,386
What kind of story is it?

59
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:27,086
Well... One day the heroine picks up

60
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,786
an old worn out cell phone on the beach.

61
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:30,586
But for some strange reason

62
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:34,086
that cell phone was a new model

63
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:36,786
that she was planning to buy next week.

64
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:39,986
While she was staring at the cell phone in wonder,

65
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:42,486
she suddenly gets text mail

66
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:44,986
saying, "How old are you?"

67
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,786
Sounds dangerous.

68
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,186
Right? The heroine thought so too

69
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:53,586
and texted him back saying, "I'd never give out private info, stupid."

70
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:57,286
"Your way of writing tells me that you've just entered high school.

71
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:59,486
How nostalgic." Is what he texted back.

72
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:01,786
After that he guesses many things correctly.

73
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,086
He prophesizes the results of the soccer

74
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:05,686
and baseball games of that day correctly.

75
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:08,586
Don't tell me that's...

76
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:09,686
Right!

77
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,686
Somebody sent the heroine's future cell phone to her

78
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,786
using a time warp device!

79
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,386
Time warp device?

80
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:20,586
Yes! To put it easier, a time machine!

81
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:25,686
When the heroine knows that something terrible will happen in future,

82
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:29,886
she gradually changes the future little by little to prevent it!

83
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:32,186
It sounds a bit interesting.

84
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,786
You think so too, don't you?

85
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:37,086
And, the heroine asks every chance she gets.

86
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,886
"Who are you?

87
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:41,986
What's your connection to me?"

88
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,586
But, the answer is always the same,

89
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:46,586
"Telephone, Sea, and I".

90
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:50,186
Just what's that supposed to mean?

91
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:53,186
The heroine couldn't figure it out either

92
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,786
but she finally seems to have figured the meaning out recently.

93
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:57,986
She returns this answer to him.

94
00:05:57,986 --> 00:06:00,786
"Telephone, Sea, and I".

95
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:01,886
What?

96
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:05,786
The answer is finally going to be disclosed next week in the last episode.

97
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:08,486
I really can't wait any longer!

98
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:13,086
That Mr. Hiura sure is daring.

99
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:15,286
Even in his ultra tight situation,

100
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:19,386
he invited the editors, who were keeping watch over him, into his room,

101
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:22,686
treat them to a meal, and coaxed them.

102
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,586
If I were in his situation,

103
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,186
I'd probably shave my head bald

104
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,786
and apologize asking for extra time.

105
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:35,086
Well, in his case, he's already shaved.

106
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:40,186
Hey, did that Mr. Hiura already return to his room?

107
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:43,686
No. After all he is one of the suspects too,

108
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,586
so until the forensics finish their investigation,

109
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:48,586
I'm having him wait in front of his room.

110
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:51,686
Then, he should still have it on him.

111
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:53,486
Have what?

112
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:57,386
A mistake that he failed to correct.

113
00:06:57,386 --> 00:07:00,886
A typo in completing the alibi trick.

114
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,510
Hey! Enough already!

115
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,210
How long is it going to take you to check my room?

116
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,425
You're not going to find anything!

117
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:19,225
The corpse was found in her room right below here.

118
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:23,125
She was killed at around 3:30 pm, wasn't she?

119
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,925
At that time I was in this room right through,

120
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:29,625
and I even have somebody who can testify to that!

121
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,625
Tell them too, will you?

122
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,825
Yes.

123
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:36,625
It's true that we were eating here

124
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,325
in Mr. Hiura's room between 3 pm to 4:30 pm.

125
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,625
During that time, Mr. Hiura was taking a bath,

126
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,425
and although he didn't eat with us,

127
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,825
there's no doubt that he didn't leave this room!

128
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:55,325
We were eating at that table that faces the front door.

129
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:57,225
But, if it was the room right below,

130
00:07:57,225 --> 00:08:00,825
by using a rope, you could use the veranda to.

131
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:02,525
Don't be ridiculous.

132
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,225
This is the 30th floor, you know.

133
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:07,425
I'm no James Bond,

134
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,125
I'm just an ordinary novelist.

135
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,725
I could never carry out a stunt like that!

136
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,525
Besides, you can see the veranda from the table too, isn't it?

137
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:17,325
True.

138
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:21,825
If you insist on taking up any more of my private time,

139
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:25,125
then, explain it to me, how did I get out of this room

140
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,525
at the time of the crime and how did I return?

141
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,225
You had no need to go out nor return!

142
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:39,925
Because you invited the victim into this room,

143
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:42,725
and killed her here!

144
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,225
He invited the victim into this room?

145
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,325
What're you talking about?

146
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,625
If Minazuki came to this room,

147
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,025
one of the editors would've noticed, right?

148
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:53,725
They all know what she looks like too!

149
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:56,125
Hey, she didn't come, did she?

150
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,725
No.

151
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:59,925
But...

152
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:03,325
There were many people who brought deliveries, right?

153
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:04,725
Yes.

154
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:08,425
If Ms. Minazuki was dressed like a delivery person,

155
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:10,825
and changed her hairstyle and all,

156
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:13,925
I think I'd be deceived.

157
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:16,625
That maybe the case

158
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,325
but they all left after we paid them.

159
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,925
Then what about that wine that's on the table?

160
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,325
If a decanter was ordered,

161
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:32,025
it wouldn't be strange for that person to go inside the room, right?

162
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,125
Come to think of it,

163
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,525
there was a person who delivered wine

164
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,225
and was asked to bring a decanter.

165
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:40,125
If I remember correctly, she was a bell girl who wore glasses

166
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,125
and had her hair bunched up behind.

167
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,825
A bell girl?

168
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:48,925
Did you see that bell girl leave the room?

169
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,425
Oh, no.

170
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,625
Because I was too busy eating.

171
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,825
Right. That was his purpose!

172
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,725
When you were watching him from outside the room,

173
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,725
you were carefully checking

174
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:05,925
the number of people going in and out of the room, right?

175
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:11,525
Because Mr. Hiura may disguise himself as a deliveryman and flee.

176
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:15,425
But, if all of you who were watching him were invited into his room,

177
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:17,725
you wouldn't be that particular about the number of people.

178
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,425
Because so it didn't matter how many people came,

179
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:25,625
as long as Mr. Hiura didn't leave and go out the front door.

180
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,025
That's why you weren't really concerned

181
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:30,025
even if the bell girl brought the wine

182
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:33,625
and went inside the room, but never came out!

183
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,725
Then, are you saying that the bell girl was Ms. Minazuki?

184
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:42,925
Yes! While the editors were eating in the living room,

185
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,725
he had instructed to take a bath,

186
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:47,525
and killed her

187
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,225
in the bathroom.

188
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:56,225
He probably chose the bathroom

189
00:10:56,225 --> 00:11:00,425
because then she would take off the bell girl's clothes on her own.

190
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:04,025
Since the corpse was dressed in a bathrobe that are easy to put on.

191
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:08,525
But why did the victim disguise herself as the bell girl?

192
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,825
Since she's the assistant, she should've just walked right in.

193
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:13,725
That's because she was being hassled with the lover's scandal thing.

194
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:18,425
If the editors who were on guard see her going into the room,

195
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,225
who knows what they'll write the next time around?

196
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:24,725
That's why he probably asked her to do so.

197
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:29,625
Quite an interesting trick.

198
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,925
If I ever have a chance to write a mystery novel,

199
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:37,225
I'd like to use it for reference.

200
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:40,125
Tell me one thing.

201
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,225
Just how did I move that body

202
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:46,725
from this room to the room below?

203
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:53,225
I left the room at around 5:30 pm!

204
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:58,025
That's 30 minutes before the bell boy found the corpse in the room below!

205
00:11:58,025 --> 00:12:00,825
Was a carrying the body back then?

206
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:02,225
No.

207
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:04,825
The only thing you were holding was your wallet.

208
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:08,925
After I left the room to the time the bell boy screamed,

209
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,825
where and what were you doing?

210
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:13,025
I was in front of your room,

211
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:18,025
reading the completed part of the manuscript.

212
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:21,925
It's too bad, I can't write your mystery story.

213
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,525
There are too many loopholes.

214
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:26,825
Oh, yes!

215
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:28,425
It's about time.

216
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:31,125
Officer Takagi. Do it, will you?

217
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:33,925
Takagi?

218
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,925
Inspector Megure!

219
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:39,225
Just now something fell from the floor above to the veranda.

220
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,725
What?

221
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,525
The veranda?

222
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:46,925
This is...

223
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:49,525
A suitcase!

224
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,225
Why would something like this fall from above.

225
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,925
Oh, Inspector!

226
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:57,225
Please open that suitcase over there!

227
00:12:57,225 --> 00:13:00,725
What's going on here?

228
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,325
Two bags of rice?

229
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,525
One bag is 30 kg.

230
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,425
Together they total 60 kg.

231
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:17,325
Just about the weight of one human.

232
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:20,425
Don't tell me that corpse was put in a suitcase.

233
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:24,825
Yes! It's scary to use a rope to go down yourself

234
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:27,225
but it's easy to slide a rope through the handle of a suitcase

235
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:30,325
with a corpse inside it and suspend it, right?

236
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,525
If you use a swinging reaction,

237
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:35,425
you can swing the suitcase onto the inside of the veranda below.

238
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,225
The rope that is passed through the handle,

239
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:41,225
can be retrieved by pulling on one side if it isn't tied!

240
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:44,925
If so, the suitcase that was in the victim's room

241
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,725
was brought there to use for moving the corpse.

242
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,625
The knapsack that was in the suitcase

243
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,725
was probably what her belongings were in.

244
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,225
The contents were removed,

245
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:56,625
and only the knapsack was put into the suitcase!

246
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,625
I see.

247
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:03,125
In other words, Mr. Hiura secretly sneaks the victim into the room first,

248
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,125
then kills her in the bathroom.

249
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,325
He shoves her into the suitcase naked,

250
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:12,025
and waits for the editors to finish eating and leave the room.

251
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,425
Then, he lowers the suitcase with her corpse inside

252
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:17,325
to her room right below.

253
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:21,125
After this, he hands the manuscripts that were already completed to begin,

254
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:25,025
one after the other to the editors who were guarding him.

255
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:27,825
Then, at about 5:30 pm, he says that he's going to think of

256
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,525
how to complete the last page while going out to get cigarettes.

257
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:34,125
He finally uses the room key

258
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,325
that he stole from the victim to go into her room,

259
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:37,825
puts the bathrobe on her

260
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:40,625
and lies her down by the front door.

261
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,725
At 6 pm sharp,

262
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:45,925
the bellboy who was told to deliver the champagne

263
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:49,625
will find the corpse there!

264
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,425
The beer was spilled on the inside of the suitcase

265
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,425
is used to camouflage any traces of wetness and smell

266
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:57,925
since he rushed to put the corpse into the suitcase

267
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:00,325
when her hair was still wet.

268
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,825
I guess he wanted to mask the smell of shampoo

269
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:04,225
and the suitcase being wet.

270
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:08,225
But, why didn't he at least dry her hair before putting her inside?

271
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:09,925
He should've at least had time for that.

272
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:12,725
He couldn't have!

273
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:17,325
Because if that man makes a sound using a hair dryer,

274
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:19,125
it would be strange!

275
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,625
I see.

276
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,525
His head is shaved.

277
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:25,725
Mr. Hiura, took the caps of the shampoo and hair conditioner

278
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:29,825
from the bathroom of the victim for the same reason.

279
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:33,125
He probably wanted to replace the caps

280
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,925
since after the victim used them,

281
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,725
she threw the caps down the drain or something.

282
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:41,725
Because you probably don't use shampoo and stuff.

283
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:45,125
So, maybe you still have them with you.

284
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,925
The caps of the shampoo and hair conditioner.

285
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:53,925
Unless you threw them away somewhere on your way here.

286
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,225
Well, even if you did throw them away,

287
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,825
it would be in the trash can of the elevator hall of the floor below,

288
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:07,225
where the bell girl outfit in a bag was also found.

289
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:09,425
What? How did he take it there?

290
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:12,425
Wasn't he empty-handed when he left the room'

291
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:14,425
He was wearing the outfit

292
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:17,725
under his clothes that he's wearing now.

293
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:20,125
He took the outfit off at the landing of the stairs,

294
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,325
put it in a bag and disposed of it,

295
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:24,825
before the corpse was found.

296
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,825
So, we should be able to find

297
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:30,125
the victim's and Mr. Hiura's perspiration,

298
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,325
fragments of skin and fingerprints

299
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,725
on the bell girl outfit.

300
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:46,825
It's really hard to dispose of when needed,

301
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:50,725
I was scared that somebody may be watching.

302
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:53,625
Then, you admit to committing the crime?

303
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,025
Yes.

304
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:59,125
I sent a blackmail fax too, to try to get away with it but...

305
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,925
I guess mysteries are not my cup of tea, after all.

306
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:05,425
But, why did you kill her?

307
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,725
She was an efficient assistant

308
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,225
and you said that thanks to her you were able to make a comeback!

309
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,925
Yes. Exactly.

310
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:15,025
Now that I've lost her,

311
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,525
I probably can't write a single line.

312
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,725
Then why?

313
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:22,025
Don't tell me that she was really your lover

314
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,325
and she pressured you to get a divorce?

315
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:26,125
Just the opposite.

316
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,325
No matter how many times I approached her,

317
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:31,525
her answer was always,

318
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:34,025
"Your wife will scold you."

319
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:37,225
She took a bath this time too,

320
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:42,425
because I told her, who was in a bell girl outfit, that she smelled.

321
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:45,525
-"Telephone, Sea and I" -She came to my room

322
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:48,825
to talk about the novel.

323
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:53,125
The last scene of "Telephone, Sea, and I".

324
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:57,225
Then... She's the one who actually wrote that novel after all

325
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:58,825
Yes.

326
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:00,325
That's right.

327
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:03,525
It's a story that she mainly thought up.

328
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:06,425
The original material came from an old fan letter too,

329
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:09,325
so it's more her work than mine at this point.

330
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:10,825
Fan letter?

331
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,125
Yes.

332
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,525
When I was cleaning,

333
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,025
an old letter that was written by an elementary school student came out.

334
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:21,125
And, I arranged the story that was enclosed with the letter

335
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,225
by using the name of the sender of that letter,

336
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:27,025
Jun Ota, as the heroine.

337
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:30,225
It was since I had told her about this

338
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:33,725
that she told me that she wanted to decide on the title herself

339
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:38,825
and also began revising in detail the things that I wrote.

340
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:43,525
It's true that the novel turned out to be fantastic thanks to her

341
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,425
but, I couldn't understand

342
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:50,825
why she got so involved in the work.

343
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,425
No matter how many times I asked her,

344
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:58,225
all she did was smile and say, "you'll eventually find out".

345
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:03,425
That's when the magazine wrote the scoop scandal of us being lovers.

346
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,425
So I was convinced.

347
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:08,625
This woman was out to take away my family, my position,

348
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,425
my fame, my money, my everything,

349
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:14,325
and ready to totally ruin me!

350
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,925
But, why would she do something like that?

351
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,625
I wonder.

352
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,525
I used to fool around a lot when I was young

353
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:24,525
so she might have held a grudge against me for something.

354
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:31,125
Well, to be honest, I'm relieved that I was arrested.

355
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,225
I was going to disclose the meaning of

356
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:37,125
"Telephone, Sea, and I" on the last page

357
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,125
but I killed her before I could ask her about it.

358
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,425
"I love you".

359
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,225
What?

360
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:48,025
-"Telephone, Sea, I" -Read it backwards, I, Sea, Tel.

361
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:50,125
If you change it to Japanese phonetics,

362
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:54,325
you'll get "I Love You".

363
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:56,625
In other words, the person who sending the cell phone over

364
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,325
from the future in a time machine,

365
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:03,425
could've been that the heroine's lover or husband.

366
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:07,825
It couldn't be some childish code like that.

367
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:09,525
It can't be helped!

368
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:13,025
It's a code that was thought up by a child to begin with, you see.

369
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:17,825
In the same way, when you read Chiaki Minazuki,

370
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:20,825
Minazuki means June in English

371
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:23,225
and the word "Aki" in Chiaki means autumn.

372
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:26,325
Read it backwards and you get "June Autumn".

373
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,025
It sounds a lot like Jun Ota, doesn't it?

374
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:32,325
No... No way...

375
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:36,225
I see. Jun Ota is her pen name.

376
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:39,025
If you decipher the code, "Telephone, Sea, and I",

377
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:41,225
it's obvious you'd be able to figure it out too.

378
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:43,625
Oh, no.

379
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,725
No way.

380
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:54,825
If so, maybe all she wanted was for you to grant her dream.

381
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:59,825
The childhood dream that she entrusted in you.

382
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,925
In the best way possible.

383
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:27,125
I love you...

384
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,925
I see.

385
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:31,825
The person who texted her was her future lover.

386
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,825
Yes. Sera said so!

387
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:38,325
But, it could be that he was a stalker too?

388
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,825
No way!

389
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,525
Don't say things like that and crush my dreams!

390
00:22:49,425 --> 00:22:51,425
What's wrong, Conan?

391
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:52,825
Oh, no.

392
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,925
It's nothing.

393
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,725
A wiretap.

394
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:06,725
The stuff that's on the tip of the bow of his glasses.

395
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:08,525
Have to be careful.

396
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:10,525
A type I've never seen before.

397
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,825
Judging from the size of the battery,

398
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,725
it operates only for a very short time.

399
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,825
This form and this performance...

400
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:22,825
Quite interesting.

401
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:26,725
How about it? Do you like him?

402
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:29,725
I'm far from trusting him yet, though.

403
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:33,625
But, if he gets impatient and asks about me,

404
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,525
tell him this,

405
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:42,725
I'm your younger sister from another domain.

406
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:46,825
We all came to Kanazawa.

407
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:52,325
So, you want to challenge the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri?

408
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:54,225
I'll accept the challenge.

409
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,725
Thief!

410
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,525
Don't you noticed anything?

411
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:09,525
Next Conan,

412
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:13,625
"Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour (Kanazawa Part)"
