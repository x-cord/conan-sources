1
00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:04,822
"Mouri Detective Agency" -This is crazy.

2
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:06,522
It's so pretty.

3
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:08,122
Isn't it?

4
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:11,722
Heiji and I are on our way now to check out the lights.

5
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:12,922
What?

6
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:14,722
Now?

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:19,622
Aren't these lights at Tokyo's Kinza Block 4?

8
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:23,122
Yeah, so we thought we'd invite you.

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,323
We're here.

10
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:29,922
You actually came?

11
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:32,822
Yeah. We're busy at the end of the year.

12
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,322
Today's the only day we were free.

13
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:38,222
And you said you weren't busy this weekend.

14
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:39,622
Well, yeah.

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,222
I guess not.

16
00:00:42,223 --> 00:00:45,122
But I just got back from grocery shopping.

17
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:47,822
I haven't made dinner yet.

18
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:51,322
Dad said he'd be home around seven,

19
00:00:51,323 --> 00:00:53,922
so I need to start cooking.

20
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:56,322
Then I'll help you.

21
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,322
Let's whip something up

22
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:02,022
and go have dinner while we look at the lights.

23
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:03,223
What?

24
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:09,922
Come on!

25
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:11,022
Okay.

26
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:14,122
Don't worry about paying for dinner.

27
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:17,322
We brought meal tickets to a cafe in Kinza.

28
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:20,922
You boys have fun at Poirot downstairs.

29
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:22,123
Sure.

30
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:27,223
Hey, Kudo.

31
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:32,822
If you're planning on asking why we came...

32
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:34,423
I'm not.

33
00:01:35,423 --> 00:01:37,323
I already know.

34
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:41,023
Fine, then.

35
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:47,522
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

36
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:50,022
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

37
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:52,522
I wish I could give Hattori my support,

38
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:54,522
but a strange customer arrives at Cafe Poirot.

39
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:56,222
He sees through the one and only truth.

40
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:58,122
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

41
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:00,623
His name is Detective Conan!

42
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:45,535
"Solving Mysteries at the Poirot Cafe (Part 1)"

43
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,436
"Mouri Detective Agency"

44
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:49,935
I'm surprised Hattori agreed

45
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:52,835
to go to such a romantic place.

46
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,835
I was surprised, too.

47
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:59,135
I expected him to say something like "Don't be stupid".

48
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:01,535
Wow, it's so pretty!

49
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:04,635
Apparently they're the lights at Kinza Block 4.

50
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:07,835
It must be crazy in person.

51
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:10,035
Wanna go, then?

52
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:11,135
What?

53
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,835
My mom won some tickets to a cafe in Kinza in a lottery.

54
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:17,535
She said she wasn't sure what to do with them

55
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,136
since she didn't have time to go.

56
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,935
Do I...

57
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:24,636
sense romance in the air?

58
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,835
There you go again.

59
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,036
You always think there's love in the air, Ran.

60
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:36,935
Huh? This meat and potatoes don't taste like anything.

61
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:39,035
-What? -Oh, no.

62
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:41,235
We forgot to put the soy sauce in.

63
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:42,335
No way.

64
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,135
What are we going to do?

65
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,135
We've already boiled it quite a bit.

66
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:50,836
The ingredients will turn to sludge before they absorb the flavor.

67
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:53,735
Let's make curry instead.

68
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:55,636
Yeah.

69
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:02,235
Who comes all the way to Tokyo for that?

70
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,235
Shut up, idiot.

71
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:06,535
You went all the way to London

72
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:08,535
to tell her how you feel.

73
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:10,536
In my case...

74
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,035
What an idiot.

75
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:14,036
What?

76
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:16,135
You mean you can't tell?

77
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,435
Aren't you a detective?

78
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:22,135
A detective should be able to deduce how I feel!

79
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,736
You idiot!

80
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:27,336
Hey! Wait, Ran!

81
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,735
Hey!

82
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:32,135
No! Let go!

83
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:34,735
You're a tough one.

84
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:35,935
What?

85
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,335
You're like a tough case.

86
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:41,835
There's all these distracting emotions.

87
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:45,835
Even if I were Holmes, it'd still be impossible to solve.

88
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,235
It's impossible

89
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:51,236
to accurately read the heart of the girl I love.

90
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:56,336
We just happened to be in London.

91
00:05:56,836 --> 00:06:02,135
Oh, yeah? I'd like to say a line as cool as that.

92
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:04,935
Anyway, are you sure about today?

93
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:06,035
Huh?

94
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,135
The date.

95
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:09,435
Yeah.

96
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,435
After all, today is...

97
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:13,336
Friday the 13th.

98
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:16,735
Is that why?

99
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:18,735
There are various theories

100
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:22,335
on why it's considered an unlucky day.

101
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,435
The most common ones

102
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,635
are because Jesus Christ's last supper

103
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,235
was attended by 13 people,

104
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:31,935
or because the number 13 doesn't fit

105
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:34,335
in the duodecimal system.

106
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:38,335
And Jesus was crucified on a Friday.

107
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:42,635
President Kennedy was also assassinated in Dallas

108
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,836
on a Friday, wasn't he?

109
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:50,835
But we're in Japan.

110
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,836
You have nothing to worry about.

111
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:57,235
The 13th day of the month

112
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:59,935
just happened to be a Friday.

113
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,435
Statistically speaking, it happens twice a year.

114
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:04,835
You shouldn't worry about

115
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:08,535
telling the object of your affection how you feel.

116
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:13,335
Besides, Jesus and Kennedy didn't die on the 13th.

117
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:16,435
But on Friday the 13th...

118
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,235
On the Friday of October 13th, 1307,

119
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:21,935
King Philip IV

120
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:26,135
had all the Knights Templar in France arrested.

121
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:29,435
They were unjustly tortured and burned at the stake.

122
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:34,335
On the Friday of June 13th, 1483,

123
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:36,535
the notorious Richard III

124
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:39,835
had one of his advisors executed for treason.

125
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:44,735
Julius Caesar was also betrayed and murdered by Brutus

126
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:47,036
on Friday the 13th.

127
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:50,735
"Customer" -Today is a very unlucky day.

128
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,736
Even in Japan, it should be avoided.

129
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,335
Excuse me.

130
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:01,436
I happened to overhear your conversation and couldn't help myself.

131
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:05,335
Who is this guy?

132
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:07,436
I didn't notice him at all.

133
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:12,735
Hey, does he come here often?

134
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:15,135
No, I think it's his first time here.

135
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:18,836
He came in right after you did.

136
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,235
Welcome.

137
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,935
"Meisuke Ozumi (21), Beika University Third-Year" -What?

138
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,035
They're still not here?

139
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,135
Fine, then.

140
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:30,335
You're with the Beika University drama club

141
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,035
that made a reservation, correct?

142
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:34,735
Your friends aren't here yet.

143
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,035
Seriously.

144
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:38,735
We're celebrating Yui's birthday here today.

145
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:39,935
"Reserved"

146
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,135
When they show up,

147
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:44,735
tell them they can start without me.

148
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,535
Okay.

149
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:49,335
My stomach hasn't been feeling well since this afternoon.

150
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,035
Are you all right?

151
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:52,736
I'm fine.

152
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,136
"Reserved"

153
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,535
"Coffee Poirot"

154
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,935
Seriously?

155
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:04,235
Don't tell me we got here first.

156
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:05,335
No.

157
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,535
Mr. Ozumi arrived earlier.

158
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:11,135
He's in the bathroom.

159
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,136
Really?

160
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:16,535
Ozumi didn't seem well this afternoon.

161
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:20,435
Then I have you to myself while your boyfriend's gone.

162
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:22,036
Stop that.

163
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:25,835
"Yui Yamashita (21)" -Tengo, I'm telling you just in case,

164
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:28,835
"Beika University Third-Year" -but don't say anything about that.

165
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,035
"Tengo Anzai (20), Beika University Third-Year" -Who knows?

166
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,836
I might let something slip once I start to drink.

167
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,535
They don't serve alcohol here.

168
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,436
What? Really?

169
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:44,035
Nagatsuka's still not here.

170
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:47,935
Yeah. He's in the middle of filming

171
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:50,935
your birthday video right now.

172
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:53,235
After all, he's in love with you.

173
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:54,835
Nagatsuka is?

174
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:56,235
Yeah, right.

175
00:09:56,236 --> 00:10:00,135
He always glares at me

176
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:03,535
when I flirt with you.

177
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:08,335
He's just upset that you're flirting with his friend's girlfriend.

178
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:10,835
Ozumi and Nagatsuka

179
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:13,935
went to the same high school.

180
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:16,735
You and I are just childhood friends.

181
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:18,636
We're just messing around.

182
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,736
Just friends, huh?

183
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:26,635
Either way, they'll find out soon enough.

184
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,135
What do you mean?

185
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:32,435
Nothing, my childhood friend, Yui.

186
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:33,236
I...

187
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:34,935
"Minoru Nagatsuka (20)" -I thought you were just...

188
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:35,936
"Beika University Third-Year" -childhood friends.

189
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,435
Nagatsuka.

190
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,935
Hey, you're late.

191
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:43,835
I got lost.

192
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:45,635
Lost?

193
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:48,235
We've been here plenty of times before

194
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:49,335
while hunting for locations.

195
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:50,835
Have we?

196
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:54,835
Last year we put on a play based on this location.

197
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:57,435
We came here together then.

198
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:58,835
Our previous club president

199
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:02,335
suggested we build a set identical to this place.

200
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:06,735
We even measured the size of the tables and the height of the chairs.

201
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:08,235
Right, mister?

202
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:09,635
You remember, right?

203
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:14,835
I wasn't working here then.

204
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:17,135
Azusa, do you remember?

205
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,235
Yes.

206
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:21,835
I was asked about how we interact with customers

207
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:23,835
and serve dishes.

208
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:25,935
Have a seat.

209
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,735
Let's watch Yui's birthday video together.

210
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,635
You finished filming your part, right?

211
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:35,635
Yeah. I just sent it to your laptop.

212
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:36,735
Oh, yeah?

213
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:39,535
But Ozumi's not here yet.

214
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:43,035
He's in the bathroom.

215
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,835
Oh, we're going to make some noise.

216
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:47,336
Don't mind us.

217
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:53,735
It's not turning on.

218
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:55,935
Is the battery dead?

219
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:57,335
Hey, miss.

220
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,935
Could we borrow an outlet?

221
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,436
Sure.

222
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:04,635
Here you go.

223
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:05,636
Thanks.

224
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:12,835
No way. A blackout?

225
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:16,135
I... I just saw a spark.

226
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,435
Yeah, from the outlet.

227
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,635
Azusa, check the breaker.

228
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:21,636
Okay.

229
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:28,736
What?

230
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:30,435
Azusa, hurry.

231
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:31,436
Okay.

232
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:39,536
What's all this noise about?

233
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,389
No way. A blackout?

234
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,489
I... I just saw a spark.

235
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,089
Yeah, from the outlet.

236
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,289
Azusa, check the breaker.

237
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,290
Okay.

238
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,390
What?

239
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:10,989
Azusa, hurry.

240
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,990
Okay.

241
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,090
What's all this noise about?

242
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,889
Tengo! Hang in there, Tengo!

243
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,089
-Don't! -Don't touch him!

244
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,489
What?

245
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,389
This is a murder.

246
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,190
Don't carelessly damage the crime scene.

247
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,789
Looks like this is attempted murder.

248
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,289
Azusa, call an ambulance and the police.

249
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,690
Got it.

250
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,289
Since he was stabbed with such a long sashimi knife,

251
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,589
I thought he'd died instantly.

252
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,089
But there's no need to call the police.

253
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,789
When he was stabbed, some blood flew onto my face.

254
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,389
And onto my glasses, too.

255
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,189
His blood must've gotten

256
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,489
on the culprit's hands or sleeves.

257
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,389
"Coffee Poirot"

258
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,790
You can't be serious.

259
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,890
Why isn't there any blood on anyone?

260
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,989
You, sir. The man quietly trying to leave.

261
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,390
Could you show us your hands?

262
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,889
No, I wasn't trying to leave.

263
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,389
There's no blood on him either.

264
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,390
Again?

265
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,489
Gosh. Why does every case have to be so hard?

266
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,989
Seriously, Hattori.

267
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,389
Are you sure you're not cursed?

268
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,690
"Mouri Detective Agency"

269
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,089
What? Don't come to Poirot?

270
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,289
Why not?

271
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,789
We just finished making the old man's dinner

272
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,590
and are on our way.

273
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,590
There was actually a murder...

274
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,090
It must be crazy in person.

275
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,989
They're filming.

276
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,989
They're filming for a movie.

277
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,989
Really? I wanna see it.

278
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,289
You idiot! You'd better not come!

279
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,689
It's a super scary horror movie!

280
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,389
What?

281
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,789
We'll meet you once we're finished here.

282
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,689
You guys go ahead without us.

283
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,190
Okay...

284
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,389
We're leaving without them?

285
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,189
They said they'd come later.

286
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,989
An ambulance?

287
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,489
Is it a hospital movie?

288
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,689
Let's go.

289
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,489
I'm excited to see the lights.

290
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,490
Yeah.

291
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:45,589
"Coffee Poirot"

292
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,189
I see.

293
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,989
Due to the thin wire wrapped around the plug

294
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,889
powering victim Tengo Anzai's laptop,

295
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,389
when the victim plugged it into this extension cord,

296
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,289
it shorted out and caused a blackout.

297
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,189
And in the darkness, someone inside the store stabbed the victim.

298
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,389
Yes, most likely.

299
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,689
But there's no blood on the hands or sleeves

300
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:18,089
of the victim's three friends or the other customer.

301
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,189
There's none on Conan and Hattori,

302
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,089
who were also inside the cafe, or employees Amuro and Azusa.

303
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,389
All of this despite the fact that Conan and Hattori

304
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,389
got blood on their faces,

305
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,089
and the table they were sitting at

306
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,490
was splattered with blood.

307
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,389
Did the victim always carry this laptop with him?

308
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,689
Yes.

309
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,289
He kept it in that bag on the floor.

310
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,189
But he left it in the club room all the time.

311
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,289
Anyone could've done something to it.

312
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,589
Yeah. He had a lot of enemies.

313
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,889
-Enemies? -Enemies?

314
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,389
He frequently flirted with other men's girlfriends and caused trouble.

315
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,790
He even flirted with my girlfriend, Yui.

316
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,089
It's because we're childhood friends.

317
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,489
I told you he was just messing around.

318
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,989
His dad's a member of the Diet.

319
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,289
I heard he smoothed over

320
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,189
a lot of disputes for him behind the scenes.

321
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,789
I see.

322
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,489
By the way, the victim seems to have been sitting

323
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,389
in this seat before the blackout occurred.

324
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,089
Where was everyone else sitting then?

325
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,389
I... I was sitting across from him

326
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,789
in the booth.

327
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,089
I was sitting next to Anzai in that chair.

328
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,489
-I see. -I see.

329
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,589
What about you, Mr. Ozumi?

330
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,989
I arrived before the others.

331
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,289
After setting my bag in the booth,

332
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,789
I was in the bathroom the whole time.

333
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,689
My stomach hasn't been feeling well since this afternoon.

334
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,189
I see. In the bathroom.

335
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,389
That makes you the only one who could've

336
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,789
washed the blood off.

337
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,489
If you think I did it, you can search me!

338
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,689
Even if I washed it off with water,

339
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,489
there'd still be a something-or-other reaction, right?

340
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,789
Luminol.

341
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,489
It's used to detect nitrogen-containing compounds.

342
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,189
When mixed with hydrogen peroxide

343
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,189
and sprayed onto blood, it reflects a pale light.

344
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,389
I doubt Mr. Ozumi will produce a luminol reaction.

345
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,589
Before the police arrived,

346
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,989
I checked the security camera footage.

347
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,989
He came to Poirot first and went into the bathroom.

348
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,589
Mr. Anzai and Ms. Yamashita arrived next.

349
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,589
Finally, Mr. Nagatsuka arrived sometime later.

350
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,889
The blackout occurred

351
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,189
when they tried to watch the birthday video

352
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,489
on the laptop.

353
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,989
Until the footage cut off due to the blackout,

354
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,990
the bathroom door remained closed the whole time.

355
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,089
I doubt he could've known who was sitting where.

356
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,389
But the bathroom has a peephole.

357
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,789
Oh, this?

358
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,089
The glass is frosted.

359
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,989
You can't see what's going on in the store.

360
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,689
Let me see.

361
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,289
You're right.

362
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,489
Hey, Kudo.

363
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,789
Who is that guy?

364
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,589
He's no ordinary cafe worker, is he?

365
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,690
Oh, he's...

366
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,390
Who is he?

367
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,289
He's a detective.

368
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,189
He was the old man's apprentice.

369
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,289
Seriously? That idiot's apprentice?

370
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,590
Then he's good for nothing.

371
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,989
My goodness.

372
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,990
"There's curry in the pot." -Seriously?

373
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,990
"We'll be back before 9 pm. Ran."

374
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,189
I'm exhausted from looking into an affair,

375
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,789
there's police cars parked outside Poirot,

376
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,989
and Ran's not home.

377
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,690
Who puts shirataki in curry, anyway?

378
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,190
That's pretty good, though.

379
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,390
Inspector.

380
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,289
I examined the possessions of those three.

381
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,889
Mr. Ozumi had

382
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,589
keys, cigarettes, a lighter,

383
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,389
a wallet, a phone, and a present for Ms. Yui,

384
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,389
which contained a necklace.

385
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,489
Ms. Yui Yamashita had a handkerchief, tissues,

386
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,389
makeup, keys, and a wallet.

387
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,789
Mr. Nagatsuka had eye drops, a wallet, a phone,

388
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,889
and a present for Ms. Yui containing gloves.

389
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,589
I searched Mr. Ozumi's bag as well,

390
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,489
but didn't find anything he could've used to commit a crime.

391
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,089
I see.

392
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,289
Listen, detectives, you seem to think we did it.

393
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,989
Couldn't it have been an outsider?

394
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,989
Maybe someone was waiting outside the store for the blackout,

395
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,389
and came inside to stab him with night vision goggles?

396
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,990
That seems unlikely.

397
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,689
Why do you say that?

398
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,489
Immediately after that man was stabbed and screamed,

399
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,989
I stood in front of the entrance

400
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,489
so no one could get out.

401
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,689
Really?

402
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,889
That's why you were standing next to the door

403
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,989
when the lights came on.

404
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,589
Yes.

405
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,489
You must have pretty good night vision.

406
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,589
No.

407
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,389
I just happened to be using my phone to...

408
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,189
listen to music.

409
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,889
I used that faint light.

410
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,189
Music?

411
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,889
Come to think of it,

412
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,689
you haven't told us your name yet.

413
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,789
My name?

414
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,889
I'm Shinichi Wada.

415
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,490
I work in medicine.

416
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,089
I see...

417
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,089
So I'm curious why

418
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,489
no one has any blood on them.

419
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,390
Shinichi Wada?

420
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,089
"Next Episode" -There's no blood on anyone.

421
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,289
I didn't know who was sitting where either.

422
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,389
I thought of a trick to avoid getting blood on yourself, but...

423
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,789
"From between long clouds blown by the fall wind..."

424
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,789
Where did that come from?

425
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,289
One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets?

426
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,489
So that's how it is.

427
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,190
I know exactly what happened.

428
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,889
Next Conan,

429
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,490
"Solving Mysteries at the Poirot Cafe (Part 2)"
