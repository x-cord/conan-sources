1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,949
Ancient Oriental Culture Museum

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,540
Entry Fee Weekday Adults 600 yen Children 300 yen Weekend Adults 700 yen Children 350 yen

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,670
Tutankhamun.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,970
The Sphinx.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,820
The Rosetta Stone.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,420
And finally...

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,580
The Screaming Mummy.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,010
Ancient Egypt sure is mysterious.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,010
But isn't everything on display here a replica?

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,640
Why did we bother coming to this museum on the way home from school?

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,130
Curious?

12
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:47,270
We're here...

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,280
For these!

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,530
These Egyptian god keychains are super popular among our classmates right now.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,089
And you can only buy them here.

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,829
That's right.

17
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,600
Super popular, huh?

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,779
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,889
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,520
The mystery of the cursed statue returns to life at the museum!

21
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,609
Always determining the one truth

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,289
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

23
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,920
his name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,850
"The Cursed Museum!"

25
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,170
This one's good, but it's hard to say no to this one.

26
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,420
Oolong Tea

27
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,200
Don't you think this one's cute, too?

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
I doubt we'll be leaving for a while.

29
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:24,119
What's this?

30
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,269
A notebook?

31
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:33,879
Ah, they have guests write reviews and requests in here.

32
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,879
Some of the reviews are quite harsh, but they're quite helpful.

33
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,389
Uh...

34
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,768
Oh, excuse me.

35
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,748
I'm Kowata, the director of the Ancient Oriental Culture Museum.

36
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:51,649
Nice to meet you.

37
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,649
So it's his taste that's reflected in this place.

38
00:03:54,999 --> 00:04:00,198
We'll be closing soon, but enjoy yourself until then.

39
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,319
Kids are very welcome here.

40
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:15,589
Closed

41
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,089
Okay, I'm getting this one.

42
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,589
Anubis is mine.

43
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,599
They finally made up their minds.

44
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,509
Excuse me.

45
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,719
Have you made up your minds?

46
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,828
Yes.

47
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,628
We'd like these, please.

48
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:33,748
Sure thing.

49
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:34,649
Oh...

50
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,848
Ishikawa-kun, could you handle the register?

51
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,219
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,148
This way, please.

53
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,129
Okay.

54
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,469
What was that?

55
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,738
What was that sound?

56
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,249
Conan-kun!

57
00:04:57,719 --> 00:04:59,689
Conan-kun, what's wrong?

58
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,259
C-Could it be?

59
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:06,888
Ran-neechan, call the police.

60
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,259
Got it.

61
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,649
It's the curse.

62
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:18,359
It's Anubis' curse.

63
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,419
Hey, Detective Takagi.

64
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,928
Was this an accident or a murder?

65
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:43,528
We don't know yet.

66
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,129
It's the curse.

67
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,219
It's clearly Anubis' curse.

68
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:50,488
What curse?

69
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:53,799
Look at the object he's holding in his right hand.

70
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,019
A-A feather?

71
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:00,248
Is that an ostrich feather?

72
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:01,578
Indeed it is.

73
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:05,029
Wh-What's so special about ostrich feathers?

74
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:06,559
The Book of the Dead.

75
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,448
That's right.

76
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,279
Th-The Book of the Dead?

77
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,408
The Book of the Dead is a guidebook to the afterlife.

78
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,948
It describes how the dead reach the afterlife.

79
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,669
What does that have to do with ostrich feathers?

80
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,169
The dead are judged after their death.

81
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,928
Their own heart is placed on one side of Ra's scales.

82
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:33,768
An ostrich feather is placed on the other side.

83
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,939
If the deceased's heart is tainted by sin, the scales tip out of balance.

84
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:43,588
If the deceased is judged innocent, the way to the afterlife opens to them.

85
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:51,249
However, if they're guilty, the beast Ammit consumes their soul.

86
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,579
And presiding over that judgment is...

87
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:05,209
God of the Underworld and mummification, Anubis.

88
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,148
I've heard about this.

89
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:12,818
A bunch of archaeologists died mysterious deaths.

90
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,019
That's the curse of the pharaohs.

91
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:20,519
Anubis must've judged this person guilty.

92
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,448
Does that mean Anubis is the culprit?

93
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:30,529
Does that mean the Anubis statue happened to fall as the victim was passing by it?

94
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:33,349
Don't you think it's odd, though?

95
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:37,789
There's a wound on the back of his head.

96
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:43,618
Yes. Forensics said further investigation is required to determine

97
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:46,518
if he got that when he was struck by the falling statue.

98
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,969
Then what about that broken pedestal?

99
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:53,738
The broken leg is a different color from the other ones.

100
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,809
You're right.

101
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,448
Was only this leg made using a weaker wood?

102
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:02,838
Which means after a certain amount of time had passed,

103
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:09,099
the wood could no longer bear the weight of the statue, causing it to fall.

104
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:13,039
It's an improvised timer.

105
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:19,369
In other words, the culprit could've rigged this in order to fabricate an alibi.

106
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:21,158
Y-You mean...

107
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,379
Yes. It's likely that this wasn't an accident, but a murder.

108
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:30,378
Director, we'd like to check your security camera footage.

109
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,649
O-Okay.

110
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,708
By the way, how many employees are there aside from yourself?

111
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,748
Just Ishikawa-kun.

112
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:43,149
Nothing beats low labor costs.

113
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:49,748
That's him.

114
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:55,659
We determined from his wallet that the victim was Uchida Hiroaki-san, 47 years old.

115
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,428
He worked in construction.

116
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:03,328
We've already contacted his wife, and she's on her way here.

117
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:08,959
Additionally, we believe this woman is his wife Uchida Yuko-san.

118
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:13,958
She's been coming here a lot recently.

119
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:14,709
What?

120
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,969
I offered her an annual pass, but she declined my offer.

121
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:20,969
I-I see.

122
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,988
Keep playing the tape.

123
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:23,809
Okay.

124
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,479
Stop.

125
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:27,769
Who is that?

126
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,479
That's Yamada-san, a regular.

127
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:34,239
He's one of a few guests who have an annual pass.

128
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:36,408
Keep playing the tape.

129
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,489
Okay.

130
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,499
Nobody came to the museum after this.

131
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:50,489
In other words, one of them is the culprit.

132
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:57,558
That's definitely my husband.

133
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,208
How did this happen?

134
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:03,378
You came to this museum today, didn't you?

135
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:04,019
Yes.

136
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,688
Did something happen inside the museum?

137
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,148
I don't know.

138
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:13,489
He suddenly showed up while I was viewing the exhibits inside.

139
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,929
We got into an argument, and I left before him.

140
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,998
I don't know what happened after we parted ways.

141
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,338
Why did you get into an argument?

142
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,959
He was a very controlling person.

143
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:32,089
He was angry that I came here without his permission.

144
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,718
Does that mean your husband followed you?

145
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:40,568
He'd make it sound like he caught me cheating,

146
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:45,038
but as far as I'm concerned, he was acting like a nasty stalker.

147
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,229
Then...

148
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:50,058
I can't say we were a happy couple.

149
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:52,658
I was considering divorce.

150
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,958
Are you sure you should be saying that?

151
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,838
You'd figure it out if I lied.

152
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,739
It's better to be honest.

153
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:05,499
Just to be sure, could we check your phone's history?

154
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,208
I'm sorry. I don't have a cell phone.

155
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,149
What?

156
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,369
That's unusual in this day and age.

157
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:15,129
That woman is the culprit!

158
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:16,748
I saw them.

159
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:18,508
What did you see?

160
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,878
I saw them arguing.

161
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,168
They threatened to kill them.

162
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:24,488
Who did?

163
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,328
The husband.

164
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:31,078
They even said, "You'll never get away with it!"

165
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,598
Who did?

166
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:36,109
That was the husband, too.

167
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,408
It makes no difference who said it.

168
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,798
The culprit is definitely the wife!

169
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,999
You also don't have an alibi.

170
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:51,879
Fool! Who's got the time to bludgeon a stranger?

171
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:56,629
I told you, it's Anubis' curse.

172
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:00,988
We're asking for your alibi for when the incident took place.

173
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:05,798
What were you doing around 3PM, 30 minutes before the body was discovered?

174
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,988
I was repairing a mirror.

175
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:12,208
After that, I met up with the director and some guests.

176
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,149
I believe I was preparing to close the museum.

177
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,628
In other words, you were both alone.

178
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,268
Yes.

179
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,659
Ishikawa-san, how long have you been working here?

180
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:26,178
Who, me? I think it's been about two years.

181
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,488
Huh.

182
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,208
I can't believe he doesn't know the difference

183
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:32,669
between the pharaohs and Anubis after working here for two years.

184
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:37,838
Ultimately, nobody had a solid alibi.

185
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,208
Let's look into the backgrounds of the victim and suspects.

186
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,258
We may discover a surprising connection.

187
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,679
You're right.

188
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:58,939
This Uchida man is unbelievable.

189
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:04,449
On top of his countless minor offensives, he has a history of cheating, brawling, and debt.

190
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:07,819
Hello?

191
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,448
Detective, I know who did it.

192
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:11,709
You do?

193
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:18,908
Yes. I'm confirming it now, but it must be them.

194
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:21,009
Who is it?

195
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:24,099
Well, actually...

196
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,019
What are you—

197
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,219
What's the matter? Sir?

198
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:30,889
Sir?!

199
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,069
Sonoko, are we really going back there?

200
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:41,848
I'm Mystery Queen Sonoko.

201
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:44,308
Of course I'm curious to know how yesterday turned out.

202
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:45,289
I guess so.

203
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,269
Hey, look.

204
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,409
What are you doing?

205
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,038
D-Don't touch me!

206
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,768
I am Anubis!

207
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,018
I am the god of the Underworld who judges the souls of the dead!

208
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:56,859
This voice...

209
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,039
Is that the director?

210
00:13:58,439 --> 00:13:59,324
Present your heart to me!

211
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:00,948
What's going on here?

212
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:03,448
I received a call from the director this morning.

213
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:04,788
He said he knew who the culprit was.

214
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:05,289
What?

215
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,298
But before he could tell me their name, the call ended.

216
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,559
I rushed here and found him like this.

217
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:14,318
His soul was tainted!

218
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:19,059
His soul tainted by lies was consumed by Ammit!

219
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:21,528
Take him to the station.

220
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,149
Yes, sir.

221
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,569
Hey, what are you doing?

222
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,029
How dare you put your hands on a god!

223
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,528
You mustn't touch me!

224
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,898
Inside that cursed notebook is...

225
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:31,829
No! Let go!

226
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,908
If you look at it, you'll be cursed!

227
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:39,039
The only thing the cursed can do is pray!

228
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:44,038
Conan-kun, don't. You'll be cursed.

229
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,249
I'll be fine.

230
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,649
Judging by his behavior, there must be something about the culprit in this notebook.

231
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,389
I see.

232
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:56,929
So that's how it is.

233
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:02,548
But Conan-kun, why are we going to Tokyo Station?

234
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:09,358
This notebook is full of reviews from lots of people, and Uchida Yuko-san's are among them.

235
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,239
What?

236
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,309
She didn't write her name, but the initials are the same, so it must be her.

237
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,769
If you look back through reviews written in the same handwriting,

238
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,359
you'll find that Yuko-san has left 17 reviews.

239
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,029
At first glance, the remarks seem harmless,

240
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:31,629
but if you read them carefully, you'll notice they have something in common.

241
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,738
What's that?

242
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:37,078
"It was raining in Shibuya."

243
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,869
"Shinjuku at night reminds me of Cairo at night."

244
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,828
"Flowers were blooming by the river in Meguro."

245
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:47,179
"The cicadas in Shakujii Park were..."

246
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:48,609
I know!

247
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:50,408
She's meeting someone.

248
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,719
There's always the name of a location in each of her comments.

249
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:57,858
Come to think of it, she said she didn't have a cell phone.

250
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,408
So it's a code.

251
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,088
Also, look at the dates of the comments.

252
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,469
The dates? But all the comments have dates.

253
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,508
The dates and times go back and forth.

254
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,129
I know.

255
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,369
This isn't when she wrote the comment, it's when she's meeting someone.

256
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:17,449
The last one is 11 o'clock on the ninth.

257
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,518
We only have 20 more minutes!

258
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,559
Let's hurry!

259
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:28,669
We're here, but where are supposed to look? Tokyo Station is huge.

260
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,638
This certainly is a problem.

261
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,079
I've requested backup, but we need to narrow it down somehow.

262
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:39,949
Where is she? Where are they meeting?

263
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,709
15 more minutes.

264
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,949
Ten more minutes.

265
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,639
Damn it. Which words indicate where they're meeting?

266
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:59,348
Today I got to see the Book of the Dead.

267
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:02,378
The hieroglyphs are arranged in such an orderly manner,

268
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:05,189
like the bricks in the wall at Tokyo Station.

269
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:10,899
By the way, the sun rising over the Libyan Desert was magical.

270
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:17,028
When the deceased watched their hearts

271
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,618
weighed against an ostrich feather on Anubis' scale,

272
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,369
all they could do was pray.

273
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:27,109
That's why I'll begin by praying, too.

274
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,709
Let me see that.

275
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,838
What's the Libyan Desert?

276
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:36,698
It's a part of the Sahara Desert in southwestern Egypt.

277
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:40,428
Huh, I guess Yuko-san's been to Egypt.

278
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:41,878
H-Hold on.

279
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:42,599
Huh?

280
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:48,278
I reviewed some records last night, and she's never been to Egypt.

281
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,978
She doesn't even have a passport.

282
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:51,779
What?

283
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,779
That's it.

284
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,629
What?

285
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,548
Sonoko-neechan, you said the Libyan Desert is in southwestern Egypt, right?

286
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:59,659
Y-Yeah.

287
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:04,409
Then it's impossible for the sun to rise over the Libyan Desert.

288
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,788
Oh, yeah.

289
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,919
Then this is part of the code, too?

290
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:12,919
See how it says "I'll begin by praying" before that?

291
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:14,919
Yeah, I see it.

292
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,179
That's where it starts.

293
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,798
Where it starts?

294
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,788
At Tokyo Station, there are facilities for praying here.

295
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:25,059
The prayer room.

296
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:29,189
And since the Libyan Desert is in southwestern Egypt,

297
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:33,888
if you head southwest from the prayer room...

298
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,449
The taxi stand.

299
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:57,129
What? What is Ishikawa-san doing here?

300
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:14,899
Ishikawa-san, I knew you would come here.

301
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:21,188
This case started with the discord between the Uchidas.

302
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:24,758
After witnessing their argument,

303
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,659
Yuko-san's lover decided to commit a crime in order to protect her.

304
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,579
You're wrong! I'm the one who killed him!

305
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:33,139
A woman couldn't have committed this crime.

306
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,709
Even if you dropped the feather in the hallway

307
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:40,219
and attacked him from behind as he picked it up,

308
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:44,718
it would've been difficult for you to drag the body

309
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:48,578
or tamper with the two-meter tall Anubis statue's platform,

310
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:51,739
even though it's a replica, in such a short amount of time.

311
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:54,558
No! I did it!

312
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,658
No, you had nothing to do with the murder.

313
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,609
How do you know that?

314
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,788
It was written in the notebook.

315
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:04,729
What? Wh-Where?

316
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:08,259
It wasn't written explicitly.

317
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,369
What was it, then?

318
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,929
Her final note was written in her usual handwriting.

319
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:17,968
If she'd been involved in the murder,

320
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:21,278
it would've affected her handwriting.

321
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,708
You're right.

322
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:27,488
Come to think of it, Ishikawa-san mixed up Anubis and the pharaohs...

323
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:32,699
But that was a lie meant to direct suspicion away from himself.

324
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,938
He pretended to be ignorant so we wouldn't suspect him.

325
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:41,528
Is he responsible for the director's curse, too?

326
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:44,989
You showed up just before the director

327
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,489
could tell Detective Takagi the culprit's name, didn't you?

328
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:52,608
When you explained the situation to the director,

329
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:56,439
he felt sorry for you two and had second thoughts about telling the truth.

330
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:02,609
So he pretended to be cursed by Anubis to avoid testifying.

331
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,249
I see. Then he wouldn't have to perjure himself.

332
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,118
You're right.

333
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,519
I'm responsible for everything.

334
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,399
I know I've caused trouble for the director.

335
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,098
But Uchida Hiroaki deserved to die!

336
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:21,039
You're wrong.

337
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,649
What?

338
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:28,148
Violence, controlling behavior, violations of privacy, and all manner of harassment.

339
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:34,169
I know Uchida-san was having affairs with multiple women for several years, too.

340
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:35,908
I was in hell.

341
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:40,208
Ishikawa-san saved me from that hell.

342
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,648
Yuko-san...

343
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:42,969
However,

344
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:48,339
that doesn't make it right to take a person's life.

345
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:22,338
Hey, apparently a Aztec culture museum is opening on the other side of the station.

346
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,748
Want to check it out sometime?

347
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:24,649
What?

348
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,819
What about Ancient Oriental culture?

349
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:33,079
That's old news. Aztec culture is in now.

350
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,999
The Incan Empire, Machu Picchu, Lake Titicaca, Quetzalcoatl.

351
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:41,069
It's so romantic.

352
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:43,129
Do you even know what those words mean?

353
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,968
Looks like you need a little educating.

354
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:53,849
I'll show you what a real story looks like.

355
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:59,599
Michiko-san, apparently it's possible that you've been poisoned.

356
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:00,849
What?

357
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,109
I see.

358
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,949
So that's how it is!

359
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:13,899
The next episode of Conan is "The Whistling Bookstore 3!"
