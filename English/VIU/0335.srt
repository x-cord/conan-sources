1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,249
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,349
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,949
We'll get to see the Yaiba movie that we had been looking forward to.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,949
A surprising incident occurs just before watching it.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,649
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,649
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,650
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,529 --> 00:02:00,129
"Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 1)"

9
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:21,528
2958cc, 220 horse power,

10
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:24,128
V-6 cylinder, 24 bulb,

11
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,629
equipped with DOHC engine...

12
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,928
Hey. Couldn't you find any other rental car, or what?

13
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:51,928
What's wrong with this? This car is just the car for me!

14
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:55,828
I think you're speeding too much.

15
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,228
Don't worry.

16
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:58,628
They don't have any "speed traps" here,

17
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,729
and I'm being very careful, too.

18
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,528
Hey, idiot!

19
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:07,329
What you gotta be careful of is not the police, but the speedometer!

20
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:13,528
Could I ask you something?

21
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:15,228
What is it?

22
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,828
Where are we headed?

23
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,228
It's about time you tell us.

24
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,129
Please!

25
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:27,129
To a place that you'd all love to go.

26
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,528
How mean!

27
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,928
Mrs. Edogawa.

28
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,728
I told you that she's not my mother,

29
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:37,029
but a middle aged relative of mine.

30
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,529
She's my aunt.

31
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,828
Hello?

32
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,528
What's wrong with calling her middle aged, when that's what she is?

33
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:02,628
Yes.

34
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,229
Mr. Karata.

35
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,728
What?

36
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,328
You're having trouble with the timing

37
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,628
and the time for "Zero" may be delayed?

38
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,228
Okay, okay.

39
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:17,529
We're on our way there, so I'll see you.

40
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,228
What is this "Zero" about?

41
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:29,028
The number of a robot or something?

42
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:32,028
Come on, please tell us.

43
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:33,328
It's a secret.

44
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:37,828
-What? Stingy! -What's the big deal!

45
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:40,528
We're probably just going to see the prerelease

46
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,928
of "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II" or something like that, right?

47
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,528
What?

48
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,528
-Is that true? -That's amazing!

49
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,628
I want to see it! I really want to see it!

50
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,629
Here goes, Joker!

51
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,729
Kamen Yaiba!

52
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:09,328
How did you figure out

53
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:12,229
that we were going to the see the prerelease of Kamen Yaiba?

54
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,928
Because timing means adjusting the color of the images

55
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:21,128
and "zero" means a film that has just been made.

56
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:26,828
Both words are a jargon of the movie and drama industry.

57
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:29,728
And, if it were to be a movie that everyone would enjoy,

58
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,929
then it must be "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II".

59
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:38,028
Since we get to see "zero",

60
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,628
it probably means the release date is coming soon,

61
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:43,928
so they're going to use "zero" for the prerelease, right?

62
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,728
Right!

63
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,628
Just as expected of you!

64
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:51,428
Hey, the signal's changed to green some time ago.

65
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:53,429
What? No joke!

66
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:57,128
Oh, no! It's changed to yellow!

67
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,929
I'm sorry. How absentminded of me.

68
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,728
Hey! Would you give it a rest?

69
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:17,728
You got children in the car, you know!

70
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,829
Okay, okay.

71
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,328
Wow!

72
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,229
It's like we're riding a jet coaster.

73
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,329
Ouch!

74
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,829
Hey!

75
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:42,929
Conan, your mother is sure a lot of fun.

76
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,629
I keep telling you that she wasn't.

77
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,328
So, this is the Tohto Processing Station.

78
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,728
It has a very long history.

79
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:02,528
It has walked the path along with the movies of Japan.

80
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,529
Come on, let's go.

81
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,728
Behave yourselves, okay?

82
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,329
Okay...

83
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:19,428
Hey there, Yukiko. Long time no see!

84
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:22,528
You're as beautiful as ever.

85
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,428
Yes, of course.

86
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:26,828
You haven't changed a bit yourself, Mr. Karata.

87
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,528
That's right.

88
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,628
He's Mr. Karata, the one who's going show us

89
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,028
the newly made Kamen Yaiba movie.

90
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,928
Nice to meet you...

91
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,228
He's the timing man,

92
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:41,228
and he finishes all my movies with nice colors.

93
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,228
"Takayoshi Karata (46), Timing Man" -Right?

94
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,528
Huh? Which means...

95
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:49,328
Did you used to be an actress?

96
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:51,228
Yes.

97
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:57,629
Maybe I was adored by your mother and father.

98
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,529
-No joke! -Really?

99
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,028
I see.

100
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:09,228
Your power of deduction was handed down from your father.

101
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:12,228
Liking to stand out, your confidence the acting talent

102
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,528
that you display when using the voice changer...

103
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:20,728
Moreover, your dangerous character of acting on impulse when angered.

104
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,129
You inherited from your mother.

105
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,828
Well, sorry.

106
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:29,628
And? When will you be able to show the "zero" preview?

107
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,628
Well, I think it's going to take a while yet.

108
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:36,328
I think we can manage to get it done around 7 pm though.

109
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:39,028
I'm sorry, but could you wait around till then?

110
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,828
You can take a tour around this place if you like.

111
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:42,129
Okay.

112
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,428
Mr. Hojima and Mr. Negami.

113
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:51,028
Would you do me a favor and show Yukiko and the children

114
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,128
inside the processing station?

115
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,428
"Yoshihiko Negami (42)" -Sure.

116
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:56,529
"Akira Hojima (28)" -Okay.

117
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,628
This is the preview room

118
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,629
where you'll all be watching the Kamen Yaiba movie later.

119
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:06,628
It's like a theater!

120
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,529
I want to see it quick.

121
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,828
This is the dark room.

122
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,628
This is the room where you check for scratches and spots

123
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:19,429
before putting the film through the developing machine.

124
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:25,028
And this is the developing machine for the 35 mm films.

125
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,228
Well? Isn't it interesting with all the machines around?

126
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:31,729
-Yes! -It's like a laboratory!

127
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:36,829
What's this sound?

128
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,628
It's a warning telling us not to open the double door

129
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:44,428
because someone's going into the dark room.

130
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:47,728
While the film is being checked,

131
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:50,828
even a slight amount of light with over expose the film and damage it.

132
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,128
After the film is checked,

133
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,028
Mr. Negami here is the develop man who makes the negatives

134
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,528
by putting the films through the developing machine.

135
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:03,228
Then, I make his negatives into positive prints.

136
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,928
I see.

137
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,628
Then, after the films are edited and dubbed with sounds,

138
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,128
the timing man, Mr. Karata that you met a while ago

139
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:14,129
adjusts the color and does the finishing touches.

140
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,429
How come only you don't have "man" at the end of the job you do?

141
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,528
Come to think of it, we don't say "print man".

142
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,128
Right.

143
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:29,529
Could it be that you're weak?

144
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,128
Weak...

145
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,828
I'm not a transforming hero or anything like that, you know.

146
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,228
-I'm pretty sure that's it. -Oh...

147
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:39,328
-Come on, Genta! -It's almost 6:40 pm.

148
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:42,028
Shall we go into the preview room then?

149
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,628
I guess so.

150
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:48,028
It's going to take a while to see that preview.

151
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:51,628
But Mr. Karata told us a while ago that it would be ready about 7:00.

152
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,328
"Norihiro Furumura (39), Salesman" -According to Karata,

153
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:56,429
he says it'll take till about 11 pm.

154
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,628
It's going to run that late.

155
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,028
Well, I guess it doesn't concern me because I goofed

156
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,329
and I'm out of work.

157
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,228
You sure look sleepy.

158
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:09,828
Did you play mahjong again?

159
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,328
Sort of.

160
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:13,628
But this is bad.

161
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:14,828
What seems to be the matter?

162
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:18,828
I won't be able to make my flight back if it's going to be 11 pm.

163
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:24,328
I can't make the children stay here till that late, besides.

164
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:28,528
Then, shall I watch the children in my room?

165
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,128
Huh?

166
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,828
My condo is right close by.

167
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:34,128
They can sleep there until it's time for the preview,

168
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,728
then I'll take them home by car after they finish watching.

169
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:41,428
Okay. Could I ask you to do so?

170
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:45,128
Are you going to make the children sleep in that sloppy room?

171
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,628
How rude.

172
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:49,728
It may be sloppy, but it's not filthy.

173
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:52,828
Well, it's only if the children want to, though.

174
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,528
Let's stay over and watch it, okay, Conan?

175
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:58,528
Bedsides, tomorrow is Sunday.

176
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,028
We can boast about it to the other kids in school, too.

177
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:03,829
Okay, Conan?

178
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:09,328
Okay, then call your folks and tell them that you're going to be late.

179
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,329
Okay...

180
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,929
-We did it! -All right!

181
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:18,728
Okay then, let's get work over with

182
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,728
and take a snooze too then.

183
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:24,928
Right. We'd better get ourselves ready

184
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:26,728
for the usual film completion celebration all night mahjong game man.

185
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:29,128
What's an all-night mahjong game man?

186
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,129
Does it have something to do with the developing man?

187
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:34,928
It means we're going to play mahjong all night.

188
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,928
Shin.

189
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,728
What?

190
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:41,528
What's with you? You sure are popular with girls, aren't you?

191
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,828
What?

192
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,128
Oh, Ayumi.

193
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,728
And the other girl, too.

194
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,928
Ms. Haibara.

195
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:51,628
What?

196
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:55,829
She stared at you at least 10 times today.

197
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,228
I guess she was watching the growth process of the guinea pig

198
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,828
who drank the drug she made.

199
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,328
How silly! Girls look at boys

200
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,728
either because there's something on his face

201
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:13,028
or because she's in love with the boy.

202
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,428
Ai?

203
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,129
No way.

204
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:21,028
I hope you got rid of that car

205
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,728
that was tailing us on our way here.

206
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:27,028
So you noticed them too, Shin?

207
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,928
Of course.

208
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,328
You were stopped all the while the traffic signal

209
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:33,228
changed from green to yellow,

210
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,528
but the car behind us didn't even toot a horn.

211
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:41,728
In other words, they didn't want us to notice them.

212
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:45,428
That is, they were tailing us.

213
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:49,929
They were tailing us for quite some time.

214
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,628
Right, I thought so too.

215
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:57,028
So I was planning to take off as soon as the light turned red.

216
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,628
I wonder who they are?

217
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,528
That's true.

218
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:07,928
If that car was after me or Ai...

219
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,529
it's highly likely that it's those guys.

220
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:14,528
Those guys that shrunk my body.

221
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,829
The probability is high that they are the men in black.

222
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,978
That's true.

223
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:35,178
If that car was after me or Ai...

224
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,979
it's highly likely that it's those guys.

225
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,578
Those guys that shrunk my body.

226
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,879
The probability is high that they are the men in black.

227
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,479
No. There is another possibility.

228
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,079
The person who is riding that car is...

229
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:06,478
A great fan of mine!

230
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,278
What?

231
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,178
That person probably wanted to know where I live and get my autograph!

232
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,178
Oh, my poor thing!

233
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:18,378
I sure hope so.

234
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,678
You'd better protect them nice and good

235
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,478
because you're all they've got.

236
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,478
Yeah.

237
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,279
I know.

238
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,078
See you then, everybody!

239
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,578
Enjoy watching the preview and go home safely.

240
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,778
Okay! Thank you...

241
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,878
Oh, that's right!

242
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,178
Come here.

243
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:57,878
What is it?

244
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,378
The girl that was staring at you...

245
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,778
Make sure you escort her all the way, and see that she gets home safely.

246
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,678
I know.

247
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,878
So annoying.

248
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,678
You're going to be late for your flight.

249
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,078
Oh, right. See you then, Shin!

250
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,579
I'll see you all some time again!

251
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:43,279
This is...

252
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:08,178
It's way messier than I imagined it to be.

253
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,579
Don't you know how to clean up?

254
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:17,179
Okay then, let's clean up before we take a nap.

255
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:19,578
Wait!

256
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,078
No, no, don't touch!

257
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,678
Huh? Why not?

258
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,578
I'm going to loose track of where everything is.

259
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,078
Is that so?

260
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,479
Is that really true?

261
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,079
It's tiring.

262
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,078
Okay, we'll sleep on the sofa,

263
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,278
so you kids sleep in this room.

264
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,378
If you sleep sideways on this bed,

265
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,979
I guess you can all sleep here.

266
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,078
This room is messy, too.

267
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,878
You can say that again.

268
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,479
I've been busy recently, so...

269
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:12,078
Good work all day today!

270
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,378
I'm going to give my best shot...

271
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:15,678
-playing all night mahjong tonight. -What is he doing?

272
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,778
I'll report the result later.

273
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:22,679
Recently, he's been hooked on making video diaries.

274
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,779
I'm going back to the station because I've still got work left to do.

275
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,878
What shall I do?

276
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,079
What shall I do? I'm so excited, I can't sleep!

277
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,178
Hey, Mitsuhiko. Are you asleep?

278
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,278
No, not yet.

279
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,278
The subtitle was "Counterattack of the Lord of Potatoes", right?

280
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,378
No. The subtitle that was shown in the preview was...

281
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:13,578
The subtitle was...

282
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:17,879
It was... subtitle...

283
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:23,778
Gosh! "The Requiem of the Potato Queen"!

284
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,679
Don't forget!

285
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,279
They're fast asleep.

286
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,478
It can't be helped.

287
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:42,279
They're children, unlike us.

288
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,479
Hey, Ai.

289
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:56,279
Can I...

290
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:00,879
Can I ask you something?

291
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,279
Is there anything on my face?

292
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,079
What?

293
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,379
What was that?

294
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,378
Hey, Mr. Furumura!

295
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:31,079
What's the matter? Mr. Furumura!

296
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:50,178
Mr. Furumura...

297
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:52,978
Conan. What was it?

298
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,379
Is it time?

299
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,279
Mr. Furumura!

300
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:25,379
How was it done in the dark?

301
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,578
"Next Episode" -I think it's almost impossible

302
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:01,978
to run away in such a short time from this dark, messy room

303
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:03,978
without making a sound.

304
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:07,278
We didn't hear the murderer at all.

305
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,079
A soundless murder...

306
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,378
I see. That's why he was flustered and did what he did.

307
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:18,579
No doubt about it, he's the killer.

308
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:27,079
Next Conan, "Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 2)"
