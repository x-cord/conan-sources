1
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:04,540
Really look at the huge number of helicopters.

2
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:06,640
More than the helicopters, the number of onlookers here

3
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:08,340
is even more surprising.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,740
They should've put up a "Keep out" sign.

5
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:13,140
Uncle had them come in deliberately

6
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,140
because he wanted the arrest scene of the Thief Kid

7
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,440
to be complemented by genuine extras.

8
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:19,740
Come to think of it, the advertisement for introducing

9
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,540
that large museum as well as the special program

10
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,640
was really flashy and filmed from the air.

11
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,340
But, wouldn't it be difficult

12
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,640
to find Thief Kid among this large crowd?

13
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:32,140
Don't worry, he has special seats reserved for us.

14
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:34,640
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki, we've been waiting for you.

15
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:35,840
Thank you.

16
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:38,340
Please follow me, everyone to the seat over that way.

17
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,440
Hey, is this for real?

18
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,641
This is the roof.

19
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:47,640
Would you like anything to drink?

20
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:48,940
We'll leave it up to you.

21
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:52,640
For the first time, she kind of looks like a rich little lady.

22
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:54,740
This certainly is the roof of the building

23
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:56,840
near the building where Thief Kid appeared,

24
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:59,440
because the only ones here beside us are the security guards.

25
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:01,540
I still don't understand.

26
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,940
I looked through the image the helicopter sent afterwards,

27
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:07,640
but there was nothing strange in it.

28
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:10,640
Moreover, he vanished in midair.

29
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,341
Just how on earth did he do it?

30
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,040
I'll go get it.

31
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,541
I'm sorry!

32
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,040
A scratch? It seems like something got stuck here.

33
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,441
And it's still new.

34
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:27,740
Do you see what I see?

35
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:30,740
A multitude of helicopters practically covered the entire sky.

36
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:32,640
And look at the many security guards that are positioned

37
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,340
all through the vicinity.

38
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,340
This is indeed a handpicked unit of security guards

39
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:37,940
that the Suzuki Financial Group has gotten together

40
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,440
to maintain their prestige.

41
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:43,240
Will he really appears under such tight security?

42
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:46,140
The one who forewarned that he would steal Blue Wonder

43
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,340
that is decorated on the roof of the great Suzuki Museum.

44
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,340
The Thief Kid!

45
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,140
He'll come. Of course, he'll come.

46
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,240
It sure doesn't sound like a remark that would come out

47
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,640
of the mouth of a little lady of the Suzuki Financial Group

48
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:58,740
whose treasure is the target of theft.

49
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,240
But, he's the Thief Kid, you know.

50
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:04,540
If just this once, I'd sure like to see him in person.

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:09,240
I actually wanted to hold the Golden Goddess statue

52
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:12,240
with a lot of gemstones on it that is on the roof,

53
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:15,940
but Uncle Jirokichi wouldn't let me.

54
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:17,340
Of course he wouldn't let you.

55
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,140
Don't tell me you wished

56
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:21,540
that he would take you away with him, gemstones and all?

57
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,840
Right, exactly, and Makoto would come to rescue me,

58
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,841
who is being held captive.

59
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:32,841
I, Sonoko wouldn't know what to do with two men fighting over me.

60
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,240
I guess

61
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,540
all this abnormal security around here can't be helped.

62
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,840
After all he declares that he is coming to check the place out last night

63
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:45,040
and appears by the building right beside this one floating in midair.

64
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:49,040
He walks in midair and closes in on the museum.

65
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,140
Then, he suddenly vanishes.

66
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:51,141
I guess it's understandable,

67
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:52,940
since he is the great thief that they are all trying to arrest.

68
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:54,640
Really, he was walking in midair

69
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,440
as though there were no tricks involved.

70
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,641
I'm sure that there are tricks and magic involved.

71
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,640
Because if people can so easily walk in midair,

72
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,140
it would surprise the birdies, right?

73
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,440
-Birdies, he says. -Oh, my.

74
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:10,741
What a cute thing to say, Conan.

75
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,741
Maybe the remark was a bit too childish.

76
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:19,040
Brat, let Thief Kid's magic surprise you and the birdies.

77
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,340
I don't know what trick he used yet,

78
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,640
but we may found the marks that he left behind

79
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,540
when he set up the trick.

80
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,740
See! The scratch on the wall over there

81
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,941
looks as if something was hooked on!

82
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,140
The scratch is still new

83
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:33,541
so it could be something that Thief Kid left behind.

84
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:36,341
Well?

85
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,140
There's one over that side, too?

86
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:41,140
Are you sure that there's a mark

87
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,740
that looks similar on the building on your side, too?

88
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:45,440
Yes, a brand new scratch.

89
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:47,640
But, I wonder what the mark is?

90
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:52,140
Maybe he hooked a wire up from this building to the other?

91
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,540
Thief Kid probably did so to put people under the illusion

92
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,340
that he was floating in midair.

93
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,740
No way.

94
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:02,740
Inspector Nakamori who climbed the other building last night said

95
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:06,240
that there were no wires or anything like that.

96
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,640
Besides, if he's suspended from something like that,

97
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:10,140
he wouldn't be able to walk.

98
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:12,240
Right.

99
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:15,040
Hey, maybe he set up a device to project a 3-D image?

100
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,340
And, that's what left the traces?

101
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:20,740
See, if he projected from two sides, this side and that side.

102
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,140
Impossible. He couldn't have done something like that

103
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:23,740
with the technique of this day and age.

104
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:27,640
It's impossible to project such a clear moving 3-D image

105
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,740
in a space where there's nothing.

106
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,441
Then, do you know how he carried out the trick, dad?

107
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,740
Sort of.

108
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,340
What kind of trick did he use?

109
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:40,040
When people think that something is not there,

110
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,140
they have a way of not being able to see it

111
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,641
because of the influence of preconceived ideas, even if it's there.

112
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:46,840
-Preconceived ideas? -Preconceived ideas?

113
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,841
And?

114
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:49,940
Just what is that something supposed to be?

115
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,040
Well, for example...

116
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,540
A super huge hard glass.

117
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:59,740
He placed it over one building to the other and walked on it.

118
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,040
Inspector Nakamori probably didn't notice it

119
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,240
because he didn't think that the glass was there.

120
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:08,440
It could be that the scratch was made when the equipment

121
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,740
that held the glass in place was removed.

122
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:14,740
If such a glass were there, somebody is bound to have seen it.

123
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,040
That's why I said...

124
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,440
In the first place, how would he have brought something

125
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,540
as large as that along, and then put it away as well?

126
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,040
That's why I said it could be that.

127
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,640
Not being able to see it because of preconceived ideas?

128
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,740
Kid...

129
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:33,240
Inspector Nakamori, so many people are flowing in

130
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:35,040
that it's impossible to keep checking them!

131
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,440
It seems that the Suzuki Financial Group

132
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:39,340
passed out a leaflet saying, "Welcome fans of Thief Kid".

133
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,040
Passed out leaflets?

134
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,641
If things are left as is, a riot may break out.

135
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:46,640
It can't be helped, let them through without checking them!

136
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:47,740
Roger!

137
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,341
He's probably going to come from the sky anyway.

138
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:55,640
Darn! The security structure of the police is a mess,

139
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:58,340
thanks to that attention-craving old man.

140
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:00,840
You're the owner of the Miracle of the Ocean, Blue Wonder,

141
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:04,140
the advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group, Jirokichi Suzuki, aren't you?

142
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,840
Indeed.

143
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:08,340
It's an hour more to go before the time declared by Thief Kid,

144
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:11,140
but are you more than prepared to take him on?

145
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:14,440
It seems that he put on a cheap magic show last night,

146
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,240
but tonight I shall be the one to put on a show.

147
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,140
I'll show you all a dramatical arrest

148
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,240
that will make Hollywood movies look like child's play!

149
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:24,440
Gee, my uncle is really out for the kill!

150
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,540
Let's take a short commercial break then.

151
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,140
The new talk of the town that has opened in Shiodome,

152
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:31,140
bringing along with it the fragrance of history and culture

153
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,340
is the Great Suzuki Museum.

154
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:35,740
Hey, even the commercial is about the museum?

155
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,740
It's a tie-up, you know? A tie-up.

156
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:41,040
Uncle never misses chances like these.

157
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,240
Even this aerial film

158
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:44,540
is a cut and paste of what he used in the special program.

159
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,440
Though he may not look it, he's quite thrifty.

160
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,540
Please come quickly, my dear Thief Kid.

161
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,740
And please steal my passionate heart away.

162
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:55,440
What's the use seeing him in a noisy place like this?

163
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:58,240
Besides, the wind's so strong, too.

164
00:06:58,241 --> 00:06:59,640
Wind?

165
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,740
What's the matter?

166
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm going over to where Uncle Jirokichi is for a while.

167
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,640
I just realized something interesting!

168
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,640
Just what is that interesting thing?

169
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,741
It's a secret!

170
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:15,740
What? Show you the film of yesterday's Thief Kid again?

171
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:19,840
Yes, Uncle Mouri insisted that I look at it no matter what.

172
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:23,140
Sonny, you watched it more than enough last night, didn't you?

173
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,440
Besides, it's already been sent to the staff

174
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,840
that are making his autobiographic movie.

175
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:30,140
What?

176
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,440
Well, but the film will eventually

177
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:36,340
be submitted to the police afterwards.

178
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:39,740
After all, Thief Kid has never come to check any place out

179
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,240
like he did last night, ever before in the past.

180
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,140
Come to think of it, he's right.

181
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:46,641
I wonder why Thief Kid put on such a demonstration?

182
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:51,340
It's less than a minute to go before the time declared by Thief Kid.

183
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:54,940
The Thief Kid fans who have gathered here are starting to countdown.

184
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,341
Let's all watch this miraculous moment, too.

185
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,040
He won't come.

186
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,240
No magician would ever let any viewer up on stage

187
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:07,840
before the show starts and let them surround him.

188
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:10,940
Because he would be revealing the secret of his trick that way.

189
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,340
Although he declared that he would appear again tonight

190
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,840
between those two buildings,

191
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:17,640
where the eyes of all the spectators are on him

192
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:19,140
and the wind of the helicopters

193
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:23,541
are going to blow his hand glider out of control.

194
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,740
He will not appear!

195
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,540
Well, if he's a long-nosed goblin or a mountain hermit,

196
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,641
it may be a different story.

197
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:49,541
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

198
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,075
It's Thief Kid.

199
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,575
He's appeared just now, as he has declared he would!

200
00:08:58,575 --> 00:08:59,974
Thief Kid!

201
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:01,374
He's come.

202
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,974
He's really floating in midair?

203
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,274
It... it can't be.

204
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:07,075
How and where on earth did he appear from?

205
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,374
Oh, no. It's started to rain.

206
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,574
Cover the equipment!

207
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:14,575
Rain?

208
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:16,774
Oh, no. It's raining.

209
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,774
What a time to rain.

210
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,374
Despite the sudden rain,

211
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,175
the call for Thief Kid goes on!

212
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:26,574
Hey, what's the matter? Chopper no.7, hey?

213
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:27,774
What is it?

214
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,874
The image from chopper no.7 was suddenly cut off.

215
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,074
This is chopper no.7. Everything's under control here.

216
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:38,174
The image probably temporarily went static due to the rain.

217
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:40,474
No. Maybe Thief Kid

218
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:42,474
is making one of his henchmen send out jamming waves,

219
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,474
and is up to something again.

220
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:46,774
Does Thief Kid have henchmen?

221
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,674
Yes.

222
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,774
It is reported to be an aged man or a young lady

223
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,974
or a lot of other characters.

224
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:55,874
But it's certain that he has at least one person helping him.

225
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,674
Hey, can you hear me, all men in the vicinity?

226
00:09:58,675 --> 00:09:59,774
This is Inspector Nakamori!

227
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:02,974
Check on the double if there is anyone among the crowd

228
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:04,374
that is holding a jamming device!

229
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,374
That person may be Thief Kid's henchman!

230
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,474
He's walking!

231
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:12,074
Just like last night, Thief Kid has begun walking!

232
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:14,374
Advisor, please tell us what to do.

233
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,274
If things are left as is, he will surely steal the object this time!

234
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:20,074
I'm not going to let him steal anything right before my eyes.

235
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:22,874
Put the Blue Wonder inside for now!

236
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,875
Yes, sir.

237
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:26,374
It's his intelligence against mine.

238
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,974
Scratch, preconceived ideas,

239
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,175
wind.

240
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:32,675
Henchman.

241
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,174
I see. That's the story.

242
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:39,274
I've figured it out, Thief Kid.

243
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:42,974
The trick that you used to appear in midair, walk and vanish.

244
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:47,675
I've also figured out how you plan to steal Blue Wonder now, too.

245
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,574
Advisor,

246
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:52,974
we've completed putting Blue Wonder back inside the museum!

247
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:55,574
Okay, we're taking the initiative from here.

248
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:58,975
Turn off all the lights inside the museum right away!

249
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,374
All the lights?

250
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,474
Yes.

251
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:07,474
He could be monitoring the image within the museum, right?

252
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,474
Hey, doing something like that

253
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,674
is just what Thief Kid would love you to do.

254
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:14,674
Then, Inspector Nakamori, do you have a better idea?

255
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,674
Do you know how to stop the great thief

256
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:19,574
who has appeared out of nowhere as would a mountain hermit,

257
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:23,774
and close in on us walking in midair?

258
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,574
But just what do you plan to do turning off the lights of the museum

259
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:28,974
and taking the treasure inside?

260
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:32,574
In other words, the point is preventing him from stealing it.

261
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,774
If the Miracle of the Ocean, Blue Wonder

262
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:38,274
stays out of his reach, I win.

263
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,874
I'd like to make a proposal.

264
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,374
In exchange for giving you complete command of this situation,

265
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,174
I would like you to lend me a few of your men who can be trusted.

266
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,674
My men?

267
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,374
I'm accepting his challenge.

268
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,974
It's a secret strategy that I stayed up all night thinking up.

269
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:55,074
My dear Thief Kid!

270
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:58,974
My dear Thief Kid, my dear Thief Kid!

271
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:01,274
The helicopters have finally gone to the other side

272
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,174
giving me a good view of him, and with the wind out of my way,

273
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:05,874
I get an even better view.

274
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,875
But too bad he's so far away.

275
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:09,775
What the...

276
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:14,674
Thief Kid's less than 100 meters from his object of target Blue Wonder.

277
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:17,474
Hey, how're things on your side?

278
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,474
Perfect.

279
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:22,675
I'm sure that your strategy will outfox Thief Kid.

280
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,774
He may be wiretapping us,

281
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,574
so that's enough.

282
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,474
There's nothing to worry about,

283
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,174
the tricks are more than well set!

284
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:34,875
All we do is watch how everything turns out.

285
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,674
Hey, wait a minute!

286
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,174
Inspector!

287
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,874
There's something strange about Thief Kid this time.

288
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,074
What is it?

289
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:46,474
You see something that looks like a string?

290
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,475
Really?

291
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,574
Yes, a thing that looks like a thin string

292
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:51,374
is shining at his shoulders.

293
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:56,074
Hey, if that's true, then Thief Kid's not walking

294
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,374
but rather is being suspended from the helicopter?

295
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,574
Isn't there something strange about Thief Kid?

296
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:04,374
His legs are moving but it looks like he's being suspended to something.

297
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,774
Hey, chopper no.7 that is right above Thief Kid's head, respond!

298
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:10,875
Chopper no.7. Hey, chopper no.7?

299
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:21,374
He vanished. Thief Kid vanished right near the museum just now!

300
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,374
It's chopper no.7 after all!

301
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,474
His henchman that was on board chopper no.7

302
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:28,874
picked him up from within the curtain of smoke!

303
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,474
Hey, I hope all your choppers are numbered?

304
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:34,674
Yes, sir. Near the tail.

305
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:37,574
All the choppers patrolling the sky, do you hear me?

306
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,474
This is Inspector Nakamori from the Metropolitan Police Department!

307
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:42,474
Thief Kid is on board chopper no.7 with his accomplice!

308
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:44,574
Report the position of chopper no.7 immediately!

309
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,574
Surround it until the police choppers arrive

310
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,275
and don't let them get away!

311
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:52,674
This is chopper no.14. Chopper no.7 verified

312
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:54,774
to be waiting at the main entrance of the museum!

313
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:57,574
Okay! Keep an eye on it and continue the pursuit.

314
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,074
Roger.

315
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,474
This is chopper no.35,

316
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:03,274
chopper no.7 is currently right above Shiodome Park.

317
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:07,574
Hey, hold it! Shiodome Park is behind the museum, isn't it?

318
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:09,174
Chopper no.28 here,

319
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:11,974
chopper no.7 has gone a long distance off from Shiodome.

320
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,574
This is chopper no.9. I verify two chopper no.7s

321
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:15,974
in the foreground of Shiodome Park!

322
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:18,574
Hey, what the hell is going on?

323
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:21,274
Well, the number "7" is written on almost

324
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,174
all the tails of the helicopters around!

325
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:25,674
Thief Kid probably did this beforehand.

326
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:28,274
Idiot! That can't be.

327
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,774
If such a thing were to be done,

328
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:31,475
somebody would've noticed when boarding the craft!

329
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:34,575
Inspector!

330
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,874
What is it?

331
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,274
There are strange silhouetted figures

332
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,874
in front of the entrance of the museum,

333
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,975
not just one or two figures.

334
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,274
They're the subordinates

335
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,974
that I let into the building a while ago.

336
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:49,974
Don't tell me that Blue Wonder is in the case

337
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,574
that the officer in the middle is holding?

338
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:53,274
Just what do they think they're doing?

339
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:56,575
It's like they're letting him know that he is carrying it.

340
00:14:58,175 --> 00:14:59,474
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

341
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:00,774
Get in right this minute!

342
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,774
Don't worry, sir.

343
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:06,074
This case is empty anyway, and we're just decoys.

344
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:07,674
Decoys?

345
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,374
Blue Wonder was taken out

346
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,974
from the back door of the museum in a trash bag

347
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:14,875
by Jirokichi Suzuki disguised as a sanitation man.

348
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:28,374
What's so funny?

349
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,174
Thief Kid.

350
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:33,074
What a crazy thing to say?

351
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:37,374
I laughed because I was able to protect that treasure from Thief Kid.

352
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,074
You idiot. I saw right through you

353
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:43,774
the minute you came to the museum today on this motorbike.

354
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:47,774
Just like now, you didn't have your goggles on earlier.

355
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:49,874
It would be pretty difficult

356
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,174
for one wearing contact lens to ride a motorbike without goggles.

357
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:55,174
The wind would hurt your eyes and you'd be in tears.

358
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:56,574
That is, even if you had a windshield,

359
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:59,374
it would be difficult to ride a motorbike.

360
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,174
Well, despite being super-rich,

361
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:04,074
the old man goes riding around on this flashy motorbike

362
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:06,174
without any bodyguards.

363
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,274
You'd have had more than enough opportunity to put him to sleep somewhere

364
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:10,574
and switch places with him.

365
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:13,774
By the way, you took the dog Lupin that was riding in this sidecar

366
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,574
to a shade in Shiodome Park.

367
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,574
I'm pretty sure it's still asleep though,

368
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:21,175
because of the sleeping drug you made it sniff.

369
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:25,174
How could I be Thief Kid?

370
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:27,874
I was right beside you

371
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,174
when Thief Kid appeared just a while ago, too.

372
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:34,874
The same goes for last night when he miraculously walked in midair.

373
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,474
That was no miracle.

374
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:41,474
It's a simple trick that can easily be carried out with an assistant.

375
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:43,774
Although the men are efficient members of the Suzuki Financial Group,

376
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,674
they're not from the police or the military.

377
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:47,474
It shouldn't be too hard to mix one of your men

378
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:52,274
among the bunch of professionals that were hired on a temporary basis.

379
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:56,774
You suddenly appeared last night in midair between the buildings

380
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,974
and brushed away our doubts about you having been suspended by something

381
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,774
by making a helicopter pass over your head.

382
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:06,074
After that, when the police and I ran up to the roof of the building,

383
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,774
all you had to do was make us confirm

384
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,974
that there were no wires connected between the buildings.

385
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:10,975
Since it would really make it look

386
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:13,074
as if you were floating in the air.

387
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,674
But if the pilot of the helicopter that flew over your head

388
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,974
were your assistant,

389
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,874
it's super easy to explain.

390
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,874
First of all, you fly on board the helicopter,

391
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,574
over to the two buildings you'll be using to carry out your trick,

392
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,274
and hook the tip of one side of the wire

393
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,174
onto the roof of one of the buildings.

394
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:32,874
Then, with the helicopter, you land on the roof of the other building,

395
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,174
hooking the wire onto the roof of that building.

396
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,174
You connect the wires from one building to the other,

397
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:39,174
then use the pulley that is attached to your body,

398
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:41,074
and move to the center.

399
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:42,974
Then you take off the black outfit you were wearing

400
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:45,275
together with the curtain of smoke, and dispose of it.

401
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,875
Then Thief Kid appears!

402
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:50,474
Your henchman comes immediately with the helicopter

403
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,174
and flies over your head.

404
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:54,874
The fish line-like thin wire that you connected yourself

405
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,374
to the helicopter with before getting off,

406
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,974
is pulled until it is taut and wound up!

407
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:02,774
After that you removed the pulley from your body

408
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,374
and made the helicopter swiftly collect the wire

409
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,674
that you hooked onto both buildings.

410
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:09,574
As a result, it would look as if you're floating in midair,

411
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:12,474
whether viewed from the top of the side.

412
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,874
Then, all that's left for you to do is to pretend

413
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,174
to walk together with the helicopter as it moves forward.

414
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:21,774
You used a tape recorder to create the sound of footsteps,

415
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:26,274
matching the sound from it with your stride.

416
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,774
In order to deceive people from thinking that you're being suspended,

417
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,774
you used exquisite body performance.

418
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:33,674
After walking a while, together with the curtain of smoke,

419
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:35,974
you abandoned your white clothes

420
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:37,474
and moved the position of the searchlight.

421
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:39,174
The helicopter pulls you up on board,

422
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:42,374
so it looks as if you vanished in midair.

423
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,274
Well, tonight's Thief Kid was merely a walking doll

424
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,774
that caught the attention of the police.

425
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,474
You were probably just pulling the doll in and out of the helicopter

426
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:50,774
together with the curtain of smoke.

427
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:51,974
All it was doing was hanging in the air,

428
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:53,874
so it was more than obvious that it was just a doll.

429
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,174
But, sonny you already climbed the building

430
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:57,974
that Thief Kid was on, didn't you?

431
00:18:57,975 --> 00:18:59,774
If something was suspended from the helicopter,

432
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:02,874
no matter how thin the string, it would've been seen.

433
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,074
No, because of preconceived ideas and the wind.

434
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:08,474
Talk about wretched.

435
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,874
The moment the helicopter flew above your head,

436
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,074
I was convinced that you weren't being suspended.

437
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:17,274
I was flustered when I didn't find the wire on the roof,

438
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:19,874
and didn't notice that string.

439
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,874
But, the marks were surely left behind

440
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,574
on the roofs of the two buildings.

441
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:25,474
The marks left behind by the hooks that you hooked on beforehand,

442
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:28,874
when the wires were collected by the helicopter.

443
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,174
But sonny,

444
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,574
you saw the video of Thief Kid last night again and again, didn't you?

445
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:35,474
Although it also depends on the resolution,

446
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,974
if the string is as thin as a fishing line,

447
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,074
you would have to be very near and view it with the naked eye.

448
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:41,874
It'd be virtually impossible to view it on the monitor.

449
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,574
The only way the string would show is the down shot image

450
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:46,374
of Thief Kid when the string comes to the foreground,

451
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,074
and the only one who could've filmed this

452
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:49,274
is helicopter no.7 piloted by your henchman.

453
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,674
If you sent the image that was previously

454
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,774
used for airing a special program on the museum,

455
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,774
and you added the image of Thief Kid onto it

456
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,174
and made it look as if helicopter no.7 sent it,

457
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:02,174
the string wouldn't be there.

458
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,074
That's why when it began to rain,

459
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:07,274
your henchman stopped sending the image, right?

460
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,874
Because on the aerial image back then,

461
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,374
there was no one using umbrellas!

462
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,474
The flashy demonstration you put on last night

463
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:16,174
was to make everyone think that you were coming from the sky,

464
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,974
and loosen the tight security on the ground.

465
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:19,474
You probably did so since you planned to disguise yourself

466
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:22,974
as Jirokichi Suzuki and come through with no check.

467
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:24,574
But, you goofed,

468
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,274
when you came with no goggles on

469
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:29,674
and that image was clearly on the TV screen.

470
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:32,774
No, it's not that I came with no goggles,

471
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,775
rather, I couldn't put them on.

472
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,074
Because my disguise would come off!

473
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:41,374
Aren't you worried about your comrade that's on board helicopter no.7?

474
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:45,174
I'm sure the police have surrounded his craft by now.

475
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:49,274
No need to worry, because the police are probably panicked.

476
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,574
They're probably flustered by all the no.7 stickers

477
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:52,974
on the helicopters.

478
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,874
All the stickers?

479
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,274
I see.

480
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:58,874
You stuck the stickers of the real numbers

481
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,074
of the helicopters over the no.7 stickers.

482
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:03,874
But the stickers of the real numbers were pasted on very lightly

483
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,774
so that the wind would easily blow them off.

484
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:06,775
Yes.

485
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:11,274
Therefore, the pilots of the helicopters go on board

486
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:13,974
totally unaware that they would be mistaken for being my henchman

487
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:15,374
and chased around.

488
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,474
In the meantime, my comrade splits amidst the commotion.

489
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:23,074
Indeed the great escape of the miracle of the vast sky, Blue Wonder!

490
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,274
The vast sky?

491
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:27,474
The blue of Blue Wonder is the blue of the ocean, you know.

492
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:28,974
It's the same thing.

493
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:32,574
The blue of the ocean is the reflection of the blue of the sky, right?

494
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:34,874
It's the same as the detective and the thief.

495
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,974
We seem as different as are heaven and earth.

496
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:37,975
However, if we trace back to the root of the matter,

497
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:40,574
we both force open the door to what people want to keep secret,

498
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,974
using the key of curiosity.

499
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:44,374
We're both nothing more than two rude men.

500
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,574
You idiot. The sky and the ocean are blue

501
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:49,274
due to totally different qualities of the dispersion

502
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,074
and reflection of light.

503
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,774
They're not to be thought of as the same!

504
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:56,774
As proof of that, the water in puddles is not blue, is it?

505
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,974
What a drab, wet blanket. You've got no dream.

506
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:02,774
I can't see through the truth chasing after dreams, you see.

507
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:06,774
Are you really thinking of nabbing me with that tranquilizer gun?

508
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:10,174
If I fall asleep at this speed, we're going to have an enormous crash.

509
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:13,474
Don't worry, I won't shoot until this motorbike stops.

510
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,174
And, as for your custody, I already contacted Inspector Nakamori,

511
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:17,474
who should be on his way here.

512
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:19,274
I'm not stopping.

513
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:22,675
Beside, remember what Gramps Jirokichi was bragging about?

514
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:28,175
This motorbike is rigged with an acceleration function.

515
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:32,074
See you, great detective.

516
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:34,274
I'll leave that treasure to you.

517
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:37,274
I wasn't after that treasure, to begin with.

518
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:40,575
Besides, all I did was take him on because he challenged me.

519
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:18,575
That punk.

520
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,974
You've got no dream.

521
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,175
Idiot. Of course, I do.

522
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:03,875
I've got dreams I want to realize too, you know.

523
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:11,574
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Uncle Jirokichi is angry at Conan now?

524
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,174
Right.

525
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:16,474
Why? Conan's the one who protected the treasure, right?

526
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:18,274
So, this is why.

527
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:22,475
That brat. How dare he take away the headlines from me.

528
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:30,074
"Next Episode" -If I keep believing, he'll come back.

529
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:32,574
It can't be. There's something wrong.

530
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:34,674
It's impossible for her lover

531
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,675
to have killed her.

532
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,274
Next Conan,

533
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:41,075
"Illusionary Spring Lover."

534
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,274
Next Conan's Hint:

535
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:01,175
"A Meal For Two"
