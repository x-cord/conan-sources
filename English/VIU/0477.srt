1
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,083
Summer shines but only yesterday.

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:05,683
After you cry, there is a cheesecake waiting for you.

3
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:07,183
A keyword to find the criminal,

4
00:00:07,183 --> 00:00:09,683
is it Japanese, English or German?

5
00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:11,183
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:12,583
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

7
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,883
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:56,221
We were at a soccer stadium,

9
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:58,121
watching a Tokyo Spirits game.

10
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,021
But the Tokyo Spirits lost.

11
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:17,721
We were so depressed so we headed to a department store.

12
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:23,721
There, we met a guy named Rutger from Germany.

13
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,721
"Rutger Heinen (42)" -But he happened to be attacked by somebody!

14
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:28,721
While half unconscious,

15
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:32,021
he pointed at a person as the criminal.

16
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,221
It was Genta.

17
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,621
What? Is it me?

18
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:38,221
But, don't worry!

19
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:42,021
Mr. Rutger left us a hint.

20
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:43,421
A hint?

21
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:45,521
Before he fainted,

22
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:47,221
Mr. Rutger pointed his finger at Genta.

23
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,921
Saying criminal.

24
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,621
He said that to you?

25
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:57,221
Yes. Was it me?

26
00:02:57,221 --> 00:03:01,221
And he grabbed my shoulder and said El.

27
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:06,821
E...

28
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:11,021
El...

29
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,321
So, the criminal

30
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,321
is someone that has something in common with Genta,

31
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:19,621
and someone who has something to do with the word El.

32
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:28,221
"Genta's Knockout Shoot (Part 2)"

33
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,221
"Parking Entrance"

34
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:30,221
What?

35
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,621
Why am I here?

36
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,021
What the heck is this?

37
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:38,321
Why do I have to tell you people about it?

38
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,321
What is going on?

39
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,621
Here he is, Inspector.

40
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:45,421
Hey, I really don't have time.

41
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:46,521
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)" -I'm sorry,

42
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:49,321
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)" -but an assault case has happened,

43
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:51,221
and you guys were the only ones

44
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,621
"Tatsuzo Genda (44)" -who were here at the moment of the crime.

45
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,721
So we need your cooperation.

46
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,021
"Kanji Kojima (28)" -What the heck! Are you kidding me?

47
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,621
You are saying that we are the suspects?

48
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:01,921
Well, you could refuse to cooperate with us here,

49
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:06,021
but it's gonna end up with us visiting your house sometime later.

50
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,621
Darn.

51
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,721
Alright! I'll tell you what I was doing!

52
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:15,221
I was just listening to the radio relay of a horse race!

53
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,921
This department store is close to an outside betting booth,

54
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:21,121
and also I was hoping to do some shopping

55
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:24,621
if I won a long shot on the track.

56
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:28,221
I see. Your name, sir?

57
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:30,121
Kanji Kojima.

58
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:32,121
Ko... Kojima?

59
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:35,421
You are the criminal, aren't you?

60
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:36,421
What?

61
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:39,121
You have the same last name as Genta!

62
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:40,121
Genta?

63
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,921
The number on your back is solid evidence too!

64
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:47,221
11 is the number Hide in Tokyo Spirits wears!

65
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:51,421
Genta is wearing a polo shirt of that team!

66
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,221
Are you stupid?

67
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:57,521
There's a scoring leader named Naoki in Tokyo Spirits.

68
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:59,521
Yeah, that's right but...

69
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:01,921
In fact, we called him Genta

70
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:06,021
but never called him Kojima before Mr. Rutger, right?

71
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:10,021
Right. Without knowing Mr Kojima's name,

72
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:13,321
it seems impossible for Mr. Rutger to call him Genta, right?

73
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:15,721
That seems right.

74
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:17,021
Okay, next.

75
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,321
Why were you here?

76
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:22,421
I was here to buy this bag that my girl asked me for,

77
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,121
but there was none here.

78
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:27,021
So I decided to go to another department store

79
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:29,921
but the gate at the parking exit was broken.

80
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,521
Man, what a bad day.

81
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:33,821
Your name, sir?

82
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,221
What? Yes.

83
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:38,721
-My name is Genda... -Genta?

84
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,021
You must be the one!

85
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:43,421
It's Genda! Tatsuzo Genda!

86
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,421
I don't know what's going on, but I am not Genta!

87
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:48,721
No, Mr. Rutger must have heard it wrong!

88
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:52,621
You are fat just like Genta too!

89
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:53,821
Oh, please.

90
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:57,321
How many fat people do you think are out there in this world?

91
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:00,721
You know, Doc and Inspector Megure are fat too.

92
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,721
Right.

93
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:06,221
Mr. Rutger would not leave such a vague hint

94
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:10,121
if he didn't know that these three people were the suspects.

95
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:15,021
Also, after Mr Rutger saying criminal to Genta,

96
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:17,721
he mentioned El.

97
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,821
If he knew Genta's name, he would've said his name, right?

98
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,821
Right...

99
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,421
Okay, last. You.

100
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,321
Why were you here?

101
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:29,721
My name is Hiromasa Itagaki and I came here to see a new idol,

102
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:35,721
Ai Sakaguchi's photo session on the 6th floor of this building.

103
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,621
I'm just her groupy.

104
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,121
Wait a second!

105
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:41,421
According to your driving license,

106
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,521
your name "Hiromasa" is written "Taisho" in kanji, right?

107
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,321
Yeah. That's right, but...

108
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:51,621
"Inagaki Hiromasa" -If I take the first character of your name...

109
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:54,221
Gakidaisho!

110
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,721
It means pesky kid! It's Genta!

111
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,221
Didn't you hear me?

112
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,221
Mr. Rutger didn't know the criminal's name.

113
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,421
But it matches too well to Genta.

114
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:06,521
And look at his hat too!

115
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:10,621
-What? -You see the big letter L on it?

116
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:12,921
This is...

117
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:17,021
This is one of Ai Sakaguchi's original goods.

118
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,021
It has nothing to do with that El, I think.

119
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,021
What?

120
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,421
If Mr. Rutger wanted to mention hat,

121
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,621
he would've said "Love" rather than "El".

122
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:26,821
But...

123
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,521
Maybe he couldn't read it because he is German.

124
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:30,821
Did you forget?

125
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,921
His ex-wife is English.

126
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,821
And because of her, he can speak English.

127
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,121
There's no way that

128
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:39,621
he would read the word "love" "L" "O" "V" "E"

129
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:43,221
It's not like Japanese words, such as "hot" and "tough",

130
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:44,921
And also "bill" and "talisman" which you write in the same

131
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:46,321
but pronounce differently.

132
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,021
I see. I get it.

133
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,521
What?

134
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:55,921
Actually there are some words in German and English

135
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:59,021
that have same spelling with different meanings as well.

136
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:03,521
Are you talking about the message Mr. Rutger left?

137
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,721
Yes.

138
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:06,221
What he was trying to tell us in the message

139
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:09,621
was that the criminal was like Genta or in other word a pesky kid.

140
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,121
Hey, Inspector.

141
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:14,121
You gotta let us go now.

142
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:17,121
You can't keep us here anymore

143
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,021
just because we happened to be here at the moment of the crime.

144
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,421
I have to go too, otherwise the photo session is gonna be over...

145
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:27,121
But you need to give us more details about what happened here.

146
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:29,221
Shut up! I did not notice

147
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:33,021
any assault case or whatever you guys are talking about, okay?

148
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:36,421
I was listening to the horse race on the radio at top volume.

149
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,421
I just couldn't leave this parking lot

150
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,621
because the gate was broken.

151
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,621
Otherwise, I would be at home already with the bag I had to buy.

152
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:49,621
I was in a hurry because I wanted to get to the photo session early.

153
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,421
So I can get a nice shooting location.

154
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:52,821
I see.

155
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:56,421
So, you all were here at the moment of the crime

156
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:58,621
but did not notice anything,

157
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,021
or did not even see a suspicious person, am I correct?

158
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,021
Yeah, that's right!

159
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:07,621
You are getting suspicious toward the wrong people.

160
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:10,521
I don't know what's going on

161
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,621
but the guy who was attacked

162
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:14,321
pointed at this fat kid and said,

163
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,721
"Criminal", right?

164
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:20,421
Then, he is the one who did it, isn't he?

165
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,621
That's right.

166
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:24,621
He was all alone kicking the soccer ball.

167
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:30,021
Maybe he missed kicking the ball and the ball hit someone...

168
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:31,321
He didn't!

169
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,421
Genta did not do it!

170
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:36,121
Ayumi...

171
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,821
What do you think about it, man?

172
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:40,521
What... I think...

173
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,921
Mr. Rutger didn't mean that Genta was the one who did it.

174
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,621
Mr. Rutger pointed at Genta because he wanted to say

175
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:49,221
that Genta had similar features with the man

176
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,721
who attacked him with the steel pipe.

177
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:56,821
In other words, he's just like Genta.

178
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,621
He's like a pesky kid.

179
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:01,121
What?

180
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:03,521
A pesky kid?

181
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,721
I don't get it... really...

182
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,721
Hey, Mr. Agasa.

183
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:12,021
This is a case of assault, not mischief.

184
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:15,421
No, what I'm talking about is the image.

185
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,021
-Oh! I get it! -What?

186
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:19,721
The person who attacked Mr. Rutger

187
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:22,821
is Mr. Hiromasa Inagaki! It was you!

188
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:23,821
What?

189
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,421
You came here for an idol's photo session,

190
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:27,021
so you must have a camera!

191
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,621
So, you are a camera kid.

192
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:30,821
Which could be interpreted that you are a pesky kid!

193
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,021
No way.

194
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:35,421
Camera kid and pesky kid are different, right?

195
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:36,821
But they are kinda similar, aren't they?

196
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:38,021
Hey, you know what?

197
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:40,421
I think Mr. Kojima is the criminal!

198
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:41,821
What?

199
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:45,521
Because he looks like he'd done a lot of mischief!

200
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:48,421
What?

201
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:51,521
What are you, kidding me?

202
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:54,021
You can't just make me a criminal because of that!

203
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:57,121
He does look like he was, as Ayumi said

204
00:10:57,121 --> 00:11:02,621
but I don't think Mr. Rutger knew about Mr. Kojima's childhood.

205
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,721
Then, we got...

206
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,021
That man named Genda,

207
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,421
but he's more a cool and wild middle-aged man

208
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,521
rather than a pesky kid.

209
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:15,021
He just looks evil to me.

210
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:18,621
Wait a second. What I'm saying is not that.

211
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:21,721
-What? -I don't see what is going on.

212
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,921
I'm saying that it was an English word, not a Japanese word...

213
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:25,621
It was elf.

214
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:26,821
Elf?

215
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:31,521
It's the pixies that you hear in fantasy stories.

216
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:33,221
Pixies?

217
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:36,421
Haibara...

218
00:13:42,221 --> 00:11:38,381
Elf.

219
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:41,581
It means small pixie in English.

220
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,181
But at the same time,

221
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:47,481
it also means little kid or pesky kid.

222
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:48,581
I got it!

223
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:52,981
Mr. Rutger said El after he pointed at Genta!

224
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:55,581
But he actually wanted to say elf!

225
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,481
But why does it have to be Genta?

226
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:02,281
Sure, Genta looks more like a pesky kid among you all

227
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:04,081
but it could be Ayumi

228
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:06,181
if the word elf means small pixie or a little kid, right?

229
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:10,681
The soccer ball Genta kicked hit Mr. Rutger's car.

230
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:11,781
Really?

231
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:16,581
And then he looked at Genta and said,

232
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,081
"A pesky kid", precisely.

233
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,781
I think Mr. Rutger wanted to say that the criminal

234
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:24,681
was someone like Genta or elf.

235
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:27,181
The criminal is an elf?

236
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,481
I see.

237
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:33,481
The word elf is the hint to find out who the criminal is.

238
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:38,481
And the victim told us that by pointing his finger at Genta.

239
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:41,081
It still doesn't make sense though.

240
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:45,381
One of these three men is the pesky kid or a small pixie

241
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,281
but they don't seem to be.

242
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,981
What do you think, Mr. Agasa?

243
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:51,781
I forgot to tell you.

244
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:55,081
Mr. Rutger is German, so he can speak German, of course.

245
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:58,481
But in addition, he can also speaks English and Japanese as well!

246
00:12:58,481 --> 00:12:59,781
Is that true?

247
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:03,981
Do you know how to count numbers in Mr. Rutger's mother tongue,

248
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:05,181
or German?

249
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:06,681
Number?

250
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:07,781
You know, Takagi?

251
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:10,381
I think...

252
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:11,981
Un, deux, trios...

253
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:14,581
That's French.

254
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:17,781
In German, 1 is eins.

255
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:19,781
2 is zwei,

256
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:21,381
3 is drei,

257
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,081
4 is vier,

258
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,681
5 is funf,

259
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:26,381
6 is sechs,

260
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,181
7 is sieben,

261
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:30,081
8 is acht,

262
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:31,981
9 is neun,

263
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:33,981
10 is zehn,

264
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,381
and 11

265
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,681
is elf...

266
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,081
What?

267
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:42,381
-Mr. Kanji Kojima. -What?

268
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,781
It's the number on your back!

269
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,681
I see.

270
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,381
Mr. Rutger meant both 11 in German and elf in English

271
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:59,481
when he pointed at Kojima.

272
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:01,581
Yes. He thought Conan knew a lot about German and England,

273
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,981
and thus trusted him.

274
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:06,381
Yeah, and you, Doc.

275
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:10,081
He thought we would figure out the meaning of elf!

276
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,681
Well, he can speak Japanese.

277
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:15,681
He could've said 11 in Japanese. It would be so much easier.

278
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:20,081
Maybe he thought that the criminal was walking around,

279
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,681
and therefore made it more complicated on purpose.

280
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:26,081
So that we won't be attacked by the criminal.

281
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:28,781
I see.

282
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:33,081
Now Mr. Kojima, you need to come to the station, please?

283
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:38,081
Are you kidding me, Inspector?

284
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:40,381
You all are talking about elf or whatever,

285
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,781
and I had 11 on my back,

286
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,981
but you can't make me a criminal just because of that.

287
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:48,781
Did that German guy say elf clearly?

288
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:51,181
I'm asking, old man!

289
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,581
If you keep trusting that old man's random deduction,

290
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:56,181
you'll look like a fool.

291
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:59,081
It seems like a pretty reasonable deduction though.

292
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,781
-It's nothing. -Hey, old man!

293
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,581
You've been standing on you soapbox for long.

294
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:03,881
No. I...

295
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,481
I am Japanese!

296
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,481
I don't care about elf or whatever it is!

297
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:08,981
Stop it, please!

298
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:12,281
If you say so,

299
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,781
why don't you show me evidence?

300
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,181
-What? -You are saying I'm the criminal, right?

301
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,581
Then show me solid evidence.

302
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:21,581
Is there any?

303
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:27,781
Is there anybody who saw me hitting the foreigner and running away?

304
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:31,481
You treat me like a criminal without solid evidence.

305
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:36,081
I don't think I can stand this, Inspector.

306
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,181
I can't cooperate with you people anymore!

307
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,581
I'm gonna go home.

308
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:41,481
Wait, Mr. Kojima.

309
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:42,581
I saw it.

310
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:49,181
I saw Mr. Kojima

311
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,581
hit Mr. Rutger and run away.

312
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:53,181
I actually saw it.

313
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:54,481
What?

314
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:56,981
Is that true, Conan?

315
00:15:56,981 --> 00:16:00,481
Yeah! When we found Mr. Rutger on the ground,

316
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:04,281
I also saw this person running away in a hurry!

317
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:05,581
Hey, kid!

318
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,681
Right, guys? You guys saw it too!

319
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:09,381
You saw him, right?

320
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:11,681
Conan?

321
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,781
You rascal!

322
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:17,581
Say that again, I'm gonna...

323
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:20,181
Can you really prove it?

324
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,281
Yeah!

325
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,281
Hey, why do you trust him?

326
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:25,681
I don't understand. Don't you see it's strange?

327
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:28,781
How come he didn't say it from the beginning if he really saw me?

328
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,781
That old man is the reason!

329
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:35,281
He's saying complete nonsense and this kid is going along with that!

330
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:36,781
They're all lying!

331
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,281
Anyway,

332
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:40,981
we need you to come to the station with Conan, please.

333
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:41,981
We'll talk there...

334
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:43,581
No. I won't go there!

335
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,781
I don't have time to deal with a kid's lie!

336
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:48,181
It's not a lie!

337
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:51,581
I remember the number on your back clearly!

338
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,781
You little prick! I'm gonna make you shut up!

339
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,281
-Stop! -It's true!

340
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,381
I saw it...

341
00:16:56,381 --> 00:17:00,281
Because I was the one who found Mr. Rutger first!

342
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:01,881
What?

343
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:03,281
Conan?

344
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:10,681
Did you hear that? Did you hear that, man?

345
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,981
This kid just gave himself away!

346
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:16,281
Look! You did not find the foreigner first!

347
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:18,581
That fat kid found him first!

348
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:25,181
What?

349
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:27,281
How did you know?

350
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:31,081
How did you know that Genta found Mr. Rutger first?

351
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:32,081
Oh!

352
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:34,481
Takagi, did you tell him about it?

353
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:37,481
No, sir. I haven't told him yet.

354
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:40,281
No.

355
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:42,181
No! I didn't do it!

356
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,881
Yeah! It was the voice!

357
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,581
It was that kid's voice!

358
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,281
I heard that kid's scream!

359
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,781
-You could not hear that. -What?

360
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,581
Remember you said you were listening to the horse race

361
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:55,681
on the radio at top volume inside your car,

362
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,981
so you couldn't notice anything outside?

363
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,281
If that so, then you could not have been able to hear Genta's scream.

364
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,481
But you said you know that he found Mr. Rutger first?

365
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:09,481
I told you, I saw it!

366
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:11,881
I saw this kid kicking the ball alone.

367
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,881
So you know,

368
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:15,281
maybe I was unable to hear,

369
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:17,681
but I could see what was happening outside the car, right?

370
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,381
Right, Inspector?

371
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,881
Sure, that's true.

372
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:25,281
But how did you know that Genta found Mr. Rutger?

373
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:28,281
Genta was just kicking the ball, right?

374
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,581
Sure I know!

375
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:30,681
Because at that time...

376
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:33,681
-At that time, you said? -Well...

377
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:40,881
It was this, wasn't it?

378
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:45,181
At that time, when you hit Mr. Rutger with a steel pipe.

379
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:51,381
You saw this soccer ball come, right?

380
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,781
That's why you knew Genta was kicking the ball

381
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:57,381
and would be coming to get the ball.

382
00:18:57,381 --> 00:19:00,081
No, I was...

383
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:02,081
I was listening to the horse race on the radio...

384
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:04,481
Then tell me.

385
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:07,281
Tell me the name of the horse that won the main race today.

386
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:10,381
-What? -You must know it if you were staying here

387
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,681
and listening to the radio relay of the horse race!

388
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:14,681
The main race was on

389
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:17,681
at the time we came back here.

390
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:20,381
Well, that's...

391
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:22,981
I understand that you don't remember

392
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:27,381
because you didn't have time to listen to the horse race on the radio.

393
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:30,581
You wanted to leave this parking lot as soon as possible,

394
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:34,181
and so headed to the exit with your car.

395
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:35,481
But guess what?

396
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:38,681
Mr. Genda was stranded at the gate

397
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:42,481
and somebody could not leave this parking lot.

398
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,381
You went back to where you were

399
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:50,981
and started listening to the horse race on the radio at top volume,

400
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,981
so you can pretend that you didn't notice anything about the case.

401
00:19:54,981 --> 00:20:00,881
I suppose you were totally panicked at that time.

402
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:07,781
No.

403
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,681
No...

404
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:13,881
I didn't do it...

405
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,181
Hey! Wait.

406
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:22,881
I got stuck here all because of you.

407
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:24,981
No. You can't do that.

408
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:27,081
Mr. Genda!

409
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:28,881
Mr. Genda.

410
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,481
What have you done?

411
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:35,381
You don't have to thank me.

412
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,281
I just wanted to do it.

413
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:07,081
"Cafe Poirot"

414
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:08,381
Really?

415
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:12,381
So that guy committed the crime for the money.

416
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,381
Yeah.

417
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:18,581
Detective Takagi called Doc and told him about that, I heard.

418
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,581
He's been running away from debt collectors.

419
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:23,581
Opportunity made him a criminal, he said.

420
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:29,281
Japanese crimes are becoming Americanized, right?

421
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,881
Anyway, I'm happy because Genta wasn't the criminal!

422
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:34,381
Yeah.

423
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:38,281
It felt like a living eel on a cooking board.

424
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:41,181
What was this foreigner thinking though anyway?

425
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:44,381
He pointed at a child and said "criminal"...

426
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:46,181
Yeah, I know.

427
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:49,081
Hi there!

428
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:53,281
What if Genta happened to be the criminal...

429
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:55,081
I trusted them.

430
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:56,081
What?

431
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,581
I trusted these little detectives.

432
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,181
Mr. Rutger!

433
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:03,381
Is your head okay?

434
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,581
Yeah, kind of.

435
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:06,081
Thank god!

436
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,581
Is he the German guy?

437
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:10,881
Looks like it.

438
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:12,581
I'm sorry, sonny.

439
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:13,681
Yeah.

440
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:16,481
As a token of my appreciation, I brought this today.

441
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:20,081
It's that cheesecake!

442
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:22,381
Wow, that looks nice!

443
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,981
I really wanted to eat this!

444
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:27,281
You know, I happened to miss it at that time, right?

445
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,681
I bought it because I thought so.

446
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,881
He already knew, Genta.

447
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:33,381
Thank you.

448
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,081
Oh, please.

449
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,881
How come such a dark horse won the race?

450
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:41,481
This was supposed to be an easy bet!

451
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:43,481
-Hey. -What?

452
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:45,781
The strong one doesn't win.

453
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:49,181
The one who wins is strong!

454
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:50,581
What?

455
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,581
"Next Episode"

456
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:58,881
The criminal may be in this building still.

457
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,481
I have to go down these stairs.

458
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:07,481
The other stairs are blocked.

459
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,881
The target is probably...

460
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:22,681
Next Conan, "Real 30 Minutes"

461
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:40,181
Next Conan's Hint:

462
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:43,581
"A Live TV Show"

463
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:44,981
Next episode is a live!

464
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:46,181
It's the first attempt in Japanese Anime history, right?

465
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:47,481
Just kidding.
