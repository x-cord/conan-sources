1
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:10,566
We went to Kanazawa.

2
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,966
Look, Conan!

3
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,366
"Tsuzumi Gate"

4
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,366
That's the Tsuzumi Gate, right!

5
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:24,666
It's really shaped just like a drum!

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:29,066
Yes! It's much larger than I thought.

7
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:30,366
Mr. Mouri?

8
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:37,966
Pops was asked to cooperate in a town revitalization event

9
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:41,366
called the "Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour."

10
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,766
How do you do?

11
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:49,366
I am Yuzo Tanimoto from the Tourist Bureau.

12
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:53,066
-"Yuzo Tanimoto (57)" -We hope you enjoy yourselves today.

13
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:57,166
-"Moeko Miyazawa (27)" -I'm Moeko Miyazawa from the Tourist Bureau too.

14
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,966
-"Yuya Tadokoro (48)" -I'm the CEO of an event planning company,

15
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:01,666
Yuya Tadokoro.

16
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,566
-"Osamu Kuranishi (33)" -I'm a staff member, Osamu Kuranishi.

17
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:08,066
-"Harumi Akiyama (29)" -I'm also a staff member, Harumi Akiyama.

18
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:14,966
I am the great detective, Kogoro Mouri!

19
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,966
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

20
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,866
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

21
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,566
A deduction event is staged in Kanazawa.

22
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,566
The mystery is big-Hyakumangoku!

23
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,066
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,066
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,566
His name is Detective Conan.

26
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:21,796
"Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour (Kanazawa Part)"

27
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:30,696
The event will be staged in Kanazawa and Kaga.

28
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:33,996
The participants will travel to several checkpoints

29
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:36,696
by deciphering codes and gather hints

30
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,696
to get to the truth behind a certain case and deduce

31
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,296
who the culprit is.

32
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:42,596
Checkpoints?

33
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,496
Yes. We've chosen several tourist spots

34
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:48,096
in Kanazawa and Kaga as checkpoints.

35
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,296
I see.

36
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,796
So we can go sightseeing while solving the mystery!

37
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:53,896
Yes.

38
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,496
You can solve the mystery

39
00:03:55,496 --> 00:04:00,296
by cracking the code you receive at each checkpoint.

40
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:02,696
That's sounds like fun.

41
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:03,696
It does, doesn't it?

42
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:08,896
Akiyama has already thought up the codes.

43
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:11,696
So, Mr. Mouri, we'd like you to come up with a story

44
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:15,496
that would serve as a backdrop for the codes, of this difficult case.

45
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:21,496
We're calling it, "A Challenge from The Great Detective Kogoro Mouri"!

46
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:22,696
I see.

47
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,596
I understand.

48
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:26,296
You can count on me!

49
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:27,896
Since I, Kogoro Mouri,

50
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:31,996
have solved countless difficult cases up to now!

51
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:36,696
I'll prepare an exceptionally difficult case for you!

52
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:39,396
I've got one suggestion to make, though.

53
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:44,096
Today, in order to get a feel of the event,

54
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:47,196
we'll have you actually solve the codes,

55
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:50,596
we're thinking of going to each checkpoint.

56
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:51,896
What do you think?

57
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:57,796
So, you want to challenge the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri?

58
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:58,996
Fine.

59
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,896
I'll accept the challenge.

60
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,696
All the checkpoints for the famous tourist sites

61
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:10,196
are in the guidebook.

62
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:11,996
Thank you very much.

63
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:15,696
So, this is the code for the first checkpoint.

64
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:18,096
We start right away?

65
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,496
Let me see.

66
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:25,496
Experiencing picking fleas in front of a mirror spring?

67
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,896
What's this about?

68
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:30,896
Look. Only the word "nomitori" are written differently.

69
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:39,296
"Nomitori"...

70
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,996
I get it!

71
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:42,196
Since it says "nomitori",

72
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,496
it means that

73
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,696
I have to delete the characters "no" and "mi" from the sentence!

74
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:48,296
When the two characters are deleted, it reads

75
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:51,896
"Experience in front of Kaga hot spring".

76
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,396
Experience in front of Kaga hot spring.

77
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:58,496
"Kaga yu" means Kaga hot spring!

78
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:04,396
We're going to experience something in front of that hot spring, right?

79
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,796
But wait, Dad.

80
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:09,596
Kaga hot springs include the four hot springs of Kaga.

81
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:11,296
-"Yamanaka Hot Spring" -Yamanaka Hot Spring.

82
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,496
-"Katayamazu Hot Spring" -Katayamazu Hot Spring.

83
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,296
-"Awazu Hot Spring" -Awazu Hot Spring.

84
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:18,296
-"Yamashiro Hot Spring" -and Yamashiro Hot Spring.

85
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,096
All of them located far apart from each other.

86
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:24,896
Besides, only the character "mae" is written in Chinese character, right?

87
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:27,096
Maybe that could be a catch?

88
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:30,996
We'd be inclined to read it "mae" meaning front, from preconception.

89
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:33,596
But can also be read "zen", right?

90
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:34,596
"Zen"?

91
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:38,896
Which means experiencing Kaga Yuzen

92
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,896
Experiencing Kaga Yuzen (Kaga prints and dye).

93
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:46,396
If I remember correctly. It's...

94
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:47,396
Here it is!

95
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:50,096
The "Kaga Yuzen" Traditional Industry Centre!

96
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:53,696
It says we can experience Kaga Yuzen here.

97
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,196
Correct.

98
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,096
Just as would be expected of a great detective.

99
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:01,996
Your assistants are very efficient too!

100
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:04,396
Well, I guess so!

101
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:09,096
Pops, you've got to tie up loose ends.

102
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:13,296
"Kaga Yuzen Traditional Industry Centre"

103
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,896
Clothes make the person.

104
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:35,096
You look nice!

105
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:37,396
It suits you very well.

106
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,296
Really?

107
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,796
Your wristwatch is nice too, Ms. Akiyama!

108
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:45,396
How fashionable to be wearing a large men's watch.

109
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:47,596
This...

110
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,096
This is not fashion, but rather,

111
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:51,196
a hand-me-down of my older brother.

112
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:54,296
I actually want something more feminine,

113
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:56,896
but I can't afford it.

114
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:59,096
Thank you very much.

115
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,896
This is the code for the next checkpoint.

116
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:04,296
And, at this point,

117
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:08,396
the first clue to the case would be given to you.

118
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:09,696
I see.

119
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:10,996
I understand.

120
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:14,196
Let's see. The next code is...

121
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:18,596
So and so experience?

122
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:21,796
All I have to do is put four letters in the circles?

123
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,096
Free experience.

124
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:26,196
Jump experience.

125
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:28,396
PSYE experience?

126
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:30,796
Come on, Dad!

127
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:32,996
I got it!

128
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:35,596
Four circles, stands for "wagashi"

129
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:38,096
is a homonym for which means Japanese sweets.

130
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:39,596
I see!

131
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:42,996
In other words, experiencing Japanese sweets?

132
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:46,696
Found it. The Ishikawa Prefecture Tourist Centre!

133
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,096
Correct.

134
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:50,296
Well done, sonny!

135
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,896
No room for the great detective, eh!

136
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:56,596
You can say that again.

137
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:02,796
You guys, show a bit of consideration, will you?

138
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:04,796
You're making me lose face!

139
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:06,696
But...

140
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:11,696
Thief!

141
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:23,396
Darn it. You'll pay for this!

142
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:30,096
Idiot.

143
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:35,696
Are you all right, Miss?

144
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:38,296
Yes. Thank you very much.

145
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,896
You're a lifesaver!

146
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:43,496
Thank you so much.

147
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,796
Are you all right, Mr. Mouri?

148
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:47,496
Yes. Of course.

149
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:50,296
What an insolent fellow, though.

150
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:53,296
The next time we find him, let's nab him.

151
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:57,296
Kanazawa is supposed to be a safe place, and yet...

152
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:01,496
Look this way.

153
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:04,696
I'll take your picture next!

154
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,796
It's just my imagination?

155
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:09,796
I feel somebody looking at me.

156
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:15,196
"Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Traditional Products"

157
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:20,596
"Handmade Japanese Sweets Experience"

158
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:39,496
"Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Traditional Arts and Crafts"

159
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:07,496
"Ishikawa Prefectural Art Museum"

160
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,496
Okay, smile.

161
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:17,096
Yes!

162
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:19,696
What? That couple again?

163
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,696
We sure run into each other.

164
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,096
Don't tell me.

165
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:35,396
Let's go have lunch at Omicho Market Place.

166
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:39,796
"Omicho Market Place"

167
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:50,296
I am now at Komatsu Hikiyama Exchange Hall Miyossa

168
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:54,896
-"Komatsu Hikiyama Exchange Hall Miyossa" -in Komatsu City!

169
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:59,796
What? Mr. Kuranishi and Ms. Akiyama, you're engaged?

170
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:00,796
Yes.

171
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:04,396
We're planning to get married some time next spring.

172
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:07,696
The same time the Hokuriku Bullet train will start running.

173
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:10,496
Well that sure is good news.

174
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,896
Sneaking behind my back, you lucky guy.

175
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,896
Well... Our company doesn't forbid

176
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:19,296
love relationships among employees, does it?

177
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:24,796
Ms. Miyazawa.

178
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:25,896
What is it?

179
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:29,596
Why are you carrying that heavy looking bag around all the time?

180
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,896
You should've left back on the bus.

181
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:34,296
Well... This is...

182
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,096
Is there something very important in it?

183
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,696
Hey, Conan!

184
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:43,496
It's rude to ask what's inside of woman's bag, you know?

185
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,096
Oh, I guess so.

186
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,096
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:48,396
It's okay.

188
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:52,996
Now for the next news.

189
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:54,596
On May 6, 2010,

190
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:58,096
the man suspected to attacked an elderly man who lived alone

191
00:12:58,096 --> 00:13:00,896
and robbed of five million yen in Kanazawa

192
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:05,696
was arrested yesterday after four years

193
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:08,796
According to the Ishikawa Police,

194
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:12,896
it seems that this man is denying all charges.

195
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:13,896
Based on the police investigation...

196
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:15,096
It's true that

197
00:13:15,096 --> 00:13:18,896
he doesn't look to be a bad person just by looking at his mug shot.

198
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:19,896
No...

199
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,496
Well, people who look that way,

200
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:23,796
turn out to be criminals most of the time.

201
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:26,696
But, if it turns out to be a false charge,

202
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:28,496
it's no laughing matter, right?

203
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:31,896
That person's life would be ruined.

204
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:37,496
What's wrong, Ms. Akiyama?

205
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:39,796
What?

206
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:41,796
Are you all right?

207
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:44,496
Yes. It's nothing.

208
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:03,777
This is good!

209
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:07,377
It goes great with liquor!

210
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,277
What's wrong, Conan?

211
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:13,777
What?

212
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:17,577
I was just thinking they're so many delicious things around.

213
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:20,277
True.

214
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,877
That couple doesn't seem to be around.

215
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,477
Did you search carefully?

216
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:29,477
Yes. But, I couldn't find it.

217
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:33,177
I must've dropped it somewhere.

218
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:35,477
Is something wrong?

219
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:36,777
Yes.

220
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:40,377
Ms. Akiyama seems to have lost the code card.

221
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:41,477
Come to think of it,

222
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:45,777
we still weren't given the code card for the next checkpoint.

223
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:48,277
But, I remember the code!

224
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:51,077
I'll make a new one right away so no worry.

225
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:52,177
Gosh.

226
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:56,777
I'm sorry...

227
00:14:56,777 --> 00:15:00,477
Mr. Mouri, I'm sorry it's handwritten.

228
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:04,777
This is the code for the next checkpoint.

229
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:05,877
Let's see...

230
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:10,077
I won't show it to you guys anymore.

231
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:13,877
One zero.

232
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:16,877
One thousand. Fifty. Ten.

233
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:20,077
Ten (To), five (go), six (ro).

234
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:23,077
Hey, Ran, give me the guidebook.

235
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,377
Here it is!

236
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:31,077
The number 1056 stands for Togoro!

237
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:33,477
G stands for gold!

238
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:35,677
And the sword stands for ken in Kenroku-en.

239
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:39,577
In other words, it refers to the Kinjo Reitaku in Keroku-en.

240
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:41,177
Correct.

241
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:43,477
Fantastic, Dad.

242
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:45,177
Bull's eye.

243
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:49,077
Pop's getting the hang of it.

244
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:52,377
Well... That's how I do it.

245
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:57,377
But, who is Togoro?

246
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,777
-"Kanazawa Shrine" -Long ago,

247
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:01,377
a man called Yam Digger, Togoro,

248
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,577
found alluvial gold while washing yams

249
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:06,977
-"Kinjo Reitaku Well" -at this mountain stream.

250
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:09,677
Because of this, it became known as Mountain stream where gold is washed.

251
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,077
Thus, the name, Kanazawa.

252
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:17,277
That's why the code was Togoro and gold.

253
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,377
It's amazing you knew, Dad.

254
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:23,677
It's common sense for any adult to know.

255
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:26,577
Then, let's head off to Kenroku-en.

256
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:30,277
Akiyama and I have some arrangements to make so.

257
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:31,577
We'll join you later.

258
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:33,377
Same here.

259
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:37,177
Kuranishi, you mean you want to stay around her that much?

260
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:38,477
It's not that!

261
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:41,477
I don't mix work up with love!

262
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:47,577
"Kenroku-en"

263
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:17,577
This is the next code.

264
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,877
What's this?

265
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:22,377
Next, it's deciphering by pictures?

266
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,477
I guess Pops is done for it, this time.

267
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:32,677
A rhombus and that seems to be an arrowhead.

268
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:37,477
A rhombus, an arrowhead, and a saddle.

269
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:40,377
Hishiyagura Turret can be found at the Kanazawa Castle!

270
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:41,477
True!

271
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,877
There's a place called Hishiyagura at the Kanazawa Castle!

272
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,477
Correct.

273
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:48,877
Really?

274
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:52,277
The Kanazawa Castle's just within a stone's throw.

275
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:55,777
"Kanazawa Castle"

276
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,577
Here's the next code card.

277
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:19,777
This will be the last one.

278
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:21,577
No, Ms. Akiyama!

279
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:23,177
It not the last one yet.

280
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:26,177
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

281
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:29,677
No problem. It's okay.

282
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:32,377
Don't you notice something?

283
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:37,177
This one's quite simple.

284
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:40,277
24 minus 3 is 21, right?

285
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:41,977
Twenty one.

286
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:45,477
The 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa!

287
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:47,377
Correct.

288
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,377
There wasn't anything to notice.

289
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:52,077
It's just simple subtraction.

290
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:55,477
He's right. It's a bit too easy, don't you think?

291
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:59,277
I'm sorry, I couldn't think of anything else.

292
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:01,377
We're a bit pressed for time

293
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:04,377
so let's head to The 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa.

294
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,677
You'll pay for what you did!

295
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:11,577
How dare you get in my way?

296
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:19,377
You're the thief I saw a while ago!

297
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:24,377
-Hold it! -Are you okay, Mr. Mouri?

298
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:25,677
Please move.

299
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:29,377
Hold it!

300
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,777
Wait!

301
00:19:40,477 --> 00:19:41,477
Wait!

302
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:44,477
Hey. Wait.

303
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,277
Hold it!

304
00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:53,377
Please wait!

305
00:19:57,777 --> 00:20:00,477
What's wrong, Conan?

306
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:01,677
It hurts.

307
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:05,077
You didn't tell me that he was that strong, Ms. Miyazawa.

308
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:09,277
Hey! I said hold it!

309
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:10,477
What?

310
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,977
What the heck?

311
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:17,677
There's another one hiding there too.

312
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:23,777
You're the one who had your handbag snatched a while ago, right?

313
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:28,177
But, what does Ms. Miyazawa have to do the victim and the thief?

314
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:31,477
In other words, this was all an act, right?

315
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:34,677
So, the couple over there was filming us from outside,

316
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:40,477
while Ms. Miyazawa was filming us from inside her bag.

317
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:44,877
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:48,877
This was actually candid camera for advertising the event.

319
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:50,877
Candid camera?

320
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:52,077
Yes.

321
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:55,877
The couple here is the cameraman and his assistant.

322
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:58,077
The thief and woman over there

323
00:20:58,077 --> 00:21:02,777
are actors who were hired to act out coincidental occurrences.

324
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:07,677
And, Ms. Akiyama and I were secretly filming all of you.

325
00:21:07,677 --> 00:21:09,377
Ms. Akiyama too?

326
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:11,977
Mr. Mouri, we've been looking for.

327
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:14,977
I'm sorry. They found out.

328
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:19,477
What's going on?

329
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:20,977
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:20,977 --> 00:21:22,877
I'll explain the details,

331
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:25,477
so let's head back.

332
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,377
Akiyama.

333
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:37,577
Harumi?

334
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:40,477
Harumi.

335
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:43,177
Hurry! Please call an ambulance!

336
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,277
Okay!

337
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:46,177
Hey, don't film this!

338
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:48,577
This is not an act. It's for real.

339
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:49,777
What?

340
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,877
It's not candid camera.

341
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,377
Then, why was Ms. Akiyama?

342
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:03,677
It doesn't look to be a robbery.

343
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:06,377
If this was the doing of a spree killer killing at random,

344
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:09,377
it's strange that there aren't any other victims.

345
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:14,677
Then, the killer specifically went after Ms. Akiyama.

346
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:21,577
Just what is the meaning of this?

347
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:48,577
Ran, you go.

348
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,277
But...

349
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:53,577
If you get too flustered, you'll look even more suspicious.

350
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:55,277
Hey, hey.

351
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:58,377
These card that fell out of Ms. Akiyama's bag.

352
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:03,077
I see. So, that's the story.

353
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,177
That's why to keep anyone from fleeing, Ran was sent over instead.

354
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:10,377
Next Conan,

355
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:14,777
