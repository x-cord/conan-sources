1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,720
We've come to visit the Tori no Ichi at the Ranburi Shrine.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,520
Ran and Sonoko wanted to come

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,220
to choose an oracle that tells fortunes of love, called the Lovely Oracle.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,620
However, the Lovely Oracle

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,020
was not the only thing that appeared at Tori no Ichi.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,320
A purse snatcher wearing a funny face mask,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,420
called the Rooster Man also appeared.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,820
Sonoko's bag is also snatched away by this culprit.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,320
We visited the Ranburi Shrine again during San no Tori.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
But, there again, Rooster Man appears,

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
stabs a university student named Mr. Shiro Masuko and wounds him.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,020
Just before passing out,

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,120
Mr. Masuko says, "It's not a rooster, but a monkey"

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
and used fingers of both his hands to indicate the number 9.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,920
What on earth does this mean?

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,620
There were three men in the toilet

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,920
that Rooster Man locked himself up in.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,320
Mr. Tatsuo Hino,

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
Mr. Hisami Sarukawa,

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,020
or Mr. Shinji Mizunoe?

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,820
Is Rooster Man among the three men?

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,720
We find out that the button that is found in Ran's coin purse

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,220
may be something that Rooster Man had dropped

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,420
when he bumped into Ran at the previous Tori no Ichi.

25
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,020
So, the houses of the three men were investigated.

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,820
But it looks like this case

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
is not going to be solved as easily it was first thought to be.

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,620
Brooding over passing seasons

29
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,720
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
A mysterious shadow closes in on Ran.

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,120
The 9 monkeys and Rooster Man mystery is finally solved.

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,520
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,320
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,420
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

35
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:19,154
"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 2)"

36
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:25,354
What? You couldn't find it?

37
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:26,554
You mean you couldn't find the clothes

38
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:29,154
that the button came off from in the houses of the three?

39
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:31,154
No. Although it seems they just took a quick look

40
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:33,754
because no search warrant was issued.

41
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,054
It seems that there were no clothes

42
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:37,454
with the same type of button on them either.

43
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:40,854
We asked the family members of the three too,

44
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,054
but it seems that there were no clothes that suddenly disappeared either.

45
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:45,154
It's highly unlikely that the button

46
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:48,054
was disposed of after the crime either then.

47
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,354
Yes. So maybe the button that Ran picked up

48
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:53,654
was something that just happened to be there.

49
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:56,054
Oh. Is that so?

50
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:58,954
By the way, we asked the family members

51
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:01,254
and found that on the day of Ichi no Tori,

52
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,954
Mr. Hino was on a trip to Sendai with his family.

53
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,854
Mr. Sarukawa has an alibi during Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori,

54
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:09,054
both at the time the crime was committed.

55
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:11,454
Mr. Mizunoe seems to have been

56
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,654
on a business trip to Nagasaki on the day of Ni no Tori.

57
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,454
In addition, at Ichi no Tori when he was attacked by Rooster Man,

58
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,954
he seems to have filed a complaint at the police.

59
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:21,154
I see.

60
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:22,954
Which means that be it at Ichi no Tori,

61
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:26,054
Ni no Tori or San no tori, none of the men

62
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:29,154
among the three could've committed the crime.

63
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:33,054
By the way, we got a call from the hospital just a while ago

64
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:36,554
saying that Mr. Shiro Masuko had regained consciousness.

65
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:40,254
-And? -It seems that he's saying that he has no recollection

66
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:41,854
of being stabbed by Rooster Man

67
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:44,054
or having said anything about a monkey or the number 9.

68
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:46,354
I see.

69
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:49,654
He doesn't remember? What does that mean?

70
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,254
Inspector! I found it!

71
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:54,054
Mr. Mizunoe's bank account

72
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:55,554
was found inside Rooster Man's knapsack!

73
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:57,054
You found it?

74
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:01,154
Yes! That bank book was in somebody else's bag,

75
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:03,054
so it took a while for us to confirm it.

76
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,354
Somebody else's bag?

77
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:07,554
Yes. We had the people who were attacked

78
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:11,154
at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori confirm whether it was their bags or not.

79
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:13,754
But since the contents were all out of sorts.

80
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:15,154
Come to think of it,

81
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:18,254
there was a handkerchief that I never saw inside my bag too.

82
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:21,154
The oracle that I'm sure I put inside the bag was gone too.

83
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,054
You're referring to that thing called the Lovely Oracle, aren't you?

84
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:25,754
I saw it in another bag.

85
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:29,754
Something about a nervous and old fashioned boyfriend.

86
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:33,554
Hey, you don't have to go revealing the contents!

87
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:36,654
Nervous and old fashioned type?

88
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:39,954
But I wonder why the contents were all messed up.

89
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:43,454
I'm sure Rooster Man took the contents of the bags

90
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:46,554
that he stole out and put them back again randomly.

91
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,954
And? Did the victims of Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori

92
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:53,154
confirm that it was their bags that was stolen by Rooster Man?

93
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:55,454
Yes, so there's no doubt

94
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:58,654
that the culprit of all three cases is the same person.

95
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,554
So, now everything is clear, isn't it?

96
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:01,654
Yeah.

97
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:05,454
It means that there's a liar among the onlookers here

98
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:08,154
passing around rumors that Rooster Man ran into the toilet.

99
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:10,054
True.

100
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:14,054
Because there seems to be no one

101
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:18,354
among us who could've visited all three festivals.

102
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,354
Okay then, I guess we get to go.

103
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:21,554
It's okay, isn't it?

104
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:23,954
I'm sure my wife is worried to so.

105
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:26,954
Yes. I guess so, for today.

106
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,654
Move.

107
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:32,354
Move it, I said!

108
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:33,854
Strange.

109
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,554
I guess the contents of the bags that were stolen

110
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:37,754
being all messed up isn't much of a problem,

111
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:41,454
but why was he carrying something like that around?

112
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:42,954
If he were caught with it,

113
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,054
he wouldn't be able to get away with it,

114
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,154
since it would serve as proof against him.

115
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:47,354
The reactions of the three

116
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:49,454
when Ran said that she had found the button

117
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:52,254
that may belong to Rooster Man also bother me.

118
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:54,554
If Rooster Man was among them,

119
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,454
even if the button didn't come off,

120
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:57,654
just the thought that it may have,

121
00:06:57,654 --> 00:07:00,054
should've thrown him into panic.

122
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,954
It normally would make him cold sweat and panic.

123
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:10,354
I see. He ran and perspired,

124
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:12,554
so that he could distract everyone from the fact

125
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:14,254
that he was perspiring from panic.

126
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:17,454
Wait a sec. Even if he were the culprit,

127
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:21,854
he couldn't have gone to all three festivals that were held?

128
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:23,554
If so, there has to be somebody

129
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:26,954
other than him who is Rooster Man,

130
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,854
but the knapsack had things

131
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,754
that were stolen from all three festivals inside it.

132
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:36,354
Besides, what does monkey and the number 9 mean?

133
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:38,754
What on earth does it mean?

134
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:42,654
What's the matter, Conan? Why that dreadfully serious look?

135
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:46,654
Yep. I was just wondering what monkey and the number 9 mean.

136
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,054
Monkey and 9 (Saru and Kyu).

137
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,554
Dad, what brings you here?

138
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,354
I heard that Rooster Man appeared again

139
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:55,954
and that you guys came to,

140
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:58,654
so I got worried and came to pick you up.

141
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:00,654
It was big news on TV

142
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,954
that the guy who was stabbed

143
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:05,754
left a mysterious message of monkey and the number 9 behind.

144
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,954
What the word "kyu" brings to mind for me is...

145
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:13,554
kyukancho (myna bird), kyukyusha (ambulance),

146
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:17,354
takkyu (table tennis) or yakyu (baseball)!

147
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:22,254
But, I don't recall any baseball ground with the word Saru in it.

148
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:26,954
Talking of baseball grounds, the Koshien Kyujo,

149
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,454
what is it called Koshien (monkey-child-park)?

150
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:32,354
Was there a place called Koshien in that area?

151
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:35,254
Yes, there is! Like Koshien Station.

152
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:36,454
No.

153
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:38,154
The name of the place was named what it is now,

154
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:40,354
after the Koshien Baseball Park was made there.

155
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,254
And the year the Koshien Baseball Park was built is...

156
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:47,454
What about the year it was built?

157
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:50,054
I see. So, that's what it was...

158
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:53,054
The victim knew the culprit.

159
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:55,154
That's why he referred to the 9th monkey.

160
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:58,354
Okay, let's go home!

161
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:01,854
Oh, I forgot!

162
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:05,054
I've got to go pick up my laundry at the cleaners before I go home.

163
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:08,054
Dad, will you go on ahead and take Conan and Sonoko home!

164
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:11,154
You can go pick it up tomorrow!

165
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:14,854
You're attending a friend's wedding tomorrow, aren't you, Dad?

166
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:37,854
Where's the cleaners?

167
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:47,354
Hey, ole man, you bump into us,

168
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,754
and think you can get away just walking off like that?

169
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,054
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:54,254
If you really feel bad about it, give us your wallet.

171
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:55,654
What?

172
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:57,754
Don't worry!

173
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,254
All we're taking from you is enough to go drinking!

174
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:03,154
If you mug him, I'm calling the police!

175
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,654
Hey lady, you're punky, aren't you?

176
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,554
You're pretty cute too.

177
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:11,854
You wanna come play with us?

178
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:14,854
Those punks.

179
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:18,354
In order to capture that heart of a nervous and old-fashioned type like him,

180
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:21,354
it's best to be a Japanese woman with all the traditional graces.

181
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,954
Tomboys and girls that prefer flashy fashion are a no-no!

182
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:28,154
Stay graceful and refined.

183
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:32,954
It will surely bring you closer together.

184
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:36,054
I'm just saying that committing a crime is not good.

185
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:38,454
What's with her?

186
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:41,454
What is it? What's going on? Is it a fight?

187
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,654
-Hey, let's get out of here -Yeah.

188
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,054
Take care!

189
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:54,354
Thank you! You're a lifesaver!

190
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,154
Not at all.

191
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,654
Acting like a tomboy is a no, no!

192
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:01,054
I've got to stay gracefully refined.

193
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:07,454
What? You've found out who Rooster Man is?

194
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:10,254
Which means, you've figured out the meaning of the word monkey

195
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:13,254
and number 9 that the university student who was stabbed remarked of?

196
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:15,954
Yep. The man who was stabbed

197
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,554
knew the man who stabbed him!

198
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:21,654
That's why he said, "He's not a rooster, but a monkey",

199
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,754
and showed nine of his fingers.

200
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:25,354
Then, it's that man

201
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:27,054
that has a monkey looking face called Tatsuo Hino, right?

202
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,354
If they knew each other,

203
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,454
he would know the face of the one who stabbed him, wouldn't he?

204
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:32,754
But, he has nothing to do with the number 9, does he?

205
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:35,854
Then, is it the man called Hisami Sarukawa?

206
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,054
His nickname seems to be Kyu-chan too.

207
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:40,554
Besides if he was close enough to know the nickname of the culprit.

208
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:41,654
I'm sure he would've mentioned the nickname

209
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:44,854
and directly say that the culprit is Sarukawa.

210
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:49,054
But the only one left is Shinji Mizunoe then?

211
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:51,854
What's monkey and number 9 about him?

212
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:54,654
The character "tori" that is used for Tori no Ichi refers to the "tori"

213
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,554
as know in the twelve horary signs of the lunar calendar, right?

214
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:57,754
So what about the monkey character?

215
00:11:57,754 --> 00:12:00,254
Well...

216
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,754
The character "shin" is the character

217
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,954
used in the name of Shinji Mizunoe.

218
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:07,754
But, what about the number 9?

219
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:11,654
I just talked about the Koshien Baseball grounds just now, didn't I?

220
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,554
It was named "Koshien" because it was built

221
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:17,854
in 1924, the year of the monkey,

222
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:20,354
the animal sign that indicates that year.

223
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:22,354
The year of the monkey?

224
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:24,654
The sexagenary cycle!

225
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:28,854
Ko, Otsu, Hei, Tei, Bo, Ki, Ko, Shin,

226
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:31,254
Jin, Ki, the 10 celestial stems.

227
00:12:31,254 --> 00:12:33,954
And the twelve branches, Shi, Chu, In, Bo, Shin,

228
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:39,354
Shi, Go, Bi, Shin, Yu, Jutsu, and Gai combined,

229
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:43,654
make up the sexagenary cycle that makes one round every 60 years.

230
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:45,654
Therefore, the word "koshi"

231
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:48,054
is the celestial stem "ko" and "shi" of the branch combined,

232
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:51,654
so it is the first year of the 60 year cycle!

233
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:53,854
That's why the baseball stadium was named Koshien,

234
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:55,954
because it was built that year.

235
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:58,554
Then what is the 9th year?

236
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,754
The 9th is

237
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:03,354
Koshi, Otchu, Heiin,

238
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:07,454
Teibo, Boshin, Kishi, Kogo, Shinbi, and

239
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,854
Jinshin.

240
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,154
You mean like in the Jinshin War!

241
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:14,754
You can say it in other Japanese reading form, too, can't you?

242
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:16,954
Like in "Hinoeuma".

243
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:20,854
The other way of reading for Jinshin is...

244
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,654
Mizunoe, saru...

245
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:25,454
Mizunoe? Shinji Mizunoe!

246
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:27,154
It's literally what it is!

247
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:30,154
As proof of that, the man called Mizunoe,

248
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:32,254
attempted to show us the receipt he received

249
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,054
at the convenience store, but didn't, right?

250
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:37,554
That's because when he was fleeing disguised as Rooster Man,

251
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:41,654
the receipt that was in the pocket of his pants got wet from perspiration!

252
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,654
And if he shows a wet receipt,

253
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:46,354
the fact that he ran would be disclosed!

254
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:48,554
The only things that were disposed of in the tool closet

255
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:51,354
in the restroom that Rooster Man took flight into

256
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:52,854
were the murder weapon knife,

257
00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:56,554
a down jacket and the mask of a funny face!

258
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:57,954
I see.

259
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:00,654
He had everything ready beforehand, except for his pants,

260
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:03,054
which he didn't have any change for.

261
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,254
But, wait!

262
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:08,254
Didn't Officer Takagi say that Mizunoe was on a business trip

263
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,154
and didn't go to the Ni no Tori?

264
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:13,554
Besides, his bag was stolen by Rooster Man at Ichi no Tori

265
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:15,054
and he even filed a complaint

266
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,254
for stolen items at the police too, right?

267
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:18,654
That's right.

268
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:21,654
Because the Rooster Man who stabbed Mr. Masuko today

269
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,854
at San no Tori was that man called Mizunoe,

270
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:26,454
but Rooster Man who appeared at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori

271
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,654
was Mr. Masuko!

272
00:14:29,654 --> 00:14:33,854
It's most likely that Mr. Masuko was threatening Mr. Mizunoe

273
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:35,354
because of the bank book

274
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:38,154
that was in the bag that Mr. Masuko stole from him.

275
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:40,554
He was probably threatened because of dirty money or embezzlement.

276
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:44,254
Masuko most likely demanded cash to keep his mouth shut.

277
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:45,854
You're saying that Mr. Masuko

278
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,354
deliberately put all the things he stole

279
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,554
at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori in the knapsack

280
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:50,954
and brought it along with him?

281
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:54,154
Yeah. Mizunoe probably told him

282
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:57,454
to bring the bank book as well as everything

283
00:14:57,454 --> 00:15:01,254
that he had stolen up to now

284
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,554
when coming to make the deal!

285
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,454
He then stabbed Mr. Masuko who came along,

286
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:08,054
left the stolen items behind

287
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:10,954
and disguise himself as Rooster Man, then fled.

288
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:12,854
Since he has an alibi when it comes to Ni no Tori,

289
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:14,454
he wouldn't be suspected.

290
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:17,254
I see! Since Mr. Masuko who was stabbed back then,

291
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:19,854
was aiming to be a literature major,

292
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:21,254
and all that was written on the bank book

293
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,654
were the name and address of the culprit,

294
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:25,554
the word monkey and the number 9 crossed his mind!

295
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:27,354
So, maybe he said that

296
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:28,554
he didn't remember anything

297
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,454
after regaining consciousness at the hospital because...

298
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,454
When he was stabbed, he was probably so vexed

299
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:37,354
that he left behind the word monkey and number 9 that indicated the culprit.

300
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,454
But, after calming down and thinking it over,

301
00:15:40,454 --> 00:15:42,854
he realized that if people found out what he meant,

302
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:45,354
it would reveal that he is in fact Rooster Man.

303
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:47,854
So he decided to not say anything.

304
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:50,654
But there's no proof.

305
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:52,754
It would be great is somebody would pick up the things

306
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:56,254
that Rooster Man dropped.

307
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:59,054
Right! The button that Ran picked up at Ni no Tori

308
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:01,254
after Rooster Man bumped into her!

309
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:04,754
If clothes missing that button is found in Mr. Masuko's house,

310
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:07,754
then it would serve as proof, right?

311
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:10,754
Because Rooster Man that appeared at Ni no Tori is Mr. Masuko.

312
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:13,554
Well, if the guy Masuko confesses

313
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,354
and spits it out about Mizunoe,

314
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:16,854
then the case will be closed.

315
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:20,654
You're both great with deduction!

316
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:23,654
Just as would be expected of the Deduction Queen and Sleeping Kogoro!

317
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:25,054
Oh, well...

318
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,154
Piece of cake!

319
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,054
But somehow...

320
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,254
It does feel like something's not right.

321
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:33,054
At any rate, let's tell Officer Takagi

322
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:34,354
and the others about the button

323
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,954
and have them check on it!

324
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,454
On whether or not clothes missing that button

325
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:40,754
is in Mr. Masuko's house!

326
00:16:54,454 --> 00:16:57,954
Maybe I sent a little too much out to the cleaners.

327
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:14,171
What? You gave the button back to Ran?

328
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:16,471
Why? It's evidence, isn't it?

329
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:21,171
Oh, no. Back then, it wasn't determined as evidence yet.

330
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,871
And she said that it could have fallen off her father's clothes,

331
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:26,571
so that she wanted to take it home and check on it.

332
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:29,571
Hey, you'd better be sure that the guy called Mizunoe

333
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:33,271
is not going to attack Ran because he wants to get rid of the button.

334
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:35,471
Ran will be okay!

335
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,371
She's strong.

336
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,271
Something's wrong.

337
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:41,271
Ran's not answering the phone since a while ago.

338
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:43,871
-What? -What?

339
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,171
Wallet...

340
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:58,071
There... Here it is.

341
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,271
So long as I get rid of the button,

342
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:05,371
there's no danger of me being suspected anymore.

343
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:08,371
Mr. Mizunoe?

344
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,971
Is it you?

345
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:12,371
Oh, that button!

346
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:14,371
Yeah, that's right.

347
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,871
This is from the guy I failed to kill today.

348
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:20,771
The button that belongs to Rooster Man.

349
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:22,771
Rooster Man that you failed to kill.

350
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:25,771
Wasn't that man stabbed by Rooster Man?

351
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,971
That's why I'm telling you that university student was Rooster Man!

352
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:31,371
What?

353
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:36,071
That punk. He saw the bank book that he stole from me

354
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:40,171
and realized that I'm embezzling money from my company.

355
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,971
Well, it's strange that nobody

356
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:45,671
noticed that the same amount of money

357
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,271
was being deposited to my account every month

358
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:52,671
that belonged to a company that doesn't even exist.

359
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:56,571
That guy had the nerve to say

360
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,171
that he'd give me back my bank book

361
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,671
but he didn't know which bag was mine.

362
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:02,771
That's why I told him

363
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:06,671
to bring everything he stole up to now so I can check for myself.

364
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:10,571
That's why I disguised myself as Rooster Man just today.

365
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:12,871
Too bad, it seems that he made it through.

366
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:15,371
But, I don't think he'll talk,

367
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:18,071
because he's a chicken that was saying

368
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:21,771
that he stole to relieve the stress of having to study for his exam.

369
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,871
Don't you think it's strange?

370
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:30,771
Why do you think I'm talking my head off like this?

371
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:38,271
Miss, it's because you're going to have to die.

372
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:42,871
Right here and now.

373
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:49,371
Ran...

374
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:53,571
I think you should turn yourself in.

375
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:57,671
Nobody's dead yet.

376
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,271
But, if you keep on adding to your crime...

377
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:04,571
Begging for your life? Yeah, I guess you don't want to die.

378
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:08,071
You probably haven't fell in and out of love much yet.

379
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:13,871
And, I found a Lovely fortune oracle still sealed in your wallet too.

380
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:16,271
Still sealed?

381
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:18,371
Don't tell me that Sonoko...

382
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,771
She snatched the Lovely Fortune oracle from me back then

383
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,371
and feigned reading it,

384
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:26,971
but maybe she read her own oracle and not mine.

385
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:31,571
I guess I'll read it for you as a gift to you before you go to Hades.

386
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:38,471
In order to grab the heart of an intelligent boy like him,

387
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,671
it's best to be yourself.

388
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,671
Beware because he'll see right through you

389
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:47,071
if you try to adorn yourself or act like a cutie-pie!

390
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:50,371
Go through with the natural openness that you possess.

391
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:54,171
Believe in yourself and push on forward,

392
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:58,571
then your feelings for him will surely reach him.

393
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:59,871
So it says!

394
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:26,171
Ran...

395
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:00,371
We didn't have to worry after all.

396
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:03,771
What was that flashy technique you just struck?

397
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:06,071
Torso spin kick!

398
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:09,271
Kazumi, my senior taught it to me the other day!

399
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,971
Oh, I see.

400
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:14,671
Oh, he's the real culprit and...

401
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:16,871
Yes, we know!

402
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:20,771
But, Ran! Wasn't tomboyish actions a no, no?

403
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:23,171
That's what your oracle said, right?

404
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:25,071
Mine said...

405
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,471
In order to grab the heart of an intelligent boy like him,

406
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:32,671
it's best to be yourself.

407
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,171
Beware because he'll see right through you

408
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:36,871
if you try to adorn yourself or act like a cutie-pie!

409
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:39,871
Go through with the natural openness that you possess.

410
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:43,171
Believe in yourself and push on forward,

411
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,071
then your feelings for him will surely reach him!

412
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,771
I like this!

413
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,671
Change it with mine, will you!

414
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,271
No way!

415
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:55,571
Well, I guess it just goes to show that women have to be strong!

416
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:59,871
You're too strong.

417
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:06,271
Delicious! Fantastic!

418
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:07,871
Mr. Miyake!

419
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:11,671
This is a selection of the 7 wonders.

420
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:15,171
Those two, I'm sure they're somehow involved.

421
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:18,471
Mr. Koshiji?

422
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:20,871
There are three more 7 wonders left.

423
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:22,971
Is something more going to happen?

424
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:25,171
Besides, what's with that man?

425
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:27,571
Next Conan,

426
00:24:27,571 --> 00:24:31,771
"Hiroshima, Miyajima 7 Wonders Tour (Miyajima Edition)"

427
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,971
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:51,671
"Fire"

429
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:53,771
The next episode is about a mystery tour to Hiroshima.

430
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:55,071
It's snacks with beer!

431
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,571
I thought so.
