00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:04,330
Ten years ago while visiting the beach with my family,

2
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:06,231
I met another family.

3
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:11,731
While there, I got caught up in a car accident.

4
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,430
Anyway, is it true

5
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:19,330
that there was another person in the car?

6
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:21,731
That's what he said.

7
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,730
What proof do you have?

8
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:28,030
I simply thought there was another person

9
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:31,231
since the passenger window was open all the way.

10
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:34,330
The driver's seat was on the right side.

11
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:36,130
If there's only one person were in the car,

12
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:40,030
it would be strange for only the passenger window to be open.

13
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:43,930
So they abandoned their friend

14
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:46,030
and fled alone.

15
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:47,031
No.

16
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:50,630
This man wasn't wearing his seat belt at the time of the accident.

17
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:52,130
What?

18
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:55,030
He struck his head on the windshield

19
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:57,130
when the car crashed into the guardrail.

20
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,930
It broke his cervical vertebrae,

21
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:03,130
killing him instantly.

22
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:07,830
It's probably safe to assume the passenger determined he was dead

23
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:09,930
when they received no response after calling out to him,

24
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:14,230
so they decided to escape on their own.

25
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:18,430
But why would they pretend to be one of the crowd here?

26
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:22,330
If they were a victim of an accident, they wouldn't need to hide.

27
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:24,430
Probably because

28
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:30,030
there was a reason they had

29
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,431
to conceal themselves.

30
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,430
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

31
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,830
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

32
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:42,030
The family on the beach and the car's fall

33
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:44,130
are both deeply shrouded in mystery!

34
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:45,730
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,630
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:50,231
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:35,492
"The Magician of the Waves (Part 2)"

38
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,891
A reason to conceal themselves?

39
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:51,891
Was there a robbery at a store

40
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:54,192
that sells watches in this area?

41
00:03:55,892 --> 00:04:00,691
We did receive a report about an hour ago that two thieves

42
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:04,691
entered a watchmaker's shop about a kilometer from here.

43
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,391
How do you know about an incident

44
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:09,291
that hasn't been reported by the news yet?

45
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:13,091
There was a bag in the back seat of the sunken car.

46
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:17,491
It was packed full of brand-name watches

47
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:19,691
with their price tags still on them.

48
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,691
They could have been wholesalers

49
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,291
making a delivery.

50
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,791
Then they would've put them in plastic bags or boxes

51
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,591
so they wouldn't get damaged.

52
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:33,291
Only a thief concerned with stealing the watches

53
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:37,891
and escaping would so casually stuff them into a bag.

54
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:43,491
Did anyone see the faces of the thieves?

55
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,891
No. They were both wearing ski masks.

56
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:50,491
Based on their voices, we know one was a man,

57
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:54,191
but we don't know the gender of the other.

58
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,192
I see.

59
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:56,792
Hey, Mr. Pierrot!

60
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,791
I brought all the customers

61
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:03,591
who went shopping after the car fell into the ocean.

62
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:04,891
You're sure, right?

63
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:06,491
Yes.

64
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:10,191
This chubby man bought a T-shirt and swim trunks.

65
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:13,091
This woman bought sandals.

66
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:17,391
And this lanky guy bought a Hawaiian shirt.

67
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:20,491
What's the big deal, anyway?

68
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:25,191
It seems this man who was driving the car

69
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,191
that fell into the water had someone with him.

70
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:32,792
I'll be questioning each of you.

71
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:41,691
"Shigekatsu Fukumizu (32)" -My name is Shigekatsu Fukumizu.

72
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:44,791
I came here with my girlfriend.

73
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,091
When she suddenly brought up marriage

74
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:49,891
while we were on a rubber boat,

75
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:54,391
I told her it was too soon.

76
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:56,791
So she pushed me into the ocean

77
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:59,591
and my clothes were soaked.

78
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,791
By the time I returned to the boat, she was gone.

79
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,592
Only my wallet remained.

80
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:09,191
So I took off my soaking clothes

81
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:12,392
and bought a T-shirt and swim trunks.

82
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,091
Where is your girlfriend now?

83
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:17,691
She was pretty angry,

84
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:20,791
so she probably took the car home without me.

85
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,891
It's her car.

86
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:24,691
Where's the rubber boat?

87
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:26,191
Who knows?

88
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:30,191
Bringing it home with me would be a pain, so I abandoned it.

89
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,792
Maybe it drifted away.

90
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,791
"Yasue Kitamori (27)" -Yasue Kitamori is my name.

91
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:44,091
I came here to pick up guys,

92
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,891
but couldn't find any good ones.

93
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:49,991
On top of that, the straps on my sandals broke,

94
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,391
so I bought some new ones and was on my way home.

95
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:56,291
Well, I did get to swim quite a bit.

96
00:06:56,292 --> 00:07:00,191
Where are the sandals with the broken strap?

97
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:03,591
I threw them away somewhere!

98
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:05,092
You're handsome.

99
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:11,891
How did you get here dressed like that?

100
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:14,391
I carried my wallet here and took a taxi.

101
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,791
I kept my wallet in a locker while swimming

102
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:20,591
and anything I needed could be bought here.

103
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:22,491
The less you're carrying,

104
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:26,192
the easier it is to go back to a guy's place.

105
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,591
You've got it all wrong!

106
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:33,091
Someone stole my bag!

107
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:36,191
"Raiya Oami (26)" -While I was showering after my swim,

108
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:39,491
someone took my bag!

109
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,791
That's why I'm only wearing a speedo.

110
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:43,891
I had no choice

111
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:47,591
but to buy a three thousand yen shirt from that beach hut.

112
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,091
They didn't take your wallet?

113
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:51,092
No.

114
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:53,891
I folded my wallet into my towel

115
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:56,991
while I was showering.

116
00:07:56,992 --> 00:08:00,491
Oami, why did you come here?

117
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:02,191
Huh?

118
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:04,291
To hit on women.

119
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:10,191
Do you use those watches you have on both wrists to hit on women?

120
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,491
Yes.

121
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:15,991
This one's on Japan time, and this one's on New York time.

122
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:17,192
Fashionable, right?

123
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:29,791
Come on, Yukiko.

124
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:34,191
I told you not to call since I'd be writing until dinner.

125
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:37,491
Go enjoy yourselves at the beach.

126
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:38,492
What?

127
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:44,091
A car fell at the beach and the driver's dead?

128
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:48,291
Apparently he was a thief.

129
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:53,391
His accomplice escaped from the sunken car

130
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:57,191
and they've blended in with the crowd on the beach.

131
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:59,291
If I send you photos of the three suspects,

132
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,591
can you tell me who did it?

133
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:02,592
I'm so curious.

134
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,191
She may be curious,

135
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,292
but I can't figure it out based on photos alone.

136
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:14,792
I see.

137
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:18,991
That's what I said!

138
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:24,292
Don't let anyone wet or wearing a swimsuit leave!

139
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:27,791
More people are leaving!

140
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,691
Masumi, that's enough.

141
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:32,092
Mom.

142
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:39,591
You know we can't get involved in a case.

143
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,092
It's not a problem.

144
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:44,891
Case closed.

145
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:48,192
All we have to do now is name the culprit.

146
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,091
Case...

147
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,792
Closed?

148
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,459
What? No way.

149
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,159
You know who did it?

150
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,659
But I only sent you photos of the three suspects.

151
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,859
Isn't that why you called me?

152
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,859
I thought I'd tell you more about the case

153
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,859
after I sent the photos.

154
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,459
Why don't you go ahead and tell me, then?

155
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,859
Okay.

156
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,259
I already told you that when the car fell into the ocean,

157
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,159
the driver died.

158
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,659
But the passenger escaped from the car,

159
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,959
and blended in with the crowd, right?

160
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,159
Yes. And that he's a thief.

161
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,959
The story was just posted online.

162
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,059
"Watchmaker Attacked! Robbers On The Run." -A watchmaker

163
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,259
was attacked by a pair of thieves,

164
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,959
and they're still on the run.

165
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
That's right.

166
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:58,059
We think one of them bought something

167
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,259
to pass themselves off as one of the crowd.

168
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,259
The three people who went shopping

169
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,759
at the beach hut after the car fell are our suspects.

170
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,159
The chubby man got soaked

171
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,259
when his girlfriend pushed him off a boat and into the ocean,

172
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,659
so he bought a T-shirt and swim trunks.

173
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,359
The young woman who came to pick up men

174
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,759
bought new sandals since the strap on hers broke.

175
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,059
The flashy guy who came to hit on women had his clothes stolen,

176
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,959
so he bought a three thousand yen Hawaiian shirt.

177
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,659
I see. I knew it.

178
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,659
Huh? Knew what?

179
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,159
The culprit is most likely the woman who bought the sandals...

180
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,359
The woman who bought the sandals...

181
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,159
Yasue Kitamori.

182
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,759
You were riding in the car that fell, weren't you?

183
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,359
What? No way.

184
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,959
Huh? Is it really that surprising?

185
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,259
Oh, no.

186
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,559
A young man on the beach just said the same thing.

187
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,459
Wait a minute.

188
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,459
How does buying sandals make me the culprit?

189
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,759
Look at how I'm dressed.

190
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,859
I obviously came here to swim.

191
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,859
Indeed.

192
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,560
If what you're wearing is actually a swimsuit, that is.

193
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,859
Are the clothes she's wearing not a swimsuit?

194
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,959
Probably not.

195
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,659
When she escaped from the sinking car,

196
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,559
she was wearing pants or a skirt.

197
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,759
She found herself on a public beach when she surfaced.

198
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,559
If she exited the water in what she was wearing,

199
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,759
she'd be exposed as the passenger in the car.

200
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,159
So in the water, she took off the pants or skirt she was wearing

201
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,159
and wrapped her scarf around her waist like a wrap-around.

202
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,159
Then she tied up the hem of her shirt

203
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,359
so she could pretend to be a swimmer.

204
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,060
But the other two guys could've done the same thing.

205
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,259
And the woman only bought sandals.

206
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,359
Actually, it's more accurate to say she could only buy sandals.

207
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,659
Why?

208
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,359
When she fell into the ocean,

209
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,159
her wallet was submerged and her bills got wet.

210
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,760
She could only use her change.

211
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,359
So I thought the woman who took off her wet shoes

212
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,259
and bought the sandals she could afford

213
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,360
with a single coin must be the culprit.

214
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,759
As you can see, unless you're right on the water's edge,

215
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,759
the sand's too hot to walk on barefoot.

216
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,559
She could've used her wet bills,

217
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,859
but the beach hut employees would've remembered someone like that.

218
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,759
And I doubt the beach hut accepts credit cards.

219
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,659
But she could've been wearing sandals

220
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,559
that are okay to get wet.

221
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,059
Did you forget?

222
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,060
There were thieves in the car.

223
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,059
On top of that, the robbery occurred just before the car fell.

224
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,859
If they were on the run,

225
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,159
it's hard to imagine she changed into sandals

226
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
that would be difficult to run in.

227
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,459
Right, Kitamori?

228
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,560
I'm sure that's a fake name, of course.

229
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,759
I see.

230
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,159
So the young man on the beach

231
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,559
is explaining exactly the same reasoning I told you.

232
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,659
How very interesting.

233
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,959
That's right.

234
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,459
Just like Sherlock Holmes would.

235
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,559
I can't see too well since he's wearing sunglasses,

236
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,959
but he seems pretty handsome, too.

237
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,260
Hey.

238
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,960
Anyway, how did you know?

239
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,559
You said you knew who did it

240
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,459
after only looking at the photos I sent you.

241
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,059
Oh, it was their watches.

242
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,459
Their watches?

243
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,559
Come to think of it, they were all wearing them.

244
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,759
The chubby man's watch was displaying 1:45.

245
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,459
The young man's watches both showed 2:00.

246
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,459
But the woman's watch was displaying 10:10.

247
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,259
That's one of the watches from the store that was robbed.

248
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,559
What? Isn't the woman's watch just broken?

249
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,259
I knew you're the thief, too.

250
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,760
You're wearing a watch you stole from the store.

251
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,059
What are you talking about, you brat?

252
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,059
Your watch is exactly like it was in the store.

253
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,359
Of course it is!

254
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,059
I bought it from a store!

255
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,660
But it's stopped at 10:10, right?

256
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,559
It probably broke when I went in the water.

257
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,059
What? You mean you don't know?

258
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,859
Watches sold in stores are generally stopped around 10:10,

259
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,860
so you can clearly see the name of the maker.

260
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,359
Is that true, Shinichi?

261
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Yes.

262
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,360
I asked my dad about it at the watch area in a department store.

263
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,159
Brand-name watches have serial numbers.

264
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,459
If we look it up,

265
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,460
we'll know if that watch was stolen.

266
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,959
I see.

267
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,660
That's how he knew.

268
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,659
That went well.

269
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,059
Yes, piece of cake.

270
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,359
Once we sell the watches,

271
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,859
should we head to a tropical island?

272
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,959
Hey, don't steal the goods.

273
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,859
Put that watch back in the bag.

274
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,860
Huh?

275
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:42,459
What are you talking about?

276
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,059
I bought this the other day.

277
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,459
What are you doing?

278
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,059
Stolen goods can be tracked.

279
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,559
Put it back.

280
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,759
Put it back!

281
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
Look in front of you!

282
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,860
We broke through the guardrail and fell into the sea.

283
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,160
This must be what it means to hit rock bottom.

284
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,560
"End Call"

285
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,060
Shuichi.

286
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,359
Aren't you finished?

287
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,559
Let's go.

288
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
Sure.

289
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,059
So, have you changed your mind?

290
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,759
You said something about joining the FBI earlier.

291
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,859
No.

292
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,659
My desire has only grown stronger.

293
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,559
Don't tell me finding the thief who blended in with the crowd

294
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,659
has gotten to your head.

295
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,859
I'd be lying if I said it hasn't,

296
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,759
but I've tasted the thrill of solving a mystery.

297
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,859
If things go well,

298
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,560
I might even find the people who killed my father.

299
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,159
I'm afraid, Brother.

300
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,359
You seem like you've been possessed.

301
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,459
I'm not possessed.

302
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,159
I'm afflicted.

303
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,559
Huh?

304
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,460
By a fever known as curiosity.

305
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,560
Tsutomu.

306
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,960
He really is his son.

307
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,359
Shuichi, I wanted you to return to Japan,

308
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,359
and be a father figure to Shukichi and Masumi,

309
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,160
but I've given up on that.

310
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,559
Go, Shuichi.

311
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,559
Let that fever drive you to clear

312
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,059
the mist obscuring the truth until you die.

313
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,559
But in exchange,

314
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,860
if you leave any haze behind, I won't forgive you.

315
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
That's what I always intended.

316
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,059
What's gotten into you, Mom?

317
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,259
You sound just like Dad.

318
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,860
It means starting today, I'm your father.

319
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,059
Hey.

320
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,959
The policeman's calling you.

321
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,560
He wants to ask you about the case again at the station.

322
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,859
I'll let you handle that.

323
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,659
You're the one who identified the truth about the watch.

324
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,260
That's right, but...

325
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:49,560
After all, you're the apprentice of my country's greatest detective.

326
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,659
Your country?

327
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,959
You're English?

328
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,359
Yes. Although I'm an American now.

329
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Anyway, did this case help you with your detective training?

330
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,359
Yes!

331
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,559
You were just like Holmes.

332
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,059
No way.

333
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,059
Holmes is even more amazing.

334
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:24,360
But I guess you're at least as good at Watson.

335
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,159
Dr. Watson, huh?

336
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,660
Great.

337
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,260
He smiled again.

338
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,460
See you later, Holmes's apprentice.

339
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,460
Hey, you.

340
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,260
You're a magician.

341
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,660
You're a magician...

342
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,960
You're a magician.

343
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,559
Huh? What?

344
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,659
Is there something on my face?

345
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,860
No.

346
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,959
Wait a minute.

347
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,459
Since Sera wore a swimsuit similar

348
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,459
to the one she wore ten years ago,

349
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,060
was she trying to help me remember that we met ten years ago?

350
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,159
Does that mean she knows I'm Shinichi Kudo,

351
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,359
transformed into a child by a drug?

352
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,159
And then there's the brother between Sera and Akai.

353
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,859
That must be Meijin Haneda.

354
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,859
They were calling him Shukichi.

355
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,659
No, more importantly,

356
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,660
the face of the woman Meijin Haneda called Mary.

357
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,759
She must be the same person

358
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,560
as the sister from another domain that Sera mentioned.

359
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,859
Was she given APTX 4869 just like I was?

360
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,459
When? Where? By whom?

361
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,459
Looks like you remembered me from ten years ago,

362
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,059
but you still don't know the real reason

363
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,060
why I call you a magician.

364
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,459
"Next Episode" -But why'd they send that to me?

365
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,659
At dawn this morning, an explosion occured

366
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,259
at pachinko parlor Sandcastle located in Beika City, Tokyo.

367
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,059
Since a hint pertaining to the bomb was written on it,

368
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,959
the suspect Hirukawa tore it up.

369
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,859
Which means there are still other bombs?

370
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,459
We found it!

371
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,259
It's inside a bag in a trash can!

372
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:12,260
