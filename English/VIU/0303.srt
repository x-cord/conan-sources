1
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:03,208
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:05,108
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:06,908
Is a case like this truly exists?

4
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:08,808
You can't recycle crime!

5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,208
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:12,408
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:14,809
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,196 --> 00:02:01,895
On that day, we set off to Akebono-cho

9
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:04,795
in order to arrest a serial thief.

10
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:08,195
Conan, let's catch the thief no matter what it takes, okay?

11
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:09,895
Yeah.

12
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,295
But...

13
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:13,995
Doesn't it feel a bit eerie?

14
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:17,695
To have other people take over and use what can still be used,

15
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,095
cherishing what limited resources we have,

16
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,796
I'd say it's a splendid arrangement.

17
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:26,295
Oh, you mean recycling.

18
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:30,995
But, you don't know who the stuff was being used by previously.

19
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:31,996
Right, Conan?

20
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:34,495
No need for worry, because there is nobody

21
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:38,195
who rubs snot on everything like you do, Genta.

22
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:40,695
You really do, Genta?

23
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,295
You rat!

24
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,895
What a thing to say?

25
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:46,696
Stop it, don't touch me!

26
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:49,895
Oh, there's the bus headed for Akebono-cho.

27
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:51,596
Oh, right!

28
00:02:55,696 --> 00:03:01,696
"The Victim Returns."

29
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,595
It sure is quiet.

30
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:11,895
There's nobody in sight.

31
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:15,295
Maybe that's why the thief targets this area.

32
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:18,995
If you see any suspicious looking people, be careful.

33
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:22,096
Geez, what the heck am I doing?

34
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:27,796
Is it that room?

35
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:30,696
Wait up, Conan!

36
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,596
What's going on?

37
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:39,295
Excuse me!

38
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,396
-Sorry for disturbing you... -Is this okay, Conan?

39
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:54,896
This is...

40
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:02,595
The cause of death is cerebral contusion

41
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:04,895
from being hit in the back of his head with a blunt object.

42
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,195
The estimated time of death

43
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:09,895
is between 14:00 to 15:00 yesterday.

44
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:14,196
She had nothing on her that would help us identify her.

45
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:18,995
Ms. Hosono, will you please explain in detail the condition

46
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:21,195
in which you found the corpse?

47
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:22,595
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,995
That sofa, is what I bought yesterday

49
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:29,396
at sundown at a recycle shop at Beika-cho.

50
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:34,895
And I had it delivered here at about 10 this morning.

51
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:36,395
By the way, after taking a good look,

52
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:38,695
the sheet was a little out of place

53
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,496
so I attempted to put it back in place.

54
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,995
I found that lady inside the sofa.

55
00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:54,795
I see.

56
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,795
And do you have any idea who the victim is?

57
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,495
Not at all.

58
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:03,795
Where were you yesterday between the hours of 14:00 and 15:00?

59
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:06,695
Are you suspecting me?

60
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:10,695
No, no, it's just routine procedure to ask.

61
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:13,595
I was at the movies yesterday afternoon!

62
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,696
Was somebody else with you?

63
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,695
I went alone.

64
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:21,395
I wonder if Inspector Megure suspects her.

65
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:22,496
Yeah.

66
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:25,795
"402, Sanae Hosono."

67
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:27,995
There are two things that are thinkable.

68
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:31,095
Ms. Sanae Hosono killed the victim

69
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:34,195
and made it look like the corpse was inside

70
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,095
the sofa that was delivered.

71
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:39,495
The other is, a sofa with the corpse inside it is

72
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:40,995
was delivered just like she said.

73
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:46,495
But when we went over there, she really looked surprised and pale!

74
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:50,195
It didn't look like she was putting on an act at all!

75
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:51,595
Right.

76
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:52,795
Yeah.

77
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:57,195
It's the job of the police to consider all possibilities.

78
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:58,196
But...

79
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:08,295
Inspector, the old lady's shoes were also inside the sofa.

80
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:11,596
I wonder why she wasn't wearing her shoes.

81
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:16,795
When she was killed, she was probably not wearing her shoes.

82
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:21,295
I see! Which means she was killed in the room.

83
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:24,795
If she is the culprit, the site of the crime is in this room.

84
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:27,295
Officer Takagi, go and question the neighbourhood!

85
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,396
Yes, sir!

86
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:34,496
Inspector.

87
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:41,195
What... the room next door...

88
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:43,395
Excuse me, may I ask your name?

89
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:46,095
Tokunaga.

90
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:47,895
Did something happen?

91
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:50,995
Well, at your next door neighbour, Ms. Hosono's room,

92
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:53,695
a corpse was found in the sofa.

93
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:54,696
What?

94
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:59,595
And, Mr. Tokunaga, were you in your room

95
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,495
between the hours of 14:00 to15:00 yesterday?

96
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:02,995
Yes.

97
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:05,895
I work in the evening.

98
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:07,295
Around 15:00,

99
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:11,796
did you hear any strange sounds or voices from next door?

100
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:15,796
Please try to remember.

101
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:21,596
Come to think of it, I sort of heard somebody arguing.

102
00:07:22,696 --> 00:07:24,495
You heard somebody arguing?

103
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:25,796
Yes.

104
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,395
And, what was the argument about?

105
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:33,495
I'm not sure of the details.

106
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:36,595
Oh, all right. Thank you.

107
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:39,595
I think I'll be asking you about it again later.

108
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:40,696
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:50,495
I wonder if what he said just now is true.

110
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:53,296
It's sort of hard to believe, isn't it?

111
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:59,195
The thing about her going to the movies seems to be a lie.

112
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:00,895
Inspector.

113
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,495
What is it?

114
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:06,995
I would like to go ask around the recycle shop.

115
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:10,995
I got curious on what the children was talking about.

116
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:12,895
Officer Takagi.

117
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:14,495
Okay.

118
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,595
Yeah, please do so then.

119
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,696
Yes, sir!

120
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:21,495
Oh, that sofa.

121
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:25,195
It's an item that we bought from a customer yesterday.

122
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:27,095
Yesterday?

123
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:30,395
You mean you bought it and put it out for sale right away?

124
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:36,895
Yes, we put the items that we purchase out for sale right away.

125
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:40,595
That way, we can sell the item for a cheaper price.

126
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:43,595
What about after Ms. Hosono bought it?

127
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:46,295
It was here right through till closing time.

128
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:50,895
Then it was loaded on the truck for delivery.

129
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,695
Is there any possibility that someone from outside

130
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,595
can get near the truck?

131
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:56,395
That's impossible

132
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:59,495
because the truck is parked inside the warehouse.

133
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:02,395
And, of course, the warehouse is locked.

134
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,595
Oh, is that so...

135
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:06,595
Which means that...

136
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:12,395
The old lady was in there already when it was purchased.

137
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:14,795
Does that mean that the previous owner of that sofa

138
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:16,396
is the culprit?

139
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,795
The fact is, that sofa

140
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:27,595
is not something that we bought from a customer.

141
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:28,596
What?

142
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:31,795
But, Mr. Hirose, I thought you said

143
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:34,896
that you were told to take the sofa, even if it were for free.

144
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:37,245
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:39,345
Yesterday afternoon, on the way back

146
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,645
after I went to purchase items in several places in town,

147
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:44,146
I think it was around 16:00...

148
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,345
What's the matter, Mr. Hirose?

149
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,745
Look at that, what a waste.

150
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:59,645
It still looks very usable.

151
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,646
You can say that again.

152
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:07,145
You picked it up at a trash dump that you happened to pass?

153
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,346
Right.

154
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:12,745
But manager, I felt it so wasteful to be thrown away like that

155
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,546
when it still looked so usable, so I...

156
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:18,045
I'm sorry I lied.

157
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:22,645
Well, I do understand your feelings of wanting to cherish things.

158
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:26,046
But, if you picked it up from a trash dump...

159
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:30,345
We have no idea who the culprit is.

160
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,045
Right.

161
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,946
But, Officer Takagi...

162
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,345
It's hard to think that

163
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:39,745
the culprit carried the corpse a long way, isn't it?

164
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:41,245
Wait a minute.

165
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:45,045
Where is the trash dump that you picked that sofa up from?

166
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:46,745
If I'm not mistaken, I think it was...

167
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,245
Akebono-cho, on 3rd Street.

168
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:51,346
Akebono-cho!

169
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:10,945
We're back where we started.

170
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:12,745
In other words, that old lady...

171
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:17,445
Yeah, she was left here about 16:00 yesterday,

172
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:19,745
and via the recycle shop,

173
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:24,545
came back to the original place about 10 this morning.

174
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:28,245
I'm sure the culprit is living somewhere near here,

175
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:30,545
but how do we go about looking for the culprit...

176
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:35,545
Besides, why did the culprit put the body into a sofa in the trash dump?

177
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,645
Why else?

178
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:40,445
Right, the culprit didn't think that

179
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,345
anyone would pick up a sofa that was thrown away.

180
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:44,445
But!

181
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:47,345
Oh, there you go again Conan with your "Buts".

182
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:51,845
It's a bad habit of yours of not looking at the situation as is.

183
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:53,446
Talk for yourself.

184
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:58,845
Mr. Tokunaga was a little creepy.

185
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,545
I saw him at that family restaurant this morning,

186
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:03,945
where he was drinking and all smiles.

187
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:07,145
Oh, so he smiles?

188
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:09,445
He always looks so super square.

189
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:13,446
So, something really good must've happened?

190
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,845
Tokunaga?

191
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:19,445
He's the one that we saw this morning, right?

192
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,545
Ms. Sanae Hosono's next door neighbour.

193
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:24,945
What're you doing here?

194
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:27,445
Inspector Megure.

195
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,945
What're you doing here, Inspector Megure?

196
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:34,346
I came to tell Ms. Hosono that her alibi's been backed up.

197
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:38,945
The person at the theater remembered her.

198
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:40,545
I'm glad!

199
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:43,445
But, if so...

200
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:46,645
The voice that Mr. Tokunaga said he heard,

201
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,245
must've been a mistake or something.

202
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:49,546
A mistake?

203
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:51,845
The thing is,

204
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:54,045
while we were tracing the source of where the sofa came from,

205
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:56,646
we ended back to where we started.

206
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,045
But, there is no mistake about the fact that

207
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,745
the victim was put inside the sofa here.

208
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:05,545
I'll go look for a witness.

209
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,546
Yeah, do that, will you?

210
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:12,346
I got it! I figured out who the culprit is!

211
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,445
Are you serious, Mitsuhiko?

212
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:17,545
Yes!

213
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,845
Mr. Tokunaga's testimony about having heard an argument

214
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:23,745
is probably not a mistake!

215
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,746
But, just a while ago, Inspector Megure...

216
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:30,845
So, the culprit is Mr. Tokunaga!

217
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:31,846
What?

218
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,546
He's the culprit?

219
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:48,886
It's just as those ladies were saying after all!

220
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:50,786
This morning, that man called Tokunaga

221
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:52,786
seemed to be in a super good mood.

222
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:54,686
So, my deduction's been backed up.

223
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:58,186
Mr. Tokunaga must be the suspect!

224
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:02,186
Conan, when a culprit wants to hide the corpse,

225
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,286
what do you think the purpose of the culprit usually is?

226
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,386
The culprit doesn't want anyone to find the corpse, right?

227
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:10,386
If the body is found, the victim will be identified.

228
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:13,386
And the people who are around the victim will be thoroughly checked.

229
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:16,886
The hands of the police will eventually reach the culprit.

230
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:19,786
The corpse is hidden to prevent this.

231
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:21,186
Exactly.

232
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:23,486
But if the culprit really wants to hide the body,

233
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,086
the body could be buried in the mountains, or sunk into the sea.

234
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:31,286
However, why didn't the culprit do so this time?

235
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,786
Yeah, that's the point's that hard to understand.

236
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:36,187
Right.

237
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,786
There is only one answer.

238
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:43,386
The culprit wanted to go hide the corpse in the mountains this time too.

239
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:46,186
But, the culprit had reasons for not being able to go.

240
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:49,786
So, what was the culprit's reason for not doing so?

241
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,286
He was saying that

242
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:54,586
he works from sundown.

243
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:57,887
That's why he couldn't go far to hide the body!

244
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:03,886
I see. Adults can't take off from work so...

245
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,487
Right, Officer Takagi?

246
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:08,286
Yeah...

247
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,586
That's why the culprit hid the corpse inside the sofa for the time being.

248
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:15,386
For the time being?

249
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:16,387
Yes!

250
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,486
The culprit was going to throw it away somewhere

251
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,087
after coming back from work!

252
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:26,286
But, when he returned from work...

253
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:29,086
Before the culprit could get to the sofa,

254
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:31,686
the truck of the recycle shop had already taken the sofa away!

255
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:32,787
Right.

256
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:39,186
I'm sure the culprit was surprised when he got home from work.

257
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:42,886
Because the sofa had suddenly disappeared.

258
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:47,186
And after he was surprised, delight filled his heart.

259
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:51,686
Because after all someone had taken care of the corpse for him.

260
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:54,486
He was spared the trouble of getting rid of the corpse himself.

261
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:58,787
Unable to hold back his joy, he went to celebrate on his own.

262
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:03,386
However, when he got back to the condo,

263
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:06,286
he found out the worse had happened.

264
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:08,786
The corpse that had disappeared somewhere

265
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:11,687
was found in the room next to his.

266
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:17,486
But the culprit who finds that the police suspects Sanae Hosono,

267
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:23,186
the one who first finds the corpse, remarks...

268
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:28,087
"Come to think of it, I heard the voices of people arguing."

269
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,786
It was no mistake,

270
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:36,186
but rather a lie to frame Sanae Hosono up as the culprit.

271
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:39,186
Everything falls right into place, Mitsuhiko!

272
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:40,486
Wow!

273
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:43,187
Nah, it's really no big deal.

274
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:46,786
What's the matter, Conan?

275
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:50,086
Even if the culprit had to go to work,

276
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:54,286
why did he have to go out of the way to move the corpse?

277
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:57,686
If he left it in his room until he got back,

278
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:00,486
nobody would've seem him, right?

279
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,486
Now that you mentioned it.

280
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:08,286
What did we come here to Akebono-cho today for in the first place?

281
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:10,986
To arrest the serial thief that's been raiding the houses

282
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:12,786
in this vicinity, right?

283
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:17,386
The culprit was afraid that the thief would break into his house!

284
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:22,286
I see! If the thief breaks in and finds the dead old lady,

285
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:25,986
the police may be contacted!

286
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:27,486
Exactly!

287
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:30,786
That's why he couldn't leave it in the house!

288
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:33,987
Your deduction is perfect, Mitsuhiko!

289
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,986
No, that won't do after all, Mitsuhiko.

290
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:39,587
Huh?

291
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:45,586
Think about it.

292
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,986
The possibility of someone witnessing him hiding the corpse

293
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:51,986
is higher than the possibility of a thief breaking into his house,

294
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,987
don't you think?

295
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:59,286
Besides, will he really be happy when he finds out that

296
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,286
the sofa where the corpse is hidden disappears?

297
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,186
I think it would be more natural for him to worry

298
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:07,087
that it may have been discovered by the police, don't you?

299
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:12,186
Besides, it wouldn't hurt to take a day off from work,

300
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:13,986
if just for a day.

301
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:17,086
In other words, deducing Mr. Tokunaga as being the culprit

302
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:19,486
is all an illusion created in your head.

303
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,986
This is homicide,

304
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:24,486
let's think about it more seriously, okay?

305
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:27,386
I'm thinking about it seriously too!

306
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:31,086
Just who is the one that is overtaken by illusion?

307
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,686
Although you say, normally this and normally that,

308
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,386
I'm sure there a people who get anxious over

309
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:36,686
thieves breaking into their houses.

310
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,786
I'm sure there are people who think themselves lucky

311
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,186
about the corpse disappearing too, don't you?

312
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,186
If someone who had never taken a day off from work does so,

313
00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:45,186
the people around him may get suspicious.

314
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:48,286
Therefore, he may go to work as usual.

315
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:50,887
That's possible too, isn't it?

316
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:03,286
According to the manager of the condo, it seems that Mr. Tokunaga

317
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:07,286
is running a small pub in the neighbouring town.

318
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:09,686
It seems he's having a tough time,

319
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:12,586
but he seems to be running the pub without resting even one day.

320
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:14,686
The manager also commented that.

321
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,286
Mr. Tokunaga is a square and timid personality.

322
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:21,086
It's just as Mitsuhiko had portrayed him.

323
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,786
Since he has to make preparations before opening the shop,

324
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,687
it seems he always goes out around this time.

325
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:28,486
It's 15:00 now.

326
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:33,586
But, no matter how timid he is, I wonder if he would be afraid of

327
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:35,486
a thief that he's not sure will break in or not.

328
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:40,786
Serial break ins have been reported in this area,

329
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:45,386
so please be sure to lock your doors when going out.

330
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:47,386
This is the Akebono Police Station.

331
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,586
Hey!

332
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,487
Please stop!

333
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:53,886
This is Officer Takagi from police headquarters!

334
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:56,386
Did you patrol this area yesterday too?

335
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,586
Yes, sir. But maybe yesterday we patrolled this area

336
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:01,386
about 10 minutes earlier than today.

337
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:02,986
Officer Takagi!

338
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:06,087
Yeah! So, that's the story!

339
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:11,786
Mr. Tokunaga was probably panic after killed the victim

340
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:16,486
and heard the voice from this police car.

341
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:19,786
This is the Akebono Police Station.

342
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:24,787
Serial break ins have been reported in this area.

343
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,486
Therefore, you were frightened

344
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:31,086
and hid the corpse inside the sofa

345
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:33,286
that you found in the trash dump nearby.

346
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:36,087
Isn't that right, Mr. Tokunaga?

347
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:42,886
I...

348
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:46,386
I owed that old lady money.

349
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:53,986
And I asked her to wait just another week for me to pay her back.

350
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,986
Then, she came to my condo and yelled at me

351
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,686
saying that if I didn't pay her back by the due date,

352
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:01,886
she would take this shop away from me.

353
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,886
That's why I...

354
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,087
That's why I lost my temper and...

355
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:13,186
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:17,686
Mr. Tokunaga, please come to the station with me.

357
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:18,887
Yes, sir.

358
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,686
You did it, Mitsuhiko!

359
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:22,787
Great!

360
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,486
Good deduction work, Mitsuhiko,

361
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:30,187
thanks to being free of preconceived opinions.

362
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:10,386
What? The thief who had been breaking into house in Akebono-cho

363
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,086
was arrested long time ago?

364
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:15,786
Yeah. Last week a man who was arrested on charges of theft

365
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:18,786
confessed to the other crimes as well.

366
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:20,286
Oh, boy.

367
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:23,386
We were all out to get him and then...

368
00:23:23,387 --> 00:23:26,886
What a bummer, I even lost out on bus fare!

369
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,886
Which means that Mr. Tokunaga

370
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,486
didn't have to go out of the way

371
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:34,986
to hide the corpse in the sofa at the trash dump?

372
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:37,686
Yeah, if he left the corpse inside his room,

373
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:41,086
maybe the case would've never come to light.

374
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,686
He sure is an unlucky character, isn't he?

375
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,587
You can say that again.

376
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:55,287
Gee, it's a homicide case and no laughing matter.

377
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:02,386
Mail that you can't delete...

378
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:05,886
It's been three years now.

379
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:09,686
They listened to it. The same words of the devil.

380
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:11,886
-Matsuda! -Don't, Sato!

381
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:14,687
No! The mercury lever will operate!

382
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,587
Conan!

383
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:25,886
The next episode is a 2-hour special,

384
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:29,287
"Unsettled Police Department, 12 Million Hostages"
