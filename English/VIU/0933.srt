1
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,022
Go, go! Break away!

2
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:10,222
This is the last one, Pops!

3
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:14,522
Ran will get mad at me if you run out of money!

4
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:17,522
Keep a close eye on him, Conan.

5
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:20,522
He just got paid,

6
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:24,022
and he gambled away all of it in just half a day the other day.

7
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:28,122
Not only that, but that's actually my money.

8
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:30,122
Got it, Conan?

9
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:31,422
Got it.

10
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:33,722
Pops!

11
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:36,422
Shut up. I know.

12
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:38,822
Yes, yes!

13
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:41,322
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

14
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:42,322
All right!

15
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:49,022
What? You must be joking.

16
00:00:53,022 --> 00:00:56,922
Here's the problem, should I man up and...

17
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:59,322
Yeah, and go home.

18
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:01,722
Should I bet the rest of my money?

19
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:03,722
Or drink my sorrows away?

20
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:05,722
Now that's the problem.

21
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:08,622
Both would be huge problems.

22
00:01:10,422 --> 00:01:11,922
Excuse me.

23
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:15,122
Are you the great detective, Kogoro Mouri?

24
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:16,522
-What? -What?

25
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:20,722
Indeed. I am the great detective, Mouri.

26
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:25,022
Excuse me. I'm unfortunately out of business cards.

27
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:28,422
I'm a freelance horse racing journalist.

28
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:32,222
I'd like to hire you for a job.

29
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,922
Yes, yes. More gambling money.

30
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:40,022
In my eyes are maximum creation.

31
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:41,822
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

32
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:43,522
He keeps talking about gambling money,

33
00:01:43,522 --> 00:01:45,622
but there's something fishy about all these horse racing jobs.

34
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:47,122
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:49,022
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:51,322
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:37,942
"The Thoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part 1)"

38
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,333
"Mouri Detective Agency" -We're home.

39
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,433
We're back.

40
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,833
Dad, hurry.

41
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,233
What?

42
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,533
You have a client, dad.

43
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,733
Well, well.

44
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,533
Thank for you waiting.

45
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,933
I am the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

46
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:03,833
Excuse me. I'm unfortunately out of business cards.

47
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:08,733
I write horse racing predictions and reviews online.

48
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,833
I'd like to ask you to do something for me.

49
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,333
Business is booming!

50
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,033
Are you sure, Pops?

51
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,833
That job was the same as the last one.

52
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:29,133
Excuse me, but I'm a huge horse racing fan.

53
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,433
I'd actually like to hire you.

54
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,933
What? What?

55
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,833
Anyway, that's that.

56
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,033
Thank you, detective.

57
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,833
What's going on?

58
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,533
We did it.

59
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,733
Yeah. Now we can relax.

60
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,933
You're right.

61
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:15,333
With a famous detective on the case, surely...

62
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,933
I don't know what's going on,

63
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,533
but there's something fishy about these jobs.

64
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,233
"Tokuyoshi Stables"

65
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:55,833
Why are you following me?

66
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,833
Ran told me to follow you.

67
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,933
She's worried because of what the jobs are about.

68
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:04,533
If you're near a track when you get paid,

69
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:08,233
you might spend all of it like always.

70
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,333
Don't worry.

71
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:16,033
This time I'm earning triple the money.

72
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:22,633
Are you sure you should've accepted the same job three times?

73
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,133
He's the most popular horse right now.

74
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,833
Coincidences happen.

75
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,033
I meant as a detective.

76
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,333
That's him!

77
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,533
White Spirits,

78
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,733
"White Spirits, Racing Horse" -the horse with the pure white soul.

79
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,433
"Yasutaka Hase (40), Trainer"

80
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,633
It's a beautiful horse.

81
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:56,733
No wonder they say he's the horse of the decade.

82
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:59,333
Indeed, indeed.

83
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,933
I've been blessed as a horse owner.

84
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,933
Who are you?

85
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:06,633
Please excuse me.

86
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,533
I took your call earlier.

87
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,533
"Kozo Tokuyoshi (55), Horse Owner" -I'm Kozo Tokuyoshi.

88
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:15,033
You must be Kogoro Mouri, the great detective.

89
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:18,333
Indeed, I am the great detective, Mouri.

90
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:23,133
I see. So you're the owner of that amazing horse.

91
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:27,733
You said you were here about White Spirits?

92
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,833
Indeed.

93
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:33,833
Tokuyoshi, I understand you've been receiving death threats

94
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:38,133
against White Spirits since about a month ago.

95
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,333
How do you know that?

96
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,133
Detectives are bound to confidentiality,

97
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,733
so I cannot answer your question,

98
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:49,733
but I've been hired to investigate and protect White Spirits

99
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:53,733
by someone who heard about the threats.

100
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:56,133
By three different people, too.

101
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,933
I see. That's perfect, then.

102
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:00,933
What?

103
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,333
I'd like to hire you, too.

104
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,833
Please protect White Spirits, Mouri.

105
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,933
What?

106
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:10,733
He's been hired by four people now.

107
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,433
Thank you, Mouri.

108
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,533
The next day,

109
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:24,533
White Spirits was being transported to a track outside Tokyo

110
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:27,833
to participate in a commemorative race.

111
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,333
"White Spirits"

112
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,633
We're counting on you.

113
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,633
"Masao Shiomi (50), Horse Trailer Driver" -Got it.

114
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:40,833
Why are you here, too, Ran?

115
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,233
I'm watching you.

116
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,033
I wasn't sure Conan could handle it alone.

117
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,233
You're unbelievable.

118
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:53,333
Just kidding. I'm actually a White Spirits fan.

119
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,933
What? Don't tell me you...

120
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:59,433
Of course not. I'm underage.

121
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:05,133
I just like how fast and beautiful White Spirits is.

122
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,133
That's why I'm worried.

123
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,333
Yeah, but...

124
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,633
Why not, Mouri?

125
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,933
I feel safer with more people.

126
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,333
Come, miss.

127
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,733
You're welcome to join me in my car.

128
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,433
Thank you!

129
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:28,533
Don't do this, sir. This is reckless.

130
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,533
If something were to happen to White Spirits...

131
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,533
Don't worry.

132
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,933
The great detective Kogoro Mouri is here.

133
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:41,133
White Spirits will appear in the race as planned.

134
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,133
You all just need to do your jobs.

135
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,833
You all?

136
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,133
What's up with that car?

137
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:12,833
They shouldn't surprise people like that.

138
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,033
Hey, wasn't that this person?

139

"This Month's Woman Jockey White Spirits' Rider"

"Chizuru Kakuta (25), Jockey"

141

They're on schedule.

142
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,433
That's them.

143
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,633
But why were they wearing disguises?

144

"Construction 50m Ahead Detour" -What's wrong? Hey, you can't just...

145
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,933
What?

146
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,333
Follow that car.

147
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:02,333
Where'd the trailer go?

148
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,933
What's wrong?

149
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,033
There's construction up ahead.

150
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:16,233
That sign was placed incorrectly.

151
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,933
I'm sorry. Thank you for waiting.

152
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,033
What a waste of time.

153
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:29,433
Now, now. We have time.

154
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,333
Let's take it slowly.

155
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,833
What is it?

156
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,333
Something not right.

157
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,933
I have a bad feeling about this.

158

"Okuho Horse Track"

I'm glad he's all right.

160
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:02,633
Nothing's gonna happen with the great detective, Kogoro Mouri on the job.

161
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:04,033
It's not him.

162
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:07,533
-What? -This isn't White Spirits.

163

What do you mean, Tokuyoshi?

It looks just like him.

167
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:24,169
It looks like him, but it's a totally different horse.

168
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,169
What?

"White Spirits"

171
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,569
Look, Pops.

172
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,269
That's...

173
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,669
No way.

174
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:41,669
And that.

175
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:44,469
What is that?

176
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,669
Dear President Tokugawa.

177
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,769
We've taken White Spirits.

178
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:55,069
Gather 100 million yen in ransom

179
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:57,569
and wait at your house for us to contact you.

180
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,069
A ransom letter?

181
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,769
What's going on, Mouri?

182
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,469
When did they take him?

183
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:06,769
Where did they swap out the...

184
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:12,969
That's right. That's the only place they could've done it.

185
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:15,469
And if that's true, then...

186
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:17,569
Could it be?

187
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,069
Hey, you.

188
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:26,469
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:28,169
My wife and child were kidnapped.

190
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:29,469
I was being threatened.

191
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:31,369
You what?

192
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:35,769
"Construction 50m Ahead Detour"

193
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:43,169
They told me to park the trailer there

194
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,469
and get in the other one.

195
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:48,469
They said they'd kill my wife and child if I didn't.

196
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,369
I had no choice.

197
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:52,069
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:06,669
I knew it.

199
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:07,669
You're right.

200
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:09,269
There's no construction happening at all.

201
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:11,469
This is ridiculous.

202
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:12,469
Look.

203
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:16,569
Is that...

204
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:17,769
Yeah.

205
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:24,669
They're tire marks from the real trailer the culprit drove away

206
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:29,569
after the driver Shiomi got into the other trailer.

207
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,669
What's wrong, Conan?

208
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,069
Nothing.

209
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:37,269
I was just thinking this is like that other case.

210
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:40,069
What? This has happened before?

211
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:45,069
It's called the "The Adventure of Silver Blaze".

212
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:49,169
What's that? I've never heard of it.

213
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:53,969
It's a Sherlock Holmes story written by Conan Doyle.

214
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:56,869
You're talking about a book?

215
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:58,669
What nonsense.

216
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,869
I hope that's all it is.

217
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,969
Hello?

218
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:09,669
Oh, Takagi.

219
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,369
That's good.

220
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,269
Any leads on the suspect?

221
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:17,869
I see. We'll meet you right away.

222
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:20,769
Was that Officer Takagi?

223
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,469
Yeah. The driver Shiomi's wife and child were released,

224
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:28,569
and made it back home.

225
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:30,569
But they were blindfolded,

226
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:33,469
so they don't know anything about the culprit.

227
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:34,869
I see.

228
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,769
I'm glad they're all right, though.

229

"Kozo Tokuyoshi"

230
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:47,369
Leave! Leave me!

231
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:49,969
Can't you read this?

232
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:53,369
Let me see that.

"In one hour, come alone to the fountain at Tsubaki Park."

234
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:56,269
"Bring the 100 million yen with you."

235
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:59,269
"If anyone else comes, other than the president,"

236
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,869
"White Spirits will not return forever."

237
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,669
What is this?

238
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:09,269
Tokuyoshi found it in his mailbox.

239
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,169
He said he was going out alone

240
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:16,569
with White Spirits' 100 million yen ransom.

241
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:18,869
Without our protection.

242
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:22,669
He what? That's too dangerous.

243
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:26,269
We said the same thing.

244
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:29,669
Danger? Protection?

245
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,969
It's all just to arrest the culprit.

246
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:35,969
I can't trust the police or detectives.

247
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:39,869
If you follow me, I'll sue all of you.

248
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:41,669
Don't forget that!

249
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:53,369
Inspector.

250
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:54,869
Of course.

251
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:59,269
We can't ignore a crime happening right before our eyes.

252
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,969
We'll follow them carefully

253
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:03,869
so neither the culprit nor Tokuyoshi notice.

254
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:04,969
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

255
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:42,569
What is this?

256
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:47,769
WS, KM North ST.

257
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,369
WS...

258
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,869
WS?

259
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:56,169
Maybe they're referring to White Spirits.

260
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:57,569
That must be it.

261
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:03,169
In other words, White Spirits is at KM North ST.

262
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,269
Where is that?

263
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:10,369
I wonder what word is normally abbreviated as ST.

264
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,669
Station. The train station.

265
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:13,669
I see.

266
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,169
KM North...

267
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:16,869
Katsumata North Station.

268
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,269
Let's go.

269
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,369
"Katsumata North Station"

270
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:32,169
Kozo Tokuyoshi from Yagiri-cho, you have a message.

271
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:34,569
Please come to the station office.

272
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:58,369
There was a phone call for Tokuyoshi about 30 minutes ago.

273
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,069
What was it?

274
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:06,469
They said to tell him, "Head to OND3BRG."

275
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:10,069
OND3? BRG?

276
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:12,169
Where is that?

277
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,069
BRG...

278
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:21,669
If it's an abbreviation like before, BRG...

279
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,369
Bridge.

280
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,569
Maybe it's a bridge.

281
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:30,769
So OND3 is the name of the bridge?

282
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,269
OND... OND...

283
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,669
If that's an abbreviation, too, then...

284
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,369
Hey, look.

285
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:43,469
Up there.

286
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,469
OND3. Onodera Overpass 3.

287
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:52,069
"Onodera Overpass 3"

288
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:06,769
Could it be?

289
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:24,769
Darn it. I can't see from here.

290
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,369
I still can't...

291
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,669
I still can't see it.

292
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,569
Here should be good enough.

293
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,669
I see it.

294
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:41,769
Stake it out.

295
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:42,769
Yes, sir.

296
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:03,569
Darn. It's been thirty minutes.

297
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,469
What's going on?

298
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:09,569
Could it be? Chiba, Takagi.

299
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,569
Yes.

300
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,769
What is this?

301
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:19,869
What happened?

302
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:23,869
It's not here!

303
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,769
What?

304
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:28,069
Darn it! They got us!

305
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,969
What's going on?

306
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:34,069
After Tokuyoshi threw down the bag,

307
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:35,469
the culprit must've come out of hiding

308
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:38,069
and switched out the contents.

309
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:43,569
Then they left before we arrived.

310
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,869
They what?

311
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:49,569
So the culprit was long gone.

312
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:59,569
The next day,

313
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,369
there was another sudden development in the case.

I see. So that's how it is.

00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:51,669
But why?

00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,269
Horse brothers?

320
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,869
You think you've used the great Kogoro Mouri,

321
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:01,869
but you haven't at all.
