1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,169
Thief Kid who is after the big jewel, "Giraffe horns",

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,169
sends a letter of warning that he will be stealing it.

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:09,569
The giraffe horns cannot be taken out

4
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:11,869
unless the trick that Kichiemon Samizu had built

5
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:13,169
is undone by inserting the four keys

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,369
of the four pedestals into the keyholes at the same time

7
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,269
and turning them at the same time as well.

8
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,595
We, the members of the Detective Squad,

9
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:24,095
were appointed to guard the four pedestals.

10
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:27,095
But Conan was knocked out in the dark,

11
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:31,295
and the giraffe horns had suddenly vanished.

12
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:34,095
The four pedestals each represented the four legendary gods,

13
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,195
the Vermilion Bird, White Tiger,

14
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:39,995
Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon.

15
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:43,795
Maybe the words of Kichiemon Samizu that are carved on the pillar

16
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:47,795
where the giraffe horns are stored have something to do with this.

17
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:53,995
I guess we'll have to solve this mystery on our own!

18
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:16,795
Brooding over passing seasons

19
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:18,795
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

20
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,495
Thief Kid who is confined

21
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,695
disguises himself as that guy?

22
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:24,395
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:26,195
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:28,295
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:58,392
"Thief Kid vs. Four Gods Detective Squad"

26
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:01,123
What? You want to confirm

27
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:03,823
the sounds and images at the time of the black-out?

28
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:06,023
I want to make sure and see that

29
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:07,423
there are no strange sounds or images.

30
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:09,523
That's true.

31
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,323
Because in order to turn the keys of the four pedestals

32
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:14,323
in the dark at the same time,

33
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:17,423
some kind of signal would be necessary.

34
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:20,023
Let's check with the VTR!

35
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:23,323
Black-out?

36
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:26,623
Don't panic! It was to be expected.

37
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:30,023
It's the sound of the shutter breaking,

38
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:33,223
and the wind and rain blowing inside the room.

39
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:36,723
I was so surprised I put on my hood.

40
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:40,023
-Me, too! -Same here.

41
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:42,723
Be quiet!

42
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,723
Okay.

43
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,523
-It's our voices. -Yeah.

44
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:49,323
Right.

45
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:55,523
This is the sound of the electricity

46
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:57,523
that is flowing through the pedestals being cut off, right?

47
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,023
-It can't be? -This is the sound of the pillar

48
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:05,423
in the center rising and the giraffe statue coming out.

49
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:09,523
So this is the light of the stun gun...

50
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:10,923
Conan!

51
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:12,723
The light turned on.

52
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:14,723
I turned it on

53
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:17,823
because I was worried at hearing Conan's scream.

54
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:20,223
It's after this.

55
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:24,323
The giraffe horns are gone!

56
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:28,323
It seems that the giraffe horns were already stolen at this point.

57
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:31,123
They're on!

58
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:36,623
So, there were no strange sounds or lights after all.

59
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:40,323
No. To be precise, nothing was unexpected

60
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,823
other than the flash of light from the stun gun

61
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,423
when this little glasses boy was attacked and his scream.

62
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:50,723
The sound of the pillar moving was heard before the boy screamed.

63
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,523
But it could be that the sound was a fake that Thief Kid played,

64
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:56,823
and if at that point, Kid had finished

65
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,723
passing the keys around to his accomplices.

66
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:02,023
The moment we heard Conan scream

67
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,523
and moved away from the pedestal,

68
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:07,623
they could've turned the keys all at the same time.

69
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:09,523
That's true.

70
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:11,723
But are you sure all of you were guarding

71
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:16,123
the keyholes of the pedestal up until this time?

72
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,423
Yeah, we did!

73
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:20,723
With my hands spread out like this!

74
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:22,223
I was leaning against the pedestal,

75
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:24,223
covering the keyhole of the pedestal.

76
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:28,023
By the way, who was guarding which pedestal?

77
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:30,523
The one I guarded...

78
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,923
was that black pedestal!

79
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:37,423
I was in charge of the green pedestal!

80
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:40,423
I watched the white pedestal.

81
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,123
And I watched this red pedestal!

82
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:47,123
But, weren't you afraid?

83
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:48,523
Because although there was a black-out,

84
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:51,523
there was electricity going through the pedestals, you know.

85
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:52,923
Well, as for that...

86
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:56,323
Hey, gramps!

87
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,623
This floor is rotten here and there,

88
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:02,623
but isn't there an iron board inside like there is in the walls?

89
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:05,023
No. As to underneath the floor,

90
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,623
the ceiling and the pillars in the four corners,

91
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:08,523
I haven't touched them

92
00:06:08,523 --> 00:06:12,323
because they were built intricately to begin with.

93
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,323
Well, he won't get away

94
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:17,823
because I've laid barbed wired all over underneath the floor!

95
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,423
Excuse me.

96
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,923
If you say that Kid's accomplices are among us,

97
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,723
I know someone who is suspicious.

98
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:28,423
This guy's who's in charge of audio!

99
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:29,923
What?

100
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,823
A young staff was supposed to come,

101
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:35,723
but he suddenly switched.

102
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:40,223
That's because I suddenly couldn't get in touch with him.

103
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:41,223
Talk for yourself too,

104
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:44,823
-then, you're just as suspicious as me! -Huh?

105
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:47,523
The person who was supposed to be in charge of the camera

106
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:50,023
was your subordinate in college,

107
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,123
but you forced your way to come here

108
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:52,123
saying that you are an old timer at this job.

109
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:53,723
What the heck are you talking about?

110
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:55,123
The one who called me saying that

111
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,123
he just got out of college and didn't have confidence

112
00:06:57,123 --> 00:07:00,723
to handle a live broadcast is him, you know!

113
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:03,123
I heard so, too.

114
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,323
That advisor Suzuki went out of his way

115
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,623
to get the children uniformed parkas,

116
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,323
and that he also wanted a person

117
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:09,423
who was at home at the camera for this job,

118
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,123
so he switched cameramen.

119
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:12,723
I went out of my way

120
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,023
only because the TV station told me that

121
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:17,423
it would be more exciting that way.

122
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:18,423
Moreover, wasn't it you people

123
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,523
who told me the phone number to the company

124
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,123
who sells the parkas and introduced them to me? TV crew!

125
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:26,723
Huh? Me? I know nothing of it.

126
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:30,723
Did you call us over here

127
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,123
because somebody told you to do so, too?

128
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:38,323
No. It was written in post script in his letter of warning.

129
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,623
"Let's not resort to childish pranks this time,

130
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:44,123
and decide victory by adult means", you see!

131
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:48,223
So, I took it that he wasn't at home with children

132
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,923
and called the Detective Squad over here!

133
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:53,323
It's true

134
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:55,523
that if the phone call that the TV station received

135
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:57,923
was from Thief Kid,

136
00:07:57,923 --> 00:07:59,623
he probably deliberately tried

137
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:02,923
to get rid of young people coming to this site.

138
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,323
But, if so,

139
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:08,423
why would he write something like that in postscript?

140
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:10,723
It's more than likely, judging from the personality of the advisor,

141
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,123
that if something like that were to be written,

142
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,123
he would most obviously call the Detective Squad over here.

143
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:20,823
But this case is full of mysteries.

144
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,423
It's strange that the treasure

145
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:25,523
that was taken is nowhere in sight either,

146
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:27,723
but the same goes for the four keys

147
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,223
that the advisor nailed to the wall.

148
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:34,623
If he nailed the keys on only slightly...

149
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:36,223
After using the keys,

150
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:38,723
if the keys were to be nailed back on to the wall,

151
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:41,723
the noise would be really loud.

152
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:45,223
But there was no such sound in the video that we just watched.

153
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:48,323
Maybe the fluorescent paint on the keys and the keyholes

154
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:49,623
are only tricks for diversion,

155
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:52,323
and the method explained on the pillar

156
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,523
that required using no keys was carried out after...

157
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:02,123
Gosh. How long to you intend to keep sleeping?

158
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,323
Lend me a hand, will you?

159
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:06,823
-White... -Huh?

160
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:09,123
Conan, are you up?

161
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:12,423
Not so loud.

162
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:17,323
Is the fact that you're up now a secret?

163
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,223
How come?

164
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:24,223
Idiot! This is the first time Kid ever passed me out.

165
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,223
How can I get up when I don't even know why he did that?

166
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:31,523
By the way, what's the beeping sound?

167
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:34,623
That's the sound of the electricity

168
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:36,923
that runs through the pedestals turning off!

169
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:39,723
It seems that the sound of the pedestals turn off

170
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:41,623
in the order of green, red, white and black.

171
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,123
That's why the Inspector asked us to guard the pedestals

172
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:47,623
according to the sound as they turn off.

173
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,323
And tell me the position of Kid's cards

174
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:54,423
that are stuck to the pedestals?

175
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,523
-The position? -Yeah.

176
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:57,923
Only on the red pedestal,

177
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:00,523
the card was stuck right above the keyhole.

178
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:04,123
I can see from here that on the green pedestal,

179
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,223
it's stuck a little more above that,

180
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,623
but I can't see the black and white one.

181
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:10,723
The white is the same as the red,

182
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,523
and the card's right above the keyhole!

183
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:15,823
The card is more above by the black than the green!

184
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:21,123
I see. That's how it works.

185
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:24,223
Okay. Will you surround my body

186
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,423
so that nobody can see me?

187
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:36,523
This position that I'm in is killing me.

188
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:40,223
What we don't want to see will be exposed, too.

189
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:44,323
No, that was just coincidence.

190
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,323
Dirty brat.

191
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:48,123
Come off it, if I were really dirty,

192
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:51,123
I'd keep my mouth shut and continue looking.

193
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,723
Conan!

194
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:01,823
I got it! The reason Kid knocked me out.

195
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:03,023
No joke?

196
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:05,123
And of course...

197
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:10,423
who Thief Kid is disguised as, among them!

198
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,283
Won't you notify one of the riot officers for me?

199
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:16,583
I'm sure that somewhere on the temple grounds,

200
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,983
the person that Thief Kid had disguised as, is being confined,

201
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,083
so notify the riot police officers

202
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,283
and have them look for him.

203
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:29,283
But, which riot officer do we notify?

204
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:33,983
True. If Kid's accomplices are among the them...

205
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:37,483
No, none of Kid's accomplices are here.

206
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:38,883
What?

207
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:44,683
Kid stole the giraffe horns with amber in them all alone.

208
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:49,183
By taking advantage of his four henchmen that knew nothing!

209
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:51,483
Four henchmen?

210
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,983
Don't tell me...

211
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:56,383
Hurry and open that door up

212
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,583
so that the officers can pursue Kid!

213
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,683
No, I can't open the door.

214
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:02,883
Why not?

215
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:09,083
I can't help feeling that he's still here in the room somewhere.

216
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,283
I can't shake the feeling

217
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:14,483
that he's waiting for the door to open any minute.

218
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,483
Exactly. Don't open the door.

219
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:24,483
Because he's probably surprised at what a tough time

220
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:27,383
he's having trying to escaping and cold sweating

221
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:30,583
somewhere in this room where there are no accomplices.

222
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,783
No accomplices?

223
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:35,283
Hey, hey. Have you forgotten?

224
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:36,783
You've got to insert the four keys

225
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:38,983
into the four keyholes at the same time

226
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:41,883
and turn the keys a the same time too, you know.

227
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:44,483
There're going to have to be at least 4 of them all together

228
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:46,183
including Kid to do it.

229
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,883
And to begin with the four keys

230
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:50,483
were fixed onto the wall like this

231
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:53,683
by the old man before anything happened.

232
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:56,083
The keys have nothing to do with what happened

233
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,583
because Kid didn't use them!

234
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,483
I told you, didn't I?

235
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:04,983
That there was florescent paint on both the keys and the keyholes.

236
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:08,983
But you don't know when the florescent paint was put there, do you?

237
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:10,183
Right!

238
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:14,483
Thief Kid could've put it on the keys and keyholes

239
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:17,283
even before the black-out!

240
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,383
That's true.

241
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:23,083
But can the giraffe statue be taken out without using the key?

242
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,083
It's written at the foot of the pillar, see?

243
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,083
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

244
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,483
without using the correct method,

245
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:33,383
must move with the flow."

246
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:36,483
This is the after care that Kichiemon Samizu

247
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,983
left behind in case the keys are lost.

248
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:43,983
It means anyone who wants to get a hold of the giraffe horns

249
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,883
without relying on the keys, should go with the flow.

250
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:48,783
What flow?

251
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:50,083
The four gods...

252
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,583
The pedestals in the four corners,

253
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,683
each represent the legendary deities belonging to the pedestals.

254
00:13:56,383 --> 00:14:00,583
This green pedestal represents the Blue Dragon.

255
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,683
The white pedestal, the White Tiger!

256
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:04,683
The black one is the Black Tortoise!

257
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:08,483
And this red pedestal represents the Vermilion Bird!

258
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:13,583
But I wonder if there was a specific order to the four gods?

259
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,983
-Seasons! -Seasons?

260
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,983
The Blue Dragon is Spring.

261
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,983
Vermilion Bird, Summer.

262
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,883
The White Tiger, Autumn.

263
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:24,183
And the Black Tortoise is said to stand for Winter.

264
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:27,583
If "must move with the flow", means...

265
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,883
move along with the flow of the seasons.

266
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:32,583
It means to move your body

267
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,983
in order of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter!

268
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:36,683
Move your body?

269
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:39,883
In other words, bring your body close to the pedestal like this

270
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:42,683
and tilt your body.

271
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,683
Next, it's you, Ai!

272
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,683
Yes.

273
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:48,283
Okay, Ayumi.

274
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:50,783
Yep.

275
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:52,583
Lastly, it's you, Genta!

276
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,083
Aye!

277
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,983
The pillar...

278
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,383
Is moving...

279
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,283
And closing.

280
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:11,183
It... It's closed!

281
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:12,783
Now you know

282
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:14,483
that you can make the pillar go up and down

283
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:17,083
even without the keys.

284
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,983
But it only blacked-out for a mere minute!

285
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:23,183
Are you saying that Kid during this time

286
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:24,883
ran around the room without any light,

287
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,783
stuck cards to all the pedestals and tilted them?

288
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:32,983
Kid didn't. We're the ones who tilted them.

289
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:35,783
Because we were told to guard keyholes of

290
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:39,383
the green, red, white and black pedestals.

291
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:43,383
Isn't that right, Inspector Nakamori?

292
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:47,383
Rather... Mr. Magician under the Moonlight?

293
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,283
I see.

294
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,383
In order to guard the keyhole,

295
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:54,783
you'd have to bring your back close to the pedestal,

296
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:58,383
and guard the surroundings.

297
00:15:58,383 --> 00:15:59,583
Hey, hey.

298
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,883
Then just how in the world did I stick the cards on?

299
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,683
He made us do that, too!

300
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:06,183
By cracking the window,

301
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:07,683
letting the rain and wind come in

302
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:09,483
and making us wear our hoods.

303
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:10,983
He made us stick the cards

304
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:13,983
with a sticky seal on them that were hidden inside the hood

305
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:16,983
and stuck to our backs when we leaned against the pedestals!

306
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:20,183
As proof of that, the position the cards are pasted on,

307
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:21,883
each correspond to the height of the one

308
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:24,083
who was guarding the pedestal, right?

309
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,983
Now that you mentioned it...

310
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:29,783
Kid most probably called Advisor Suzuki

311
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:32,483
using the voice of the reporter told him

312
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:36,283
that he would introduce a company that sold the parkas,

313
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:39,383
and planted tricks on them himself.

314
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:41,683
But it's amazing how the cards were stuck

315
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:43,683
onto the corresponding pedestals in the dark,

316
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:45,883
without making a mistake.

317
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:48,383
As far as what was seen on the VTR,

318
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,383
there was nothing like a signal.

319
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:52,583
Sound...

320
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,583
He told us!

321
00:16:54,583 --> 00:17:00,383
To wait for the sound of the electricity flowing

322
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,783
through the pedestals turn off,

323
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:04,383
then, to guard the pedestals in that order!

324
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:07,383
I didn't set up such a sound though.

325
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:09,283
Of course there was!

326
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:10,583
It beeped.

327
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,383
An irritating sound.

328
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:14,983
-Did you hear such a sound? -No.

329
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,483
Not at all.

330
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:18,183
What?

331
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:21,983
Mosquito sound.

332
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:24,883
A high frequency sound

333
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:28,383
that gradually becomes inaudible to people over the age of 20

334
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:30,483
because the ears start to age.

335
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:34,083
He played that sound that only the children could hear,

336
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,683
and let them know what order to tilt the pedestals.

337
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:39,183
If nobody mentions anything regardless of the sound being heard,

338
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,883
everything would seem normal.

339
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:43,683
That's why you removed

340
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:46,283
all the young staff from the TV crew, right?

341
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:48,783
To avoid having anyone else hear that sound.

342
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:54,283
You told us nothing about that mosquito sound, though.

343
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,383
Sorry.

344
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:58,583
Then, where are the horns of the giraffe?

345
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,983
Oh, that's...

346
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,983
Inside the hood of my parka!

347
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:07,683
He pretended to take me,

348
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:10,383
who was knocked out by the stun gun to the hospital

349
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:13,983
and was planning to make it out of here, treasure and all!

350
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:15,683
Although, I realized right away when I got up

351
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:18,883
because of the weight of the treasure I felt.

352
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:22,083
By the way, he used the florescent paint

353
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,583
when the advisor handed over the keys

354
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,283
to show us the statue of the giraffe.

355
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:31,783
Back then, if he put florescent paint on the keys,

356
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:33,283
then the keyholes where the keys are inserted

357
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:35,383
will also have paint on them!

358
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:38,083
Then, where's the real Inspector?

359
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:42,083
Probably knocked out by a stun gun and around here some place.

360
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:45,783
Open the door!

361
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:49,483
The one that's inside is Kid disguised as me!

362
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:51,283
-Why not let him in? -Open the door!

363
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:56,883
But, if he came to get his accomplices out of here...

364
00:18:56,883 --> 00:19:00,983
If he wanted to, he would've done that long ago!

365
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:03,383
-True! -Open the door!

366
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:04,983
The one that's inside is Kid disguised as me!

367
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:07,483
Okay, open the door!

368
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:17,783
How about it, Kid?

369
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:21,483
I've stamped all the adults except you.

370
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:25,083
Now you can't disguise yourself as someone else!

371
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:30,683
Because the one with no stamp on his face is you!

372
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:35,183
So, this is it, for you.

373
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:39,183
I wonder about that.

374
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:48,583
-Genta? -Turn on the lights!

375
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:54,683
Look for him!

376
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:57,283
The one that doesn't have a stamp on his face!

377
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,283
That's Kid!

378
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,183
But, Inspector.

379
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:04,083
Everybody's face is stamped.

380
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,683
Kid is nowhere in sight!

381
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,883
Impossible!

382
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:12,783
Where the heck did he disappear to?

383
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:15,383
He can't possibly disguise himself as a child.

384
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:17,883
Hey!

385
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,983
Help me!

386
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:21,683
Genta!

387
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:23,583
What happened? What's with that hole?

388
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,483
I don't know!

389
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:28,083
Somebody grabbed me in the dark

390
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,083
and I was shoved into this hole!

391
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,483
Come to think of it,

392
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:35,283
Kid disguised as Inspector Nakamori

393
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,583
was touching the floor.

394
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,883
He probably set up a simple bomb at that time

395
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,583
and opened a hole in the floor,

396
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,683
used Genta as the lid and escaped under the floor.

397
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:48,983
Okay! Kid is under the floor!

398
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:50,383
Open it.

399
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,383
Okay, I got it.

400
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,283
Genta, you stay right there and don't move, okay?

401
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:58,583
If somebody grabs your legs,

402
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,083
shout really loud and let us know, okay?

403
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,083
Okay.

404
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,583
Hey! Did you find him?

405
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,383
No, not yet.

406
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,183
Hold it.

407
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:11,183
Genta's 10 yen sized baldness, if I remember correctly...

408
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,783
Thief Kid!

409
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,983
I'll give this back to you.

410
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,483
It wasn't what I after to begin with!

411
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,483
When on earth did you...

412
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,683
What about Genta?

413
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:32,783
He's asleep under the floor.

414
00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:34,883
Fast asleep.

415
00:21:34,883 --> 00:21:36,383
I see.

416
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:38,583
So he just wanted to prove

417
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,883
that he could even disguise himself as a child.

418
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,383
Right!

419
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:44,283
I wanted to prove...

420
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:50,183
that nothing is impossible for Thief Kid!

421
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,083
-See you! -Hold it.

422
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,483
You've forgotten something.

423
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:00,883
That riot officer is Kid!

424
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:02,383
-Nab him! -What?

425
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:05,083
Kid?

426
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,883
If I make it into the woods in this disguise,

427
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:11,183
they wouldn't be able to tell me apart from the others.

428
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,083
"1 hour later" -Thief Kid detected!

429
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,583
6 kilometers west of the mountain temple.

430
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:43,583
It's Kid! There he is!

431
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,583
Why? How can they tell?

432
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,383
"I have obtained the Giraffe horns. -Thief Kid"

433
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:52,383
You're paying me back for passing me out, Kid!

434
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,983
"Next Episode"

435
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:57,383
I'm going to make French fries

436
00:23:57,383 --> 00:23:58,583
from the potatoes I dig up from the field

437
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,983
and have them as snacks with my beer!

438
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,383
Inspector, this dead body!

439
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:08,983
Doesn't it look like it's pointing at his face with his index finger?

440
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:13,783
Maybe he tried to let people know who killed him using his own face!

441
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:17,783
Why does he also have a wound on his forehead?

442
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:27,183
Next Conan, "Trap of the Roof Farm"
