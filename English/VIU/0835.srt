1
00:00:00,492 --> 00:00:02,792
Pops goes to visit a client because a warning note of a murder

2
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,392
was delivered to him.

3
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:06,192
But when he got there,

4
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:08,292
his client, Mr. Yoichi Takarada,

5
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:11,992
was stabbed to death by his secretary Mr. Haruyuki Shinkai.

6
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:16,692
But the fact is Mr. Takarada had been strangled to death

7
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:20,092
two hours before that!

8
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:21,092
Mr. Shinkai is accused of

9
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:23,792
"Haruyuki Shinkai (27)" -destruction of a corpse and was arrested.

10
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,992
In the meantime, from the fingerprints on the warning note of a murder,

11
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,692
"Koji Takarada (42)" -Mr. Takarada's younger brother, Mr. Koji,

12
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:30,392
is suspected of committing the crime

13
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:32,192
but thanks to the testimony of Mr. Shinkai,

14
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:34,592
Mr. Koji is spared of suspicion.

15
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:36,792
On the other hand, his wife Mika, is suspected.

16
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:37,792
"Mika Takarada (36)" -Furthermore,

17
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,092
with the discovery of a wig that served as concrete evidence,

18
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:42,992
suspicion about her seems even more conclusive.

19
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:47,092
A canvas stained black with crime.

20
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:49,492
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

21
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:51,592
Take a good look at the three suspects.

22
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:53,692
One of them is a big liar!

23
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:55,292
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:57,292
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,792
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:44,483
"The Man Who Died Twice (Part 2)"

27
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:47,483
"Mouri Detective Agency" -She still hasnt confessed?

28
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:50,983
She looked pretty sly.

29
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:53,183
You must have it tough, Inspector.

30
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:54,883
If Mrs. Takarada is framed

31
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,883
and made to look as if she had murdered her husband,

32
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:00,983
she would lose her right to inheritance

33
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:05,183
and his younger brother, Koji, would inherit everything.

34
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,983
He probably planned on doing so

35
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:11,983
but the problem is Mr. Shinkai's testimony of his alibi.

36
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,583
Was his testimony false?

37
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,383
What're you mumbling about?

38
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:20,183
What? No. Its nothing.

39
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:22,183
Yes.

40
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:25,983
About Mr. Haruyuki Shinkai who was arrested yesterday.

41
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:27,583
I have something I want to discuss.

42
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,183
Well, please have a seat.

43
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:34,883
I am Hisashi Teshima.

44
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:36,183
I see.

45
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,483
You work at a printing factory?

46
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:42,583
And? What did you want to say about Mr. Shinkai?

47
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,383
"Hisashi Teshima (28)" -Both Shinkai and I

48
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:48,683
were raised in the same orphanage.

49
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:53,183
That's why I came wanting to help make his crime a little lighter.

50
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:58,683
Since you seems to have witnessed him committing the crime.

51
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:00,983
Thats why you came to me?

52
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,083
Yes.

53
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,383
Shinkai is not a bad guy.

54
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:08,783
He was abandoned by a super selfish mother.

55
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,583
I feel sorry for him.

56
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,283
Super selfish mother?

57
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:14,683
Kid, stay out of this!

58
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:19,083
Mr. Teshima, I understand how you feel,

59
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,483
but I think you should discuss things like this with a lawyer.

60
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:26,083
Its not within my sphere of work.

61
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,883
A lawyer.

62
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:31,783
Yes. I'm sure a lawyer can be of help to you.

63
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:34,783
All right.

64
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:37,383
I'm sorry to have intruded on you despite your busy schedule.

65
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:39,983
No problem, I'm sorry I couldn't be of help to you.

66
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:41,083
Goodbye.

67
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,283
Pops, I'm going out for a while too.

68
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,283
Hey, brat.

69
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:50,983
What's with him?

70
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,183
Oh, boy. He doesnt know how to clean up.

71
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:01,283
What is it you want to confirm with me?

72
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:04,583
When Mr. Takarada was killed around 1 pm yesterday,

73
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,783
you were at a department store in Shinjuku, right?

74
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,383
Yeah. So what do you want confirm?

75
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:15,383
It seems that Mr. Shinkai, who testified to your alibi,

76
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:18,783
is saying that he lied about it

77
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:22,683
because he was being threatened by you.

78
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:24,183
That guy!

79
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,383
Why would he lie like that!

80
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:28,383
Is he lying?

81
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:32,183
Tell Detective Mouri who sent you here.

82
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:35,383
That it's no use suspecting me.

83
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:36,783
I've got other people to testify for me

84
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:39,583
besides that secretary too, you know?

85
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,983
What?

86
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,983
I was called out by phone yesterday

87
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:46,283
from a guy I dont know.

88
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:48,983
He told me that he knew of a good job to make money of.

89
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,883
I was stood up though.

90
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:54,183
But when I was waiting for that man...

91
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,683
Hey you! I found you, Koji!

92
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:57,883
Bummers!

93
00:05:57,883 --> 00:05:58,983
Hold it!

94
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,083
Give me back my money, Koji!

95
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:06,083
He's a guy named Yaginuma who I cheated money out of before.

96
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:10,183
I was composed even when the police suspected me

97
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:14,583
because I figured Yaginuma could testify for me in the end.

98
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,783
Although he may beat me to a pulp.

99
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:25,583
It seems he's not lying.

100
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,183
Isn't that what you call fishing in troubled water?

101
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:31,083
What does he mean by you ran an errand for me?

102
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:35,883
Listen. The one who murdered Takarada is his wife!

103
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:39,383
She called a man to summon Koji out

104
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:43,083
and erased his alibi to frame him as the perpetrator!

105
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:45,783
But Pops!

106
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:48,983
If so, dont you think its too sloppy?

107
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:51,183
What do you mean?

108
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:52,983
If she wanted to erase his alibi,

109
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,083
she'd want to call him out to a secluded place

110
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,283
with no other people around, right?

111
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,383
Because she didn't do so,

112
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:01,083
a witness like Mr. Yaginuma appeared.

113
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,583
Even the wig that serves as evidence is found

114
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,983
because it was thrown away very sloppily.

115
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:09,283
Geez, what a nuisance.

116
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:13,683
In other words, shes dumb, that selfish woman.

117
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,083
What?

118
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,383
Is it okay to finish it off with just one word, like dumb?

119
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:30,983
I think its unlikely that Mrs. Mika is the perpetrator.

120
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,183
Which means...

121
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:34,683
I see!

122
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:38,283
That's why it had to be found!

123
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,683
If so...

124
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:44,483
They found fingerprints on the murder warning note.

125
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:48,183
Mr. Koji Takarada, your fingerprints!

126
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:51,783
It was supposed to be Mika's fingerprints.

127
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,483
Wait a second.

128
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,883
It's only natural, right?

129
00:07:55,883 --> 00:08:00,683
Because we've found that he's the perpetrator and the case is closed.

130
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:02,383
Which means...

131
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:06,683
But, if so why did he do something like that?

132
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:08,683
He contrived it just for that?

133
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:12,383
Which means, it had all started from the beginning.

134
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,983
That brat. He's up to something again.

135
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,183
"Mouri Detective Agency"

136
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:26,483
Okay. I understand.

137
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:29,283
No, something kept bothering me.

138
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:31,383
Goodbye.

139
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:32,983
I thought so.

140
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:34,383
Thats why.

141
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,583
Hey, glasses kid!

142
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,983
What stupid idea did you come up with?

143
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,783
Next time you use my name,

144
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:41,083
I'll teach you a lesson, understand?

145
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:45,583
No matter what kind of background he may have come from...

146
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:49,283
He's quite famous

147
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:53,183
for loving to wear flashy things.

148
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:56,283
What if there's a blonde wig or something?

149
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:58,883
He's sure to wear it!

150
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:01,383
He'd be delighted.

151
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:03,583
That's why he took it there.

152
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,483
Just as expected of a great detective like Mr. Mouri.

153
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:16,783
Like what Mr. Mouri said, I got a call from one of the residents.

154
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:19,083
"Kinsaku Tomii (58)" -It was an anonymous caller.

155
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,483
But he said that a suspicious person seems to have gone upstairs.

156
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:25,683
That's why I went to make my rounds

157
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:28,683
and encountered that blonde woman.

158
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:31,383
Just as I thought, it wasn't a coincidence.

159
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:41,783
The only thing needed now is decisive evidence.

160
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:49,483
Come to think of it, back then...

161
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,883
Just what's going on, Inspector?

162
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,283
What do you mean?

163
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:07,183
You're the one that told me to bring these three here, right?

164
00:10:07,183 --> 00:10:08,283
What?

165
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:11,683
You're the one who said youve figured out the truth of the case.

166
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,183
So, now, people.

167
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:23,483
It's time for me to tell you all about this case.

168
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:36,186
We made a mistake from the very start.

169
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,786
We assumed that someone in the family was responsible for the murder,

170
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:42,186
and by doing so we immediately eliminated the real perpetrator.

171
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:45,586
Eliminated the real perpetrator?

172
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:46,786
Yes.

173
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:50,486
The perpetrator who killed Mr. Yoichi Takarada is...

174
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:53,686
Mr. Haruyuki Shinkai over there!

175
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:02,186
Mr. Shinkai is the perpetrator?

176
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:03,586
Mr. Mouri?

177
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:07,586
If he strangled Mr. Takarada to death,

178
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:13,186
then why did he have to stab Mr. Takarada again two hours later?

179
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:15,786
Rather to begin with

180
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:18,286
I have an alibi at the time

181
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,686
when the president was killed.

182
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:22,486
It's true that Mr. Shinkai confessed that

183
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:25,786
as long as Mr. Takarada was around,

184
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,786
new victims will keep being created so he had plans to kill him.

185
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:33,686
But that's not why he murdered Mr. Takarada.

186
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:37,186
Mr. Shinkai, as Mr. Takarada's secretary,

187
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:42,886
you knew that Mika remained married to Mr. Takarada for his money.

188
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:46,186
Where is all this coming from all of a sudden?

189
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:48,986
Mr. Takarada probably told you himself

190
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:51,686
that he had only six months to live.

191
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:54,386
In other words, in six months,

192
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,286
she'd be inheriting the entire estate

193
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:59,286
and insurance money that shed long waited for.

194
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,786
And you couldn't stand that.

195
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:06,886
That's when you came up with the idea

196
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:08,886
of killing Mr. Takarada

197
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:12,686
and framing Mika as the killer.

198
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:16,986
Then she would lose the right to inherit his estate

199
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,386
and his insurance money.

200
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:24,286
In other words, it's not that you really wanted to kill Mr. Takarada,

201
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,586
but you killed him only to frame Mika up

202
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:29,686
for killing her husband.

203
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:32,486
What?

204
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:36,286
You're not making any sense.

205
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:40,386
It seems you have your mind set on making me the real perpetrator,

206
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:43,086
but you just contradicted yourself.

207
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:45,486
If I wanted to frame her as the murderer,

208
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:50,286
I would've had to put her fingerprints on the murder warning note!

209
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:53,386
But my fingerprints were on it.

210
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,186
True.

211
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:57,386
It's contradictory.

212
00:12:57,386 --> 00:13:02,286
When Koji, the perfect pawn, came to the house,

213
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:04,886
you put your plan into action.

214
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:08,286
Why aren't you answering my counterargument?

215
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:10,586
You created a murder warning note

216
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:13,486
with Kojis fingerprints on it then sent it.

217
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:16,286
So, I'm telling you that's contradictory!

218
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,486
That arrived yesterday.

219
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:21,086
I'd like to see them try it!

220
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:30,586
Later, you urged Mr. Takarada to confine himself to this study alone.

221
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:31,686
While on the other hand,

222
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:35,786
you told Mika that the president wanted her

223
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:38,686
to organize the storeroom to make sure she stayed at home.

224
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:41,086
Ma'am, you were asked by your husband

225
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,886
to organize the storeroom, correct?

226
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:47,486
Yes, but I wasn't told to do so directly.

227
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:50,786
I relayed the message from the president to her.

228
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:53,086
You planned this so she would have no one

229
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:54,986
to back up her alibi.

230
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:58,386
But the house maid was at the house too.

231
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:01,586
You knew that she'd be going out, didnt you?

232
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:02,586
"Kyoko, Afternoon, Hospital" -Yes.

233
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:06,086
Not only Koji, but I'm sure that everyone else knew too.

234
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:08,186
Because as soon as I got the appointment,

235
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:09,186
I marked it on the calendar like this

236
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,586
because I didn't want to inconvenience anybody.

237
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:14,986
I may have heard about it, but I forgot.

238
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:17,186
Then, you called me,

239
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,386
pretending to be Mr. Takarada.

240
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,286
Since I never met him,

241
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:24,286
I had no idea what he would sound like.

242
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:27,386
You have no proof either that I made the call.

243
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:29,686
You also pretended to be an imaginary person

244
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:33,086
and got Koji to leave the house.

245
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:35,186
Was that you?

246
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:38,286
You dont have proof that it was me then, either.

247
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:42,786
Then, at 1 pm you came to this condominium.

248
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:46,586
I followed Koji and was in Shinjuku

249
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,386
among the crowd of parents and children there who came to watch.

250
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:50,286
The hero show.

251
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:52,086
If you insist you followed him there,

252
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:56,186
then perhaps you can tell us about the commotion that occurred.

253
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,486
Theres no way you didnt see it

254
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:00,986
if you were really there.

255
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:03,386
Hey, you! I found you, Koji!

256
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:04,786
Bummers!

257
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:06,686
Hold it!

258
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:10,286
You could've known about the hero show ahead of time,

259
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,586
and you could've assumed that

260
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:14,186
it would naturally be crowded with parents and children too.

261
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:18,786
Even without going there.

262
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:23,786
Of course, you're suspecting me because you have proof?

263
00:15:23,786 --> 00:15:25,486
Yesterday around 1 pm,

264
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:27,686
you avoided the security cameras

265
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:29,986
and came into this condominium from the back door.

266
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:31,586
You gained access into his room

267
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:33,586
by pretending you had urgent business to attend to or something.

268
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:38,386
And strangled Mr. Takarada to death.

269
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:40,386
Then you left only the murder warning note that you brought

270
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,586
from the condominium room,

271
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:44,486
you wore a blonde wig,

272
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,586
disguised yourself as a woman resident

273
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:49,886
and called the condominium manager

274
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:51,286
to make him witness you.

275
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:55,286
You put several strands of Mika's hair on the wig that you used,

276
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,886
and to make the investigator discover this wig,

277
00:15:57,886 --> 00:15:59,586
you shoved it into the belongings of a person,

278
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:02,086
who was known for his love for disguising,

279
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,886
then came back to this room again

280
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:08,786
and waited for me at 3 pm the appointed time.

281
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:10,586
It must be beyond on the other side.

282
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,286
Geez, you're always.

283
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,586
This is not play, you know?

284
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:18,286
Then you waited for the right time and...

285
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,686
Die!

286
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:27,686
You called me to make me witness that decisive moment.

287
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,286
Since I have the absolute trust of the police!

288
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:37,586
Nobody would attempt to kill a man

289
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:40,586
who is already dead.

290
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:43,986
You hid behind the blind spot of this stereotyped conception.

291
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:50,386
I thought the president was alive.

292
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:52,986
When I came to visit him,

293
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,486
he seemed to be taking a nap,

294
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:58,086
so I figured I should take this chance to stab him.

295
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:01,586
After being arrested for mutilating a body,

296
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:05,486
you fabricated plausible sounding lies,

297
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:09,186
while waiting for your schemes to take effect.

298
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:11,986
Those were all fabricated lies?

299
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:13,886
And just as you planned,

300
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:18,186
Koji was suspected due to his fingerprints are on the warning note.

301
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,986
That's what doesn't make sense!

302
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:25,886
That's precisely what made me suspect you.

303
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:27,386
Because of those fingerprints,

304
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,786
Koji was almost concluded as the murderer

305
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:32,386
and the case was about to be closed.

306
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,086
Therefore, Mika was ecstatic.

307
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:38,986
I've been waiting all this time for this moment to come!

308
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:42,886
Thank you so much, Koji.

309
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:46,986
She didn't have to wait six months ahead of time anymore.

310
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:50,286
However, the situation suddenly changed.

311
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,486
Now the situations reversed

312
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:54,986
because I've got somebody to prove my alibi

313
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:58,386
while you don't.

314
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:01,086
Mika now, had nobody to back up her alibi.

315
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:03,486
And furthermore, with the discovery of the material evidence.

316
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:05,986
It can't be...

317
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,486
I know nothing about the wig.

318
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:12,986
I was here at home at the time Takarada was killed!

319
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:15,486
Believe me, officers!

320
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:16,586
In other words,

321
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,286
the perpetrator deliberately

322
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:21,386
made a murder warning note with Kojis fingerprints on it.

323
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:25,886
So that Mika would feel a moment of ecstasy

324
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:29,386
before suddenly being thrown into despair!

325
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:33,086
Oh, no.

326
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:36,386
It was a reversal filled with hatred for Mika.

327
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:42,086
Of course it started when you reversed your alibi testimony.

328
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:45,886
Thats when I began suspecting you as the perpetrator,

329
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:47,786
Mr. Shinkai.

330
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:51,386
This is all too forced.

331
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:53,886
Please show me the evidence, Mr. Mouri!

332
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:57,186
All your deductions are nothing more than hypothesis!

333
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,886
Since you're so careful,

334
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:02,986
theres likely no physical evidence.

335
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,486
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

336
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:08,886
So, you admit that it was all your imagination.

337
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:11,286
But, you were too careful.

338
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:13,386
Just what do you mean?

339
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:17,786
The resident living across this room saw you yesterday.

340
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:19,786
What?

341
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:22,386
It happened around 2:30 pm.

342
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:27,186
Because it was more than an hour before what was reported in the papers,

343
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:29,686
they seem to have thought it was irrelevant to the case.

344
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:36,086
In other words, although you were supposed to be here by 2:30,

345
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:38,486
you stabbed Mr. Takarada at 3 pm.

346
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:42,786
In other words, your story of stabbing Mr. Takarada

347
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:46,186
because he seemed to be taking a nap

348
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,986
doesn't make sense!

349
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:52,786
But, Mr. Mouri...

350
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:55,586
It won't serve to support the killing.

351
00:19:57,786 --> 00:19:59,086
True.

352
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:01,286
No, its over.

353
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,986
It was supposed to be perfect.

354
00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:09,286
But exposing even a single flaw means I've lost.

355
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,286
Of course I was careful, Mr. Mouri.

356
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:17,586
Although our appointment was at 3 pm,

357
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:21,386
you could come earlier.

358
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,686
Thats why I rushed back over here, and was looking out the window for you,

359
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:27,586
so I would be ready no matter what time you came.

360
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:29,386
If the timing was wrong,

361
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:33,086
I would be able to hide behind the blind spot of stereotyped conception.

362
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:35,686
Which means, Mr. Shinkai...

363
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,086
Yes.

364
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:39,286
Everything is just as Mr. Mouri had said.

365
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:40,386
Everything.

366
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,286
Why?

367
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:48,986
Why'd you go as far as to kill Takarada just to frame me?

368
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,586
It shouldnt matter to you

369
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:54,386
whether I inherit his estate or get insurance money!

370
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,686
True.

371
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:58,286
Why, Shinkai?

372
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:02,286
Its because he saw his mother in you.

373
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:07,586
Mr. Teshima told me.

374
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:11,786
About Mr. Shinkais selfish mother you mentioned?

375
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:16,186
I loved my father.

376
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:17,786
Although he was physically weak,

377
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:20,786
he was knowledgeable and kind.

378
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:24,886
But Mother shunned Father.

379
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:27,586
Nevertheless, she wouldnt agree to a divorce.

380
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,686
Father eventually passed away,

381
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:31,686
and as soon as she got hold of his insurance money,

382
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:34,886
she disappeared off somewhere with a man.

383
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:39,986
Abandoning me who had just turned 10 years old.

384
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:43,886
But that has nothing to do with me.

385
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,686
I know!

386
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:49,686
I know but watching you made me...

387
00:23:17,286 --> 00:23:21,686
Apparently, the perpetrator mutilated the body to camouflage the murder.

388
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:26,886
I solved another case without knowing it again!

389
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:29,386
Its a miracle, you must be God!

390
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:31,286
God? I see.

391
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,786
So, I'm a god?

392
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:39,786
Its a miracle you haven't realized what's going on yet.

393
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:45,886
"Next Episode" -Let's make a girls high school band, us three!

394
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:48,286
Who's going to be the vocalist?

395
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:49,286
-What? -What?

396
00:23:49,286 --> 00:23:52,186
Sorry, I'm tone-deaf.

397
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:55,386
Hagie...

398
00:23:58,986 --> 00:24:02,586
Haven't we met before?

399
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:03,886
No.

400
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:06,186
I think today is the first time.

401
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:12,386
