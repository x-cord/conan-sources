1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,199
A murder occurred at a theater

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,480
holding a lecture titled "The Great Detective Mori Kogoro Reveals His Secrets."

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,778
Panelist and actor Inokoshi Kenichiro-san

4
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:17,008
was found murdered inside his locked changing room.

5
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:20,627
I knew it.

6
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:24,528
The body's keeping the door shut instead of the lock.

7
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:26,548
In other words, this is...

8
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:29,618
Yeah.

9
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:33,267
It's a locked room mystery.

10
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:34,158
What?

11
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:38,597
The old man solved the locked room mystery,

12
00:00:38,598 --> 00:00:40,898
and it seemed as though the suspect had been identified.

13
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:46,188
But the suspect Reizei Mokichi-san confessed to...

14
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,177
I knew you'd spot my cane trick eventually.

15
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,658
But I killed someone else.

16
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:58,798
Wha—

17
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,168
Wh-What?!

18
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:12,007
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness!

19
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:13,887
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills!

20
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:17,638
The old man's reasoning was right, but in reality, there are two cases!

21
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,607
Always determining the one truth

22
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:21,347
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

23
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,768
his name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:11,298
Mori Kogoro's Grand Lecture (Part Two)

25
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,832
Based on Reizei-san's confession,

26
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,933
an investigation of his crime and search for corroborating evidence were conducted.

27
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:27,313
Hishida Junko (50) HISHIDA Hall Owner

28
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:38,573
Once again, we have an announcement for our guests.

29
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:45,942
With Inspector Megure's approval,

30
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:50,083
the start time of the old man's lecture was delayed an hour.

31
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,213
Anyway, I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience,

32
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,213
but we appreciate your cooperation.

33
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:57,743
I understand.

34
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:00,223
I'm in a bit of a bind though.

35
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:01,973
What do you mean?

36
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:07,723
I'm honored I was invited to appear on the panel.

37
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:11,302
But I have plans immediately after this.

38
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:13,332
I can't accommodate a one hour delay.

39
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,603
I see.

40
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:19,863
And you verified my alibi, didn't you?

41
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:21,602
Of course.

42
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:22,703
In that case...

43
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:28,793
But that alibi applies only to Inokoshi Kenichiro-san's murder.

44
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:36,222
Reizei may have confessed to Hishida Junko-san's murder,

45
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,932
but we haven't even determined the time of death—

46
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:39,423
Inspector!

47
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:42,923
We've determined the time of the crime.

48
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:51,223
I just couldn't. I just couldn't accept it!

49
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:57,242
Disregarding the achievements of the late previous owner—

50
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:01,493
rather, her father, was her style.

51
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:06,623
I wanted her to understand, so we continued our conversation there.

52
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:08,703
But...

53
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:11,873
You never give up. I've had enough of you.

54
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:13,873
Wh-What?!

55
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,933
Take a look at this and this.

56
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:39,802
Th-This is...

57
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:44,842
Wasn't Inokoshi-san's time of death 2:50?

58
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:45,952
Yes.

59
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:51,033
That's the time the victim's pocket watch broken by the weapon was stopped at.

60
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:57,272
Which means Inokoshi-san wasn't killed by Reizei-san.

61
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:01,043
In other words, there's another culprit.

62
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:03,902
I know it's a coincidence, but this isn't good.

63
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:07,492
That's not all that's not good, Inspector.

64
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:08,263
What?

65
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:10,462
Have you forgotten?

66
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:14,013
The two murders took place at practically the same time.

67
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,162
Aside from Reizei-san,

68
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:21,773
the people whose alibis we verified for Inokoshi-san's murder were all innocent.

69
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:23,133
In other words...

70
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:27,403
Not a single person doesn't have an alibi.

71
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:40,482
Is it true that the owner Hishida was killed as well?

72
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,152
And the culprit was...

73
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,272
Yeah.

74
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:47,622
That old man Reizei, the manager before me.

75
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:50,433
Did he kill Inokoshi-san, too?

76
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:52,782
No, that wasn't him.

77
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:55,563
No, that wasn't him.

78
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:59,603
Y-You mean there's another murderer?

79
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:01,063
No way.

80
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:05,782
A-Are you sure we shouldn't cancel the lecture?

81
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:09,042
If they don't arrest the culprit...

82
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:10,563
Don't worry.

83
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:14,462
None other than the great detective Sleeping Kogoro is here.

84
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,833
I'm sure he'll solve the case.

85
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:20,962
So focus on assisting the audience.

86
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:25,962
And don't mention the case until the police explain the situation later.

87
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:28,032
U-Understood.

88
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,082
We'll be standing by.

89
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,223
Huh?

90
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:34,643
Come to think of it, where's Mei-chan?

91
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:39,353
Do you not care about the game? It's starting.

92
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:44,003
I know, but we can't leave now.

93
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:48,363
We have less than thirty minutes until the old man's lecture starts.

94
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:53,743
Maybe so, but we need to come with an excuse to tell those kids.

95
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:56,162
You can handle that.

96
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:57,312
Jeez.

97
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,003
Excuse me!

98
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:02,593
Kogoro-no-ojisan asked me to do something.

99
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,763
So, do you have any leads?

100
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,283
Huh? Nope.

101
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:13,493
You're unbelievable.

102
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:18,243
What's that?

103
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:22,093
This wasn't here before, right?

104
00:08:23,443 --> 00:08:25,822
Are those pages from a magazine or something?

105
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:27,653
Looks like they were torn out.

106
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:33,233
Judging by the quality of the paper and print, they're probably from the same magazine.

107
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:41,353
There's been a guard standing in front of this changing room since after the scene was examined.

108
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:46,993
So they reached in through the window so they wouldn't be spotted?

109
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:51,982
The question is who left it here, and for what purpose.

110
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,683
Not only that, but now, after the murder.

111
00:08:57,673 --> 00:08:58,733
Could it be?

112
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:18,463
Found it.

113
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:27,793
I knew it.

114
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:31,482
Are they different pages from the same magazine?

115
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:32,982
And the one underneath is...

116
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:35,803
Is it from a gravure article?

117
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:40,183
It's probably the first page after the cover.

118
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:45,062
I feel like there's some meaning behind the way they're overlapped.

119
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:48,502
Either way, it could be some kind of message.

120
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:49,532
Yeah.

121
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,193
Hey.

122
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:57,953
If you found something, shouldn't you let Mori-san know?

123
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:01,743
Right, little detective?

124
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:15,342
Huh? What about this?

125
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:18,143
I thought it might be some kind of message.

126
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:20,713
From who?

127
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:22,952
I don't know.

128
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:26,573
Jeez. You went off and found something trivial again.

129
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:30,063
I'm sure it was just a prank.

130
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:32,323
I'm busy over here.

131
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:33,943
Stop bothering me.

132
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:42,083
Excuse me, Inspector. And?

133
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:48,463
We thought you solved the trick used to create the locked room,

134
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:54,213
but if Reizei-san's cane wasn't used to prop up the chair with the body in it,

135
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:56,723
then what was?

136
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:01,493
I've been thinking about that, too.

137
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,432
Have you figured it out?

138
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,453
No, I have no idea.

139
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:13,502
In any case, there isn't a single person without an alibi.

140
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:16,743
We can't proceed with our investigation if we can't solve that mystery.

141
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:23,743
They must've used something in place of a cane.

142
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,892
In place of a cane?

143
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:29,333
That's it. They used that!

144
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:31,673
Hey, mister.

145
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:37,053
Maybe it's wrong to assume it was a long object like a cane.

146
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:42,933
But recently they sell telescoping canes, too.

147
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:43,933
What?

148
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:48,242
A telescoping cane?

149
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:50,143
This is why I can't stand amateurs!

150
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:52,703
Stay out of—

151
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:55,823
Wh-What is it, Mori-kun?

152
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:59,613
Th-That's it! I've figured it out, Inspector!

153
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:01,723
Really?

154
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:04,453
Tsukinogi Hideki-sama

155
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:11,953
Tsukinogi Hideki-san.

156
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:15,002
You've retired from bodyguarding,

157
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:18,593
but you still carry your gear with you.

158
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,202
Yes, that.

159
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:25,103
I'm talking about your telescoping nightstick.

160
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:29,402
It's a habit I developed over the years.

161
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:32,483
I feel anxious without it.

162
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,983
What about it?

163
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:39,363
Don't play dumb.

164
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,493
You extended your nightstick,

165
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:48,083
pressed it against the back of the chair supporting Inokoshi-san's body, tilted it,

166
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:53,533
and withdrew it while gradually closing the door, creating the locked room.

167
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,253
Am I wrong?

168
00:12:57,313 --> 00:13:02,303
Would you hand over your nightstick, Tsukinogi-san?

169
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:08,813
We'd like to see if the end of your nightstick matches the mark left on the chair.

170
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:11,273
That's fine with me.

171
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:17,563
But this was actually stolen from me.

172
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:20,823
Stolen?

173
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:24,892
I went to the bathroom immediately after arriving.

174
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:28,342
I took it off and left it in this changing room, and it went missing.

175
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:31,413
But when I just checked, it had been returned.

176
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:35,213
I don't know who it was, but I thought it was strange.

177
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:38,713
You think we'll believe that excuse?

178
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:44,013
In that case, don't I have an alibi?

179
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:47,683
I was with several others when the murder took place.

180
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:53,813
Weren't you, the police, the ones who verified that?

181
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:55,813
W-Well...

182
00:13:57,613 --> 00:14:02,102
Forgive me, Mori-san, but I'm disappointed in you.

183
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:06,453
Is this the best the great Sleeping Kogoro can do?

184
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:12,203
Hey, about the time of the crime...

185
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:19,713
Wasn't that the time shown on the victim's pocket watch that was broken by the weapon?

186
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:24,133
That's it!

187
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:31,373
They broke it beforehand and set the hands pointing at 2:50.

188
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:37,392
Then they put it in the breast pocket of the victim after they killed him.

189
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,112
That's right.

190
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:43,783
In other words, the murder actually took place earlier than that.

191
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:48,132
Takagi, Chiba. Reconfirm their alibis immediately.

192
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,033
Yes, sir.

193
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:57,022
At the originally determined time of 2:50,

194
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,922
Tsukinogi-san met with event company president Tsunohazu-san

195
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:04,053
and staff member Amagi-san.

196
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:08,222
But no one saw Tsukinogi-san during the ten minutes before that.

197
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:12,193
We spoke with the others, and they all gave the same answer.

198
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:16,593
Can you explain that, Tsukinogi-san?

199
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:19,882
What can I say?

200
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:22,182
I simply didn't encounter anyone else.

201
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:25,322
That doesn't mean I did it.

202
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:28,243
Well, yes, but...

203
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:31,993
Then what's that shining on your lapel?

204
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:33,043
What?

205
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:42,083
Maybe it's a piece of glass from the pocket watch broken by the weapon.

206
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:48,922
If it's a match,

207
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:52,582
there's no way a piece of glass could've gotten on you

208
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,353
if the pocket watch was inside the victim's jacket was broken,

209
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,412
so it must have been broken beforehand.

210
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:04,832
And the pieces could only have gotten on the person who broke it.

211
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,613
Right, Mori-san?

212
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:07,693
What?

213
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:10,243
Uh... Yes, exactly.

214
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,863
I was just about to say the same thing, Inspector.

215
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:22,003
Well, Tsukinogi-san?

216
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,683
I-I couldn't forgive him.

217
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:31,873
I couldn't forgive him!

218
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:35,343
According to Tsukinogi-san's confession,

219
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:41,193
one year ago while guarding Inokoshi-san, he caught a woman stalking him.

220
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:46,113
She was actually Inokoshi-san's ex-girlfriend who was seeking an apology

221
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:49,283
and damages for domestic violence.

222
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:54,863
After explaining the situation and turning the woman over to the police,

223
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,372
not only was he fired by Inokoshi-san,

224
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:01,113
but rumors of his uselessness were spread.

225
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:04,832
Because of that, he and the security company he manages

226
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,003
would be forced into bankruptcy soon.

227
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:12,182
You did it, Mei-chan!

228
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:14,163
You beat the great detective!

229
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:18,262
She's kind of amazing, isn't she?

230
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,683
Huh? Yeah, she sure is.

231
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:23,673
Her detective skills certainly are impressive, but...

232
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,212
We knew you could do it.

233
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,943
It's just a coincidence.

234
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:29,632
Something bothering you?

235
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,923
No, really.

236
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:37,702
In any case, the two murders were solved,

237
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:40,493
and the old man's lecture was to be held.

238
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,542
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

239
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:47,963
The HISHIDA Hall renovation commemorative lecture,

240
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:54,593
presented by the Sleeping Kogoro, Mori Kogoro himself,

241
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:59,353
"The Great Detective Mori Kogoro Reveals His Secrets" will now begin.

242
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:10,042
I'm Hanai Rika, Nichiuri TV announcer, and I'll be your MC today.

243
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:12,002
Rika-pon!

244
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,622
Thank you.

245
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:17,472
Now let's bring the star of the day onstage.

246
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:20,623
Everyone, please put your hands together

247
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:24,593
for the great detective Mori Kogoro!

248
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:29,043
Thank you, thank you.

249
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:31,153
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,013
You can do it, Dad.

251
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,793
Red leather, yellow leather. Red leather, yellow leather.

252
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,523
Focus, focus.

253
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:55,922
Thank you for waiting!

254
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:58,283
As I was just introduced,

255
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:02,033
I am the great detective

256
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,943
Mori Kogoro!

257
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:12,793
I should redeem myself here.

258
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:31,243
It's no use. I can't sleep.

259
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:38,453
The case has already been solved, so I won't be sleeping today.

260
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:40,823
What?

261
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:42,823
Seriously? I was looking forward to this!

262
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:48,663
I'll tell you all about it eventually.

263
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:55,013
The subject of today's lecture is a great detective's secrets,

264
00:19:55,753 --> 00:20:01,223
and as such, I will be telling you all about my abundant experience.

265
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:05,563
Good. Nice one, Dad.

266
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:13,093
Then another panelist arrived.

267
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:18,052
Anyway, that's enough from me.

268
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:21,673
Thank you for listening.

269
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:25,472
That was the great detective Mori Kogoro-san.

270
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:28,373
Let's give him another round of applause.

271
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,623
Thank you, thank you!

272
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:43,032
After a short break,

273
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,643
we'll move onto the panel.

274
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,372
The audience was informed that due to certain circumstances,

275
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:53,692
panelists Inokoshi Kenichiro-san and Tsukinogi Hideki-san

276
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:56,653
were no longer able to attend.

277
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,382
The event organizers decided to keep quiet about the case

278
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,753
until the police made their official announcement.

279
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:06,373
Thanks for waiting.

280
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:12,373
Mom!

281
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,242
Sounds like you had some trouble.

282
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:16,583
I just heard the news.

283
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:21,383
But thanks to Mori-sensei, the cases were solved.

284
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:25,592
I know the circumstances are unusual, but everyone loved the lecture.

285
00:21:25,593 --> 00:21:30,023
Keep up the same energy during the panel, Kisaki-sensei.

286
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:32,523
Sure.

287
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:41,403
But doesn't that mean it'll be just the two of us going onstage?

288
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:43,703
Something wrong with that?

289
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:45,942
Dad!

290
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:48,532
No, as long as you don't have a problem with it.

291
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:49,783
Mom...

292
00:21:51,573 --> 00:21:53,913
Well, actually...

293
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:57,313
About that...

294
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:01,513
What?!

295
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:10,093
I'm Tsukuba Mei.

296
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:12,563
I look forward to working with you.

297
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:49,363
We're looking for pages torn from this magazine.

298
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:52,373
They should be someplace visible.

299
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:55,623
All right! I'm not sure what's going on, but let's do this!

300
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:56,873
Yeah!

301
00:23:57,313 --> 00:24:00,932
It seems you have some questions for the Sleeping Kogoro.

302
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:02,472
Oh, yes.

303
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:08,633
It's actually about a murder that happened at a certain college one year ago.

304
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:10,133
What?

305
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:15,793
The next episode of Conan is "Mori Kogoro's Grand Lecture, Part Three!"
