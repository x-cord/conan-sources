1
00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:05,712
Sergeant Momosaki and Lieutenant Yagi were murdered

2
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:08,333
one after another in the policewoman serial murder case.

3
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:15,433
It was determined that the dying messages they left behind pointed to no parking signs.

4
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:18,143
And that signified...

5
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:25,533
I had no idea Japanese road signs were based off English ones.

6
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:28,242
England...

7
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:32,793
Japanese road signs are based off English ones...

8
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:37,323
That's it! So that's how it is!

9
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:39,842
Listen, Detective Chiba...

10
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:42,133
Oh, sorry. Someone's calling.

11
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:57,143
Hello? Hello?

12
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:02,493
Hey, what are you doing?!

13
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:11,533
Damn! You had two phones?

14
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:28,693
Ch-Chiba-kun...

15
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,412
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

16
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,222
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

17
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:40,702
The culprit's identity is becoming clear!

18
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:43,052
Hurry to Patrolwoman Miike, Detective Chiba!

19
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:44,632
Always determining the one truth

20
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,342
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

21
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:48,743
his name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:32,763
Target: MPD Transportation Department (Part Four)

23
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:36,755
Hello, Sato-san? It was a week ago after all.

24
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:40,824
One week ago, there was a woman who committed suicide

25
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,265
by jumping from the roof of an office building on Second Street in Haido City.

26
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,494
Her name was Midorikawa Aiko.

27
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:47,594
Since she worked at the building she jumped from,

28
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,275
her colleagues were able to confirm her identity right then and there.

29
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,525
She resided in room 702 of the apartment building.

30
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:57,634
Left at the scene were her shoes and phone.

31
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:00,535
Later, a suicide note was discovered in her desk as well.

32
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,035
And, in fact...

33
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:05,285
You know who the culprit is?

34
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:09,295
You know who killed Sergeant Momosaki and Lieutenant Yagi?

35
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:10,395
Yeah.

36
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:13,234
The culprit is one of the traffic violators

37
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:17,545
they arrested one week earlier, right?

38
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:18,695
Yeah.

39
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:22,414
They were extremely angry when they were brought into the police station,

40
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:24,484
so that's the lead we're following.

41
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:31,315
They were Aono, who forgot his license and was using his phone while driving,

42
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:36,065
Akamine, who was riding a motorcycle against traffic without a helmet,

43
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:41,995
and Shiroyama, whose inspection was expired and forgot to wear his seat belt, right?

44
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:47,075
And most likely, both the first victim Sergeant Momosaki was pointing at

45
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:53,085
and the second victim Lieutenant Yagi was facing a no parking sign.

46
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:58,484
Do you know why signs prohibiting something are a circle with a diagonal line?

47
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,965
N-No, I don't.

48
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:05,374
Because the shape is combination of the letters N and O.

49
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,174
In other words, it means "no" in English.

50
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:12,104
No parking signs are a "no" layered on top of a blue sign.

51
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,024
Which means blue (ao) plus "no" is ao-no.

52
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:16,855
The culprit is Aono-san.

53
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,615
Blue plus no makes Aono?

54
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:24,664
Do you really think they made a lame pun with their dying messages?

55
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:26,704
That's what I thought at first,

56
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:30,375
but if that's the only thing you saw in the vicinity, wouldn't you do the same?

57
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:34,314
Dying messages can't be noticed by the culprit,

58
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:37,234
but it's also not good if no one understands them.

59
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:41,244
Most people don't know the history of road signs,

60
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:45,114
but it's likely an officer of the Transportation Department would notice.

61
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:47,025
It's the perfect message.

62
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:49,904
Then there's 7155.

63
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:50,725
Huh?

64
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:55,485
The number Lieutenant Yagi left on her phone that doesn't connect to anyone.

65
00:05:55,695 --> 00:06:00,615
It probably refers to road traffic law article 71, section 5-5.

66
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:04,924
While operating a vehicle, drivers must not hold their phone in their hand

67
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:07,335
or look at its screen.

68
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:13,294
In other words, I think we can assume it refers to Aono-san,

69
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:15,005
who was using his phone while driving.

70
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:21,005
We just received word from Sergeant Chiba.

71
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:24,474
We've received information identifying Aono Kengo

72
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:28,015
as the suspect in the policewoman serial murder case.

73
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,374
I'm ordering the emergency deployment of police forces

74
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,015
in a wide area to search for Aono Kengo.

75
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:38,145
He's a dangerous criminal who has murdered two of our own.

76
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:41,754
For the dignity of the police, we must arrest him!

77
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:42,655
Yes, sir!

78
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:46,915
Yes, sir.

79
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:48,405
Oh, but...

80
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:53,265
It was Conan-kun who figured all of this out.

81
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,145
The Sleeping Kogoro's adviser...

82
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,175
I suppose I'm not surprised.

83
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,065
Aono hasn't returned to his home.

84
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:09,935
According to his neighbors, they haven't seen him for several days.

85
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:12,805
According to Aono's coworkers,

86
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:16,684
this afternoon they told a woman who came to ask about his whereabouts

87
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:20,065
that he was probably at his girlfriend's place if he wasn't at home.

88
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:23,414
Yes, it was definitely Lieutenant Yagi.

89
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,075
I confirmed her identity using a photo.

90
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:39,295
Sato-san, look!

91
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,654
It's so noisy.

92
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,385
There are a lot of patrol cars driving around.

93
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:52,805
Of course there are.

94
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:57,825
They're looking for the suspect who murdered two police officers.

95
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:04,995
So I recommend you release me immediately and turn yourself in!

96
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,875
I told you...

97
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:14,205
If you want me to release you, just tell me already.

98
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,955
She's in here, isn't she?

99
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:21,715
That damn woman named Yumi.

100
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:24,215
Why do you want to know?

101
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:29,345
I'm going to tell her I found your phone and have her come here to get it.

102
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:33,715
Then I'll push her out the window and break her head open,

103
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:36,695
just like my girlfriend Aiko.

104
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:44,565
Though she might trigger a trap first and end up skewered instead.

105
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,255
In that case...

106
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,485
I wouldn't tell you even if I knew!

107
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:54,734
What?

108
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:59,745
Aono Kengo's girlfriend killed herself by jumping off the building she worked at?

109
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:02,244
One week ago?

110
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:03,304
Yes.

111
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:06,424
Apparently she couldn't take the power harassment

112
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:08,255
she was suffering at the hands of her bosses.

113
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:12,735
Aono received a text from his girlfriend that said "goodbye."

114
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:17,265
He rushed out of work, got into his car without his license,

115
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:23,425
and was caught by Sergeant Momosaki and Lieutenant Yagi while he was on his way to her.

116
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:27,775
So he resented them for stopping him.

117
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:31,615
He believes he could've prevented his girlfriend's suicide if that hadn't happened.

118
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,784
But according to the local jurisdiction,

119
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:37,365
she called Aono immediately after texting him, right?

120
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:41,434
Yes, but Aono didn't answer,

121
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,625
so she left a voicemail instead.

122
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,004
She was using a recording app on her phone,

123
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:50,635
so they were able to confirm the message's contents at the scene.

124
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:52,355
Her phone, huh?

125
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:57,474
Speaking of phones, they received a phone call while questioning Aono,

126
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:59,645
and he was extremely upset.

127
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:00,675
Yes.

128
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:03,775
The officers who came to help question them heard what he said.

129
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,854
You're seriously talking about karaoke?!

130
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,695
Someone might die, and you're talking about karaoke?!

131
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:14,014
The two of them had a mutual friend named Yumiko who they went to karaoke with.

132
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:17,745
But both of them called her Yumi.

133
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:19,164
Yumi?

134
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:23,214
Did Aono hear that name then and plan to kill Yumi-san next?

135
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:27,754
If you're looking for someone named Yumi among their acquaintances,

136
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:28,875
it's certainly possible.

137
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:31,134
Where is Yumi-san now?

138
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:34,355
I've been calling her, but she won't answer.

139
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:38,645
A text?

140
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:44,504
Conan-kun just sent a message to Takagi-san's phone.

141
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:45,934
Conan-kun did?

142
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,775
Due to certain circumstances, I'm driving him home right now.

143
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:52,814
Is the number I just sent him Yumi-san's number?

144
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,154
What? Yumi called you?

145
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,554
I don't know if it was Yumi-san,

146
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:02,114
but I heard four sets of a fingernail tapping a phone seven times.

147
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:06,664
After that, I heard a male voice say, "Hey, what are you doing?!" before they hung up.

148
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,704
I thought it might be...

149
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:10,214
What? Wait.

150
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:12,175
This is Miike's number.

151
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:15,104
What? Miike, Yumi-san's subordinate?

152
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:18,515
Come to think of it, we can't get in touch with Miike either.

153
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:23,054
It's possible the culprit figured out she's a police officer

154
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:25,264
and kidnapped her so he can lure Yumi-san to him and murder her!

155
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:26,265
What?

156
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:29,544
If he plans to call her to him, then he can't be that far.

157
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:33,155
What places are nearby that the culprit would be familiar with?

158
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:37,574
Do you know what Aono does for work?

159
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,014
Y-Yes...

160
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:41,575
I think he was a remodeler.

161
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,534
An English school, an out-of-business arcade,

162
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:52,125
a planetarium, a sports facility, a restaurant...

163
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,505
It's no use.

164
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:56,345
There are more places being remodeled than I expected.

165
00:11:56,865 --> 00:12:01,765
The only clue we have is the four sets of seven taps that Detective Chiba heard.

166
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:05,435
Damn it! Where are they?!

167
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,330
A remodeler...

168
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,070
Four sets of seven taps...

169
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:34,511
What does it mean?

170
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:39,790
By the way, Chiba-kun, how did the sound you heard go?

171
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,220
I believe it was...

172
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:46,721
Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap,

173
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:51,851
tap tap tap tap tap tap tap.

174
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:55,391
Huh? That sounds familiar.

175
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:56,891
It's "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star!"

176
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:57,981
What?

177
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,440
Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are.

178
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,940
Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.

179
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:05,991
The lyrics are four phrases of seven syllables each.

180
00:13:06,391 --> 00:13:09,861
She could only communicate using sounds because her mouth is covered!

181
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:13,690
The culprit works as a remodeler, and then there's "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star!"

182
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:16,871
In other words, she's being held in the planetarium that's being remodeled!

183
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:27,981
The planetarium is near the park we were just at that was the scene of the first murder.

184
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:31,861
Hurry!

185
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,851
Damn it. You're determined not to talk, aren't you?

186
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:48,701
Forget it, then.

187
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:57,831
Instead, I'll make it so you can never speak again!

188
00:13:58,501 --> 00:13:59,831
Chiba-kun!

189
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:07,340
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

190
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:13,811
how I wonder what you are.

191
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:20,390
Up above the world so high,

192
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:26,701
like a diamond in the sky.

193
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:33,041
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

194
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:41,120
how I wonder what you are.

195
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:44,900
A-A kid? What is this? Why are you here?

196
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:49,421
I brought him here so he could distract you.

197
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:59,131
Aono Kengo, you're under arrest for the murders of two female police officers.

198
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,111
Chiba-kun!

199
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:07,021
22:54, suspect arrested.

200
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:11,281
Damn it!

201
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:14,201
Damn, damn!

202
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:18,340
So you do have your phone with you.

203
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,791
The police have been calling you over and over.

204
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:24,291
It's not on.

205
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:28,060
This phone is full of memories of Aiko.

206
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,051
I never let it out of my sight.

207
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:35,020
But since that day, that moment, I haven't looked at the screen!

208
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:36,551
I can't look at it anymore!

209
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:39,430
Since that moment Aiko died,

210
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:42,681
no matter how often I look at it, Aiko never says anything to me!

211
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,201
I heard about your girlfriend.

212
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:47,860
What happened was tragic.

213
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:50,200
It's your fault!

214
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:54,241
Because you police wouldn't let me go, Aiko is...

215
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:58,971
Weren't you driving without a license while using your phone?

216
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:01,241
It's only natural that you were arrested.

217
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:03,021
Those are the rules.

218
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,000
There it is. The rules.

219
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,530
They could've quickly written me a ticket!

220
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:11,270
But they wasted my time by talking about karaoke on the phone

221
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,680
and slowed me down!

222
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,721
I wanted to get to my girlfriend to convince her not to do it!

223
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:20,011
The police killed Aiko!

224
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:24,051
The police didn't kill your girlfriend.

225
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,571
It was a coincidence that they received a call.

226
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:30,611
Even if it hadn't happened, they wouldn't have let you go.

227
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:35,111
It was clear from your behavior that you were out of your mind.

228
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,111
They thought you needed time to calm down.

229
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:42,111
No one can remain calm under all circumstances,

230
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,001
especially not if their loved ones are involved.

231
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:46,791
Not even me.

232
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:54,341
It's the reason the policewomen you killed did their jobs.

233
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:57,210
So a driver like you

234
00:16:57,211 --> 00:17:01,741
who's lost their cool won't take the life of someone else's loved on.

235
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:03,761
You're lecturing me?

236
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:08,061
Talk all you want, but Aiko still died because you guys stopped me!

237
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,311
If that hadn't happened, I could've saved Aiko!

238
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,510
Besides, I was calm!

239
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,560
They had no reason to keep me there!

240
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,301
No.

241
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,930
You weren't behaving normally.

242
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:20,570
You weren't there. How would you know?

243
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:21,800
I do know.

244
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:25,451
Your girlfriend left a voicemail on your phone.

245
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:26,951
A voicemail?

246
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:28,660
I knew it.

247
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:31,280
You haven't heard your girlfriend's message.

248
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:34,601
No, you don't even seem to know that she called you.

249
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:39,221
She called you a minute after she sent that last text.

250
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:42,670
Because you were hurrying to your car,

251
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:45,221
it's possible you didn't notice she was calling.

252
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,310
But you were looking at your phone while driving after that.

253
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,481
You were so preoccupied that the police stopped you.

254
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:58,360
You should've seen this notification on your screen then.

255
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:00,361
Aiko, Voice Message Missed Call

256
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:04,960
This important notification was visible to you, but you didn't notice.

257
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,371
I know exactly how shaken you were.

258
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:09,101
Aiko...

259
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:12,371
Let me hear it.

260
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:16,381
Let me hear the message Aiko left for me.

261
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,560
Aono-kun.

262
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:24,901
Just sending a text seems bland, so I'll tell you directly.

263
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:27,901
Thank you for everything.

264
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:33,510
Someone fell!

265
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:34,881
Call an ambulance!

266
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:38,891
Do you understand now?

267
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,251
You were too late.

268
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:48,471
You're lying!

269
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,921
Aiko...

270
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:58,800
You're Yumi-san's subordinate...

271
00:18:58,801 --> 00:18:59,631
Don't!

272
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:12,140
How could you be so reckless?

273
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:14,321
It's only natural! After all, I...

274
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,061
I...

275
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,581
Chiba-kun, you're...

276
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,631
After all, I...

277
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,471
I'm a police officer.

278
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,351
It's only natural.

279
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:40,341
I parked my car far away so the suspect wouldn't notice.

280
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,770
I'm going to carry you to a nearby hospital.

281
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:44,040
Do your best to bear it.

282
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,591
Okay.

283
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:48,331
Chiba-kun!

284
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:50,601
Sorry. Could you handle the rest?

285
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,341
It should be around here somewhere.

286
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:01,860
There it is. Beika University Hospital.

287
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:03,861
For Pedestrian and Cyclist Use

288
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,851
Damn. The light's taking forever.

289
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:15,610
There aren't any people or cars.

290
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:16,751
Maybe I'll cross.

291
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,171
You shouldn't cross.

292
00:20:20,481 --> 00:20:21,171
What?

293
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:24,660
You may think no one's watching, but I'm watching.

294
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,040
You're watching, too.

295
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,141
Once you go easy on yourself and break the rules, it becomes a habit.

296
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:32,940
Habits are hard to break even if you want to.

297
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,390
Do you not even understand that?

298
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:37,451
Y-You...

299
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:41,140
It's not superheroes that I like.

300
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:43,531
Don't make me say it, dummy.

301
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,651
Thanks, Kamen Baiya.

302
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:49,321
Chiba-kun, you idiot. I hate you!

303
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:57,791
A-Are you really my childhood friend Naeko-chan?

304
00:20:58,461 --> 00:20:59,251
You idiot.

305
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,871
Took you long enough.

306
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:13,621
The light turned green a while ago.

307
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:15,931
Oh, right.

308
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:24,691
Uh, oh! I forgot to return Naeko-san's phone after I picked it up.

309
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:31,571
Hey, while I was sleeping at Chukichi's place, Miwako called me 54 times.

310
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:34,780
I've been trying to call her back, but her line's been busy.

311
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:36,231
Did something happen?

312
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:08,261
Yes.

313
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:13,761
As you said, I gave all the information I could to that boy.

314
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:19,650
Though my information didn't do much to help him solve the case.

315
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:21,180
It's a minor matter.

316
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:24,521
It's better not to have to put out unnecessary fires.

317
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:27,671
More importantly, how is that going?

318
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:31,291
Nothing yet.

319
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:35,911
Don't neglect to make your reports, Bourbon.
