1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:05,710
The old man received a letter from someone named Komakichi Kurataya

2
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:08,710
saying he'd like to give him his family treasure,

3
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:12,110
so Ran and I accompanied him to Yamaguchi Prefecture.

4
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:15,710
However, the old man was mistaken

5
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:18,110
for the accomplice of a robber and was arrested.

6
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:23,410
It turned out Komakichi Kurataya was the name of a robber

7
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:26,110
who stole millions of yen worth of gold coins.

8
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:30,410
Fortunately, news site reporter Asuka Natsume

9
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,110
was able to get him released.

10
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:35,910
Unbelievably enough, Asuka was the one

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:40,510
who sent the old man the letter using the name Komakichi Kurataya.

12
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:47,011
She intended to hire Pops to secretly investigate the robbery.

13
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,210
So in search of clues,

14
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:54,211
we left Yamaguchi City for Hagi, but...

15
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:58,411
What a nice view.

16
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,210
Ran, get down!

17
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:06,111
Hey, don't touch that!

18
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:09,411
Hey, what are you...

19
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:15,410
Hide inside the rickshaw!

20
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,011
What happened?

21
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,810
Are you okay, Ran?

22
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:20,811
Yeah.

23
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:26,110
-Is Komakichi Kurataya trying to kill... -Looks like he ran.

24
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:28,410
Pops?

25
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,510
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

26
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,610
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

27
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:34,510
Fearsome bullets are being aimed at the old man!

28
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,910
Where will the restoration's treasure take us?

29
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,510
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,710
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:43,311
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,940
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour (Hagi Part)"

33
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,239
Wait, dad?

34
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,639
Darn it. We shouldn't be wasting time here.

35
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,839
Where are you going?

36
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,339
We haven't been questioned yet.

37
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,039
I appeared on Asuka's news site

38
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,939
to soothe her over-anxious nerves.

39
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,639
Instead I provoked the culprit.

40
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,839
You mean...

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,539
Yeah. Asuka could be in danger, too.

42
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,139
Ran, we need to notify Asuka immediately.

43
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,140
Yeah.

44
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,539
-Hello, Asuka? -I can't come to the phone right now.

45
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,139
It's no use. It went to her messages.

46
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,039
We need to get to Asuka quickly.

47
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,140
Yeah.

48
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,139
You...

49
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,939
Where are you going?

50
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,539
Someone's trying to kill you.

51
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,139
So, what?

52
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,739
We can guarantee your safety.

53
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,539
We'll protect you.

54
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,239
I don't need your protection.

55
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,540
Let's go, Ran.

56
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,539
Darn it. You...

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,340
Stay there.

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,439
Dad, what should we do about Asuka?

59
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,239
We'll wait for an opportunity to...

60
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,440
Inspector Takajo!

61
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,339
Got it. I'll let headquarters know.

62
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,839
You boys watch...

63
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,539
Darn it. That incompetent detective...

64
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,839
Why are you just standing there?

65
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Hurry up and find them!

66
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,940
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

67
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
"Hagi Reverberating Furnace"

68
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:28,039
"Hagi Reverberating Furnace" -This is...

69
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,139
the Hagi Reverberating Furnace of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution

70
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,139
that was made a world heritage site.

71
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,839
A reverberating furnace

72
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,539
is a metal melting furnace for refining cannonballs.

73
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,539
The young members of the Choshu Domain

74
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,939
poured their hearts

75
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,039
into constructing this reverberating furnace themselves.

76
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,739
But ultimately, their passion failed to achieve results.

77
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,539
Years later, you can still feel the passion of the young patriots

78
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,940
who never stopped working towards their dream.

79
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,539
This is Natsume.

80
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,439
Asuka, are you all right?

81
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,739
What? Mr. Mouri.

82
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,339
I'm fine.

83
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,439
Good.

84
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,239
Did something happen?

85
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,639
Someone shot at me with a gun earlier.

86
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,639
With a gun? Are you all right?

87
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,539
Yes. Fortunately, I'm fine.

88
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,039
It must have been Komakichi Kurataya.

89
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,339
Komakichi Kurataya...

90
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,439
Asuka, you could be in danger, too.

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,039
You're at the reverberating furnace right now, right?

92
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,239
Yes.

93
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,139
I'm at the parking lot at the bottom of the steps.

94
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,439
Got it.

95
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,539
I'll be right there, so don't move.

96
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,140
Understood. Please hurry...

97
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,939
What's wrong, Asuka?

98
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,039
Asuka?

99
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,039
Are you all right, Asuka?

100
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,439
"Kogoro Mouri, In call" -Answer me, Asuka!

101
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Asuka!

102
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,539
Asuka!

103
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,439
Where are you?

104
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,839
If you're here, answer us!

105
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Asuka!

106
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,439
This is...

107
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,139
Asuka's phone.

108
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
"Takarada, Incoming call"

109
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:38,839
A video call from Takarada?

110
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,839
What? Where's Asuka?

111
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,539
Takarada.

112
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,539
Asuka has been kidnapped.

113
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,039
What?

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,839
We heard she was at the parking lot at the reverberating furnace.

115
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,540
But when we got here, we only found her phone.

116
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,739
Mouri.

117
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,939
It may have been the lawyer Fujiki.

118
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,539
Fujiki?

119
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,639
Asuka believed Komakichi Kurataya's true identity is Fujiki.

120
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,939
Even if that's true, where could he have taken her?

121
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,639
I don't know.

122
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,939
But I heard Fujiki asked Asuka

123
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,639
to meet him at Shizuki Park several times.

124
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,539
-Shizuki Park? -Yes.

125
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,739
"Hagi Castle Shizuki Park" -It's the park where Hagi Castle is.

126
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,439
There are moats and stone walls.

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,639
He could be hiding the coins he stole there.

128
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,539
You think he took Asuka there?

129
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,139
I'll head there now,

130
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,539
but it takes about an hour by car to get to Hagi.

131
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,639
Got it.

132
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
We'll head there first.

133
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,540
Why, though?

134
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,740
The old man was shot at with a gun, but Asuka wasn't.

135
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,139
Maybe he only shot at the old man to scare him.

136
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,139
Does that mean he kidnapped Asuka so he could actually kill her?

137
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,639
But where did he take her?

138
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,940
Someplace he could kill her without anyone noticing...

139
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,739
Keicho coins have a nearly 90 percent gold content.

140
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,739
If melted down into gold bars,

141
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,140
they could be sold.

142
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Is he going to...

143
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,639
Ran, let me see Asuka's phone!

144
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,439
-What? -I'm going to examine the videos

145
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,940
she previously uploaded to her news site.

146
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,539
Found it.

147
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,439
I consider the Hagi Reverberating Furnace a power spot.

148
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,239
A power spot?

149
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,439
The Choshu Domain attempted to construct

150
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,439
the reverberating furnace without any plans.

151
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,539
I come here often during my walks to feel the power

152
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,939
of those men who faced such difficulties.

153
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,239
Oh, right.

154
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,139
"Yuichi Fukuhara (32), Metalworking Researcher" -Your foundry is nearby.

155
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,739
Yes.

156
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Driver, stop the car!

157
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,239
What are you doing, kid?

158
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,539
You guys go to Shizuki Park.

159
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,939
There's something I want to check out.

160
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,740
Hey! What are you going to check out?

161
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,839
Oh, no! Get down!

162
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,740
-What? -It's the cops!

163
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,339
That was close.

164
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,439
It's like we've done something wrong.

165
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,139
We can't help it.

166
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,839
They want to...

167
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,439
We can guarantee your safety.

168
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,239
We'll protect you.

169
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,939
Wait a minute. Hagi should be outside their jurisdiction.

170
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,739
So why did they respond to the shooting?

171
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,940
Is that half-wit Komakichi Kurataya?

172
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,140
Where is it?

173
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:39,840
Where is the foundry?

174
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,139
There it is!

175
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,440
I hope I make it in time!

176
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:29,049
Conan!

177
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:36,749
This is bad! I need to stop the conveyor belt!

178
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:41,849
-That's it! -Conan, hurry!

179
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:45,648
Stop the belt!

180
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,249
Go!

181
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,149
I made it in time.

182
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:10,748
You wait here.

183
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,848
-What? -He has a gun.

184
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:15,949
Whatever you do, don't follow me.

185
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:18,349
Dad.

186
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:24,348
Conan, where are you?

187
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:27,348
Ran, I found Asuka.

188
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,248
Really? Is she okay?

189
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,248
Yeah. Where's Pops?

190
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:36,349
He just headed into Shizuki Park alone.

191
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:49,849
Fujiki.

192
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,748
That's that half-wit.

193
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:00,449
So they really are...

194
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,549
Dad!

195
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:37,848
Don't move, you incompetent detective.

196
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:39,248
Takajo.

197
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:41,049
I knew it was you.

198
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:46,249
Dad!

199
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,149
Don't move.

200
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,549
What?

201
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:05,748
-Hey. -Darn. He got away.

202
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:08,348
I thought you were aiming for me.

203
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:11,948
Why would I shoot you?

204
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:15,148
Someone was trying to shoot you from these bushes.

205
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,149
What?

206
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:22,348
He dropped this in his panic.

207
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:24,849
Which means the culprit is...

208
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:28,948
Hello?

209
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:31,348
Hey, kid!

210
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,548
Where and what are you...

211
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,849
What?

212
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:46,148
I'm sorry I'm late, Mouri.

213
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,648
I've been waiting for you, Takarada.

214
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,848
It really does take over an hour from Yamaguchi.

215
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,449
Yes.

216
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,048
"Akihiko Takarada (45)" -Anyway, were you able to find Asuka?

217
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:00,049
What?

218
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:06,248
What are the police and Fujiki doing with you?

219
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,348
What's going on?

220
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:11,148
Takarada.

221
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:17,448
Did you know Fujiki had become Fukuhara Yuichi's lawyer?

222
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:18,449
What?

223
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:24,248
Apparently Fukuhara believes you may be Komakichi Kurataya.

224
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,648
What? Who, me?

225
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,948
You expressed disapproval of your father's will.

226
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:36,248
The will stated that all the artworks and knickknacks

227
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:40,348
in the storehouse should be donated to local institutions.

228
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:43,548
So you wanted at least the coins for yourself.

229
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:48,348
After all, if you melted them down, you could sell them.

230
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:49,648
Wait a minute.

231
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,148
Do you have any proof it was me?

232
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,948
There is no evidence.

233
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:58,048
But weren't you beginning to notice

234
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,648
that Asuka suspected you?

235
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,348
So you kidnapped her and attempted to silence her.

236
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,848
Officer, don't tell me you believe them.

237
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:11,648
I was shot in the arm by the robber.

238
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:12,948
You were,

239
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,148
but the bullet barely scratched your left arm.

240
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:23,348
It's possible you shot yourself so you could pretend to be a victim.

241
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,848
What are you talking about?

242
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,248
You don't even have proof.

243
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:27,648
There is proof.

244
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:32,148
-What? -You tried to kill me twice.

245
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:35,148
What are you talking about?

246
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,249
About an hour and a half ago, you shot at me once.

247
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:43,849
Then again an hour ago.

248
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,748
I have an alibi.

249
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:53,148
I just got here.

250
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:55,748
I was in Yamaguchi City until then.

251
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,648
I called you from my garage.

252
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:03,048
Was that actually the garage at your home?

253
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,748
There was a flashy sports car behind you.

254
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:12,548
Anyone would assume it was your garage.

255
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,848
I don't understand.

256
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:15,848
The culprit Komakichi Kurataya deliberately appeared

257
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:19,848
on your webcam dressed as a Kiheitai soldier.

258
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:25,148
A memorable outfit diminishes your impression of the actual culprit.

259
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:28,148
Did you not employ the same technique to make us believe

260
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:34,248
you were in your garage by having a flashy sports car in the background?

261
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:38,148
If it wasn't my garage, where was I?

262
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,148
-Ran. -Okay.

263
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,648
Conan, are you ready?

264
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,048
Yeah. I'm ready anytime.

265
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,349
You're facing him now.

266
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,748
Hello, Takarada.

267
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:53,948
You said the construction next to your shop is noisy

268
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:56,948
from morning until night,

269
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:59,448
but when you called us earlier,

270
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,249
we didn't hear any construction sounds.

271
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:09,448
That's how I knew you weren't inside your garage,

272
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,749
but inside a truck.

273
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:18,748
You pretended you were calling us from your garage,

274
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:21,848
but you've actually been here in Hagi

275
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,648
calling us from inside this truck.

276
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:27,648
What? Where's Asuka?

277
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,248
Takarada.

278
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:32,448
Asuka has been kidnapped.

279
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:33,848
What?

280
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:38,748
And you brought Asuka here when you kidnapped her.

281
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:40,948
Takarada.

282
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:46,848
You really are the robber Komakichi Kurataya!

283
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:47,849
Darn it!

284
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,149
He's not getting away!

285
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,249
Darn!

286
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,349
Yuichi.

287
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,949
Asuka.

288
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,349
Welcome back.

289
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:01,449
I'm back.

290
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:07,948
What's going on?

291
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:12,048
I thought Asuka and Fukuhara were just acquaintances.

292
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,148
Too bad, Pops.

293
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:16,248
Shut up.

294
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:20,748
Anyway, I'm glad he was released after exactly one year.

295
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:27,848
Asuka probably wanted to find the culprit before his sentence was up.

296
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,148
That's right.

297
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,148
Fukuhara said he'd find

298
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:35,748
the culprit himself once he got out.

299
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:40,348
Asuka didn't want him to do anything dangerous.

300
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:46,848
You knew about Asuka's plan from the beginning.

301
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,348
You finally figured it out, you incompetent detective?

302
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:52,548
What was that, you half-wit?

303
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:57,448
I'm the one who told Asuka to get you involved.

304
00:22:57,449 --> 00:22:59,248
What?

305
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:01,448
I told her this case could only be solved

306
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,649
by Japan's greatest detective,

307
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:09,049
The Great Kogoro Mouri.

308
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,248
Why not celebrate

309
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:16,948
by eating some of Yamaguchi's famous Kawara Soba noodles?

310
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:21,448
A delicious meal should satisfy your empty stomach.

311
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:23,948
I can't be satisfied by food.

312
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:26,549
There's lots of good local sake, too.

313
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:31,049
Well, then I guess I can let you off the hook.

314
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:37,149
A half-wit police officer and an incompetent detective?

315
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:41,249
They make a good team.

316

Isn't it wonderful, Conan?

318
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:48,548
It really is.

319
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:54,248
This is kind of like what happened to that ship.

320
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:57,348
You mean the Mystery of the Mary Celeste?

321
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,448
The Mystery of the Mary Celeste?

"Curse"

323
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:07,548

00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:09,448
