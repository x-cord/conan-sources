1
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:05,394
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:07,294
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:09,094
One who is obviously the culprit.

4
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:11,194
The vital point of truth pierces through the paradox.

5
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:12,694
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,594
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,995
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:58,987
On our way back from Izu,

9
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,787
Pops car broke down again

10
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,987
on a mountain road covered with thick fog.

11
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:06,987
We stopped for help at a study facility

12
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:09,287
of the Kuron Health Equipment Corporation

13
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:13,387
that happened to be nearby.

14
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:17,087
In the presence of a tyrant president called Shiro Umetani,

15
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:22,187
everyone is in the midst of a company competition of massage chairs.

16
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:23,387
However,

17
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:26,588
Mr. Umetani is suddenly found stabbed with a knife.

18
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:32,487
Fortunately, Mr. Umetani's life is saved.

19
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:35,687
The culprit Hiramatsu flees with his car

20
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:39,188
and while fleeing, falls over a cliff and dies.

21
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:44,987
It seems that there was a thick fog at the time of the accident

22
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:47,887
and besides this slope is steep and the curve is very sharp.

23
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:50,387
It's most likely that he couldn't steer fast enough

24
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,787
while he was on the run.

25
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:55,787
Yeah, most likely.

26
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:57,587
Strange.

27
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,688
There are too many strange things involved.

28
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:03,387
A person who gets enraged, stabs someone and flees,

29
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:04,587
flattens the tires of everyone's car

30
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,887
because he doesn't want anyone to come after him.

31
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:11,187
This same person panics and steers his car out of control,

32
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:13,288
and falls over the cliff to his death.

33
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:18,487
The curve mirror that was facing the wrong way.

34
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:21,288
Brake oil that was completely gone.

35
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:25,187
Something smells fishy.

36
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,788
Very fishy!

37
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:36,788
"The Lucky Cigar Case (Part 2)"

38
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:38,888
Mr. Umetani,

39
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,087
at any rate, we'd better get you to a hospital quickly.

40
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,987
I'll ask you for details there.

41
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:47,487
No, I really can't be doing that.

42
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,287
I've got to decide what to do

43
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:51,587
since something like this has happened.

44
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:53,287
A one-man management is really a lot of hassle

45
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:55,188
at times like this.

46
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:58,687
Mr. Umetani?

47
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:01,087
I think it's better for you to go to the hospital after all.

48
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:03,187
This is really no big deal.

49
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:06,887
If I wasn't saved by this cigar case I had in my chest pocket,

50
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:09,187
I would've been in the world beyond by now.

51
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:10,688
If you think of it that way...

52
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:12,687
True.

53
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:16,188
It's indeed a cigar case of good luck.

54
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:18,687
Oh, how terrible.

55
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:21,987
The inside is wiped out.

56
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,287
That's a rare looking type of cigarette.

57
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:27,887
How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?

58
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:31,287
Well, about 40, maybe...

59
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:34,587
Then, you must really have it tough without cigarettes.

60
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:36,187
You can have mine, if it's okay with you.

61
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,887
No, thanks.

62
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:39,987
I've got some more in my car.

63
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,587
Besides I only smoke cigars.

64
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:46,887
Would you like to try one, Mr. Mouri?

65
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:48,687
A cigar?

66
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:53,487
Mr. Mouri, I'd like to ask about the accident.

67
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:55,187
Oh, right.

68
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:57,087
I've got something good that may be of help.

69
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,987
Something good?

70
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:02,687
A video taped the competition we had.

71
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:03,787
What?

72
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:05,287
You video taped it?

73
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:06,687
Don't tell me that...

74
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:07,688
Yes.

75
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:13,688
It shows what happened when Hiramatsu stabbed me.

76
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:17,287
Inspector Yokomizo!

77
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:18,487
Inspector!

78
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:20,387
Please come upstairs for a moment!

79
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:23,188
-What is it? -The thing is...

80
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:28,087
We found this in the closet

81
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:31,588
between the mattresses in Mr. Hiramatsu's room.

82
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:37,687
A rope, stun gun and a death note.

83
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,088
A death note? What's going on?

84
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,387
What's this?

85
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:45,787
What's wrong?

86
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,087
What's this...

87
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:50,387
I've completely lost confidence in keeping this company going.

88
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:52,487
Please forgive me for my selfishness.

89
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:55,187
President of Kuron Health Equipment Corporation,

90
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,087
Shiro Umetani.

91
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:58,487
What?

92
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,987
It's President Umetani's death note!

93
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,987
Absurd!

94
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,987
I would never write something like this!

95
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:07,987
There's no reason why I should commit suicide!

96
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:09,887
Just as I thought.

97
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:13,187
Mr. Hiramatsu probably was scheming to kill you

98
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:16,187
using everything here.

99
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,687
How could he...

100
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:21,387
There's no doubt about it!

101
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:24,787
Before all else, let's take a look at the video tape!

102
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:29,187
I kept the video running just in case.

103
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,487
But, I sure had no idea

104
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:33,587
it would come in handy in a situation like this.

105
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:35,788
How ironic.

106
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:37,788
Oh, there!

107
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:44,987
After you all left the room, I tried AIMS out.

108
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,887
It was good, wasn't it?

109
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:50,387
Yes, I was definitely sure that it would be a hit.

110
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:53,387
Except for one problem.

111
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:54,987
Problem?

112
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:57,687
He demanded that I let him quit the company.

113
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:58,987
And that unless I take in his request,

114
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:01,287
he refused to give AIMS to me.

115
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,587
He said that unless the password is entered by midnight,

116
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:08,687
the program within AIMS would perish.

117
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,287
So, what did you do?

118
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:13,887
I was sure that I could make a great profit with AIMS.

119
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:17,087
But, I was more afraid of him going to another company

120
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:21,687
and developing something better than AIMS.

121
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:25,287
So, you chose Mr. Hiramatsu?

122
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:26,388
Yes.

123
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:31,588
At first, it seemed that he was convinced.

124
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:36,188
But he suddenly became enraged.

125
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:45,687
I was suddenly stabbed and fainted,

126
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:47,988
so I don't remember anything that followed.

127
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:54,287
I awoke when you people woke me up.

128
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,887
After that, Mr. Hiramatsu who afraid of

129
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:57,987
everybody finding out about what happened

130
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:59,987
fled from the window.

131
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,987
After he went through the trouble of preparing to kill you

132
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:04,787
under the pretense of suicide,

133
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:07,387
why would he lose his temper and use a knife because it was there?

134
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:10,387
That man had no patience.

135
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,587
He used to do only what he wanted to do.

136
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:14,587
He used to always wear a blank look and seemed like a quiet man,

137
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:16,387
yet he easily loses his temper.

138
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,587
You're pretty hard on him, aren't you?

139
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:20,587
How about you, Mr. Nakano?

140
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:25,587
Well, it's true that he had that inclination.

141
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,988
I see.

142
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:38,388
This is the place that Mr. Hiramatsu's car was parked.

143
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,887
Just as I thought!

144
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:46,987
Brake oil leaked.

145
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:50,887
Somebody removed the tube!

146
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:54,687
Try it, will you?

147
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:58,687
The aroma is very different from cigarettes.

148
00:08:58,688 --> 00:08:59,987
Come on, have one!

149
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:02,187
Thank you, I'll have one then.

150
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:06,187
But, what a fine cigar case you have!

151
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:08,587
Yes, it's my father's keepsake,

152
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:11,187
and this is a one and only.

153
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:13,487
Oh my God!

154
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:14,788
Well, well.

155
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:21,287
There's no mistake that this is Mr. Hiramatsu's briefcase.

156
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:24,187
Yes, there's no mistake about it.

157
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:28,387
It's just like Mr. Hiramatsu to hide it in the closet.

158
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:29,587
What do you mean?

159
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:32,287
He was very secretive.

160
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,787
The 3rd development room is a single room.

161
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:36,087
Therefore, the door was always locked,

162
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,887
and he wouldn't let anybody in.

163
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:42,687
The only time he ever talks is during the competition.

164
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:47,187
Then, did anyone know that he was planning to kill the president?

165
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,587
How would we ever know a thing like that?

166
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:53,187
Gosh, we're the ones who'd want to kill him!

167
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:54,188
Huh?

168
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:56,487
Oh, well, I mean...

169
00:09:56,488 --> 00:10:00,187
We understand very well his feeling of wanting to go independent!

170
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:04,388
Come to think of it, he was being yelled at even this morning.

171
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,687
Only Mr. Hiramatsu's AIMS was delayed being brought here.

172
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:13,287
The president went to the 3rd development room himself

173
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:15,788
and Hiramatsu was being yelled at from morning.

174
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:18,987
After a while, Hiramatsu came dashing out

175
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:22,287
and disappeared off somewhere.

176
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,487
Talk about troublemaker.

177
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:29,487
But, we finally find him and come back

178
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:31,887
only to find the president gone next!

179
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:32,987
He tells us that he can't take it any longer

180
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:34,987
and had to cool down for a while.

181
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:39,087
Then, he goes out to buy that cheap cigar case.

182
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:41,488
What the heck's going on?

183
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:46,687
Didn't any of you go out with your car?

184
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,487
Great, Pops!

185
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:51,887
Yeah. We went to eat and do some shopping.

186
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:54,387
Of course, Hiramatsu didn't come with us.

187
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,887
The president said he was going to stop by at the villa,

188
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:59,387
so I went with Nakano in his car.

189
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:03,287
We arrived here right after that.

190
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,387
I see.

191
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:07,487
I get it!

192
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:09,688
I've figured everything out!

193
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:13,487
It's this late already.

194
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:17,587
Since I've more or less finished questioning all of you,

195
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:19,688
I guess we'll call it a day.

196
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:21,887
Mr. Mouri,

197
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:25,087
if your car's not repaired yet, let me give you a lift!

198
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:27,387
Oh, thanks.

199
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:29,688
It's been a long day.

200
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:35,687
I guess I'll go try out that relax seat one more time.

201
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:37,687
Hey, dad!

202
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:40,388
It wasn't much of a case anyway.

203
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,387
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

204
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:48,388
Ran!

205
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,087
Call Yokomizo and the others and tell them to come back!

206
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:54,787
Mr. Hiramatsu didn't die of an accident!

207
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,187
Huh?

208
00:11:56,188 --> 00:12:02,488
This is a cleverly schemed homicide case!

209
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:11,125
What do you mean that Mr. Hiramatsu's death

210
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:13,625
by accident is a homicide case, Mr. Mouri?

211
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:17,025
Well, the brakes weren't working, but...

212
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:20,525
It's true that the malfunction of the brakes

213
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:24,025
do not always lead to fatal death.

214
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,425
However, the killer

215
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:31,426
set up another trap to make sure that he dies in the accident!

216
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,525
What kind of trick was it?

217
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:38,325
Mr. Hiramatsu believed that he killed the president

218
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:41,225
and fled by car.

219
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:45,125
His brakes didn't work as he drove through the thick fog.

220
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:48,225
And, the car just kept going down the mountain.

221
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,426
Then suddenly the headlights of an oncoming car appear.

222
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:09,325
He loses control of the wheels and falls over the cliff.

223
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,625
Please wait, Mr. Mouri.

224
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,926
Was there an oncoming car?

225
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,725
The road uphill, all except for the private road

226
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,325
that's on the side here to this company lead up to the top

227
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:20,825
and is a dead end.

228
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:22,925
And besides, after sundown,

229
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:25,425
this whole area is covered with thick fog

230
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:28,225
that there is always practically no one.

231
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:30,425
There doesn't seem to have been such a car.

232
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:33,125
No, wrong.

233
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:36,625
The lights he thought were of an oncoming car was...

234
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:40,125
the headlights of his own car.

235
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:45,326
But unless there's a mirror or something in front...

236
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,125
Yes, do you remember that

237
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:50,125
there was something at the scene of the accident

238
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:53,325
that was reflecting the floodlight?

239
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,225
Yes! Yes!

240
00:13:55,226 --> 00:14:00,125
The corner mirror that was on the road leading to this facility!

241
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,325
I see.

242
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:05,125
The angle of the corner mirror was changed

243
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:08,125
to reflect the headlights!

244
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:11,625
When Officer Shimada of the residential police box saw in the day time,

245
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:14,325
it seemed to be in the correct position.

246
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:19,525
And in the parking lot where Mr. Hiramatsu's car was parked,

247
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,425
there were traces of oil leak.

248
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:25,025
The person who removed the brake oil

249
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:27,625
and the person who flattened the tires of the other cars

250
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:30,125
is probably one and the same.

251
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:32,325
Even if the brakes were to be tampered with,

252
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:36,025
there's no guarantee that Mr. Hiramatsu would flee with that car.

253
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,025
Besides, if someone goes after Mr. Hiramatsu

254
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:40,625
and catches him before he gets into the accident,

255
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:43,225
everything will go to waste!

256
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,725
Which means, Mr. Mouri...

257
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,925
someone here did it?

258
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:50,725
Here, you mean us?

259
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:54,125
-No! -We don't have time long enough to be alone,

260
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,325
so it's impossible!

261
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:58,725
Only the president has time to himself, right?

262
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:00,825
You idiot! I'm the victim!

263
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:04,025
Mr. Umetani, after the competition,

264
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:07,825
you went to take a smoke of cigar all by yourself.

265
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:10,325
And, you seem to have come home alone

266
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,025
when everyone went out to have dinner, didn't you?

267
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:17,325
You went by the corner mirror with your car then, didn't you?

268
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:18,425
Hey, hold it!

269
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:20,925
Have you forgotten that I've extended my kindness to you?

270
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,525
One more thing.

271
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:25,226
The killer used a certain thing.

272
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,825
Just what is that certain thing?

273
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,526
The other thing is...

274
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:33,526
The other thing is...

275
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,026
The fog.

276
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:41,325
The fog?

277
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:45,125
Yes, the thick fog that is unique to this area.

278
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:46,126
Without the fog,

279
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:50,125
it'd be easy to see through the corner mirror trick.

280
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,825
In other words, the one thing that was necessary

281
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,425
to commit this murder was the fog.

282
00:15:56,426 --> 00:16:01,326
And the only person who could use this fog to his advantage was you!

283
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,026
President Umetani!

284
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:06,525
None other than you!

285
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,725
Don't be ridiculous.

286
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:10,525
The fog is a natural phenomenon!

287
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:13,325
Besides, the fact that Hiramatsu would stab me and flee

288
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:16,225
is not something I could've known beforehand!

289
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,925
How dare you say something irresponsible like that?

290
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:21,225
No, you knew

291
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:25,725
that Mr. Hiramatsu was planning to kill you.

292
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:27,425
What?

293
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:31,625
I hear that you had it out with Mr. Hiramatsu before coming here

294
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:35,925
and Mr. Hiramatsu dashed out of the room.

295
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:38,025
You stayed back in the room

296
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:41,125
so I guess you saw it, didn't you?

297
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:45,225
The inside of the briefcase!

298
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:47,725
Therefore, thinking of getting back at him,

299
00:16:47,726 --> 00:16:52,125
you went to buy yourself a cigar case just before leaving.

300
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,425
Because the one that you're always using

301
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:58,225
is a precious keepsake of your father.

302
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,825
Well, using all kinds of cigar cases is good for a change!

303
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:06,425
Then why would a person like you who smokes 40 cigars a day

304
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:13,425
choose a cigar case that can take only 4 or 5 cigars placed diagonally?

305
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:15,125
And...

306
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:19,925
you kept postponing the competition for one reason or another

307
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:23,125
till the night when a thick fog appeared.

308
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,126
In other words,

309
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,625
this homicide taking advantage of and envisioning this fog

310
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:31,726
can only have been committed by you, the one-man president!

311
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:36,225
Some renown detective you are.

312
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:38,025
All you said just now are nothing but assumptions!

313
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,925
Where the heck is the evidence?

314
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,826
The evidence is on the video tape.

315
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:49,325
Please look closely at Mr. Hiramatsu's facial expression.

316
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:50,925
When Mr. Hiramatsu

317
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:54,525
demanded you to make a choice between AIMS and him,

318
00:17:54,526 --> 00:18:00,725
you selected Mr. Hiramatsu to AIMS, didn't you, Mr. Umetani?

319
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:02,325
Yeah, right!

320
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:04,726
Oh, stop right there!

321
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:08,925
If so, why would Mr. Hiramatsu

322
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:12,225
who couldn't get what he wanted be smiling?

323
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:13,625
Beats me.

324
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:18,826
Isn't it a fact that you agreed to what he asked for?

325
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:22,226
Please move it on now.

326
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:29,225
And, he's saying something to you, isn't he?

327
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:33,125
I'm sure he's giving you the password.

328
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:38,326
The password to stop the program of AIMS from being erased.

329
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:44,125
However, he is suddenly angered

330
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:46,925
and stabs you in the shoulder.

331
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,325
It's most likely that

332
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:54,025
he realized that you just pretended to take in his demand.

333
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:56,325
Hey, cut it out already!

334
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:58,225
You just made up your story

335
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:01,925
so that it looks to fit what's seen on the video tape!

336
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:04,725
Is this what you call evidence?

337
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,225
No, this video shows one more thing

338
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:10,625
that is not in keeping with what you're saying.

339
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:11,626
Not in keeping?

340
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:13,425
Please advance the tape.

341
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:14,426
Yes, sir.

342
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:17,126
Stop!

343
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:22,425
I thought you said that you passed out at this point,

344
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,525
but why does Mr. Hiramatsu

345
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:27,825
stop in place as if someone is calling him?

346
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:29,025
How should I know?

347
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:33,825
Isn't this what you said when you called out to him?

348
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:34,925
Come back!

349
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:37,325
If you don't finish me off,

350
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,425
it's going to be your turn next time around!

351
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,225
Or something to that effect.

352
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:44,425
You probably went on like this.

353
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:48,025
If you stab the "O" of Kuron, you'll finish me for sure!

354
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:51,925
Because it's right on the heart!

355
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:56,025
Mr. Hiramatsu did exactly as you provoked him to

356
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,926
and stabbed right through the letter, "O".

357
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:03,525
On the letter "O" right, on top the cigar case

358
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,425
that you had put inside your chest pocket!

359
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:06,925
What a bunch of baloney!

360
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:09,625
It's all just your imagination!

361
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,125
No thing like this is going to serve as evidence!

362
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,525
Inspector Yokomizo.

363
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:16,126
-Yes, sir? -What time is it now?

364
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:19,826
One minute before midnight.

365
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:23,025
Mr. Umetani.

366
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:28,525
Will you turn on the switch for AIMS after midnight?

367
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:33,125
If you didn't get the password from him as you say,

368
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:36,925
the device is not supposed to work, is it?

369
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:39,226
Mr. Umetani?

370
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,526
It's midnight.

371
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:56,525
Good evening, President Umetani.

372
00:20:56,526 --> 00:21:00,325
I appreciate our wise choice.

373
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,825
Please make a lot of profit with my AIMS.

374
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:06,625
I guess we'll never be seeing each other ever again.

375
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:09,426
Goodbye, President Umetani.

376
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:14,426
Darn.

377
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:55,126
Good job, Conan! More towards the shoulders!

378
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:03,025
It feels like I'm being deliberately stepped on.

379
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:06,125
Pops, you're right!

380
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:09,425
Let's buy a massage chair after all!

381
00:23:09,426 --> 00:23:12,325
If you want to buy something expensive like that,

382
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:15,025
do work that will bring in enough cash, okay?

383
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:19,225
But don't you feel sorry that Conan has to do all this hard work?

384
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:24,125
So, I'll massage you, then.

385
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:27,226
No thanks!

386
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:31,725
No, don't do this to me!

387
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,225
I'll cure you by putting your backbone in place.

388
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:36,025
I promise it'll make you feel way better.

389
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:38,826
I don't need anymore massage today.

390
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,426
I'm going to get delicious food ready, then.

391
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:57,626
Talk about scary.

392
00:24:01,826 --> 00:24:05,925
Oh, I've figured out who the culprit is!

393
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:10,925
Mr. Tsukigata, the culprit is your other disciple!

394
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:13,325
Alibi established, eh.

395
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,925
Mysterious Centipede Ninja.

396
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:18,925
The enemy is your friend and your friend is your enemy.

397
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:21,725
One twist after the other.

398
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,225
Counterturn!

399
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:24,426
Counter.

400
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:30,526
Next Conan, "Ninja Technique of Alibi Scheme"
