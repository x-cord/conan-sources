1
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:05,943
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:07,543
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:09,543
Today's story is the finale of the magic case.

4
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:12,943
Solve the miraculous trick with Conan and Heiji!

5
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:14,443
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:16,243
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,544
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,318
Due to popular magician Dogo Hoshikawa's show,

9
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:04,018
we got invited to the legendary magician, Mr. Masakage's house.

10
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,018
It has been exactly 10 years since the day,

11
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,018
Mr. Masakage suddenly disappeared.

12
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,318
The pupils magicians have gotten together there

13
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,818
and Tenko Himemiya among them

14
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,119
was discovered dead in the hallway on the 2nd floor!

15
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:27,318
More than 30 minutes have passed since she died.

16
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,718
Did you find her yourselves?

17
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,218
No, Hoshikwa was also here with us.

18
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,918
What the heck is this?

19
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,018
Tell me, what is this room?

20
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:39,618
Mr. Masakage traveled all around the world.

21
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,618
Those are the documents on magic that he collected.

22
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,219
I found it!

23
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,918
So, this is the Christmas tree magic, huh?

24
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,618
What's more, the tree is where.

25
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:53,618
Ms. Tenko's body was found at the end of the hallway.

26
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:55,518
She must be hiding something.

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,618
Oh!

28
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:59,218
Look at this, Kudo. This picture.

29
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,918
The pictures of the 3 pupils when they were young.

30
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,218
This might be...

31
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,118
That's right, the shadow!

32
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,518
That's right, the shadow of the vase is wrong!

33
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,518
The shadow of the vase?

34
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,118
The moonlight was shining on the vase from behind,

35
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,519
so we couldn't see the patterns on it.

36
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,218
But after the blackout, when we found Tenko's dead body,

37
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,318
the moonlight was shining on the vase from the side,

38
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,618
so we could see the patterns!

39
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:29,818
There's no way the moon moves that fast!

40
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,619
The shadow of the vase.

41
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,618
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Solution)"

42
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,018
The moonlight.

43
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,918
-The vase. -What's happening?

44
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,718
That's not possible, that doesn't.

45
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,618
First the moon was covered by clouds,

46
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:53,318
so it was dark and the design of the vase couldn't be seen.

47
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,018
The cloud disappeared during the blackout

48
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:58,918
and so the design could now be seen?

49
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,318
If you say so.

50
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,818
It may be so.

51
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,518
And then?

52
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,418
Didn't you hear the culprit run away or voices during the blackout?

53
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,718
It may have been so,

54
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,418
but the lights suddenly turned off and we were screaming so...

55
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,818
Mr. Hoshikawa was telling us in a soothing voice to calm down.

56
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,218
Soothing voice?

57
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,418
It's all right!

58
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,318
He repeated, "I'm with you so it's all right".

59
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,519
He really seemed so reliable!

60
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,718
Well... good for you.

61
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,419
Come on!

62
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,418
Then just in case,

63
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,718
Mr. Handa is said to have been taking a nap during the blackout,

64
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:44,018
please lead us to your room.

65
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,419
Sure.

66
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,218
Kazuha, you stay with that lady there!

67
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:55,918
What? Why?

68
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,418
You annoy me when you're around.

69
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:00,119
What's that supposed to mean?

70
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,019
Maybe it's because...

71
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,818
Maybe he's burning with jealousy?

72
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,318
Burning?

73
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,518
Heiji's not red because of the sunburn.

74
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,519
I don't mean that.

75
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,018
So, this is the room Mr. Handa used

76
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,718
when you were still Mr. Masakage's pupils.

77
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:26,918
That's right.

78
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,818
The bed that was used then

79
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:34,118
was disposed of when Mr. Handa left 10 years ago.

80
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:38,718
And? Where were you and Mr. Handa when there was a blackout?

81
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:42,718
When I opened the door, he was lying down on the sofa,

82
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:46,518
and was standing still for about one minute of the blackout.

83
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,618
I told her it wouldn't be a good idea to move around in the dark.

84
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,118
Then who reset the breaker?

85
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,319
I did.

86
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,019
Me and this kid was right by the breaker when it was thrown.

87
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,518
This room definitely is right under the data storage room.

88
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,518
It's impossible to climb out from that small window.

89
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,318
Thought there might be some tricks to the house

90
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,719
since a magician built it.

91
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:20,118
There seems to be no elevators to carry.

92
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,718
Ms. Tenko's body to the 2nd floor.

93
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,618
If you and Mr. Handa was in this room during the blackout,

94
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,018
it would be impossible to commit the crime.

95
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:33,118
When Ms. Tenko's body was found, Mr. Hoshikawa who was the closest

96
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,518
was being clung onto by Kazuha

97
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,919
couldn't have put the body there.

98
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,618
Then the crime must have been committed by someone from outside.

99
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:44,619
Inspector Megure!

100
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,818
Huh?

101
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,418
What is it?

102
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,718
When I investigated the shrubbery,

103
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,818
I found some broken branches and footprints all around

104
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,718
that seemed to have been smoothed out.

105
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:59,518
That shrubbery is right under Mr. Masakage's room.

106
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,418
Hattori! Just like you said.

107
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,418
The culprit was hiding in the storage room,

108
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,518
threw the breaker and left the body

109
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,718
and went into Mr. Masakage's room,

110
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,818
leaped from the window and used the shrubbery as cushion.

111
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,518
He seems to have escaped from the backdoor.

112
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,519
Okay!

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,718
Ask around the neighborhood if anyone has seen a suspicious figure.

114
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:20,919
Yes, sir!

115
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,518
If it's an outsider...

116
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,618
The rest should be left in the hands of the police.

117
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:29,819
-Our role... -is finished.

118
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,918
I see.

119
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,919
So, that's it.

120
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,818
What?

121
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,318
Do you know who did it?

122
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,418
That's right.

123
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,418
The culprit who beat Ms. Tenko to death,

124
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,619
used this as a trick to cover up the crime.

125
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,718
Trick?

126
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,418
I will show you the trick,

127
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,518
so let me borrow your tall officer and fat officer.

128
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,518
Tall one? Fat one?

129
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,318
Oh, Takagi and Chiba!

130
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,918
I'll let you borrow them but what are you planning to do?

131
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,218
You don't mean to use them as a guinea pig in a dangerous trick.

132
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:27,018
No need to worry.

133
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:32,619
I understand you being worried about your men.

134
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:39,518
Hey Hattori, are you okay?

135
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,518
He's okay!

136
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,318
Bring everyone to where Ms. Tenko's body was found

137
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:48,318
in the hallway on the 2nd floor in 10 minutes!

138
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,218
You will be surprised too!

139
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:55,518
Is what Brother Heiji was saying! Right?

140
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,819
Yeah.

141
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,118
I'm counting on you, Hattori.

142
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:05,018
Right! I'll get Takagi and Chiba to come to this room.

143
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:11,618
Will Mr. Handa and Mrs. Masakage please go back to your rooms and wait?

144
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,418
Get Mr. Hoshikawa too.

145
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,219
Yes. Then I'll go to the living room.

146
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:23,618
Hey, Kudo.

147
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:25,918
I think I got it.

148
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,218
That's why we're gathering everyone up.

149
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,418
No, not that!

150
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,618
I'm not talking about the case.

151
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,818
I'm talking about why there was something about Kazuha

152
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:36,018
that was annoying me!

153
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:39,319
Well, good for you.

154
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:44,218
It's almost 10 minutes.

155
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:45,318
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

156
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:49,418
Then, can you all step up on the stage

157
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,518
where I will unravel the mystery,

158
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,318
of course, with the culprit who is among us.

159
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,818
Huh?

160
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:58,218
The killer is...

161
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:00,419
Among us?

162
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,621
But, Hattori!

163
00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:11,906
You just said!

164
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:16,406
The culprit who killed Ms. Tenko was an outsider!

165
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,406
The intruder's target

166
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:22,306
was Mr. Masakage's notes in the storage room on the 2nd floor

167
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:25,906
down the hall to the right!

168
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:28,606
And Ms. Tenko ran into him when he was looking for the book,

169
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,106
was killed,

170
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:34,506
and afterwards, Mr. Hoshikawa, Kazuha and Ran came in.

171
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:35,906
After the blackout,

172
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:39,006
the culprit put Ms. Tenko's body at the end of the hallway,

173
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:42,206
went into Mr. Masakage's room down the hall to the left

174
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,707
and escaped from the window.

175
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:49,206
There were works on the hallway switch to make it look like a blackout.

176
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,306
During the blackout,

177
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:53,806
Mr. Handa and Mrs. Masakage were in the room downstairs,

178
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:57,206
Mr. Hoshikawa was being clung onto by Kazuha and Ran

179
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,706
and couldn't move.

180
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:02,106
If it wasn't an outsider,

181
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:08,407
how would someone among the three put Ms. Tenko's body over there?

182
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:12,806
Also Mrs. Masakage, you said that,

183
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:17,106
5 years ago, a suspicious person who called Mr. Masakage,

184
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:20,206
your husband a phony visited.

185
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:24,107
If there's anyone to be suspicious about, wouldn't it be him?

186
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:28,606
The man that visited many times,

187
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,906
didn't he have a habit or something?

188
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,406
Huh? Habit?

189
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:39,006
I don't know. There might have been, but it's been 5 years...

190
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,806
For example,

191
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:45,706
pushing up the middle of his sunglasses with his left hand little finger.

192
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:48,507
Right, right! That habit...

193
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:50,406
What?

194
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,706
Why does Heiji know?

195
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:54,606
I don't know

196
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,606
but I know that what Mrs. Masakage is saying

197
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:59,306
the person in the very right of this picture,

198
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:03,106
the man with a hat, sunglasses, and a moustache is the one!

199
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:05,106
Isn't it...

200
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:08,306
Mr. Handa when he was young?

201
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,406
That's right. Mr. Handa pushed up the middle of his sunglasses

202
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,906
with his left hand little finger.

203
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:18,306
Then, the suspicious man Mrs. Masakage met 5 years ago

204
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:19,606
was Mr. Handa.

205
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,006
Stupid!

206
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,006
If that man was Mr. Handa who was living in this house

207
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,606
as Mr. Masakage's pupil,

208
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:29,106
Mrs. Masakage would've recognized him!

209
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:31,506
Oh, that's true.

210
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:34,306
Well, that's to say... when people say things that's not true

211
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:37,106
but actually sounds like it's true,

212
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:41,606
they usually visualize someone they know in their heads!

213
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:45,107
It would be bothersome if things don't add up later on.

214
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:47,606
And that someone is...

215
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:51,306
Mr. Handa when he was young!

216
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:55,806
I see. If that man's habit is just like Mr. Handa's,

217
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,606
Mrs. Masakage will have no problem recognizing it,

218
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:00,806
so it will not be suspected.

219
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,306
But...

220
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:04,207
Why lie like that...

221
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:08,306
She realized who the culprit was

222
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:11,306
from where Ms. Tenko's body lay

223
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,907
and from the state the body was found.

224
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,306
Mr. Hoshikawa...

225
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,807
you are the murderer!

226
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:25,806
Then Mrs. Masakage, you covered up for Mr. Hoshikawa.

227
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,606
No, that can't be true!

228
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,106
When Mr. Hoshikawa found Ms. Tenko,

229
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:33,506
I was clinging on to him so he wasn't able to move.

230
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:38,406
That's why I'm going to unravel that mystery right now!

231
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,206
Look at this, this hallway.

232
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:41,606
It's the same as last time, right?

233
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:44,406
Yes, just like this.

234
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,306
It was poorly-lit

235
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:49,706
but I noticed there was nothing at the end of the hallway.

236
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:52,106
Well, at that time,

237
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:55,906
I was holding on to Mr. Hoshikawa's arm like this!

238
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:57,106
Stupid!

239
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,206
You're too close!

240
00:13:58,207 --> 00:14:00,006
So you won't play any tricks on me!

241
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,507
So behave!

242
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,506
Hey.

243
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:05,806
Hey, so hurry up and unravel the mystery!

244
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:10,306
When Mr. Hoshikawa pressed this switch,

245
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,106
you said it blacked out.

246
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:15,607
If it blacked out, the breaker...

247
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,007
Conan?

248
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,506
Since when were you there?

249
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,906
How did you...

250
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,506
I was here all the time.

251
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:31,406
Don't lie to me!

252
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:32,506
When it got dark,

253
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:35,506
you came out of the storage room, didn't you?

254
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,106
No.

255
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:40,106
I was here in this storage room the whole time

256
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,206
but the door didn't open.

257
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:46,207
But I didn't see Conan.

258
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,607
Huh? What?

259
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,006
What is it, Conan?

260
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,906
-Huh? -Disappeared?

261
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,606
We didn't disappear!

262
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,206
Conan?

263
00:14:58,207 --> 00:14:59,406
Like this.

264
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:05,207
Brother Heiji just moved Mr. Masakage's room door like this.

265
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,106
During the blackout.

266
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,607
Just like Mr. Hoshikawa did.

267
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,707
That can't be true!

268
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:23,606
This is...

269
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:26,406
Isn't it similar? This room...

270
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,407
looks just like the end of the hallway.

271
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:33,606
The door of the storage room is that closet.

272
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:37,206
The right wall is this screen!

273
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:39,706
And...

274
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,907
The small window at the end of the hallway is...

275
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:48,207
The big window hidden by this sideboard.

276
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:52,606
This is the door in front of Mr. Masakage's room that can be seen.

277
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:53,907
And...

278
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:59,706
if behind Mr. Masakage's room door is the mirror...

279
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,606
You can tell already, right?

280
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,906
Before the blackout, what Kazuha and Ran saw

281
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:10,907
was the room seen as reflected in the mirror behind the door!

282
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:15,406
Then, the body was at the end of the hallway from the very beginning?

283
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,306
So during the blackout,

284
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:23,206
Mr. Hoshikawa shut the mirror door and showed it!

285
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:28,306
But when we entered the room, there was no mirror in back of the door.

286
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:32,307
That's right, that's right! There was no extra door at all!

287
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:34,806
Conan?

288
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:37,706
This door is some door

289
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:43,006
move the mirror by the knob and put the door together.

290
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,606
And it becomes one door. Some trick!

291
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:50,006
You noticed the trick because the door was too thick

292
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:52,706
and the line down the center, right?

293
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:53,707
Yes.

294
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,106
And also

295
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:57,306
because of the uncomfortable feeling Kazuha and that lady

296
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,106
-was talking about! -Huh?

297
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:04,206
You were saying, before and after Ms. Tenko's body was found,

298
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,306
the shadow of the vase was different.

299
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:10,306
I was convinced as I recalled that

300
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:13,106
before and after Ms. Tenko's body was found,

301
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:15,106
it must have been a different place

302
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:17,906
where the moonlight was cast differently.

303
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:21,706
But this house is a convenient house for tricks.

304
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,207
Of course,

305
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,806
this door, room, hallway,

306
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:31,706
Mr. Masakage made everything in order to play this trick.

307
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:33,106
What?

308
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:36,006
Bring the guests to this hallway.

309
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,506
When he turns off the light closes the door,

310
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:41,706
and shows the Christmas tree at the end of the hall

311
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:45,506
and surprises everyone with the magic.

312
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:46,606
So that's it!

313
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,506
That's why Mrs. Masakage knew that Mr. Hoshikawa

314
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:51,206
was the culprit from the beginning.

315
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:55,407
But, wasn't it you who wanted to come here, Mr. Handa?

316
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:59,806
Mr. Hoshikawa didn't intend to kill.

317
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,906
His intent to kill probably developed

318
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:04,406
when Ms. Tenko said she was going to do

319
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:06,606
the trick "Witch Reborn" in the next show.

320
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:08,006
No.

321
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:11,106
Actually it's "The Resurrection of the Devil",

322
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:15,006
the title of the magic Mr. Masakage thought of.

323
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:19,606
-Huh? -The same stage setup and performance.

324
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,606
I realized right away

325
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:24,706
that she looked at Mr. Masakage's trick book

326
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:27,107
and was going to copy it.

327
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,906
The magic that had been sealed because it was too dangerous.

328
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:33,906
That miracle magic.

329
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:37,706
But, she was just going to steal the master's trick.

330
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:40,106
She didn't know that.

331
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,906
Everyone, in other words, we discussed

332
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:44,306
and decided not to do that magic

333
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:48,506
because it was before she became my husband's pupil.

334
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:50,906
Mrs. Masakage covered up for me

335
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:55,206
when she said the book was in the storage room.

336
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:59,606
Master always carried the book around.

337
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:05,006
But one day ten years ago, he misplaced the trick book

338
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:09,406
and said he was going to go look for it but never came back.

339
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:13,806
I thought it was strange for her to be able to look at the book

340
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:17,906
so I called her to the teacher's room and confronted her.

341
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,206
That's right, I stole it.

342
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:23,606
I am clever with by hands by profession.

343
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:27,006
I was going to return it to the teacher when he returned

344
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,806
but I didn't think he would be so shocked

345
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:31,606
as to disappear from before everyone.

346
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:32,706
But...

347
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:35,906
the teacher who was always telling us to surpass him

348
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:39,206
didn't realize that he was betrayed.

349
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:41,807
It was probably his time to quit

350
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,507
as a magician.

351
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:52,306
Well, if I perform Mr. Masakage's not-yet-performed magic

352
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:55,206
all over the world,

353
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:59,207
the master will be happy from under the sod, don't you think?

354
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,506
That's why you killed her?

355
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:12,406
My mind went into total panic, and when I snapped back to myself,

356
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:15,406
she was all bloody lying in front of me.

357
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:19,706
I recalled the master's Christmas tree magic

358
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:23,507
and used that to make it look like an outsider had killed her.

359
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:28,006
Then you broke the branches in the shrubbery,

360
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:30,406
and erased the footprints.

361
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:31,806
Yes.

362
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:36,506
Probably, the weapon was the vase in Masakage's room.

363
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:40,506
There was blood on the base of the vase

364
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:44,306
and maybe a few drops of blood got on Mr. Hoshikawa's black clothes.

365
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,706
The evidence is all over the place.

366
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:49,606
I failed as a magician.

367
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:52,006
You're a failure even if you're not a magician!

368
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:54,706
Brace yourself.

369
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:59,307
Unlike magic, your charge will not disappear easily.

370
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:36,906
Wow, what can you expect of Hattori!

371
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:38,807
It was excellent deduction!

372
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:44,907
You are no less than Kudo, maybe even more!

373
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:48,407
Inspector, you think so too?

374
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:52,906
By the way, Brother Heiji, weren't you saying?

375
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:54,206
Huh?

376
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:59,106
That you get annoyed when Sister Kazuha is friendly with other men!

377
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:00,206
Huh?

378
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:02,706
What does that mean?

379
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:06,606
Oh, that's right! Now I know why.

380
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:08,307
Huh? What?

381
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:12,706
I probably think of you...

382
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:14,006
What?

383
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:18,206
No. No, Heiji, not in front of everyone.

384
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,907
As my henchman.

385
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:21,507
Huh?

386
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:23,706
What did you just say?

387
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:25,806
Henchman, my henchman!

388
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:30,206
As the boss, I wouldn't feel good if you wag your tail at someone else,

389
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:31,806
I'll lose face, right?

390
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:35,106
That's why I was annoyed!

391
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:37,306
Why should I be your henchman?

392
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:39,606
Your father is my father's henchman!

393
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:41,607
So, of course you're my henchman!

394
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,006
That night, I got mail from Ran.

395
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:53,106
P.S. Shinichi, I hope you don't think of me as your henchman?

396
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:55,507
Hey, hey.

397
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:00,507
"Taketori Story."

398
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,406
Okay, stop!

399
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:06,907
Behave yourself!

400
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,206
The traveling acting group featuring Tamanosuke Ito

401
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:14,006
has come to our town to put on a show again.

402
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:17,506
Then, it was just a week ago,

403
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:20,206
that the threat note was sent over the internet.

404
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,707
Something's not right.

405
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:24,806
Next Conan,

406
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:28,807
"Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 1)"

407
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:46,606
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:48,806
"Taketori Story."

409
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:50,706
Conan is now in 3D!

410
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:53,307
Come see us at Tempozan, Osaka during summer vacation!
