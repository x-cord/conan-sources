1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,380
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,680
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,680
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,180
Get to the truth of a case

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,180
that even a fortune teller cannot see through.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,580
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,380
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,180
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:58,507
"Shattered Horoscope".

10
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,407
The essential thing for a detective to do

11
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:09,207
is to grasp the case objectively.

12
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:11,507
And to be able to make logical deductions

13
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,807
without getting carried away by emotion, I guess.

14
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:18,007
Oh, does that mean you do not believe

15
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:19,607
"Reika Shijo (38)" -in things like astrology

16
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,507
"Astrologist" -that I work with, Mr. Mouri?

17
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:24,007
No, that's not what I mean.

18
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,507
Although it's a bit different from astrology,

19
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:31,507
the sixth sense and inspiration are needed to solve cases.

20
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:37,207
Inspiration to see through the truth of the cases intuitively that is!

21
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:41,207
Then, are there times that you think about fortune telling?

22
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:43,607
Well, I guess I do at times.

23
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,907
A whimsical publisher

24
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:51,707
has brought together the now famous astrologist, Reika Shijio

25
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,207
"Kensuke Katsuragi (45)" -and famous detective Kogoro Mouri,

26
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,907
"Starry Sky Weekly's President" -for a discussion,

27
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:58,507
so we all came to Reika Shijo's residence.

28
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,107
"Masao Tamura (32), Editor"

29
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:04,507
I guess I was born with the talent to be a detective

30
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:08,507
because at times, cases are solved without my being aware.

31
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,307
Oh, my. You've got to be kidding.

32
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:17,707
Ms. Reika, you have a call from Mr. Nakame of Tohto TV.

33
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:21,007
"Yuka Shiraishi (26), Reika's apperentice" -It seems to be an urgent call.

34
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,907
I'm in the middle of work now,

35
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:24,807
-later, okay? -Yes, ma'am.

36
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,807
Okay, I'm going to start taking pictures!

37
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:34,407
Mr. Mouri, you don't have to make forced smiles.

38
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:37,007
What a lovely place.

39
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,507
It used to be the villa of a certain person of financial standing

40
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,207
but Reika bought it from him.

41
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:42,207
Reika?

42
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:43,907
I mean...

43
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:46,107
Ms. Reika.

44
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:49,507
Stained glass.

45
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:54,607
Yeah. Ms. Reika herself designed it and had it made.

46
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,907
You can find it in various places inside this mansion.

47
00:03:57,907 --> 00:04:03,107
Her guardian star, Scorpio, is placed over her profile.

48
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:06,907
I'll go get the door.

49
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,307
Bitter!

50
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:12,707
This tea is too strong,

51
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,907
that there's practically no aroma to it!

52
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:16,507
I... I'm sorry.

53
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,107
I'll make another cup of tea right away!

54
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:26,807
You're...

55
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:29,907
"Clara Midorikawa (28), Actress" -Actress Clara Midorikawa!

56
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:31,707
I didn't know you had a guest.

57
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:34,407
This is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

58
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,907
This is something that a publisher planned and we're having a talk.

59
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,107
How do you do?

60
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:41,807
It's an honor to get to see you.

61
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:44,607
Ms. Reika, could I have a minute with you?

62
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:49,707
This is the last time, don't bug me anymore!

63
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,607
I've paid you more than enough, haven't I?

64
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:54,007
Are you sure that's what you want to say?

65
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,607
If I spill out what I know,

66
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:58,207
you're finished, you know.

67
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,307
But if things continue the way they are,

68
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:03,407
I've got no choice but to hang myself.

69
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,807
If you want to pull free of me,

70
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,607
go find someone else to take your place.

71
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,907
Someone else?

72
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,907
Yes, someone to take your place.

73
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:13,807
Anyone will do.

74
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:17,807
Anyone with money and troubled with scandals.

75
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:22,707
Introduce someone else and you can go free.

76
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:29,207
Who's this handsome guy?

77
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,807
What're you talking about?

78
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:36,107
Mr. Mouri, I will read your horoscope.

79
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:38,707
I think it will only take about an hour.

80
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:41,807
Please help yourself to some wine while you wait.

81
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,307
Clara, please come to my room at 5:00.

82
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:45,607
Okay.

83
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:05,907
Ms. Reika!

84
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,807
Oh, Ran.

85
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,407
Is there anything I can do for you?

86
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:14,907
I'd like you to give me a reading.

87
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,307
That's why I begged dad to bring me along.

88
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:23,407
It's something I'd really like to know about.

89
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:26,107
It's something that's really bothering you, isn't it?

90
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,307
Okay.

91
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,707
I'll give you a reading.

92
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:31,107
-Really? -Yes.

93
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:34,007
But I can't access the information now.

94
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:38,307
There are many others who are waiting to be read.

95
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,507
I see.

96
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,307
I'll give you this instead.

97
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:45,107
A lucky charm.

98
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:47,607
I can't accept something so expensive!

99
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,907
I'll let you keep it for me then,

100
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:53,307
until the day that I get to tell your fortune. Okay?

101
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:55,507
Yes!

102
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:57,707
I'll try to make time for you as soon as possible.

103
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:59,407
Thank you very much!

104
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:18,607
That can't be!

105
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:24,607
Didn't you promise to let me write this corner next time?

106
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:27,307
I was planning to let you too.

107
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,507
But Reika says no.

108
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,007
She wants to do

109
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:36,007
a fortune telling corner that is totally different from astrology.

110
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,807
It's not that you're not good or anything like that.

111
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:40,807
That's only a facade.

112
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:43,707
Ms. Reika doesn't like me!

113
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:50,407
Tres bien! (Excellent)

114
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,607
What's wrong, Yuka?

115
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:57,907
Were you scolded by Ms. Reika again?

116
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:04,707
I feel sorry for her because she's always being scolded by Ms. Reika.

117
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:08,307
Yuka is Ms. Reika's niece, but just because she's her niece,

118
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:11,007
Yuka is treated like a housemaid.

119
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,207
Well, I guess that's part of training too.

120
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,207
Excellent!

121
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:31,707
Yeah, it's me.

122
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:34,007
About that special...

123
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,607
Which way is the restroom?

124
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,107
Go left and straight ahead all the way down.

125
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:40,307
Thanks.

126
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,707
Left. Left.

127
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:55,107
I should've played soccer with Genta and the others

128
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:57,107
rather than come here.

129
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,607
It's a red-flanked blue-tail.

130
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:05,507
I wonder if they come all the way down here.

131
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,007
How rare.

132
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:19,507
Ms. Reika, dinner's ready.

133
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,007
Ms. Reika.

134
00:09:25,907 --> 00:09:28,107
There's no answer no matter how many times I call.

135
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:30,207
Maybe she's asleep.

136
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:35,707
She's not the type to keep her customers waiting though.

137
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:37,007
Let's go see!

138
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,407
Mr. Mouri, will you please come with me?

139
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,707
Okay, if you want me to.

140
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,907
Ms. Reika! Ms. Reika!

141
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:48,807
Reika, is anything the matter?

142
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,507
The door's locked!

143
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,807
This is strange. Maybe there's something wrong.

144
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:55,407
Let's go check from the veranda.

145
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:56,407
Okay.

146
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,107
Reika! What's wrong? Reika!

147
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:12,907
No good!

148
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:15,607
Right, maybe we can crack the skylight.

149
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,407
I'll climb up there.

150
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,907
Will you hold the door for me, Mr. Tamura?

151
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:20,907
Yes, sir!

152
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:24,807
Please unlock the door as soon as you get inside!

153
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,207
Hold on, Reika.

154
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:53,907
Reika...

155
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:56,107
Please open your eyes, Reika!

156
00:10:56,107 --> 00:11:00,207
The only way in and out of the room was locked.

157
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:03,007
The window is a non-opening window.

158
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,407
In other words, this is...

159
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:07,507
a locked door murder!

160
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:20,472
The victim is Ms. Reika Shijo, an astrologist.

161
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,972
It looks like she's been dead between three to three and a half hours.

162
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:26,172
The estimated time of the murder

163
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:28,772
is probably some time a little before or after 17:00.

164
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,972
You went in by cracking the skylight

165
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:34,872
because the door was locked?

166
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:37,472
And where was the key found?

167
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:39,472
It was on the floor around there.

168
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:43,172
Mr. Katsuragi picked it up and opened the door.

169
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:45,072
Do you have a spare key?

170
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:48,572
Yuka, her disciple may have the key.

171
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:57,072
A bird feather is on the floor.

172
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:59,272
The feather of a red-flanked blue-tail!

173
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:03,272
I saw it on the roof about 5:30!

174
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:06,272
If the feather back then fell from the cracked skylight,

175
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:09,572
isn't it strange that it's underneath the shattered glass?

176
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:11,172
Hey!

177
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:14,172
Don't go here and there on your own at the site of the murder!

178
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:15,472
Ms. Shiraishi.

179
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:18,772
Do you have the spare key to Reika's room?

180
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:19,972
No.

181
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:24,672
The key that Ms. Reika had was the only key to that room.

182
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:28,472
Yuka, being as near to her as you usually were,

183
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:32,872
wouldn't it have been quite easy for you to make a spare key?

184
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:33,972
Why would I?

185
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:35,472
Don't tell me

186
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:37,172
that you held a grudge against Ms. Reika

187
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:39,972
because she was against you writing a fortunetelling section in a magazine.

188
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:41,972
No way!

189
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:44,072
Now that Ms. Reika is passed on,

190
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:49,672
you'd be her only bereaved family, inheriting her entire estate.

191
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:51,172
I see.

192
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:54,172
The killer is you, Yuka!

193
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:55,172
What?

194
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:58,472
You secretly made a spare key and...

195
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:01,172
Inspector, we got a verification as to the spare key.

196
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:05,072
-And? -Yes, sir.

197
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:08,272
This is a special type of key called dimple key

198
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:12,072
and only the manufacturer of this key is able to make a spare.

199
00:13:12,072 --> 00:13:13,172
Moreover,

200
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:16,172
when you make a spare you've got to get credit card authorization too.

201
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:19,272
That's why it would be almost impossible for anybody but the victim

202
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:21,572
to make a spare key.

203
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:23,472
We confirmed with the manufacturer

204
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:25,472
that this is the one and only key to her room.

205
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,372
No... no way.

206
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:30,072
If so, this case is quite complicated.

207
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:34,472
Yes, since the only key there is was inside the room.

208
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,672
A locked room murder case.

209
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:39,772
Hold on! What if Mr. Katsuragi switched keys

210
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:43,872
from the one he had hidden to the real one when he unlocked the door?

211
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:45,672
What a thing to say.

212
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:48,672
No, I was watching him from beginning to end,

213
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:50,572
but he did no such thing.

214
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:53,672
Right. I was watching too.

215
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:55,072
Ms. Shiraishi.

216
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:58,572
When did you last see Reika?

217
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,372
When she left the living room

218
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,672
and headed to her workshop.

219
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:04,472
Where were you after that?

220
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:07,372
After talking to Mr. Katsuragi for two to three minutes,

221
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:09,172
I was in the kitchen right through.

222
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:15,272
I was in the kitchen all the while, helping her make dinner.

223
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,372
And you, Mr. Tamura?

224
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:19,472
The same as Yuka.

225
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:22,872
After that, I was with Mr. Mouri in the living room right through.

226
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,472
And you, Mr. Katsuragi?

227
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:25,972
The same with me.

228
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:29,272
I made a business call from the guest room,

229
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:33,572
and from after 17:00, I was here talking to Mr. Mouri and Mr. Tamura.

230
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,672
What about you, Ms. Midorikawa?

231
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:40,172
The... the same as everyone else.

232
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:43,572
Come to think of it, when I went to the restroom at about 5:00,

233
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,172
you came down from the second floor, didn't you?

234
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:50,472
That's because I had an appointment to have my fortune told at that time!

235
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,172
Don't tell me that you, Clara, killed Ms. Reika at that time.

236
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:55,172
Don't be ridiculous!

237
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:57,272
Why would I killed her?

238
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,872
Clara.

239
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:03,272
When I came here last month on business,

240
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:06,772
I saw you come out of Ms. Reika's room.

241
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,872
I'll kill that woman one day!

242
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:13,972
Kill her? Why on earth?

243
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:16,272
Reika is an ugly woman!

244
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:19,372
At first, she approaches you like she's a nice person,

245
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:22,272
then she pries into your privacy, saying that it's for fortunetelling.

246
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:25,272
After she gets hold of your weak points,

247
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,972
she turns into a devil

248
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:30,272
demanding a large sum of money for the reading!

249
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:32,872
I tried to break off all ties with her,

250
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:35,372
but she threatened to leak my private information to the media.

251
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:38,172
I see. She threatened you.

252
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:41,172
So, you were cornered into killing Reika.

253
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:42,472
No!

254
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:43,972
I went up to her room but...

255
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:49,272
I'm in the middle of work now. Later, okay?

256
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:53,972
That's why I came back without going inside!

257
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,872
Can you prove it?

258
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,972
Well, I don't know how...

259
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,072
Conan.

260
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:09,172
Ran.

261
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:11,672
I thought she was a kind person,

262
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:14,272
and I didn't think she'd threaten anyone.

263
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,372
I wanted her to give me a reading,

264
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:19,672
but she told me that she couldn't do so right away

265
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:21,072
and gave me this.

266
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,472
She told me it was a lucky charm.

267
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:25,272
She had it on the key holder that her key was on.

268
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:27,172
What's that?

269
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:28,972
She gave it to me before I went into her room

270
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,972
to ask her to give me a reading on dad.

271
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,572
That's...

272
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:38,072
"I'm in the middle of work now. Later, okay?"

273
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:40,272
The remark sure sounds familiar.

274
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:45,072
The skylight was made with the same thing as this.

275
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:52,872
This is...

276
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:58,372
I get it. That's the story!

277
00:16:58,372 --> 00:16:59,872
At any rate, everyone,

278
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:01,272
I know it's troublesome,

279
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:03,172
but I would like you all to come to the station

280
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,672
and give us the details.

281
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:07,372
-Oh, no. -Okay.

282
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:12,372
The wine's getting to me only now.

283
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:17,472
Please wait, Inspector.

284
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:20,472
The only one you need to take to the station is the murderer.

285
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:24,472
What? Then, have you figured out who the murderer is?

286
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:25,672
Of course!

287
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:30,672
The locked room trick is not all that difficult.

288
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:33,272
The person who killed Reika

289
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:35,272
walked out of the room with the key

290
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:37,872
and locked the door.

291
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:39,872
He then, climbed the roof

292
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:42,972
and cracked part of the stained glass, opened a hole in it

293
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:45,872
and dropped the key inside from there.

294
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:53,172
The feather of the red-flanked blue-tail that Conan saw at around 5:30

295
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,472
dropped into the room from the hole that the killer made.

296
00:17:56,472 --> 00:18:00,672
That's why it was underneath the shattered piece of glass.

297
00:18:00,672 --> 00:18:01,972
As proof of that,

298
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:06,472
there are no shattered pieces of red pieces of glass.

299
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:07,572
That is,

300
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:10,372
there are no pieces of glass that are part of the Antares of Scorpio.

301
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,472
But why did the murderer

302
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:15,072
go as far as to commit a locked room murder?

303
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:18,072
In order to make a scapegoat of Yuka.

304
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:24,172
The murderer probably thought that Yuka had a spare key.

305
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:27,072
But since no such key existed,

306
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,672
it turned out to be a locked room murder case.

307
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:31,172
I see.

308
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:34,272
If so, then the murderer is Ms. Clara Midorikawa after all.

309
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:35,272
No!

310
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:36,772
No.

311
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:39,072
When Clara went to the room,

312
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:41,972
Reika was already killed.

313
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:43,072
What?

314
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,672
But I'm sure that I heard her voice!

315
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:46,872
Mr. Tamura.

316
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:50,572
You recorded me talking to Reika, didn't you?

317
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:51,572
Yes.

318
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:54,372
There was a phone call part way through the talk, wasn't there?

319
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:57,472
Could we listen to that part of the conversation?

320
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:58,772
Sure.

321
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:04,072
It seems to be an urgent call.

322
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:05,772
I'm in the middle of work now.

323
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:06,872
Later, okay?

324
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:12,272
Ms. Reika, it's me, Clara Midorikawa.

325
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,472
I'm working now.

326
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:18,172
Later, okay?

327
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:21,972
Which mean that the murderer is Mr. Tamura since he has a recorder.

328
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,372
No way!

329
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:28,172
Anybody can have a recorder hidden in his pocket.

330
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:30,672
Right, Mr. Katsuragi?

331
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:32,572
What the?

332
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,872
The one who killed Reika is...

333
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:38,272
you, Mr. Katsuragi!

334
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:43,672
Don't be ridiculous!

335
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:45,272
You mentioned a while ago

336
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:49,472
that maybe Yuka had the spare key to the room.

337
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,772
If so, why didn't you call her

338
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:55,272
when you found out you couldn't go into the room?

339
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:58,072
It... it just didn't dawn on me

340
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,372
because I was in a rush!

341
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:02,672
No. In order to hide the hole that you made

342
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:04,872
to drop the key into the room,

343
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,772
you needed to crack the skylight!

344
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:08,972
Wrong!

345
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,972
Then, let me ask you.

346
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:13,972
When you broke the skylight and landed in the room,

347
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:16,872
there were many keys on the floor.

348
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:21,272
But you without hesitation picked up the key to the room.

349
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:24,372
How did you know that it was the key to the room?

350
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,972
The key holder!

351
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:29,672
It's because I knew from before

352
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:31,872
that the key holder with the sapphires

353
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:34,272
was the one with the key to the room!

354
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:36,372
That's strange,

355
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:37,872
because that key holder that the key was attached to

356
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,972
was switched just before the murder was committed.

357
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:44,372
When my daughter asked Reika to read her fortune,

358
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:48,472
she gave my daughter her key holder as a lucky charm.

359
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:49,972
Isn't that right, Ran?

360
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:50,972
Yes.

361
00:20:55,272 --> 00:21:00,072
The room key was attached to the Sapphire key holder

362
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:02,372
after Reika entered her workshop.

363
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:07,172
How can you, who haven't seen or talked to Reika after that,

364
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:09,372
have known about this?

365
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:14,272
The only person who can tell that the key on the sapphire key holder

366
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,572
is the one for room,

367
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:17,172
other than Reika,

368
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:21,172
is the murderer who used the key to carry out the locked room murder,

369
00:21:21,172 --> 00:21:22,472
Mr. Katsuragi!

370
00:21:28,472 --> 00:21:30,372
That woman's to blame.

371
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:35,172
She suddenly demanded me to pay her back all the money that she invested.

372
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:36,372
She told me that if I can't pay her back,

373
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:40,172
she was going to sell my story of getting insider information from a printer

374
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:43,072
and sell it to the magazines.

375
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:21,872
Ran.

376
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:23,672
What did you want her to read for you?

377
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:24,872
What?

378
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,672
Where Shinichi is right now?

379
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,072
I'm right here.

380
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:35,472
I wonder...

381
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:37,272
if he's really doing okay.

382
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:44,372
Rather than worry about Shinichi,

383
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:47,172
I think first priority is how we're going to

384
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:49,672
take Pops home, don't you think?

385
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:56,772
I wonder if there's anyone who reads snores?

386
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:01,972
"Next Episode" -24 hours with Kogoro Mouri?

387
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:04,972
I will accept your offer!

388
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:12,472
You came into this locked room before anyone else did

389
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:16,672
and hid the evidence you didn't get to erase!

390
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:20,172
Wrong. This is no ordinary murder.

391
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:23,672
This is an impossible crime!

392
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,172
Next Conan,

393
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:29,072
"Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 1)".

394
00:24:44,872 --> 00:24:46,872
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:49,172
"Wet jacket".

396
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:50,672
The playboy, Officer Takagi!

397
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:51,672
Wild racket?

398
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:54,272
Next on Detective Conan is "Wild Cheating Racket".
