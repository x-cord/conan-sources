1
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:06,221
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:09,021
Out of the fourth corner, Number 7, Darkest Nightmare is in the lead!

3
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:11,921
-All right! Come on... -Behind him is Number 4, Kid the Sunflower!

4
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:13,921
Will Nightmare stay ahead? Or will Kid catch up?

5
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:15,421
Will it be Nightmare or Kid?

6
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:17,221
Nightmare is closing in! So is Kid!

7
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:20,421
-It's Darkest Nightmare! -No! I lost again!

8
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:21,621
Number 7, Darkest Nightmare wins!

9
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,021
So, how much did you bet on this race?

10
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:27,921
Huh? Not much.

11
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:29,921
How much?

12
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:33,221
A thousand each on four or five races in the second half.

13
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:35,621
And you lost all of that?

14
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:37,121
Yes.

15
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:40,221
Fine. No allowance for you this month.

16
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:44,721
Hey, the G1 race is next week!

17
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:48,421
Darn it! Today's just not my lucky day.

18
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:50,521
What do you mean?

19
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:54,321
It was sunny when I left for the betting booth,

20
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:57,621
but it started raining the second I got there.

21
00:00:57,622 --> 00:01:00,421
When I went to buy cigarettes after getting my tickets,

22
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,921
"Sold Out" -my usual ones were sold out.

23
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:05,921
Not only that, someone ran into me,

24
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:08,821
and all the change fell out of my wallet.

25
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:12,521
To top it all off, my wallet fell into a puddle.

26
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,421
The tickets in my wallet

27
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:17,121
"4, Kid the Sunflower" -got soaking wet, too.

28
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:20,522
Well, they're losing tickets, so it's not like it matters.

29
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:26,221
Anyway, what do you want for dinner?

30
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:29,421
I'm in a bad mood, so let's celebrate with...

31
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,221
We can't afford to celebrate!

32
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:32,321
-What? -Sheesh.

33
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:33,421
Huh?

34
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:34,921
What is it?

35
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:39,121
Didn't Pirate's Spirit from race nine win?

36
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:40,521
-What? -In third was Number 6,

37
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:43,121
"Tansho, 8 Pirate's Spirit" -Raven Chaser.

38
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:46,121
Tansho tickets for Number 8 win 10500 yen.

39
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:47,921
-Umaren tickets... -Seriously?

40
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,421
That was the dark horse! This pays out a hundred-fold!

41
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,521
How much is it?

42
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:56,422
Well, he bought it for ten thousand, so...

43
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:02,822
"One Million Yen" -One million yen?

44
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:06,421
I knew I could do it! All right!

45
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:10,321
But he only bet a thousand on the other tickets.

46
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:13,321
Why did he bet ten thousand on just that one?

47
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:17,221
Maybe when he dropped his wallet,

48
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:21,021
he picked up someone else's ticket and put it in his wallet?

49
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:24,821
I could've accidentally added another digit.

50
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:27,821
Besides, even if I did pick up a ticket

51
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:30,221
and put it in my wallet,

52
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:33,721
the buyer's name isn't written on the ticket.

53
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:36,521
It's their fault for dropping it.

54
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:40,021
All right, tonight we're having sushi for dinner, sushi!

55
00:02:40,022 --> 00:02:43,022
We're heading to Beika Iroha Sushi next door!

56
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,921
Today is a great day.

57
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:49,822
I thought you weren't lucky today.

58
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:54,121
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

59
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,221
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

60
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:58,021
A ten thousand yen ticket yields an easy payout!

61
00:02:58,022 --> 00:03:00,121
But I smell a case at Iroha Sushi!

62
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:01,821
He sees through the one and only truth.

63
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:03,721
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

64
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:06,522
His name is Detective Conan!

65
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:52,454
"The Tokyo-Style Detective Show Next Door (Part 1)"

66
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:55,553
There.

67
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:57,454
Welcome.

68
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:00,053
Huh?

69
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,454
We're the only customers.

70
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,353
Don't make it sound like business is slow.

71
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:11,554
Just imagine you've reserved the restaurant for yourselves, sir.

72
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:16,053
One beer and three extra specials.

73
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,653
Make one without wasabi for the kid.

74
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:19,654
You got it.

75
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:23,453
One beer and three extra specials, one without wasabi.

76
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:26,953
Dad. I can't believe you ordered extra specials.

77
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:30,953
Don't worry. We've got this.

78
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:33,053
You're misappropriating a lost ticket.

79
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,153
Shut up.

80
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:37,554
Anyway, sir, you're a curious person.

81
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:43,953
I can't believe you bet all that money on Pirate's Spirit.

82
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,153
Huh?

83
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:47,053
How did you know?

84
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:50,153
You didn't see me pick it up, did you?

85
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:53,053
Pick it up? What are you talking about?

86
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:55,753
I just used my detective skills.

87
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,053
Detective skills?

88
00:05:57,054 --> 00:06:00,953
My neighbour Kogoro Mouri loves horse racing.

89
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:06,653
The boss said you only come here when you win at the races.

90
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:11,653
And I heard you normally only order regulars or specials,

91
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,853
but today you ordered the extra special.

92
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:16,553
You must've won big.

93
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:19,053
The radio said they were only selling dark horse payout tickets

94
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:24,153
for Pirate's Spirit today, so I thought that had to be it.

95
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:28,953
Well? How are my detective skills, Sleeping Kogoro?

96
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:33,253
Huh? They're all right.

97
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:36,453
Anyway, I don't recognize you.

98
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:38,853
-Are you new? -Yeah.

99
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:42,053
"Kanenori Wakita (56), Cook" -I'm Kanenori Wakita, a cook.

100
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:45,953
I'm not the type of guy to settle down in one place.

101
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:50,553
I eventually ended up here. I'm what you'd call a drifter.

102
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:51,853
I see.

103
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:54,553
I'd rather be in the kitchen,

104
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:57,753
but it's too dangerous for me to use a knife with one eye.

105
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:58,953
The boss told me to handle customers

106
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:01,654
-until my left eye gets better... -Come to think of it, Rum...

107
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:05,053
Lose?

108
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:08,553
Come to think of it, that's what they all said.

109
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,153
That he was missing one.

110
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,753
He?

111
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:13,953
Rum.

112
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:16,453
He injured an eye in some kind of accident.

113
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:20,154
Either his right or left eye is an artificial eye.

114
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,253
Hey, mister.

115
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:25,153
-Huh? -What happened to your left eye?

116
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:28,753
Oh, it's a real mess.

117
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:29,853
You want to see?

118
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:31,754
No, thank you...

119
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:37,654
Anyway, tell me about the cases you've solved.

120
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:42,553
I've loved mysteries since I was a little kid.

121
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,053
Since I heard you live next door to this place,

122
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:48,354
I've been dying to meet you.

123
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:50,854
In that case...

124
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:56,253
"Iroha Sushi"

125
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:58,653
I see...

126
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:01,653
So she used the footage from an old home video

127
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:05,953
to make it seem like the dead man had come back to life as a zombie.

128
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:09,453
Now that's an incredible case.

129
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,653
Isn't it? Another beer.

130
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:15,653
Oh, sorry. I didn't notice.

131
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:20,953
Dad, Hattori solved that case.

132
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,853
I helped.

133
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:26,053
I'm the one who found the zombie first.

134
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:30,053
You were bedridden after eating some poisonous mushrooms.

135
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:34,754
Anyway, sushi doesn't taste right without wasabi.

136
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:38,254
Here's your beer.

137
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:40,954
Welcome!

138
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:49,553
What'll it be, sir?

139
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:50,853
"Tsunetaka Harashima (25), Customer" -I'll have

140
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:54,153
the nigiri special, some chawanmushi

141
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:55,753
and a cola.

142
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,853
Cola?

143
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,653
What was that, old man?

144
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:02,253
Nothing.

145
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:04,753
-And extra ginger, please. -You got it.

146
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:08,653
Kids these days drink cola with their sushi?

147
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:12,053
Apparently they go together surprisingly well.

148
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:14,453
Really?

149
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,753
Hey.

150
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,453
What is it?

151
00:09:17,454 --> 00:09:18,553
Where's your bathroom?

152
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:22,453
The bathroom's back there.

153
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:23,554
Thank you.

154
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:27,053
What'll it be, sir?

155
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:31,053
The regular nigiri and an oolong tea.

156
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:32,353
"Tameshige Munechika (42), Customer" -Also,

157
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:36,753
do you have the limited availability seasonal grilled fish today?

158
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:39,653
Yeah. We've got horse mackerel today.

159
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:41,553
Then I'll have one of those, too.

160
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:42,753
You got it.

161
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,053
You have grilled fish?

162
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:47,753
Apparently we added it to the menu recently.

163
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,653
We can't make it selling sushi alone.

164
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,553
What a tough world.

165
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:55,253
Come to think of it, they have anmitsu, too.

166
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:57,753
No way. I want some.

167
00:09:57,754 --> 00:09:59,054
Sheesh.

168
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:03,153
What's with this rain?

169
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:04,554
Welcome!

170
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:10,353
What'll it be, miss?

171
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:12,253
The usual.

172
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:15,653
And what would that be?

173
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:18,253
You know, the usual.

174
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,853
Huh? Where's the regular guy?

175
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:24,053
He got hurt in a traffic accident.

176
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:25,453
"Natsume Ashino (33), Customer" -Oh, really?

177
00:10:25,454 --> 00:10:28,253
In that case, I'd like a highball and seafood chirashi.

178
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,653
Extra sea urchin, salmon roe, and wasabi.

179
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:31,754
You got it.

180
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:33,853
Thanks for the food.

181
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:36,453
-Check, please! -Sure thing.

182
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:39,353
-That anmitsu was good. -Yeah.

183
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:43,653
Seriously? They were complaining before we got here.

184
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:48,953
Kogoro, come back and tell me more interesting stories.

185
00:10:48,954 --> 00:10:52,853
I'll take your bill out of my wages and give you a discount.

186
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:54,953
Thanks.

187
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,953
If you take me to a crime scene,

188
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:01,353
I'll give you something extra special.

189
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:04,654
Well, I doubt any crimes will be happening here.

190
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,554
"Suzuyo Hijirisawa (47), Customer?"

191
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,553
Who stole my pouch?

192
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:18,853
I know the thief is in here.

193
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:23,354
Hey, you. What are you talking about?

194
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:25,654
What's your problem?

195
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:33,753
Hey, you!

196
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:37,153
You can't just come in here and start picking fights with our...

197
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,053
Where's the bathroom?

198
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:41,654
The bathroom's back there.

199
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:48,153
Hey, you! If you wanted to use the bathroom, you should've said so!

200
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,253
I found it!

201
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:51,953
Found what?

202
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:53,753
It's not here!

203
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:58,954
Who threw my pouch in the trash can?

204
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,453
What's going on?

205
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:05,253
It was just stolen from me on the train.

206
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,653
This pouch I had in my bag.

207
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:11,353
I see. But how'd you know it'd be here?

208
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:14,353
My wallet and phone were in this pouch.

209
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:18,053
I hurried home and used the GPS on my spare phone

210
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:20,653
to find it in this shop.

211
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:26,453
But none of your customers have a bag they could have put my pouch in.

212
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,253
So I thought they hid it in the bathroom.

213
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:31,553
I see.

214
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:34,153
So, when was it stolen?

215
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,953
About an hour ago.

216
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:41,353
That's shortly before Kogoro and his family arrived.

217
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:45,554
And since none of the customers who arrived after him have left...

218
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:50,153
They might still be inside this store.

219
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:54,054
The thief who stole your pouch on the train.

220
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:58,653
How are you going to find them, though?

221
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,153
If they're smart,

222
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,753
they'll have wiped their fingerprints off the pouch.

223
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:05,853
Don't worry.

224
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:08,953
I put this on the thief.

225
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,053
A band-aid?

226
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:14,953
My hand slipped while I was peeling and apple and I cut my finger.

227
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:18,853
It was bad enough that I bled through the band-aid.

228
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:23,153
I grabbed the right sleeve of the thief

229
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:25,553
who stole my pouch with this hand,

230
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,053
so it should still be on them.

231
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,653
The sleeve of someone in here

232
00:13:30,654 --> 00:13:34,553
should be stained with my red blood that seeped through the band-aid.

233
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,553
Fine.

234
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:37,754
Here.

235
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,453
No one has blood on their sleeve.

236
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:46,653
No way. It can't be.

237
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:48,253
That's not possible.

238
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:51,053
Just how much was stolen?

239
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:53,853
None of the money in my wallet was stolen.

240
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:55,753
Then who cares?

241
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:59,453
But the ticket I had with my cash is missing!

242
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:01,953
My dark horse payout ticket worth a million yen!

243
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,054
What?

244
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:10,733
A dark horse payout ticket worth a million yen?

245
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,933
And the wallet it was inside was stolen?

246
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:18,233
Yeah. I was on the way to get dinner with a friend.

247
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,734
I was listening to the race results on the radio.

248
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,933
No way. I won.

249
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:25,633
Won what?

250
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:28,933
My dark horse payout ticket. It's a million yen.

251
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,233
What?

252
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:31,833
All right!

253
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:34,933
Then you're paying for dinner tonight.

254
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:38,533
Okay. I'll buy you whatever you want.

255
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:43,633
In that case, you're taking me someplace really expensive.

256
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,233
Go ahead.

257
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:47,434
How do you feel about French cuisine?

258
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:51,433
Hey! What are you doing?

259
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:54,833
It was stolen from me in the blink of an eye.

260
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:58,433
You didn't see the thief's face?

261
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:01,033
I didn't have time for that.

262
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,633
I was doing my best to keep them from stealing my pouch.

263
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:07,133
But couldn't your friend have seen them?

264
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:09,633
My friend is really nearsighted.

265
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:12,733
On top of that, she had her glasses pushed up on her forehead

266
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:15,633
so she could read the small print on her phone.

267
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:18,833
But I got a firm grip on the thief's white sleeve

268
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,934
with this finger that's bleeding through the band-aid.

269
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,733
It must be on them.

270
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:28,833
On the sleeve of someone in this store!

271
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:33,633
But there wasn't any blood on anyone's sleeve.

272
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:37,134
Let me get a better look at the rest of your sleeve, too.

273
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,433
It seems a little damp.

274
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:44,633
Yeah. It got wet when I washed my hands in the bathroom.

275
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:47,933
Maybe you washed it off in the bathroom.

276
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:49,233
Don't be ridiculous!

277
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:52,433
You can't wash blood out with water!

278
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:55,233
Then show me your sleeve.

279
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:59,533
All right. My sleeve is wet, too.

280
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:04,233
Like him, it got wet when I washed my hands in the bathroom.

281
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:08,234
My sleeve's wet, but it's not from the bathroom.

282
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,233
It got wet in the rain.

283
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:12,833
It was coming down pretty hard until a minute ago.

284
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:15,933
I did go to the bathroom once, though.

285
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,933
Hey, Dad.

286
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:18,934
Huh?

287
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:24,033
Maybe the ticket you picked up belongs to that woman.

288
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:26,933
You idiot. There's no way.

289
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:30,333
It was stolen about an hour ago.

290
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:34,833
I was watching the races in my office around then.

291
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:39,933
But the TV broadcast of the races ended about 50 minutes ago.

292
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:44,933
Since you were out buying tickets, you only saw the last race.

293
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:49,933
An little over an hour ago, you would've been near the ticket booth.

294
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,033
I guess you could say that.

295
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:56,433
Maybe the thief was in a rush to redeem the ticket,

296
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:59,933
ran into you, and dropped it.

297
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:02,433
I guess you could say that.

298
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:06,133
And you picked it up and put it in your wallet.

299
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:08,133
Maybe you...

300
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:10,233
You can't be serious, idiots!

301
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:12,433
Come to think of it, Kogoro,

302
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:15,333
didn't you have a winning dark horse ticket?

303
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,733
Yikes!

304
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:17,933
What's with the reaction?

305
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:21,833
Oh, no. I mean to say, uh...

306
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,633
Blood! Yeah, blood!

307
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:24,933
Blood?

308
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:28,633
If you cut yourself deep enough that you bled through your band-aid,

309
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:33,633
then your blood must be on the ticket, too.

310
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:39,133
There wasn't any blood on the ticket in my wallet.

311
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:42,233
Of course there isn't.

312
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:47,433
I made sure to use my uninjured right hand when touching my ticket.

313
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,033
Of course.

314
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:52,733
Hey, Kogoro.

315
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:56,734
Why don't we make this a contest?

316
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,033
A contest?

317
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:04,433
Let's see which of us can find the thief first.

318
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:10,633
But there wasn't any blood on anyone's sleeve.

319
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:14,733
Doesn't that make this an unsolvable case?

320
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:16,333
Dad!

321
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:19,934
What's your problem? I was joking.

322
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,333
I don't have time for this.

323
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:25,933
I'll leave my money here.

324
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,433
I'm leaving.

325
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,533
Hey, you! You're running away?

326
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:34,233
What was that? I finished eating, so I'm leaving.

327
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:38,033
Is there some reason you have to leave?

328
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,033
Huh? Well, yeah.

329
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:44,833
There's a show on TV that I can't miss.

330
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,333
A TV show?

331
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:51,533
I'd understand wanting to watch a sporting event live,

332
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:54,833
but these days don't people record

333
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:58,233
TV shows they're that excited about?

334
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:02,633
It's hard to imagine a young man casually ordering

335
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:04,533
the special at a sushi restaurant

336
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:08,534
doesn't have a DVD or Blu-ray recorder.

337
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:12,534
Yeah, it's set to record.

338
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:17,433
Sheesh. Bring me some ginger, then.

339
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,233
I'll stay.

340
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:21,033
Right away, sir.

341
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:25,333
Excuse me, but I'd like to leave soon, too.

342
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:26,933
Why?

343
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:31,333
I'm meeting my wife's parents for a drink tonight.

344
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:34,633
They've been calling to tell me to hurry up.

345
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:37,734
They haven't stopped calling.

346
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:42,133
Honey, what are you doing?

347
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:48,033
I told you. I got involved in an incident at a sushi restaurant.

348
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:50,233
What kind of incident?

349
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:51,633
Hey!

350
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:54,233
I've taken your husband's phone.

351
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,233
What? Who are you?

352
00:19:56,234 --> 00:20:00,733
I'm Wakita, an employee at Beika Iroha Sushi.

353
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:04,533
A drunk tried to pick a fight with your husband.

354
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:08,733
He tripped, and his clothes got soaked in the rain.

355
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:12,733
We're drying his clothes at the restaurant right now.

356
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:15,833
Then could you tell him we'll be waiting for him

357
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,333
at Arsene at the Beika Center building?

358
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:22,334
Sure. We'll send him on his way as soon as his clothes are dry.

359
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:26,033
You should be good for a while.

360
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:28,033
I see.

361
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:31,233
But Arsene is a classy restaurant.

362
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:34,433
Why aren't you having dinner there?

363
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,633
My wife's parents are very strict.

364
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:40,833
I'm too nervous to eat around them,

365
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,933
so I thought I'd eat here.

366
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:45,833
Family can be complicated.

367
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:50,833
I don't mind playing along with this charade for a while.

368
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,833
But I'm leaving before 8pm.

369
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:56,433
There's a painting I want to buy in an online auction,

370
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:59,633
and it closes tonight at 10pm.

371
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:04,733
I'm the highest bid right now, but it's a popular painting.

372
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:07,033
If I'm not careful, someone else will outbid me.

373
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:10,433
Huh? Miss, you seem like a regular.

374
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,933
You don't live near here?

375
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:15,333
I live nearby. It's a 30-minute walk.

376
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:19,133
Then you could easily make it in time if you left by 9pm.

377
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:21,733
My computer's on the fritz,

378
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:24,133
so I use my phone to bid in auctions.

379
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:27,533
But it's running out of battery, so I need to charge it.

380
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:31,533
In that case, it can't be helped.

381
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:34,533
Oh, and could I get some more wasabi?

382
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,433
I got less than normal today.

383
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,633
And another highball.

384
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:43,633
In that case, I'd like some more grated radish.

385
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,333
I ran out.

386
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:48,234
And if possible, another oolong tea.

387
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:52,533
Then I'll take some more cola and ginger.

388
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:54,233
It's on the house, right?

389
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:56,234
Sure thing.

390
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:59,233
That's odd, though.

391
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:04,133
It's strange that the woman's blood wasn't on anyone's sleeve.

392
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:08,833
But why did the thief leave the stolen pouch in the bathroom?

393
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:12,433
A professional thief would've taken the money

394
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:16,834
and left the incriminating wallet in a nearby trash can.

395
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:21,134
So why did they bring it into Iroha Sushi?

396
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,133
"Next Episode"

397
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:47,833
Involved and erase?

398
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:52,933
The person who has either a million yen in cash

399
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:57,734
or the stolen dark horse ticket on them is the thief.

400
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:03,733
The thief's already a carp on a cutting board.

401
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:07,734
All that's left is for me to name them and for them to confess.

402
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:10,033
