1
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,059
It feels good.

2
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,659
Forest bathing is super.

3
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,059
That's right.

4
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,159
The air's so delicious too.

5
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,359
It's so healing.

6
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,859
I should've brought Dad along too.

7
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,359
Thank you for inviting us to come, Sera.

8
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,259
Not at all, I'm glad that you're here with me too.

9
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,259
But, it's not like you

10
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,259
to be interested in forest bathing, Sera.

11
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:59,959
Well, I came over because I was asked to do some work here.

12
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,359
Work? Don't tell me...

13
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,559
You mean your detective work?

14
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,359
Yes. The request actually came for my brother.

15
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,159
A friend of his during his high school days

16
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,159
asked him to solve a mystery at the rental villa

17
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,459
that we're headed for right now.

18
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:19,059
But, it seems he's busy, you see.

19
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:21,859
That's why he asked me, a woman high school detective,

20
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:25,059
to come here in his place.

21
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:27,659
You mean, your older brother is a detective too?

22
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,659
No, it seems that during his high school days

23
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,359
he used to solve mysteries just like that you see.

24
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,059
But, I thought your older brother passed away.

25
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,259
Yes. My oldest brother did.

26
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:47,559
The one who was asked to do the job was my second brother.

27
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:51,059
I have two older brothers, you see.

28
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,759
All three of us have different last names though.

29
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,459
Why are your last names different?

30
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,159
Because of things like Dad dying and such.

31
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,459
I have my mother's maiden name, Sera, you see.

32
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,759
My second brother's last name was also Sera

33
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,259
until he graduated from high school.

34
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,559
Then before your name changed to Sera...

35
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,959
I'll bet it was...

36
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,659
Akai. (Also means "red")

37
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,459
A red person.

38
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,359
There was a red person beyond the trees

39
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:21,259
just a while ago, wasn't there?

40
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,859
Yes.

41
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:26,259
A woman wearing a red raincoat and red boots.

42
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,759
She had long hair.

43
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,059
I thought I saw her right around there until a while ago.

44
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,159
A red woman.

45
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:38,559
Conan!

46
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,059
A swamp?

47
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:54,559
You'd better watch your step.

48
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:57,759
This forest seems to have quick sand swamps too.

49
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,159
-No joke. -No joke.

50
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,459
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

51
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,259
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

52
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,859
A rental villa with a bright red door.

53
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,259
The shadow of the red woman resurrects.

54
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,659
He sees through the one and only truth.

55
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,459
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

56
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,659
His name is Detective Conan.

57
00:05:05,232 --> 00:05:10,632
"The Tragedy of the Red Woman (Bath Steam)"

58
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:19,532
What a wonderful villa.

59
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:22,932
But, was is only the entrance door bright red?

60
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:26,832
True. It's sort of eerie.

61
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:31,732
Oh, are you're Sera's younger sister and her friends?

62
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,232
Yes, we are.

63
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:36,732
Thank you for coming all this way.

64
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:39,232
-"Tamami Minegishi (28)" -I'm Tamami Minegishi.

65
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:42,032
We're counting on you, okay!

66
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:46,732
Who of you are Sera's younger sister?

67
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,032
I'm his younger sister, Masumi,

68
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:53,532
and they're my classmates, Sonoko Suzuki and Ran Mouri.

69
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:56,232
-Hello. -How do you do?

70
00:05:56,232 --> 00:06:00,332
And, he's Conan Edogawa,

71
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,232
who's staying over at Ran's.

72
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:05,032
He's a detective who's much smarter than me.

73
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:09,332
Conan, you're little but super, aren't you?

74
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:13,032
Oh, well, not really.

75
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:15,832
And, about what we're asking you to do.

76
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:20,132
We've been taking pictures of the weird things that are happening

77
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:23,832
at this villa with a digital camera,

78
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:28,632
and Sumika said that she going to bring it after printing them out.

79
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:30,632
Oh, there she is.

80
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:34,432
Sumika, did you bring the pictures?

81
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,232
-"Sumika Kawana (28)" -These are the pictures I printed out.

82
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,232
We're counting on you.

83
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:43,332
Yes.

84
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:44,432
See you.

85
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:48,732
I'm sorry, don't let her bother you.

86
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:51,332
Sumika's not very friendly with people she meets for the first time.

87
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:53,432
She always that way, you see.

88
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:59,132
Oh! Sera's younger sister, the high school detective, right?

89
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,732
So, you really came?

90
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:03,232
Ninda and Hakuya?

91
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:04,832
Did you guys come together?

92
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,232
No.

93
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:09,332
-"Masaie Hakuya (28)" -We happened to run into each other in the forest.

94
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:10,732
So, we came together.

95
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:14,632
He said that he fell into the swamp.

96
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:17,332
I saw him just as he was changing clothes in the forest.

97
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:21,032
-"Jinsuke Ninda (29)" -He's a klutz as ever, isn't he?

98
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:23,132
Come on, cut that out.

99
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,032
But, how disappointing.

100
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:26,432
I was looking forward to seeing her

101
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:28,432
because he said she was a high school student,

102
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:31,332
but it seems like she brings her boyfriend along.

103
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:33,032
He told us that his younger sister

104
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:35,732
was coming with her girlfriends, you see.

105
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:39,332
I'm his younger sister, Masumi Sera!

106
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:41,332
You mean, you're a girl?

107
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:44,232
I was so sure that you were a boy.

108
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:45,932
Excuse me.

109
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:50,032
What's in that bag you're carrying on your back?

110
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,832
Oh, this?

111
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,032
It's a bat.

112
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:59,032
I bring it with me every year for self-protection.

113
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:02,232
It sure is a thin bat, though.

114
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,532
Can hit balls with that?

115
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:06,632
Like I said, it's for self-protection.

116
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:09,132
Self-protection?

117
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:10,732
Are there bears around here so something?

118
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:13,932
No, there are no bears here...

119
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:16,132
-Right? -Right.

120
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:40,732
It's delicious.

121
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:43,132
Really! It's super delicious.

122
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:46,832
Tamami! This hamburger is really delicious.

123
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:48,232
Right, Conan?

124
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:50,832
-Yes. -Thank you.

125
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:54,932
Tamami's hamburger's so good that she could run a store making it.

126
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:57,032
I wonder about that.

127
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:58,432
It's true.

128
00:08:58,432 --> 00:09:01,132
That you could make pretty good money with this hamburger.

129
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:03,432
Don't be silly.

130
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:12,732
Sera, you're good at using a knife and fork, aren't you?

131
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:15,232
I couldn't use them at all when I was child,

132
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:18,132
but after living abroad for three years, I got used to them.

133
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:21,132
Just as would be expected of someone who returned from the States!

134
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:25,032
Children are really fast learners.

135
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,532
You got sauce on your face, Conan.

136
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:31,932
By the way, what kind of gathering is this?

137
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:34,232
The outdoor club in our high school days.

138
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:38,332
We used to go mountain climbing and camping together.

139
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,732
But, since we were still just high school students,

140
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:44,332
the only time we got to do anything was during summer vacation.

141
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,732
Thank you!

142
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:48,632
But, really enjoyed the time we spent together!

143
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:53,332
The only members were five of us, classmates though.

144
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:54,932
If there is five of you...

145
00:09:54,932 --> 00:10:00,632
which means that the woman in red clothes is the other member?

146
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,832
Where did you see her?

147
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:18,032
In the forest, with Sonoko.

148
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,832
Is it true that she was wearing red clothes?

149
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:22,132
Yes.

150
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:25,032
She was wearing a red raincoat and red boots.

151
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:29,332
She was red from head to toe and had long hair.

152
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:31,632
Hey. Don't tell me.

153
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,932
That's a lie!

154
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,532
It can't be.

155
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:38,932
There's no way Satoko's alive.

156
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,632
Oh, well,

157
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:45,432
I thought it may be the killer 15 years ago.

158
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:48,732
About that...

159
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:53,232
Tell me more about it in detail.

160
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,032
You want to hear about it too, don't you, Conan?

161
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:57,632
What? I mean yes.

162
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:05,532
Well, it was 15 years ago.

163
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:11,332
There was a murder at a different rental villa near here.

164
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,532
The victim was some office worker.

165
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:19,832
He had secretly come to the villa with his cheating partner,

166
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:23,332
when his wife burst in on them with a knife.

167
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:27,232
By the time a police officer who heard of this incident got to the room,

168
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:31,432
the entire room was a sea of blood.

169
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:41,732
The white raincoat that she was wearing had turned bright red

170
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:46,232
because she had stabbed him over and over.

171
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,632
They called her...

172
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:54,232
The Red Woman.

173
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,347
-The Red Woman? -The Red Woman?

174
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:18,847
And was that woman arrested?

175
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,347
No.

176
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,947
She stabbed the police officer who came to the scene,

177
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:24,747
she vanished into the forest,

178
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:26,847
and is still on the run.

179
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,347
And, three years later.

180
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:36,347
When we came to this rental villa during summer vacation,

181
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:41,247
another member of our club, Satoko, said that she saw a red woman,

182
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:46,247
so we all went to the forest to look for her, but...

183
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:50,147
while searching, Satoko seems to have gone astray.

184
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:52,347
So since it started to get dark we called the police

185
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:54,847
and had them search for her too, but...

186
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:58,147
She was found a week later.

187
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,247
Satoko's corpse was found sunk in the quicksand swamp

188
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:06,847
covered all over with mud.

189
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:09,947
Satoko's shoes were found near the swamp

190
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:12,647
and that's what lead to the discovery of corpse.

191
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:17,547
The knife that was used in the murder case was also found on the ground.

192
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,547
And so we all thought

193
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:22,647
that maybe Satoko...

194
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:36,447
Was chased around by the red woman in the forest

195
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:39,747
and ended up falling into the quicksand.

196
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:07,047
You want Sera to catch the red woman?

197
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,347
What? Oh, no.

198
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:13,147
That's work for the police, isn't it?

199
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:17,747
Even after graduating, we've decided to gather here every year

200
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:21,447
on the day that Satoko's corpse was found.

201
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:23,147
But, from about the year before last,

202
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:25,647
weird things have been happening.

203
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:30,047
Like windows cracking

204
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:33,547
and a lot of apples found scattered around the room.

205
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:40,647
When we couldn't get any hot water,

206
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,847
we found red rose petals stuffed inside the hot water heater.

207
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:53,947
There were times when the front door was splattered with red paint too.

208
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:57,147
And this time, a red woman.

209
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:00,847
It seems that the owner of the villa

210
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:05,847
decided to paint the front door all red after that incident.

211
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,947
That's why the front door is red.

212
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:12,047
Well, I think that most probably all the weird occurrences

213
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:18,547
including the red woman you saw in the forest are all pranks.

214
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:23,047
And, well, we wanted to figure out who the culprit was,

215
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,847
so we decided to ask Sera who's clever to do the job.

216
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:31,147
I see. I got the rough picture.

217
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:35,547
So, you want me to solve the mystery involving the red woman.

218
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:38,547
No. We can leave the red woman to the police.

219
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:39,847
Okay!

220
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:44,747
I'll go check around the forest on more.

221
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:45,947
Me too.

222
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,347
Wait, Conan!

223
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,947
You can't just go off on your own!

224
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:59,347
I'll go shopping at a store about a kilometre from here.

225
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:02,047
We need a lot of things like drinks and foodstuffs, right?

226
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,947
Yes, thanks.

227
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:06,847
Okay, I'll clean the dishes and all.

228
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:10,547
Shall we help you shopping?

229
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:12,847
Oh, no. It's fine...

230
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,747
Because shopping and carrying things are my job.

231
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:26,347
What's the matter, Hakuya?

232
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:28,847
You look pale.

233
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:33,247
It's nothing. It's really nothing.

234
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:38,247
Well... I guess I'll go clean the bath tub and bathroom.

235
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,147
Thanks, Hakuya.

236
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:48,047
I guess I'll go clean the rooms then,

237
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:50,147
but will two help me out too?

238
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:52,547
Sure.

239
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,347
You know...

240
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,947
After taking a good look around this place, it's really dusty.

241
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:01,747
We should've cleaned the place a bit before eating lunch.

242
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:04,647
Even so, don't you think it's a bit too filthy?

243
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:08,947
Well, if such a case as we just heard about had happened nearby,

244
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:11,647
maybe not too many people want to rent the place already.

245
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,147
The sound of the vacuum cleaner's really loud.

246
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:20,447
It's probably the big type that has great suction.

247
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:23,447
Yes, the one that you see a lot on TV shopping and stuff.

248
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:24,447
Right...

249
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:28,647
What do you two want for dinner?

250
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,547
I thought I'd start making preparations.

251
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:34,347
Anything that tastes good

252
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:35,847
Okay, I got it!

253
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,947
Shall we help with the preparations?

254
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:39,147
No, thanks...

255
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:41,747
I can handle it alone.

256
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,747
Did you two finish cleaning the living room?

257
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:45,847
Yes.

258
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,747
Then, please help me with the other rooms too, will you?

259
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,847
-Yes, of course! -Yes, of course!

260
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,447
Hakuya filled the bath tub up.

261
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,747
He's pretty thoughtful.

262
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,847
Hakuya's not here.

263
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:09,847
I wonder if he cleaning the bathroom then?

264
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,447
How's the water temperature?

265
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:17,047
It seems to be just right.

266
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:19,347
The colour of the water is green.

267
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,247
It's green bath salt.

268
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,347
Hakuya's hooked on it now.

269
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:25,447
My mother uses it too!

270
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:27,747
It promotes perspiration, doesn't it?

271
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:30,647
I hear it's good for the skin too.

272
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:34,547
Then, shall we finish up cleaning and be the first to take a bath?

273
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,347
The bath tub here's quite large too, see?

274
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:38,647
Sounds good!

275
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,247
Let's, let's!

276
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:43,147
I'm back.

277
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,947
Welcome back.

278
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:47,147
Oh, you're together?

279
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:51,247
Well... I coincidentally ran into them on my way back here,

280
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,747
and had them help me carry stuff.

281
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:58,947
I looked here and there in the forest

282
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:01,347
but couldn't come up with anything.

283
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:02,947
I see.

284
00:19:02,947 --> 00:19:07,147
Well... I guess we'll close the case for today then.

285
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,547
I got ready my very best recipe for tonight's dinner, you see.

286
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:14,047
That sounds great.

287
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,147
Where are Ran and the others?

288
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,447
They said since they finished cleaning,

289
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:20,147
they're going to take a bath.

290
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:23,147
So she taking a bath now with Sumika and Sonoko.

291
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:26,047
Hey, what's this?

292
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:27,147
It's revolting.

293
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,347
Is this someone's prank too?

294
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,147
What's the matter?

295
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,247
Hey! What's up?

296
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,047
Are you guys okay?

297
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:45,247
Red.

298
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,147
Red?

299
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:58,047
Red...

300
00:19:58,047 --> 00:19:59,547
Woman.

301
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,347
The bath tub is filled with tomatoes.

302
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,847
Red tomatoes.

303
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:19,447
This is also a prank.

304
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:21,147
Where's Hakuya?

305
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:23,347
What? Now that you mentioned it,

306
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,747
I haven't seen him since after lunch.

307
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:28,547
Nindo, is Hakuya around?

308
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:31,247
Oh, no, he's not.

309
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:33,047
I wonder where he went.

310
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:36,047
He was supposed to go clean the bath tub and bathroom, right?

311
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:39,747
Yes. He was supposed to.

312
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:41,547
-Don't tell me... -Don't tell me...

313
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:39,947
He's Hakuya, isn't he?

314
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:41,347
Yes.

315
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:49,747
Darn it.

316
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:09,147
I see.

317
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:11,347
This is a bath tub.

318
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:18,047
Is Hakuya dead?

319
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:21,147
Yes, it seems that way.

320
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:46,347
Then, who on earth?

321
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:48,447
Who else?

322
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:50,647
The one who killed Hakuya.

323
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:51,847
The Red Woman.

324
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,147
Who else could it be but her?

325
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:58,547
The Red Woman.

326
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:01,347
There're no such things.

327
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:03,447
Evil spirits or goblins.

328
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:05,847
Witches or wizards.

329
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:08,847
They all belong to the world of fantasy.

330
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,347
