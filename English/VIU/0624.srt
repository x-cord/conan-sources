1
00:00:02,164 --> 00:00:05,164
A project to protect children from crime?

2
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:07,264
Yes. Because recently

3
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:10,864
cases of children being kidnapped in the city are on the rise.

4
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:11,864
But...

5
00:00:11,864 --> 00:00:13,864
Why would you, Inspector Shiratori of the Metropolitan Police Department

6
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:15,264
come all this way?

7
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:16,464
Well...

8
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,264
I just happened to be in the neighbourhood investigating a case,

9
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:20,564
so I thought while I was at it, I may as well...

10
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:23,964
You suddenly had this urge to want to see Ms. Kobayashi too, didn't you?

11
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:25,464
Officer Chiba...

12
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:29,164
I just met him this morning when I handed him his lunch.

13
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:31,864
By the way, why'd you come with me?

14
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:33,364
Why not?

15
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:35,164
I'm a graduate of this school.

16
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:38,364
What? I'm also a graduate of this school,

17
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:39,764
but what year class were you?

18
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:43,164
I think I was here in the 20th year...

19
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:46,764
Then, you're two years younger than me.

20
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:48,564
Then, do you remember?

21
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:51,264
The cooking teacher, Skeleton Kunigami.

22
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:55,364
Yes. He's still here and the children fear him

23
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:57,064
calling him "Death" Teacher.

24
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:01,864
Come on. Shall we head back then?

25
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:03,164
But...

26
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,964
It's been a long time since I came here,

27
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:08,064
so would it be okay for me to take a walk

28
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:09,264
around the school building?

29
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:12,764
The moment you decide what you want to do in life,

30
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,964
you must be true to yourself.

31
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:16,564
An elementary school classmate.

32
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:18,964
Where will Officer Chiba's first love go?

33
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:20,664
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,564
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:24,664
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

36
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:10,073
"Video Letter of First Love"

37
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:11,373
"Year 1, Class B"

38
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:12,473
What?

39
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:14,673
Look for a crime prevention video?

40
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:15,773
Yes.

41
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:19,273
During lunch time the police brought me this leaflet.

42
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:20,973
So for tomorrow's ethics class,

43
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:22,873
I'm planning to show a crime prevention video

44
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:24,373
in the audio visual room.

45
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:27,373
But, why do we have to look for that video?

46
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,573
If you know that it's in the warehouse of the audio room

47
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,473
why not go look for it yourself?

48
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:32,673
Well, you see...

49
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:35,873
I have a teacher's meeting I have to go to right now.

50
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:37,073
Come to think of it,

51
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,373
we never saw the video of our chorus contest

52
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:41,673
before either, did we?

53
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,573
In other words,

54
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,673
you're not good at looking for things.

55
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:48,073
Exactly.

56
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:52,873
Because the number of video tapes in the warehouse is countless.

57
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,573
The words on the labels are practically faded too.

58
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:58,673
Many of the labels have been stuck on one on top of the other,

59
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,573
so it's hard to tell which is which.

60
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,973
So, she wants you,

61
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:07,273
who are good at looking for things find it for her, right?

62
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,473
I guess so.

63
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:12,073
"Audio Visual Room"

64
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:14,973
Talk about a lot...

65
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:18,673
Just like teacher said the words are almost faded

66
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:21,573
and there are labels pasted one on top of the other.

67
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:24,273
They're not organized by year,

68
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,273
so it's going to be really tough looking for it.

69
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:28,273
Let's forget about it, already.

70
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:31,873
We, The Youth Detective Squad members are cautious,

71
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:34,973
so we'll be fine not watching a crime prevention video.

72
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:37,473
It's not bad to be on your guard.

73
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:39,673
No matter how careful you try to be,

74
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:41,573
a guy that you don't know at all

75
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,473
who is after your life may secretly

76
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:46,473
be sitting right next to you.

77
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:49,073
Are you talking about Subaru or what?

78
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:50,173
If you don't like him so much,

79
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:52,973
maybe you should sleep over at the detective agency?

80
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,673
No way.

81
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:58,373
But, how are we going to look for the video?

82
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:01,573
If we play all the videos and check the contents,

83
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:03,973
I guess we'll eventually find it...

84
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:06,373
What? You mean everything here?

85
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,273
We don't have to do that.

86
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,473
Since teacher asked us to do it,

87
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:13,973
it means that she came to check it once,

88
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:16,073
but couldn't find it.

89
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:18,373
Although the words on the label are almost faded,

90
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:19,973
they are still legible.

91
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:22,373
It's also unthinkable that anyone would stick another label

92
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,073
onto the label of a video that is considered

93
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,173
important enough to one day use in class.

94
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,473
Then, why can't it be found?

95
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:30,773
In other words, that video is not a VHS type

96
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:33,373
that is lined out on the shelf

97
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:36,373
but one that is put away somewhere.

98
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:39,973
That is, it is most probably a BETA video tape.

99
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:44,573
See, found it. A crime prevention video.

100
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:47,573
The school chorus contest video is also here.

101
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:48,873
I see.

102
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:51,473
Ms. Kobayashi's homeroom teacher

103
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:53,773
used to use BETA videos.

104
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,873
What's this BETA thing about?

105
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:59,373
I heard that in the past there were VHS and BETA video tapes,

106
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:02,873
but BETA lost and disappeared from the market.

107
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:05,473
But, why did BETA lose?

108
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:06,573
Beats me...

109
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,173
maybe it wasn't as good performance wise?

110
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,373
-Not really. -What?

111
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:14,573
Back then BETA had better image as well as sound than VHS.

112
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,573
The size of the cassette was also smaller

113
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:19,173
and was really popular among the video freaks.

114
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:20,573
Officer Chiba?

115
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:24,173
Well, but the recording time was shorter than VHS,

116
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:26,873
so it lost in sales strategy I guess you could say.

117
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:29,673
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,873
I brought along a crime prevention project leaflet

119
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,173
and while I was at it

120
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:35,773
I thought that I'd browse around the school building.

121
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:39,773
I felt nostalgic because I'm a graduate of this school.

122
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:42,773
But, that doesn't explain why you were hiding here

123
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,573
in the audio visual room, does it?

124
00:06:44,573 --> 00:06:47,673
Well, actually...

125
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,873
What?

126
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:50,773
You were looking for the answer

127
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:53,073
to a love letter you wrote 13 years ago?

128
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:54,173
Really?

129
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:57,373
Yeah. I was in the broadcast club.

130
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,773
One day, we broadcast a mini drama

131
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:01,373
that we recorded during lunch recess,

132
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,073
and it really caught on.

133
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:05,273
So, I suggested whether it's turned down or not,

134
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:08,573
next time we should record an actual take of a drama

135
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:11,073
and play it at the school drama club.

136
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:13,473
Then a girl classmate of the broadcast club was all for it

137
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:16,073
and all the other members also started to agree with her.

138
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:21,373
As a result, the special SFX drama was somehow completed.

139
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:24,473
So, I took it that she was also a SFX fan

140
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,473
and talked a lot about the subject with her,

141
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:28,573
but she didn't seem interested at all.

142
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,473
I asked her, "Do you really like SFX?"

143
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:36,473
What I like is not SFX but...

144
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:41,473
Don't make me say it, stupid.

145
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:44,473
She answered with blushed cheeks.

146
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:47,673
So, the next day, I impulsively wrote her a love letter.

147
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:50,373
But, maybe I just mistakenly thought so after all?

148
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,573
No, I think she really had feelings for you.

149
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,273
That's right.

150
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,873
She also liked you, Officer Chiba.

151
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:58,873
Really?

152
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:01,973
And? Why is the answer to that love letter

153
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:04,773
in the warehouse of this audio room?

154
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:07,873
Did you lose the answer for the love letter you received from her in here?

155
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:09,873
No...

156
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:13,673
She did send me her answer in the mail soon afterwards,

157
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:15,373
so I have it with me even now.

158
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:17,573
You mean she didn't give it directly to you?

159
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,473
She had to change schools all of a sudden,

160
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:21,673
and I gave her my love letter

161
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,573
on the day of her farewell party, that's why...

162
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:26,573
She sent you the answer from the place she moved to.

163
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,873
But, wasn't her answer written in that letter?

164
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:33,173
I thought so too

165
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,573
and my heart was pounding while I was reading it, but...

166
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:36,773
In the letter it said that

167
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:39,873
"It would be easy to write how I feel in this letter,

168
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:42,273
but it may not really hit you so...

169
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:46,573
I will save it once in the warehouse of the audio visual room.

170
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:52,473
So that my feelings are carved onto your heart," she wrote.

171
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:53,973
I see.

172
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:57,773
She hid that video somewhere in this warehouse

173
00:08:57,773 --> 00:08:59,973
where only you would probably look, right?

174
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:00,973
Yeah.

175
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,173
After reading her letter I came here right away

176
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,973
and looked in every nook and cranny

177
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:07,873
but didn't find anything that looked like a letter.

178
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:10,573
Have you seen her since then?

179
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:13,273
I haven't seen her even once in 13 years.

180
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:16,273
She didn't come to the class reunion either.

181
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:19,773
Then, why are you looking for something like that now?

182
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:22,473
I got a call from her saying,

183
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:26,373
"I'm going to the class reunion next week but are you coming?"

184
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:29,173
I answered that I'm planning to go, then she asked me...

185
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:32,373
"Since it was so long ago, you may not remember,

186
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:35,773
but did you see the video with my answer?"

187
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,073
Video?

188
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:39,573
And? What did you answer?

189
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:41,973
I answered that I didn't see it.

190
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:45,873
Then, she mumbled, "Oh..." and hung up.

191
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:48,073
Officer Chiba, how cruel of you.

192
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:49,773
I couldn't help it, could I?

193
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:51,373
Because I really didn't see it.

194
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,073
But, please wait.

195
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:56,073
If she said video...

196
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,673
She may have made a video letter

197
00:09:57,673 --> 00:10:02,173
and dubbed it onto one of the videos and left it for you?

198
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:05,973
Yeah, I thought so too, so I came here.

199
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,173
I didn't check the contents of the video back then either.

200
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:12,773
And? Did you find it, that video letter?

201
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:16,173
No. I tried looking through the videos that look to be it.

202
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:18,173
I would pick up by fast forwarding it but...

203
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:20,673
There're so many of them.

204
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:24,173
And you all happened to walk in while I was doing this.

205
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:26,373
Then, let's look for it together.

206
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:30,573
But, it's a tough job going through all those videos.

207
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:33,773
There's no need to look through them from beginning to end.

208
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:36,373
If I were to make such a video letter,

209
00:10:36,373 --> 00:10:39,873
I would put it at the end of an originally recorded film,

210
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,973
so it would be hard to find.

211
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:46,573
I see! All we have to do is check the end of the video tapes.

212
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,373
This is really exhausting.

213
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:58,373
Not this one either.

214
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,573
How many more are there?

215
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:01,873
That's the last one.

216
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:03,173
What?

217
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:07,173
We didn't see the SFX drama that you made, did we?

218
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:11,273
Mr. Kunigami took that video away from me.

219
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:13,073
No way.

220
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:17,373
Come to think of it, the advisor for the broadcast club was Mr. Kunigami.

221
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:22,073
But, that's not a problem.

222
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:25,773
But that SFX drama is carved deeply

223
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:29,473
in my head as my memory with her.

224
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:30,773
You see!

225
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,273
Well, I've been thinking about it but...

226
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:36,973
Why were you opening the lid of the video tapes?

227
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,573
This is a habit of mine.

228
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:43,473
My older brother used to part-time at a rental video shop

229
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:46,573
and was told to check if the tape

230
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:50,773
was rewound to the beginning by opening here.

231
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:53,073
This became a habit of his

232
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:54,973
and he used to open the lid of the video tapes at home

233
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:56,373
after watching them too.

234
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:58,773
I thought it looked awesome, so I copied him,

235
00:11:58,773 --> 00:12:02,073
and before I knew it that became a habit of mine too.

236
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:04,473
Since when did acquire that habit?

237
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,373
From when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade of elementary school, I think?

238
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,673
When did you take that SFX drama?

239
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:11,873
Summer of 6th grade.

240
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:15,173
After that she suddenly moved away.

241
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:20,973
Ai, get me a writing brush and water in a cup!

242
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,873
You guys pull out videos with labels

243
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,273
that are stuck one on top of the other.

244
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:26,573
What?

245
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:31,073
Mr. Kunigami was known from before for being mean and stingy from before.

246
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,673
So, I'm sure that he taped over the tapes

247
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:35,973
that he confiscated right away and erased the original.

248
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:39,873
Known from before? How do you know?

249
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:42,173
You're only in 1st grade.

250
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:44,873
Well, never mind that.

251
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:53,273
There are quite a lot, aren't they?

252
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,573
Are you going to check the contents of these again?

253
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,073
No.

254
00:12:57,073 --> 00:13:01,073
If you run the writing brush dampened with water like this.

255
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,973
The words of the label that is pasted below emerges.

256
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:09,573
Bull's eye. This is the video you made, Officer Chiba.

257
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:11,873
But Masked Baiya?

258
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,173
This is just a copy of Masked Yaiba.

259
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,673
But, the video letter is in here, right?

260
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:21,573
No, if that girl knew of Officer Chiba's

261
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,573
habit of opening the video tape,

262
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:26,073
I'm sure that the message will be exposed

263
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,573
when he opens here...

264
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:32,473
Nothing's written?

265
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,073
No joke?

266
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:37,921
What's up, Conan? Nothing's written.

267
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,721
Strange.

268
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:43,321
I was almost really sure that the message would be written here.

269
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:46,821
I'm sure that the video letter is in this tape.

270
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:50,321
Yes. Let's try and play it.

271
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:55,621
There was nothing in it.

272
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:59,521
Maybe it was erased when something was taped over it.

273
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,421
I don't think so.

274
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:04,621
A little bit of the scene of the drama was left

275
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:06,221
even after the tape over,

276
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,221
nothing seemed to be inside after it.

277
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:12,321
Come to think of it, she appeared a little bit

278
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:14,721
during the final scene of the drama.

279
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:21,121
See, it's this girl!

280
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,721
Thank you, Masked Baiya!

281
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:26,721
Cute!

282
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:29,521
She is, isn't she? Her name was Naeko Miike

283
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:32,121
and she was really popular among the boys in class.

284
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,321
But...

285
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,321
Nothing...

286
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:36,821
To think that a girl who looks like an idol like this

287
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:39,121
would fall in love you, Officer Chiba.

288
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,221
Hey, hey...

289
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:42,421
Did she really like you?

290
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:44,021
Do you have any recollection

291
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:46,321
of having done something to make her like you?

292
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:50,221
The thing is, I have no such recollection.

293
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:53,221
I did make her cry just once though.

294
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:54,421
Were you mean to her?

295
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:55,621
How dare you!

296
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:58,021
No, I wasn't mean or anything,

297
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:59,621
she just suddenly started crying.

298
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:01,221
If I remember correctly,

299
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:02,621
we went home a bit late

300
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:05,121
because of things that we had to do at the broadcast club.

301
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,021
When we got to the crosswalk, she suddenly started to cry.

302
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:13,421
You dumb-dumb! I hate you!

303
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:16,121
After saying so, she ran home.

304
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:19,521
It seems that she wanted to go home early that day.

305
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,221
Then maybe she wanted you to stop her with force.

306
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,421
And, kiss her or something?

307
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:24,521
What?

308
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:27,221
I would never do anything like that.

309
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:30,021
If so, you must've said something to her.

310
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,821
Don't you remember what you said back then?

311
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:36,121
Back then...

312
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:39,521
I chased her and fell

313
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,121
and deeply cut the palm of my hand.

314
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:46,921
I see. And she treated your wound for you.

315
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:48,121
No.

316
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:51,021
She ran off not knowing that I fell.

317
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:52,321
Is that so?

318
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:53,821
But...

319
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:55,621
the cut that I got back then

320
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,721
is still left like a carving here on the palm of my hand.

321
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,921
Carved?

322
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:03,221
Come to think of it, he mentioned that

323
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,821
it was also written in her letter.

324
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:10,321
"So that my feelings are carved onto your heart,"

325
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:12,121
Directly carve on means...

326
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,921
Somewhere on the body.

327
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,721
I see... That's what it was!

328
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,921
Conan, did you figure out?

329
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,521
You figured it out, didn't you?

330
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,321
Yeah, I figured out that...

331
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,921
Officer Chiba used to...

332
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:33,321
sweat a lot since he was a child!

333
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:34,321
What?

334
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:37,221
It's true that I sweat a lot.

335
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,821
Although I wasn't as bad Genta,

336
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:41,121
I was pretty hefty.

337
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:44,021
What's that got to do with anything?

338
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:45,921
When you open this lid,

339
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,521
you place your hand on this side video, right?

340
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:53,421
That's where she wrote the message with a water-based pen.

341
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:54,721
She did so, because that way,

342
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:57,521
the words would rub off

343
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:59,321
on the sweaty hands of Officer Chiba.

344
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,121
Moreover, she wrote it in mirrored words

345
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,021
that you would be able to read it too.

346
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:06,021
See. On my hands that I used to open the lid,

347
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,021
there's red ink, isn't there? That's the proof.

348
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:10,421
I see.

349
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:13,221
Even if you write on the black side of the tape with red ink,

350
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,521
it would not be visible.

351
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,321
On top of that, it's written in a place that no one else would touch,

352
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,921
so she didn't have to worry about anybody else seeing it too.

353
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:22,421
But, it's already been 13 years, so I wonder if it's still legible?

354
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:25,921
Don't worry. You rip the paper up like this

355
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,021
and wet it with water.

356
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:30,921
You paste it on like so on the side of the video,

357
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:32,821
then peel it off.

358
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:36,621
The message put here 13 years ago is revived.

359
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,721
"I like you too"

360
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,921
I like you too, is written here!

361
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,721
You both liked each other!

362
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,221
Amazing!

363
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,721
When's the reunion that she's coming to?

364
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,921
Tonight.

365
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,321
Then, maybe you should go?

366
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:58,821
But, I wonder about telling her at this point that I got her message.

367
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:01,621
No! You should go!

368
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:05,421
Her feelings finally reached you after 13 years, you know?

369
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:07,921
Of course she'd be happy.

370
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,921
Ms. Kobayashi?

371
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:13,221
I'm sorry. I overheard you.

372
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:22,121
What I like is not SFX but...

373
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:25,221
Don't make me say it, stupid!

374
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:29,921
What? Ms. Miike's not here?

375
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:32,421
No, she says she came up with an urgent matter.

376
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:35,921
She seemed really happy saying that she finally got together

377
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:38,221
with the one she really cared for after hoping for so long.

378
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,921
She got together?

379
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:42,921
I wonder. Maybe she got married or something?

380
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,521
What should I tell the children?

381
00:18:57,321 --> 00:19:00,121
No way, a parking violation.

382
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,421
I was planning to come back

383
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:03,221
and re-park the car as soon as I saw her.

384
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:05,921
But, I was plodding along from shock.

385
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:07,821
Excuse me...

386
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:11,721
Don't worry about it, I haven't sent the data yet.

387
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,621
You left the engine on so you

388
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,721
were planning to come back right away, weren't you?

389
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,021
Yes...

390
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,621
Besides, being a police detective

391
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:21,021
there are times you may have to inevitably park, so...

392
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,521
No.

393
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,021
No matter if you're an officer or not,

394
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:25,621
a parking violation is a violation.

395
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,521
You've got to do your job.

396
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:33,121
Well, it's not like I came for an investigation or anything besides.

397
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,821
Then, I'll go pay for the violation

398
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:38,321
so will you give me the violation ticket?

399
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:39,621
Yes, sir.

400
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,121
I tried to act cool,

401
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:49,721
but the charge for violation 15,000 yen sure isn't cheap.

402
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,921
But, I wonder how she knew I was a police detective?

403
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,221
What's the matter?

404
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:56,621
Did that guy who got the parking violation

405
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:58,321
give you trouble or something?

406
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,021
No...

407
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,121
By the way, is it really okay?

408
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:03,921
Not attending the reunion?

409
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:05,021
Yes.

410
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:08,121
I haven't gone to the reunion for some time now,

411
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:11,421
so I think I'd feel uncomfortable even if I went anyway.

412
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:12,621
And...

413
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:16,421
I got to see the person that I really wanted see too.

414
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:21,821
Well, it seems that he had forgotten all about me though.

415
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,621
Are you talking about...

416
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,021
the childhood friend of yours that is a police detective

417
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,521
at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department?

418
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,621
Yes.

419
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:29,921
I'm going to be transferred to the

420
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,421
headquarters of the Police Department soon,

421
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:34,621
so I'll be able to work with him.

422
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:37,421
I was planning to tell him how I felt at that time,

423
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:39,521
if I met him and he remembered me but...

424
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,121
I guess life just doesn't work out that way.

425
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:45,621
Gosh, to forget a great lady like you.

426
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:49,121
He's probably not worth anything, forget him.

427
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:51,521
It's not that he's not worth it.

428
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,321
He's as cute and childish looking as ever.

429
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,821
Besides...

430
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:59,521
I was the youngest child in the family

431
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:02,321
and was really pampered by my parents and was never scolded.

432
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:04,821
But, back then he...

433
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,921
I'll go home ahead of you.

434
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:09,121
Because I have a TV program I want to watch.

435
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:10,921
Don't cross now.

436
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:14,121
The traffic light's red.

437
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:19,821
Who cares? There are no cars and nobody's watching.

438
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:24,221
I'm watching. And you're watching too.

439
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,821
If you pamper yourself and break a rule,

440
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:28,821
it can turn out to be a habit.

441
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,321
A habit is something you can't break

442
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,821
even if you want to, you know?

443
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:34,321
You mean you don't even know something like that?

444
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:47,521
Really... he hasn't changed a bit, Mr. Chiba.

445
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,821
What?

446
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,121
You were brushed off?

447
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:14,521
Yeah. Well, I guess so.

448
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,721
No joke.

449
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:18,521
I guess she was too high on the pedestal after all.

450
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:21,121
-Hey... -What're you doing?

451
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:23,321
We'll resume investigations.

452
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:25,021
Yes, sir.

453
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:27,121
This is a secret, all right?

454
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:28,621
Okay...

455
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:31,621
That's good to hear.

456
00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:33,221
I'm going to tell Miwako about it.

457
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,521
About that...

458
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:36,821
If he was brushed off,

459
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:38,721
that means he's not taken anymore, right?

460
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:41,121
Yes... well, sort of...

461
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:44,521
What's your name?

462
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,921
I'm Naeko Miike,

463
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:49,321
who was transferred from the Haido Station.

464
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:50,621
Nice to meet you.

465
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:56,221
Go inside this haunted mansion

466
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:58,921
and check out how well the zombies are made?

467
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:02,521
Ran, you can't tell Shinichi that you like him,

468
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:03,721
the way you are.

469
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,421
I'll take Anna to the hospital...

470
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:14,121
Don't touch her!

471
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,821
She could've drunk potassium cyanide poison!

472
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,621
Poison?

473
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:24,021
