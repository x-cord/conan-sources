00:00:01,703 --> 00:00:05,502
"I saw the Oninohamura Village website.

2
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:09,302
An article on there says a moon's droppings

3
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:12,802
was found at the Oninohamura Village Museum excavation site.

4
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:14,402
Based on my research,

5
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:16,502
the fossil was found in a layer of earth

6
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:19,802
130 million years old.

7
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:24,002
There's no precedent of the moon's droppings

8
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,602
being discovered on earth from that era.

9
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:31,102
I was hoping I could visit you and have an in-depth conversation."

10
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:34,302
Wait, she totally doubts us!

11
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:35,702
Yeah.

12
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,402
So, what are we going to do?

13
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:38,502
At this rate,

14
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:42,502
someone might discover we lied about the fossil's origins.

15
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:44,502
There you go again.

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,402
You can handle a reporter or two.

17
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:50,502
Right, Mr. Politician?

18
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:53,502
Don't be ridiculous! I'm not that influential!

19
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:54,802
I'm just a town mayor.

20
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:56,502
What? Are you kidding me?

21
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:58,803
Why do you think I'm working with you?

22
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:02,103
It's so you can do something about this!

23
00:01:04,403 --> 00:01:07,203
Just solve it with money, then.

24
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:10,802
You may not be influential, but you've got money.

25
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:12,302
But...

26
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:14,302
You'll pay, won't you?

27
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:18,403
After all, your political career depends on it.

28
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:27,703
Useless.

29
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:43,002
In my eyes are maximum creation.

A suspicious duo has a suspicious conversation.

A rare fossil leads to a case.

33

He sees through the one and only truth.

I had no idea ammonites were so pretty.

39
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:04,334
I thought fossils looked more like rocks.

40
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:07,634
Well, your typical fossil is much more plain-looking.

41
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:10,834
Then why's this one so sparkly?

42
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,634
Because it's made differently.

43
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:16,434
Typically fossils are made when the matter

44
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:18,834
that comprises bones and shells is replaced with minerals.

45
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:21,434
That sparkly one is sparkly

46
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:25,235
because it was replaced with a gemstone like an opal.

47
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,935
You kids sure are knowledgeable.

48
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:33,634
You've got a lot of rare fossils.

49
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:35,034
You've got a keen eye.

I see. From overseas?

00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:44,734
It's just my hobby.

Yeah. Just looking at beautiful fossils makes me happy.

Oh, you've arrived. I'll be right there.

Please wait inside.

71
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:41,935
All right.

72
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:45,835
Ogami.

73
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:48,934
Like you said,

74
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,134
I've decided to settle the matter with money.

75
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:52,434
Good.

76
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,134
I knew I could count on you, Mr. Mayor.

77
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:57,635
So you don't need to worry about anything.

78
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:02,635
Seriously.

79
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:09,134
A journalist? Did you come to write a story about us?

80
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,434
Of course not.

81
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:14,534
They must've found some kind of rare fossil.

82
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:18,535
Come to think of it, I saw a story about that on the village's website.

83
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:20,034
That's right.

84
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:22,834
I came here because I saw the same story.

85
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,234
"Moon's Droppings found at Oninohamura Village" -See?

86
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:26,834
"Gunma Prefecture!" -It says they found a moon's droppings.

87
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,434
What's a moon's droppings?

88
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:31,934
It's when the inside of a conch shell becomes a jewel.

89
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,134
Does that make sense?

90
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:36,634
It's a very valuable type of fossil.

91
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:39,634
And they found that at the excavation site here?

92
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:41,334
That's right.

93
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,335
Look.

94
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:44,834
It looks like a turd!

95
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:48,034
That's right. Droppings mean poop.

96
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:50,934
What?

97
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:53,634
Maybe ancient people thought the rabbit in the moon

98
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:56,434
had pooped on them.

99
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:58,835
But I don't see it on display anywhere.

100
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:02,434
We're thinking of making it the village's symbol.

101
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,635
It's on display at the town hall.

102
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:08,034
Their symbol is poop.

103
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:10,334
Genta, that's rude.

104
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,835
I hope it doesn't become a negative symbol.

105
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:19,034
Everyone, we're ready to begin the tour.

106
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:21,135
Go ahead.

107
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:30,234
Mr. Ogami, could I take a look at the site

108
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:32,334
where the moon's droppings were found later?

109
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:34,334
Yes, of course.

110
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:37,235
There's actually something I'd like to tell you.

111
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:39,135
Very well.

112
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:50,934
All right! Let's find an ammonite!

113
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:53,534
Genta, you're not going to find an ammonite.

114
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,334
What? Why not?

115
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:58,634
We could make a major discovery.

116
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:01,534
Different types of fossils are found in different layers of earth.

117
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,134
All you'll find here

118
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:06,634
are clam or oyster fossils.

119
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:08,234
Clams?

120
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:11,334
I had some in my miso soup this morning.

121
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:14,534
But apparently, they've found ornithomimid dinosaur bones

122
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,134
and footprints before.

123
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,135
Seriously?

124
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:20,334
I wanna find a dinosaur.

125
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,335
Let's do our best.

126
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:22,835
-Yeah! -Yeah!

127
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:42,434
I don't see any fossils in there.

128
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:45,234
They're quite difficult to find...

129
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,235
Maybe there aren't any here.

130
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:50,634
I didn't find any again.

131
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:52,735
Genta, what if you hit someone?

132
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:55,035
Sorry.

133
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,834
This is a fossil.

134
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:59,034
What?

135
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:03,034
Look here. The color's darker.

136
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:05,634
This is a clam fossil.

137
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:06,635
It's tiny.

138
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,035
It's so plain.

139
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:12,634
It's not easy to find big ones.

140
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,034
The only shortcut to finding good fossils

141
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:18,134
is to dig a lot.

142
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:21,235
All right! Let's dig, dig, dig!

143
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:24,634
That's the spirit.

144
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:28,034
As long as you dig with passion, the fossils will find you.

145
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,135
All right!

146
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:36,034
Fossils sure are complicated.

147
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,034
I don't understand them at all.

148
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:42,634
But I thought you were sponsoring the moon's droppings PR program.

149
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:45,634
I've left most of it up to Ogami.

150
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:48,535
All I do is sign off on it.

151
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:56,434
Do you have a minute?

152
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:57,934
Yes.

153
00:09:57,935 --> 00:10:01,334
I've been wondering whether or not I should tell you.

154
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,334
Ogami!

155
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,834
Do you have a minute?

156
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:06,534
Sure!

157
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:08,635
Excuse me. We'll talk later.

158
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:18,034
Ai, want to go to the bathroom?

159
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,235
Sure.

160
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,835
Someone's inside.

161
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:34,134
Are you all right?

162
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,434
This smell...

163
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,935
Yoshida, stand back!

164
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:54,835
Ayumi, what's wrong?

165
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,535
In the bathroom...

166
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:01,835
Mr. Ogami!

167
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:04,735
This smell...

168
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
"Misao Yamamura."

169
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:25,599
"Gunma Prefecture Police Inspector Division 1" -I see, I see.

170
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,599
The victim was Oninohamura Village lodge & fossil museum owner,

171
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,499
Akira Ogami.

172
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,499
And the cause of death was cyanide poisoning.

173
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,599
Is that it?

174
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,499
Yes, it is.

175
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,799
The victim didn't eat or drink anything

176
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,499
during the fossil excavation tour.

177
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,499
Which means someone poisoned the bathroom beforehand

178
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,299
and made the victim touch it.

179
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,499
Do you think we did it?

180
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,599
We'd never do that.

181
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,899
That's right.

182
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,799
Besides, why would someone choose to kill him like that?

183
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,099
These children could have been harmed.

184
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,200
What? Oh, uh, you're right.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,399
Isn't you Conan?

186
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,799
Does that mean.

187
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,599
Mr. Mouri's here, too?

188
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,299
Mouri isn't here today.

189
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,199
Oh, it's you, Dr. Agasa.

190
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,100
You sure do get caught up in a lot of cases, too.

191
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,099
Excuse me, but I don't think this is a criminal case.

192
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,599
What? Who are you?

193
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,399
Nakatani, the mayor.

194
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,299
What? You're the mayor?

195
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,199
Please excuse me.

196
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,399
Ogami seemed worried about something for a few days now.

197
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,499
I see. He was worried.

198
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,899
Yes. He said he couldn't sleep and wanted to die.

199
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
Why?

200
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,799
I'm not sure.

201
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,400
Maybe it was because of the moon's droppings.

202
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,399
What's a moon's droppings?

203
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,799
It's an ancient fossil of a shell.

204
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,299
I see.

205
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,099
The truth is,

206
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,399
I came to expose that that fossil's origins were faked.

207
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,099
They were faked?

208
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Yes.

209
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:22,899
I believe the moon's droppings were found at a different excavation site.

210
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,599
So Mr. Ogami killed himself because he thought he'd be discovered?

211
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Yes.

212
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:31,199
He said there was something he wanted to confess to me.

213
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,999
Perhaps he couldn't bear the guilt any longer.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,999
Unbelievable.

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,299
Mr. Nakatani knows barely anything about fossils.

216
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,899
He couldn't help that he didn't notice.

217
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,500
But my village renewal plan is already in motion.

218
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,699
Well, this looks like a suicide.

219
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,899
Darn.

220
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,799
I thought I'd finally

221
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,399
get to gloriously solve a case again.

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,900
But Mr. Ogami was excited about his trip next month.

223
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,399
What trip?

224
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,299
He said he was planning to go to America.

225
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,299
There was a plane ticket on his desk.

226
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,699
Would someone considering suicide buy plane tickets?

227
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,499
Maybe he felt like dying after he made his reservation.

228
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,999
It's not too late to decide that

229
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,599
until after we determine if there's poison present or not.

230
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,900
We haven't searched everyone yet, either.

231
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,999
See?

232
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,799
We didn't find any poison anywhere.

233
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,499
Really?

234
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,499
Yes. We didn't find anything

235
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,399
on places the victim was likely to have touched.

236
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,099
We found lots of fingerprints, though.

237
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,799
So it was a suicide, then.

238
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,600
Excuse me, but there's something I forgot to report.

239
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,499
We didn't find poison on the victim's sanitary wipes,

240
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,900
but they are slightly more acidic than normal.

241
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,199
-Acidic? -Yes.

242
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,299
-More than normal? -Yes.

243
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,199
It's obviously unrelated.

244
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,199
Didn't I say we're looking for a cyanide compound?

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Okay, everyone. Shall we search the lodge next?

246
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,899
That mayor is definitely the culprit.

247
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,099
Really?

248
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,600
But there's no proof.

249
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Why are they all dead?

250
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,599
What are you guys doing?

251
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,799
Look. There are lots of dead bugs.

252
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,899
Poor bugs.

253
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,499
Let's dig a grave for them.

254
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Wait.

255
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,099
Could it be...

256
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,199
Don't touch those.

257
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,899
What's wrong, Conan?

258
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,899
Did you figure something out?

259
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,200
Yeah, thanks to the Youth Detective Squad.

260
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,899
Since we didn't find any signs of poison at the lodge,

261
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,900
-this must've been a suicide. -It wasn't a suicide.

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,699
It's a murder.

263
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,599
I finally figured out

264
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,499
how the culprit killed Mr. Ogami.

265
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,899
But Dr. Agasa, we didn't find poison anywhere.

266
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,600
How did they kill him?

267
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,999
It's hard to believe the victim would've drunk the poison himself.

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Mr. Ogami didn't drink the poison.

269
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,299
What are you talking about?

270
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,799
The victim clearly died of poisoning.

271
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,299
Yes, but isn't there other methods of taking in poisons

272
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,500
besides swallowing or licking them?

273
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,099
You still can't figure it out?

274
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,199
That's it. The victim inhaled the poison.

275
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,599
That's right.

276
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,799
Inhaled it? But how?

277
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,199
People say cyanide compounds kill

278
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,199
when they're swallowed,

279
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,299
but actually, the compound itself is not poisonous.

280
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,699
However, once it enters your body,

281
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,599
it reacts with your stomach acid, creating a poisonous gas.

282
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,099
That's why people say swallowing cyanide compounds kill you.

283
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,400
Yes.

284
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,399
What does that mean?

285
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,999
In other words, adding acid to a cyanide compound

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,999
creates a poisonous gas.

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,999
Adding acid?

288
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,799
That's right. The culprit probably dissolved

289
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,299
the cyanide compound in the toilet bowl.

290
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,899
Once the acid is added,

291
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,399
the poisonous gas would be released.

292
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,499
Come to think of it, there was hydrochloric acid at the lodge.

293
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,899
I heard it's used to clean fossils.

294
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,399
No, that's not what they used.

295
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Adding hydrochloric acid would produce a poisonous gas immediately.

296
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,199
They could close the lid.

297
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,699
Wouldn't that run the risk of killing

298
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,400
whoever used the bathroom before Mr. Ogami?

299
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,799
You're right. Then how did they do it?

300
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,599
The acid was added not by the culprit,

301
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,200
but by Mr. Ogami himself.

302
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,200
When he wiped his hands with a sanitary wipe and tossed it.

303
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,099
Into the toilet bowl?

304
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,199
Yes.

305
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,099
Forensics said the sheet

306
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,499
was slightly more acidic than normal.

307
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,500
The culprit added the diluted hydrochloric acid to the sanitary wipes.

308
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,799
The cyanide compound in the toilet bowl

309
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,099
reacted with the acid in the sanitary wipes

310
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,299
and created a poisonous gas.

311
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,199
With this method, even if someone entered the bathroom before him,

312
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,300
the cyanide compound would be harmlessly flushed away.

313
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,699
The culprit most likely told Mr. Ogami

314
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,999
they hid something valuable in the bathroom

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,999
so he'd search it.

316
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,099
The clean-freak Mr. Ogami used the sanitary wipes

317
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,800
to wipe his hands and threw them in the toilet.

318
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,600
The poisonous gas was formed, and Mr. Ogami died.

319
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,799
So? Who did it?

320
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,499
The only one who knew Mr. Ogami was a clean-freak

321
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,400
who carried sanitary wipes with him.

322
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Mr. Nakatani, you're the only one.

323
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,799
Wait... wait a minute.

324
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,299
That's just your theory.

325
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,699
What about evidence?

326
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,599
Do you have any proof that Ogami inhaled a poisonous gas?

327
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,000
There is. There's one piece of solid evidence.

328
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,399
What... what is this?

329
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,799
They're just dead bugs.

330
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,399
What's so important about these?

331
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,999
We examined them at Dr. Agasa's request.

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,500
Like the victim, these bugs were poisoned with cyanide.

333
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Look.

334
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:15,800
This spot is right beneath the bathroom fan.

335
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,199
The bugs gathered around the fan

336
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,699
must have inhaled the poisonous gas.

337
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,999
No...

338
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,099
Fearing the poisonous gas would remain inside the bathroom,

339
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,499
you must have left the fan on,

340
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,800
but it backfired.

341
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,699
Darn these insects.

342
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,699
Darn it, these insects!

343
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,599
Hey, wait. What are you doing?

344
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,799
These insects ruined my plan!

345
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,299
You mean you killed Mr. Ogami?

346
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,299
That's right. I killed Ogami.

347
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,899
You're the one who lied about the moon's droppings

348
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,299
coming from this village, too.

349
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,700
No, they were accomplices.

350
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,699
Accomplices?

351
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,199
That's right.

352
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,999
We came up with the idea together,

353
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,499
but he tried to place all the blame on me.

354
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,399
So I told him I had a tape of evidence

355
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,699
and told him to come to the bathroom.

356
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,699
But you didn't have to kill him.

357
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,700
If I didn't kill him, my political career would've been over.

358
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,200
There are so many things I still have to do.

359
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,699
What an awful mayor.

360
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,400
There's only one thing you should be doing.

361
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,499
The only thing you should be doing

362
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,800
is showing remorse and atoning for your crimes!

363
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,699
Look. I found an oyster fossil.

364
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,499
I only found clams.

365
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,099
What's going to happen to the fossil museum?

366
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,299
I'll try working to keep it open.

367
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,700
This is all I found.

368
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,099
What is that?

369
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,199
It's gross.

370
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,799
Right? This worthless thing...

371
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,100
Hey, wait. Isn't that dinosaur poop?

372
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,599
If that's true, that's a major discovery, Genta.

373
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,499
Really? I guess I'm lucky.

374
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Yeah, lucky.

375
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,599
"Next Episode."

376
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,199
This is my girlfriend.

377
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,000
She suddenly disappeared a few days ago.

378
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,900
I doubt we'll find a body in this current.

379
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,600
We managed to stop him, but what now?

380
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Conan!

381
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,099
Next Conan,

382
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,400
"The Missing Girlfriend"
