1
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:07,733
Dr. Agasa took us to a hot spring inn in Hakone.

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,733
The filming for the newest version of the movie

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,533
called the "Blood Smoke Hitman" was taking place there.

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,533
"Ganji Tetsuyama (67)" -We met scriptwriter, Mr. Ganji Tetsuyama,

5
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:20,033
"Mishio Natori (28)" -the actress playing the heroine Ms. Mishio Natori,

6
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:23,233
"Junsaku Tanzawa (34)" -her manager Mr. Junsaku Tanzawa,

7
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:27,733
"Unpei Terado (33)" -and the lead actor Mr. Unpei Terado.

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,433
Early in the morning the following day,

9
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,933
we went to the lake top outdoor spa

10
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:35,933
and found Mr. Tetsuyama murdered in the women's bath.

11
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,233
Judging from the circumstances,

12
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,033
the culprit most likely waited for Mr. Tetsuyama

13
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,533
outside the spa all night and ambushed him,

14
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:46,833
then mingled among the crowd after committing the crime.

15
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,133
The only guests who walked around alone the night before were...

16
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:58,733
Ms. Mishio, Mr. Tanzawa and Mr. Terado.

17
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:03,633
The culprit is most probably among the three.

18
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,833
Brooding over passing seasons

19
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,633
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

20
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,433
An actor falls into a trap.

21
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,533
The spa mystery is finally solved.

22
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,133
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,033
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,333
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:08,627
"Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 2)"

26
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:11,627
If so, the culprit is...

27
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,027
the woman right here!

28
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,227
Last night I overheard Mr. Tetsuyama

29
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:18,727
talking on the phone in the lobby.

30
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:21,327
He was saying, "So you've finally decided to do it."

31
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,827
"Let's take a dip in the open-air bath on the lake

32
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,427
with the morning sun shining on us."

33
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:26,727
Or, "If you don't like the lead actor,

34
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,427
I could make a switch."

35
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:33,227
I'm sure she used her feminine wiles to lure Mr. Tetsuyama here and...

36
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,627
I see...

37
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:38,227
If so, I can see why he was found dead in the women's spa.

38
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,427
How about it?

39
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,227
Were you the one talking to him on the phone?

40
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:45,427
Yes, it was I.

41
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,927
I told him that if he came to the women's spa first thing in the morning,

42
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,627
I would soak in it until the other guests came.

43
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:53,527
But, I was just lying.

44
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:56,327
I only wanted to teach that perverted man a lesson

45
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:59,327
by standing him up and embarrassing him.

46
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,227
I wasn't the only actress who was fed up

47
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:05,027
with Mr. Tetsuyama sexual harassment.

48
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:10,427
Which means, that you both had a motive for killing Mr. Tetsuyama.

49
00:04:10,427 --> 00:04:12,527
Hey, hold it.

50
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:14,727
This guy has a motive too.

51
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:17,227
Five years ago his role as leading actor

52
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:18,727
was suddenly taken away from him by Mr. Tetsuyama.

53
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:21,327
And he hasn't acted since then.

54
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,827
Is that true?

55
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:26,627
Yes. I resented him a bit back then,

56
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:29,027
but now I'm grateful for what he did.

57
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,527
Because thanks to him,

58
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:33,927
I'm experiencing a variety of things other than being an actor.

59
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:35,727
It's not that I hated him to the point

60
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:37,427
of wanting to kill him either.

61
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:39,627
Same here.

62
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:40,727
Inspector Yokomizo.

63
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:42,027
What?

64
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:44,827
This was found in the back of a basket in the changing room.

65
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,127
A PET of Japanese tea.

66
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:50,327
It's not tea that's inside it, though...

67
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:53,527
Yes. It looks like plain water.

68
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,327
And, burnt remains of matches were found

69
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,527
floating on the lake near the site of the crime.

70
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:01,027
Burnt remains of matches?

71
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:02,127
Why?

72
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,427
Excuse me,

73
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:07,827
why not have those three people meet

74
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,427
with the employees who were at the entrance

75
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,827
of the wharf from the main building?

76
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:15,627
Right. If he were hiding here all night,

77
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:19,327
he wouldn't have passed through that entrance yet, no?

78
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:22,427
Yes. Well... you see, as for this floor

79
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:23,727
the lights are set at low

80
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:26,427
and kept dim until 6 am in the morning.

81
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,727
Many people from the police and all passed through here today,

82
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,627
so I really can't tell who's who.

83
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:34,527
I do remember that Mr. Tetsuyama was the very first to come here

84
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:38,527
and the children came here right after him though...

85
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:39,727
You told us that Mr. Tetsuyama

86
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:42,227
has a special privileges and gets to enter that outdoor spa

87
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:43,627
earlier than anyone else,

88
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,027
does he always do so?

89
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:48,627
Yes, Mr. Tetsuyama loves to be the first to take a bath.

90
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:50,927
So, when he stays at this inn

91
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:54,527
the lights in the spa are turned on before 4:30 am,

92
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:57,427
and we let him go through quite early.

93
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:58,627
Inspector.

94
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:01,927
It seems that one of the rings of the victim is missing.

95
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,027
Ring?

96
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:06,927
Yes. Only an empty case was left back at the room.

97
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:11,127
On the case it said, "Nichiuri TV Newcomer Scenario Award".

98
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:16,427
You mean the ring with the soybean sized jewel on it.

99
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,827
That's right, the silver one.

100
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:21,827
He used to wear it to parties

101
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,327
or when he had to make speeches

102
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,627
saying that it was like a good-luck charm for him.

103
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:26,927
You can't find it anywhere?

104
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:28,327
No, sir.

105
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,127
It was probably disposed of into the lake

106
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,127
along with the murder weapon.

107
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:35,027
Didn't anything come out of the rooms of these three?

108
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,427
No, but there's something that bothers us in each room.

109
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:38,827
What?

110
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:41,127
The ashtray of Mr. Terado's room

111
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,027
was full of burnt remains of matches.

112
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,127
Matches?

113
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:47,727
What's wrong with lighting cigarettes with matches?

114
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:49,727
Inside the bag found in Mr. Tanzawa's room,

115
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:51,627
we found gloves,

116
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,527
but for some reason they were only for the left hand.

117
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,527
They are golf gloves.

118
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,727
A lot of people wear them only on their left hand

119
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:59,327
to keep their hand from slipping.

120
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,427
Me too, since I'm right handed.

121
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:04,627
And, from the wastebasket in Ms. Natori's room,

122
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:06,027
we found a cracked wine glass cup

123
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,527
and on the table, a script with several pages crumpled.

124
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:12,527
I was playing the role.

125
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:14,027
When I was reading the script last night

126
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:15,927
there was a scene where the character ripped out paper

127
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:18,327
and threw a wine glass at the person she was with.

128
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:24,227
I did it almost unconsciously.

129
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:26,327
Concentrating my all into becoming the character

130
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:28,227
is my style of acting.

131
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:31,227
Concentrate on the role and become the character.

132
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:36,527
I see. So, that's the story.

133
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,927
The culprit got too absorbed in his role,

134
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,027
and forgot completely

135
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,527
that he had hidden the conclusive evidence

136
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:46,927
inside his own pocket.

137
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:49,327
Inspector Yokomizo.

138
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:52,327
I've spoken with the inn employees at the front desk.

139
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:54,927
-And? -They said that around 5:30 am this morning,

140
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,627
Ms. Natori turned her room key in to the front desk

141
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,727
and still hasn't come to pick it up.

142
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,627
Mr. Terado at about 2 am this morning,

143
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,627
called an employee up to his room

144
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:06,727
saying that the air conditioner had broken down.

145
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:09,527
Well, it turned out I wasn't operating it correctly though.

146
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,527
Then, what about Mr. Tanzawa stopping

147
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:13,827
at the front desk to get loose change at about 4:30 am?

148
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,627
That's been confirmed too.

149
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:18,227
He exchanged 1000 yen to 100 yen coins.

150
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:19,827
What?

151
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:20,827
Hey.

152
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,227
Before we, the police came,

153
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:24,427
is it really true that not even a single person

154
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:26,427
went back to the main building from the wharf?

155
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:28,027
No, sir.

156
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:30,427
If so, these three people would've been

157
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,827
at the main building this morning,

158
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:33,927
so the deduction about the culprit hiding

159
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,627
all night inside the lake top outdoor spa

160
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:40,527
that the brat made was completely off the mark?

161
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:42,327
But that's...

162
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,627
Dr. Agasa.

163
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,927
So, you're up.

164
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,627
If so, the culprit must've come into the outdoor spa

165
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:54,527
from the lake after all,

166
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,827
and after killing Mr. Tetsuyama returned to the lake and fled.

167
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:01,927
Okay. Go ask around the places surrounding the lake...

168
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:05,127
I don't think that will be necessary.

169
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:09,127
Why? Because the killer is here...

170
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,527
right in front of my eyes.

171
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:21,744
Hey, hey...

172
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:24,944
I don't have any idea about the murder, you know.

173
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,944
Never mind just pretend to talk along with my voice.

174
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:29,244
What is this?

175
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:31,044
Butting in all of a sudden.

176
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,944
No, I just...

177
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:34,944
I'm saying that despite traces of someone

178
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:39,044
having been hiding by the outdoor spa all night...

179
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:42,044
Are you guys so blind that you can't see it?

180
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:43,844
Traces?

181
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:46,444
The bottle of green tea that for some reason had water in it

182
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,344
and was found in the changing room

183
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,144
and the burnt remains of matches

184
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:52,444
that were found floating in the lake are evidence.

185
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:56,244
It's too cold to wait all night outside the outdoor spa on the lake,

186
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:59,644
where the wind blows through during this season.

187
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:03,044
And even if you were to enter the spa from the veranda,

188
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,244
with the lights and the heater turned off,

189
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:08,544
it would be impossible to endure the cold in the changing room.

190
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:11,244
The only way to keep warm is...

191
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,344
Don't tell me the culprit went into the spa?

192
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:15,944
Yes, that's right.

193
00:10:15,944 --> 00:10:17,344
After the culprit drank up all the tea,

194
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:19,344
judging from the fact that the culprit drank up not only the green tea

195
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,544
but refilled the bottle repeatedly with water

196
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:22,444
from the sink of the changing room,

197
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:25,544
I'm sure that the culprit soaked repeatedly in the water all night.

198
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:28,544
Soaking in the spa makes you thirsty.

199
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,244
Then, what about the burnt remains of the matches

200
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:32,044
that were afloat in the lake?

201
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:35,044
The culprit smoked to stay awake.

202
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:39,544
And did so on the veranda to avoid making the spa smell of smoke.

203
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:41,544
Which means that the suspicious one would be you

204
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:43,444
because you had cigarettes on you.

205
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:45,244
Hey, hey, I...

206
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,144
I said the culprit smoked.

207
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:50,544
I didn't say the culprit smoked cigarettes.

208
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:52,044
What?

209
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:55,244
Not cigarettes...

210
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:56,844
A pipe?

211
00:10:56,844 --> 00:11:01,144
Wait. If the culprit waited while smoking a pipe...

212
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,744
Yeah, that's right.

213
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:08,044
The one who was hiding all night by the lake top outdoor spa was...

214
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:11,644
the one who was killed, Mr. Tetsuyama.

215
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:13,444
-What? -What?

216
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:16,844
Then, who is the Mr. Tetsuyama that went pass this entrance here

217
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,544
at 4:30 am in the morning?

218
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,444
That one's the killer.

219
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:24,044
He was disguised as Mr. Tetsuyama.

220
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:25,544
In other words, by reversing the common sense

221
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:28,144
that there would be no reason for the victim to hide

222
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:32,444
at the would-be crime scene for a long time for the culprit,

223
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:34,844
we were thrown off by a psychological trick that was set up.

224
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,244
Hey, is that right?

225
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,344
You guys let Mr. Tetsuyama pass through

226
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:41,044
the entrance to the outdoor spa, didn't you?

227
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:45,044
Well, I think it was him.

228
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,544
His unique way of walking.

229
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,844
And, the stern facial expression he wore,

230
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:52,844
as if coercing us were manners that only belonged to Mr. Tetsuyama.

231
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:56,144
However, back then, this floor was dimly lit

232
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:58,144
and moreover, that person

233
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:01,244
was wearing a knitted cap, wearing glasses

234
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:03,944
and had a towel around him as if it were a muffler, right?

235
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:06,244
Yes.

236
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:07,944
I see.

237
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:11,144
You knew Mr. Tetsuyama very well

238
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:12,544
so as an actor and former actor,

239
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:16,544
you both could've acted out being Mr. Tetsuyama

240
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:19,044
if you wanted to.

241
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:20,444
Hold it.

242
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:22,444
If so, this woman who's also

243
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:24,444
an actress should be suspected too.

244
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,044
If she wears many layers of clothing,

245
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,144
she could imitate his physique,

246
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:29,444
and if he wore a stern facial expression,

247
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,544
she wouldn't have had to say a word.

248
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,944
She also told him that if he came to the women's spa

249
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:35,244
first thing in the morning,

250
00:12:35,244 --> 00:12:37,444
she would bathe with him until the other guests came.

251
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:41,244
If she made him promise to hide in the women's spa all night

252
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,244
then it all fits in, doesn't it?

253
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:45,144
That's true,

254
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:50,344
if the person on the other side of the line was really her.

255
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:53,844
Really her? Are you saying she's lying?

256
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:57,844
She had to say so to protect him.

257
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:02,044
Mr. Terado was watching Mr. Tetsuyama talking on the phone

258
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:04,244
and if Ms. Natori completely denies

259
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:06,044
that she wasn't the one who was talking on the other side of the line,

260
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:09,844
there would only be one person left who would turn out to be the culprit.

261
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:13,144
Ms. Natori's manager, Mr. Tanzawa.

262
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:16,044
You're the only one.

263
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:17,644
Just what're you talking about?

264
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:18,944
I'm not lying.

265
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:24,244
Mr. Tanazawa probably told Mr. Tetsuyama

266
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:26,044
that Ms. Natori will be going first thing

267
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:28,144
in the morning to take a bath at the outdoor spa on the lake.

268
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:30,244
If you want to watch her taking a bath,

269
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:34,544
stay in hiding all night and wait for her.

270
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,544
A strategy that only you,

271
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:39,644
as her manager could've carried out.

272
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:41,544
Mr. Tetsuyama, because of that phone call

273
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:45,944
remarked, "So, she's finally decided to listen to me."

274
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:50,144
I'll bet Mr. Tetsuyama nagged you repeatedly about this.

275
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,744
Of course, Mr. Tetsuyama

276
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,444
could've come to the spa first thing in the morning

277
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:55,544
and hid in the women's spa.

278
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,044
But, if Ms. Natori finds out

279
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,944
that Mr. Tetsuyama went to the outdoor spa before her,

280
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:03,244
you probably talked him in by saying that she may get suspicious.

281
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:05,044
This way, you, Mr. Tanazawa,

282
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,644
made Mr. Tetsuyama hide on the veranda of the women's bath,

283
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:09,944
and you headed for the outdoor spa

284
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:13,744
a little before 5 am in the morning.

285
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:18,244
Then, you took off your disguise in the changing room.

286
00:14:18,244 --> 00:14:20,144
And, you probably fast talked Mr. Tetsuyama

287
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:21,944
into coming into the spa, saying where he was wasn't good.

288
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,744
Then, you struck him with a blunt weapon and killed him.

289
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:26,844
After that, you planned to re-enter

290
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:30,444
the spa amidst the confusion, didn't you?

291
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:34,444
Because you figured that maybe some of your hair may be found in the spa.

292
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:38,344
But, the children came earlier than expected,

293
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,244
and instead of getting all worked up over finding the dead body

294
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:44,444
they blocked the entrance to the spa.

295
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:46,244
Although you wanted to hide the traces

296
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:48,544
of you being at the scene of the crime,

297
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:51,344
you just couldn't come around to doing so.

298
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:53,444
That's why Mr. Tanazawa, who had no other choice...

299
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:56,044
Hey, you're talking like you actually saw everything but...

300
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:57,944
Do you have proof or what?

301
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,144
Yes, that evidence is...

302
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:02,944
What are you doing in secret, Conan?

303
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,644
That's the voice changer bow-tie, isn't it?

304
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,744
Are you talking in Dr. Agasa's voice?

305
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,444
You can't talk in your own voice?

306
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:13,844
No. He's helping Dr. Agasa who doesn't know

307
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:15,744
anything about the case out by whispering from behind.

308
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:17,244
I see.

309
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:18,944
Thanks, Ai.

310
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:20,544
Don't worry.

311
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,744
I won't let them take a peek like you did.

312
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:25,044
Peek in?

313
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:30,044
As to that, you don't have to worry about it either.

314
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:31,944
All I got to see is your butt.

315
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,544
Butt?

316
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:35,744
What about... butt?

317
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:37,144
Nothing...

318
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,344
Shoots. I talked in Dr. Agasa's voice.

319
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:42,544
But, he knew something.

320
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,844
Something that only the culprit would've known.

321
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,344
Mr. Tanzawa that is...

322
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,944
That's why Mr. Tanzawa took the lead

323
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:52,544
and step foot into the spa.

324
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,144
That's the evidence.

325
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:55,644
What?

326
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:57,844
Because the children were blocking the entrance,

327
00:15:57,844 --> 00:16:01,544
it's only natural to want to find out what's going on inside.

328
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,344
But, the scene was the women's spa you know.

329
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:06,544
Wouldn't you normally ask a woman

330
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,944
to go check the place out first of all.

331
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:10,444
Yes.

332
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:12,644
Mr. Tanzawa already knew...

333
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:15,444
that in the spa, there would only be Mr. Tetsuyama's dead body

334
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:17,644
and the children.

335
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,544
He also knew that even if he inevitably happened to look

336
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:20,744
at the naked bodies of the children,

337
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:22,844
it would not be a problem.

338
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,344
What's wrong, Ai?

339
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:33,544
You're emitting a sinister and dreadful aura.

340
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:35,944
You look scary.

341
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:39,244
That's proof? What a laugh.

342
00:16:39,244 --> 00:16:42,744
If it's immovable evidence, you know of it too, don't you?

343
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:45,544
That Mr. Tanzawa still has it on him.

344
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:51,344
It's that ring that you said on the spur of the moment,

345
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,744
had a soybean size jewel on it,

346
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:55,344
in order to protect him.

347
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:57,144
She said to protect him?

348
00:16:57,144 --> 00:17:00,744
Yes. If it were a ring with such a large jewel on it,

349
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:03,644
it would be readily apparent if you wear it on your finger.

350
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:06,044
You would never think that the blackened ring

351
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:11,844
that Mr. Tanazawa is wearing on the finger of his left hand is the one.

352
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:13,144
What?

353
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:17,044
This?

354
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:20,144
When he was told to show you his belongings...

355
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,244
he remembered that he had forgotten that in the left pocket of his slacks,

356
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:30,044
the ring that he had forgotten to dispose of was still inside.

357
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:32,444
So, he fuddled inside his pocket and wore the ring on his middle finger

358
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:34,244
by sticking his hand into his pocket.

359
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:36,644
He also made sure that he wore the ring so the jewel would be hiding,

360
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:37,944
facing the palm of his hand.

361
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:41,844
But, why did he go out of his way to wear the ring?

362
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:45,944
Because the silver sulfurized and blackened.

363
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:48,244
This hot spring is a sulfur spring.

364
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:51,644
Reacting to the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide,

365
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:54,644
the surface of the silver ring sulfurized and blackened.

366
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:57,744
Seeing the blackened ring,

367
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,544
he figured he had to remove the ring.

368
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:04,244
He feigned coming to take a bath just now and yet

369
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:08,444
he didn't want to be suspected of having soaked in the spa for a long time.

370
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,444
Well, but if the spa has a highly concentrated content of sulfur in it,

371
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:15,144
the ring would blacken in no time at all.

372
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:17,144
But, what an idiot...

373
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,644
to forget to dispose of it.

374
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:20,944
He couldn't help it.

375
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:23,744
Because he was playing the role of being Mr. Tetsuyama.

376
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:27,444
Mr. Tetsuyama always held his pipe in his left hand

377
00:18:27,444 --> 00:18:29,244
so he was probably left-handed.

378
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:31,544
That's why you put the ring in your left back pocket

379
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,944
that you normally don't put anything inside, right?

380
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:36,444
You just planned to leave it there until you were ready

381
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:38,744
to dispose of the blood spattered bathrobe and outer robe,

382
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,444
as well as the murder weapon into the lake.

383
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:43,244
You pushed the button of the vending machine

384
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:47,844
with your left hand and called me "brat", too...

385
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,844
You were playing the role of Mr. Tetsuyama

386
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:51,844
already from that time, right?

387
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:53,044
Yes.

388
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,744
I really had it tough

389
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:57,944
because I never acted the role

390
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:00,244
of such a narrow minded man like him.

391
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:01,744
Hey. Don't tell me...

392
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:04,144
It's because you held a grudge against Mr. Tetsuyama

393
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,144
for taking your role as leading actor away from you five years ago.

394
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:10,144
Yes, to put it simply that was my motive.

395
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:13,844
The role I was denied was for the middle aged hitman,

396
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:17,444
in Scarlet Wellspring that is currently being made.

397
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:20,844
Since I received rave reviews for the youth part,

398
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:23,244
I thought that I would naturally be continuing the role.

399
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,344
Maybe he thought that you were still too young

400
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,544
to act out the role?

401
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:30,944
Yes. I thought so too.

402
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:33,144
Because he also told me that I was too young,

403
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:35,344
that I lacked the melancholic feeling that ripens with age,

404
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:39,344
and that I should accumulate more diverse experiences and all.

405
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:44,244
That's why I quit acting and started working as her manager.

406
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:46,644
I experienced what I never got to experience when I was an actor.

407
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,444
I experienced the hardships of being on the bottom of the ladder.

408
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:54,744
I got to thinking that he wanted me to go through all of what I did.

409
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:58,344
And, I found out that they would be filming Scarlet Wellspring again,

410
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:01,944
so I called and pleading with him to give me the part,

411
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,244
but he was so wasted

412
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,044
that he didn't recognize that it was me on the phone.

413
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:09,444
Junsaku Tanzawa to play the leading role as the hitman?

414
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:13,544
No. He won't do. He's too good.

415
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,644
Just like when he played the youth part,

416
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:17,844
I don't want to feel vexed after he's reputed by the public

417
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:20,344
as acting the part out way better than the original work.

418
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:25,144
No matter what I did, he wasn't going

419
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:27,944
to give me the part of the middle aged hitman.

420
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,544
Unfortunately, that is,

421
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:33,844
so long as he remains in this world...

422
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:36,744
The black and white version of the Scarlet Wellspring

423
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,444
that I saw as a child

424
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,444
was what intrigued me to become an actor,

425
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:43,644
so I wanted the part at all costs.

426
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:45,744
But, thinking back,

427
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,944
maybe I couldn't have acted it out after all.

428
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:56,344
If I was able to become a hitman soon after I killed him,

429
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:59,544
I wouldn't have goofed in this way.

430
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:00,844
Mishio.

431
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,244
Act the part of the woman owner of the inn with all your might

432
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:08,544
because it's a part that will open up the breadth of your roles.

433
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:10,444
I can't,

434
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:11,744
because you're the one who taught me

435
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:14,544
that I'd have to live the role I'd be acting

436
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:17,344
even in my private life until the filming is completed.

437
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:21,444
The one who hired the hitman was the woman herself.

438
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:26,144
In order to conceal this fact without batting an eyebrow.

439
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:31,544
The woman attempts to kill the killer in cold blood.

440
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:34,244
I can no longer...

441
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:36,744
go on acting this role.

442
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,044
Okay, everybody, don't forget your things.

443
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:02,344
Yes!

444
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:04,044
We should get one more souvenir.

445
00:23:04,044 --> 00:23:07,344
Hey, Dr. Agasa. Come here for a while.

446
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,844
After I changed clothes after taking a bath,

447
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:12,544
there's a stinging feeling on my butt.

448
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:13,744
Will you take a look at it for me?

449
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,244
Okay...

450
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:16,844
Talking of hot springs,

451
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:20,344
Ai was at the men's spa a while ago.

452
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:22,044
What? Why?

453
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:23,344
I wonder...

454
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:25,944
She was saying that she was looking for something.

455
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,644
It's a bit red and swollen.

456
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:32,344
No joke?

457
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,644
-What? -What?

458
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,644
That's red pepper...

459
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:38,844
If you rinse it off with water, you'll be just fine.

460
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:42,344
There's red pepper powder on the inside of your undies.

461
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:43,344
What?

462
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:46,644
Well, there's nothing to worry about.

463
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:48,844
It's only the naked body of a child.

464
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,244
It's no problem if anyone sees it, right?

465
00:23:55,544 --> 00:23:57,644
That rat...

466
00:24:01,544 --> 00:24:03,444
Catch him!

467
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,144
Stop.

468
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,344
Move it.

469
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,444
Oh, no.

470
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:09,544
He's Kanemura.

471
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:12,344
He's member of the fraud group, right?

472
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,744
The scene of the crime is in between

473
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,644
this Natsuhabara Station and Beika Station.

474
00:24:16,644 --> 00:24:18,344
It's near Sugame Station.

475
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,744
I understand how you feel.

476
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:25,844
But, it's not right.

477
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:31,044
Next Conan, "A Friend of Justice".

478
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:49,244
Next Conan's Hint:

479
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:51,044
"Automatic Wicket".

480
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,544
The next episode, "A Friend of Justice"

481
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:53,744
It's about Yaiba.

482
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,444
No, he's not appearing. It's about me, then.

483
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:56,444
What?
