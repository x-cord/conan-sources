1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:03,694
We came to the cake buffet at a hotel that Doc won

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:06,795
after spinning the lottery.

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:10,194
There, we ran into two actress bloggers,

4
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:12,194
Saya Kitami and Kyono Shono

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:15,995
who were competing for blog popularity ranking.

6
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:19,594
However, although it's almost time for shooting, Kyona doesn't wake up.

7
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:23,294
Sakurako Yonehara, who is worried about Kyona,

8
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:26,894
asks the bellboy to open the door of her room, and there they find...

9
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,694
Kyona, what's wrong?

10
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,995
Shooting's going to start!

11
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:36,195
Kyona? Kyona?

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,695
Kyona...

13
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:48,694
What's the matter?

14
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:50,794
Please call an ambulance and the police!

15
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,995
What? Oh, all right!

16
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:57,694
What's this?

17
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:01,394
Conan, that's a card key, isn't it?

18
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,494
Yep.

19
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,694
But, that's strange.

20
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:07,194
This hotel isn't auto lock.

21
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:11,694
-What? -How did the perp lock the room?

22
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,595
It's a locked room murder.

23
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:18,595
What's this white stain?

24
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:22,694
Whipped cream?

25
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:23,994
Which means...

26
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:26,494
Who on earth...

27
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:29,795
Who could've done something terrible like this?

28
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:31,995
Don't tell me that the perp...

29
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,994
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

30
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,194
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

31
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:39,994
The key point of the locked room murder

32
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:42,394
was an ordinary toy and small prop.

33
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,994
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:45,794
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:47,895
His name is Detective Conan!

36
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:36,224
"The Actress Blogger's Locked Room Case (Part 2)"

37
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,123
And? How about it?

38
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:45,023
Did you figure out the locked room trick?

39
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,223
No, not yet.

40
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,423
But, I have an idea how the perp made it in the room

41
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:51,023
and the murder weapon!

42
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:55,823
What? Then are you saying that the TV talent is the perp after all?

43
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:58,023
Yeah, no mistake about it.

44
00:03:58,024 --> 00:03:59,123
No.

45
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:02,523
She seems to be so kind.

46
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:05,723
The outward appearance and inside of a woman are different, you know.

47
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:07,423
Although the lady who was killed

48
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:10,923
seemed to have a foul mouth, was vulgar and rude,

49
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,023
if you look at her blog,

50
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:16,123
you'll see that she had a sensitive and meticulous side too.

51
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:19,423
What? How did you find something like that out?

52
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:23,123
The bottles of manicure were lined out in order by number,

53
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:25,223
despite it being a brand where you couldn't see the number

54
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,223
unless it was turned over.

55
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:28,523
What?

56
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:31,624
Wait a sec. Then, that picture...

57
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:39,123
I see. So this is the secret that she found out about.

58
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:43,323
But, would a person commit murder just for something like this?

59
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,624
Wait a sec.

60
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:47,423
Wait.

61
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:50,324
In English, this would be?

62
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:57,823
I sort of feel hungry.

63
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:59,623
What? Already?

64
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:03,523
You said you were full just a while ago, didn't you?

65
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:06,723
Doc, make something for me, will you?

66
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:10,823
Why not go home and eat dinner like you're supposed to?

67
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:16,823
But, Mom and Dad are at a gathering of the shopping arcade

68
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:19,823
and aren't going to be home till late tonight.

69
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:23,123
If I eat too much, Mom will get angry

70
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:25,023
so make me something like dessert, won't you?

71
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,423
You ate so much cake and you still want dessert?

72
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:32,623
Geez. You're really a glutton, Genta.

73
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,123
Would you like some cheese cake, then?

74
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:37,923
I was thinking of making one tomorrow

75
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:40,123
so I already bought the ingredients.

76
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:42,323
All right.

77
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:46,023
You get to eat yours at breakfast tomorrow, Doc.

78
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:47,624
Give me a break.

79
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:53,323
But, won't it take time till it's ready?

80
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:54,823
It seems I'll be able to make it

81
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:57,623
in 30 to 40 minutes if I use the rice cooker.

82
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,723
Huh? Rice cooker?

83
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,823
Yes! The function of the rice cooker

84
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:04,223
is not limited just to making rice!

85
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,524
It can also make delicious cake!

86
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:11,923
I see. So, that's the story.

87
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:14,723
The perp didn't use what the function was originally meant for

88
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,824
and turned that room into a locked room.

89
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:21,524
In order to hide her past mistake.

90
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:27,223
But, this case is sure one filled with mysteries.

91
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:28,923
The victim was saying that

92
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:32,923
she wouldn't open the door unless the housekeeper, Sakurako came

93
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:38,023
but the perp got into the room, and killed the victim.

94
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,423
The doors of the rooms of this hotel aren't auto lock and yet,

95
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:43,123
the card key was on the floor in the bedroom

96
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,123
away from the entrance,

97
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,523
and the way the perp made it away after committing the crime

98
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:49,524
is not known at all.

99
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:53,223
On top of that, the stick like weapon that

100
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:57,323
the victim was struck to death with hasn't been found yet.

101
00:06:57,324 --> 00:06:58,923
The only thing we know is that

102
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:01,923
the victim is TV talent, Ms. Kyona Shono,

103
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:06,123
and that there's going to be quite a fuss after this.

104
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,823
Shall we ask the Chief what to do?

105
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:10,924
Yeah, I guess.

106
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:14,023
Who is it?

107
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:15,424
Oh, well...

108
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:18,524
Hey, hold it there.

109
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,623
Dr. Agasa?

110
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:26,923
And, what is it you want?

111
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:29,823
Conan?

112
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,223
Huh, where's Dr. Agasa?

113
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:37,123
Dr. Agasa's waiting for you in room 504, Inspector!

114
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:41,623
-Huh? -In the room of the perp right below this room!

115
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:44,923
Room 504 right below?

116
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:48,323
That's the room of TV talent Ms. Saya Kitami!

117
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:50,323
Yep, that's right!

118
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,323
Conan.

119
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:55,723
I think it's too difficult for you to understand

120
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,923
but the room was locked and...

121
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:00,023
Inspector!

122
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:05,123
The Chief called to say, do as Conan says.

123
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:06,324
Huh?

124
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:12,323
Please explain this so I understand.

125
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:16,223
Why am I the perp who killed Kyona?

126
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:20,523
The card key was in the room, so the room was locked, correct?

127
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:23,923
Moreover, it seemed that Kyona said

128
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:26,723
she would open the door only for Sakurako.

129
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:30,423
If you're going to suspect anyone, I think it should be Sakurako.

130
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:33,123
Well, it may be but...

131
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:34,924
Doctor Agasa is...

132
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:40,623
If you look through the peek hole of the door,

133
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:44,923
you'll see how the perp got into to the room.

134
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,923
I tell you.

135
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,024
Who is it now?

136
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:52,423
Dr. Agasa?

137
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:57,324
It can't be...

138
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:06,124
What on earth's...

139
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:15,298
What on earth's going on here?

140
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:17,597
We did it!

141
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,497
-Huh? -We tricked you!

142
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:22,597
A total success!

143
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:25,297
Then, you guys did that?

144
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,098
Yes, that's right.

145
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:32,097
We recorded Doc's video beforehand on the cell phone

146
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:35,998
and put the cell phone up against the peek hole and played the video.

147
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:41,197
Then, Dr. Agasa that I saw a while ago too was...

148
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:42,497
Yeah, that's correct!

149
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,597
I made Conan do the same thing.

150
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:51,798
The same thing that Saya did when she went into Kyona's room.

151
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:53,997
I see.

152
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:58,397
Saya recorded Sakurako's video on her cell phone

153
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,597
and used it to go into Kyona's room.

154
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:07,397
But I met Sakuroko for the first time today.

155
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,097
I didn't have time to take such a video!

156
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:11,397
Right, don't you agree?

157
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:12,797
Yes.

158
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:17,197
Sakurako, when Saya told you to come to her room and you went there,

159
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:20,197
you said that something was posted on the door, didn't you?

160
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:22,898
Huh? Yes. There was an envelope...

161
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:25,497
An envelope?

162
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:29,797
Yes. An envelope with a large black heart mark drawn on it.

163
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:34,897
It was posted right below the peekhole of the door of Saya's room.

164
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:39,197
Saya said that it was prank played by one of her fans though.

165
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:43,297
The cell phone was in that envelope.

166
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:46,497
There was a hole made shaped like a heart,

167
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,597
and the cell phone was put inside

168
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:51,297
so that the camera lens would fit right into the hole.

169
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:53,797
Then, if it were in record mode,

170
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:59,597
the image of you pushing the doorbell would be taken.

171
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:02,597
Both the rooms of Kyona and Saya

172
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:05,197
are at the dead end of the corridor.

173
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,597
Therefore, the background would look exactly the same too.

174
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:09,997
But...

175
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:11,997
What about the card key?

176
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:15,497
It was near the corpse that was in the bedroom beyond, you know!

177
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:18,297
The doors of this hotel aren't auto lock,

178
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:20,697
so how did I get out of the room after committing the murder

179
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:23,397
and lock the door?

180
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:26,997
You probably used this toy helicopter

181
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:30,497
that you flew at the cake buffet, right?

182
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:32,698
Helicopter?

183
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:36,897
Will you lend me the card key to this room?

184
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,398
Here you go.

185
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:44,397
First, you stick the axis of the rotary shaft of the propeller

186
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:46,897
onto the rear of the helicopter

187
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:50,097
with a long string using scotch tape.

188
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,297
Then you tie the scotch tape on the end of the string

189
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:55,697
that is attached to the rotary shaft,

190
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:59,897
and then stick that scotch tape lightly onto the card key.

191
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:03,797
Then you put the helicopter on the floor of the bedroom

192
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:05,897
and stick it on lightly.

193
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:07,697
There, all done!

194
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:09,897
Finally, hold the two strings,

195
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:14,297
and pull the string out from under the door,

196
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:18,597
slide the card key from under the space of the locked door

197
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:21,198
and move the helicopter.

198
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,797
Then, I'll leave the rest up to you guys!

199
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:25,998
Okay!

200
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:33,697
I inserted it.

201
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:35,597
Okay, start!

202
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:36,697
Okay!

203
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:38,297
Here goes!

204
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:39,998
Switch on!

205
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:44,997
When the helicopter is moved,

206
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,797
the string will be wound by the rotary shaft

207
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,197
and the card key will slide smoothly through

208
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,297
the space under the door into the room beyond.

209
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:56,597
Then after the rotary shaft winds up all the string,

210
00:12:56,598 --> 00:13:01,497
they card key will be cut off from the string due to the impact,

211
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:03,898
and fall to the floor!

212
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:09,097
I see! You deliberately don't fly the helicopter

213
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:11,897
and use it only to wound the string.

214
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:14,197
Yep! And to finish it off, all you do is

215
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,697
pull the string that is attached to the rear from outside the room!

216
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:20,897
Hey! Pull!

217
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:21,898
Okay!

218
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:28,397
Then, the helicopter will peel off from the floor

219
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:32,898
and move all the way to the entrance of the room.

220
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,497
And if you pull the string with all your might

221
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:38,497
when the helicopter bumps into the door...

222
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:39,598
There!

223
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:45,497
See, you can retrieve the string too!

224
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:47,497
You're right.

225
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:51,097
As proof of that, on the floor near the card key,

226
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,798
there was white whipped cream, right?

227
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:55,798
Yeah.

228
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,097
That's because the whipped cream was on the skid

229
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:01,598
that's attached under the helicopter!

230
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:03,997
Because Saya's helicopter

231
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:07,898
fell onto the cake that Genta was about to eat!

232
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:15,197
But, Conan, the helicopter should still be in the room, right?

233
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:20,097
Yep, that's why Saya dropped her cap

234
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:21,797
as soon as she entered Kyona's room!

235
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:22,997
Huh?

236
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:25,397
She pretended to have missed putting her cap on the cap holder

237
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,997
and dropped it.

238
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:30,597
If she had double stick tape attached to the inside of her cap,

239
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:35,597
it should stay even if she put it on the cap holder.

240
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:40,597
So it's probably still there.

241
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:47,398
Inside her cap is the Petite Falcon used to commit the crime!

242
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:50,697
The string is still wound onto it too.

243
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:52,697
There seems to be no doubt about it.

244
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:54,297
Wrong!

245
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:55,797
I didn't do it!

246
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,097
That double stick tape

247
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,697
was originally on there so that the cap wouldn't fall out of place.

248
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:05,697
Right, so I think it coincidentally got stuck there

249
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,697
when I dropped my cap.

250
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,698
Then, why did you get on top of the table?

251
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,497
When I got the Petite Falcon

252
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:20,897
stuck to the ventilator of the air conditioner,

253
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:23,798
you got onto the table and took it off for me, right?

254
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:31,397
You're fantastic, just great!

255
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,698
Oh, come on, it's quite easy.

256
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:39,297
Oh no! It got stuck on the air conditioner.

257
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:42,298
I need a pole.

258
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:51,297
-Here you go! -Thank you!

259
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:55,997
Back then, there were teacups on the table,

260
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,897
so normally you wouldn't get on as is, right?

261
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:00,897
That's because...

262
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:03,198
Besides, right in front of you,

263
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,698
there was a self-photo taking pole too.

264
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:10,097
Self-photo taking pole?

265
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:12,797
Oh, a self-photo taking pole

266
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:15,297
is a pole where you attach the cell phone at the tip

267
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,297
and take a photo of yourself.

268
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:19,697
It's a convenient thing

269
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:21,897
where you can take pictures of yourself from a distance

270
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,098
if you extend the pole.

271
00:16:27,598 --> 00:16:31,597
If you misuse it, it could turn into a murder weapon.

272
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:36,097
Kyona's blog was full of self-photos of herself,

273
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:40,597
but Saya's blog had no self-taken photos whatsoever.

274
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:45,697
That's why that's probably Kyona's self-photo taking pole.

275
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:49,998
Will you please explain, Ms. Saya Kitami?

276
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:53,797
Why Kyona's self-photo taking pole

277
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:57,498
was smeared with blood and found in your room?

278
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:07,997
Why else?

279
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:11,097
That woman found out about my secret.

280
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,497
I used that pole that was in her room

281
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:17,197
to shut that blabber mouth up for good!

282
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,097
Secret?

283
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:24,498
See! That woman had the nerve to upload my secret on her blog!

284
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,597
By making it look as if she was introducing the comics that she liked!

285
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:32,997
Where's the secret?

286
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:37,698
Beside her face, see, it says "Hit and Run of Love"!

287
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,697
In Japanese, "hit and run" is a baseball term,

288
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,298
but in English...

289
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,497
It means to run someone over and flee. Correct?

290
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,297
Yes, that's right.

291
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:57,597
Two years ago, I ran someone over a drunk man,

292
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:01,397
I had it hidden all this time, and yet that woman...

293
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:04,798
she had the nerve to tell me this when I forced myself into her room.

294
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:12,997
Hey, just what's going on? You're an hour early?

295
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:15,297
Saya...

296
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:16,897
Where's Sakurako?

297
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,497
She's not here!

298
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,197
Just what're you doing?

299
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:22,797
I'm not doing anything!

300
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,497
Hey! Stop yelling!

301
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,797
Oh, I get it.

302
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:36,397
Did you figure it out the code in that photo of the comics?

303
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,597
And? What're you going to do about it?

304
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:39,797
Are you going to back off

305
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:41,797
from the blog ranking popularity competition

306
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:46,197
or bring everything to light?

307
00:18:46,198 --> 00:18:47,298
"Hit and Run of Love"

308
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,897
Maybe a shaved head will be more becoming on you than you think.

309
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:58,197
You may get an avalanche of offers for acting as a nun.

310
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:01,397
Then, you may become even more popular than you are now.

311
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:04,297
If so, it'd be thanks to me, right?

312
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:06,398
You'd better be grateful!

313
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:38,297
Saya, I don't think Kyona knew about the hit and run.

314
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:39,397
Huh?

315
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:41,997
But the photo...

316
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:44,797
she said it was the code of the comic book.

317
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,697
The thing that she coded was not the "Hit and Run"

318
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:53,597
but the one next to it, "To You".

319
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:55,197
Being as meticulous as she was,

320
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:58,397
only the series of that book was not placed in order,

321
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,198
and there were two copies of volume 11.

322
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,397
If you place the episodes

323
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:06,297
in order to the 50 sounds of the Japanese alphabet,

324
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:11,297
leaving only episode 29 in place, it reads,

325
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:14,798
"Saya is actually 29 years old!"

326
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:22,597
All she did was code that phrase to expose that

327
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:26,597
you were 5 years older than you claimed to be.

328
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:28,497
No.

329
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:32,297
But, since you were caught up in your past,

330
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,997
only the words "Hit and Run" caught your eye.

331
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:41,297
In baseball terms, the words "hit and run" mean a sink or swim play.

332
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:46,398
But I guess for you, it meant sinking into the wells of punishment?

333
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:30,297
Well, Dr. Agasa, a fantastic deduction as always!

334
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:31,597
You were indeed a great help!

335
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:33,398
Not at all.

336
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:38,197
By the way, Conan.

337
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:41,997
I'm surprised that you were acquainted with the Chief!

338
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:44,897
Huh? But the chief of the 1st Investigation Division

339
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:46,797
is Superintendant Matsumoto, right?

340
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:47,798
No, well...

341
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:54,598
I knew you'd help in solving the case.

342
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:05,398
After all, you're the wisdom bag of the Sleeping Kogoro.

343
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:11,097
Who are you?

344
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:15,197
I'm Hyoe Kuroda who has been appointed

345
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:18,997
as Chief of the 1st Investigation Division of MPD

346
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,197
in place of Superintendent Kiyonaga Matsumoto.

347
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:23,698
I am pleased to make your acquaintance.

348
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:26,997
Oh, what a polite greeting.

349
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:29,298
Same here.

350
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:35,997
Hello again.

351
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,498
Conan Edogawa.

352
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:52,897
There's no such thing as an ET.

353
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,697
There is! My Father who died said so!

354
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:57,898
It's an ET! Help!

355
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,097
There might be something behind last night's incident.

356
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:07,898
I guess it's show time for us.

357
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:13,798
Next Conan, "A Disappointing And Kind ET"
