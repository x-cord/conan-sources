1
00:00:01,328 --> 00:00:02,628
At Sera's invitation,

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:08,128
Ran, Sonoko, and I came to a rental villa deep in the mountains.

3
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:10,928
Fifteen years ago,

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:14,828
a tragic crime was committed in the vicinity of the villa,

5
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:17,128
by a killer called The Red Woman.

6
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:20,628
Sera had come in place of her older brother

7
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:23,028
to solve the weird phenomena occurring frequently

8
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:27,328
that have to do with the color red.

9
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,628
In the midst of all this...

10
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:34,528
Hey, what's this?

11
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:39,328
-Don't tell me? -Don't tell me?

12
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:55,628
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

13
00:00:55,628 --> 00:00:57,328
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

14
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:58,628
Is it fantasy or reality?

15
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,528
The silhouette of The Red Woman that even Sonoko saw!

16
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,128
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,028
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,528
His name is Detective Conan.

19
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:53,174
"The Tragedy of The Red Woman (Evil Spirit)"

20
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:01,574
Oh, thank you for coming.

21
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:02,674
How is it?

22
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,174
Yes, ma'am.

23
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:08,974
The victim is Mr. Masaie Hakuya, age 28.

24
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:11,974
He came with a few of his friends to this villa using his holiday leave.

25
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:15,774
They were all planning to spend a few days here.

26
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:19,474
Mr. Hakuya seems to have arrived at this rental villa in late afternoon.

27
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:23,474
After eating lunch, he split chores with his friends to clean the villa.

28
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:27,374
That's when he was killed.

29
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,274
After that, his friends who went to take a bath

30
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:35,074
seem to have found him sunk in the tub.

31
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:37,374
I see.

32
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:42,374
By the way, was the blood in the bath room the victim's?

33
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:43,974
Oh, no.

34
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,974
It was the blood of the boy who had come to this rental villa.

35
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:49,174
Boy?

36
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:52,174
Yes. That boy over there.

37
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:56,074
You people.

38
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:58,774
Rather, Conan, what's the matter?

39
00:03:58,774 --> 00:03:59,874
A nose bleed?

40
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,274
Yes.

41
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,474
I was so surprised when I see the corpse.

42
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:07,974
I'll bet you got excited at seeing Ran's naked?

43
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:09,974
Come on.

44
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,674
Frankly, she's right.

45
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:18,374
Is Hakuya dead?

46
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:32,074
The victim was most likely drowned in the bathwater

47
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:33,974
after being knocked unconscious

48
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:37,274
by a blow from a blunt object to the back of his head.

49
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:41,574
-"Jinsuke Ninda (29)" -Darn it! Why'd he have to be killed.

50
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:45,074
"Sumika Kawana (28)"

51
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:48,674
"Tamami Minegishi (28)"

52
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:51,774
The victim was cleaning, you said.

53
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:52,974
Yes.

54
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,574
He was cleaning this bath tub and the bathroom.

55
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:58,074
Every year when we come here,

56
00:04:58,074 --> 00:05:00,674
we each have fixed roles to carry out.

57
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:04,274
Sumika cleans the rooms and corridors.

58
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:08,374
Ninda does all our shopping most of the time,

59
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:12,374
Because the nearest store is about a kilometer away.

60
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:17,374
And, I'm in charge of making meals for everybody.

61
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:21,474
Well, after we finish doing our fixed roles,

62
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:24,374
we help the others out too.

63
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,474
If I only didn't go shopping

64
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:28,574
but helped Hakuya out instead,

65
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:30,574
this wouldn't have happened.

66
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:33,974
Then, when did you last see the victim?

67
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:35,174
After lunch,

68
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:37,774
he said he was going to clean the bath tub and bathroom,

69
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:40,874
I haven't seen him at all since.

70
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,774
When I looked into the bath room, he wasn't there.

71
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:46,674
You looked into the bath tub?

72
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,474
Yes.

73
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,674
I saw steam coming out from the bath tub

74
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:54,874
so I thought that Hakuya had filled the tub for us, that's why.

75
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:58,474
I looked into the bath room together with them..

76
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:01,074
Did you look into the bath tub back then too?

77
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,774
Yes. I opened the lid to check the temperature of the water.

78
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:10,574
But, back then there were no tomatoes floating in the tub.

79
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:15,274
After that I finished cleaning the rooms with Sonoko and Sumika,

80
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,574
we wanted to be the first ones to take a bath.

81
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:24,574
That's when Sumika found a lot of tomatoes in the tub.

82
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:26,874
After hearing about this,

83
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:29,374
Conan and I rushed over.

84
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:32,474
Then we found Hakuya's corpse in the tub

85
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,874
and pulled it out.

86
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,374
That also means that

87
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:40,474
you couldn't see the corpse until you pulled it up?

88
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:41,574
That right.

89
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:44,774
The entire surface was covered with tomatoes, you see.

90
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:48,274
And the water was green because of the bath salt too.

91
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,874
It seems that

92
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:55,074
the corpse was held down using a dumbbell so it wouldn't come afloat.

93
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:58,574
In other words, the killer, after sinking the corpse,

94
00:06:58,574 --> 00:07:01,174
filled the water with tomatoes

95
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:03,774
in order to keep the corpse out of sight.

96
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,974
In what order did you go in?

97
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:10,474
-What? -The order that you took a bath.

98
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:16,074
I think he's asking you in what order did you take a bath?

99
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:20,874
If the first one who took a bath had a bag of tomatoes,

100
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,974
that person could've put the tomatoes in the water, right?

101
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:27,674
Don't tell me that the kid's suspecting us?

102
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:31,074
The very first one was Sumika, right?

103
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:36,774
I think she went in with only a bath towel to open the lid of the tub.

104
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:37,974
Yes.

105
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:43,474
We'd all notice if someone was holding a bag full of that many tomatoes.

106
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:47,074
You get that, you precocious nose bleeding boy.

107
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:49,274
In any case,

108
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:52,274
that means the crime was committed between the time you finished cleaning,

109
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:58,874
came to check the temperature of the water and came to take a bath.

110
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:02,474
Can you tell me what the other two people were doing at this time?

111
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:04,274
Sure.

112
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:08,374
Like Tamami just mentioned I was out shopping.

113
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:10,274
To a store that's about a kilometer

114
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,674
and 15 minutes on foot from here.

115
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:15,274
We didn't have any beer and stuff so, you see.

116
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:19,274
On the way back, I happened to run into those two.

117
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:20,574
Is that right?

118
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:21,574
Yes.

119
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:25,474
He gave me cold drink so I drank it while walking back here.

120
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,674
I gave it to her right after I bought it,

121
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,774
because I met her in the forest right near the store.

122
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,274
Why were you two in the forest back then?

123
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:35,874
We had several things we wanted to check out, you see.

124
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:39,074
That's why I was going around the forest.

125
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:40,574
Then, what about you, Tamami?

126
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:44,974
What? I was cleaning the used dishes

127
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:48,074
and preparing dinner.

128
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:49,174
Alone?

129
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:52,374
Yes. I was alone in the kitchen.

130
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:55,674
Then, you have no alibi.

131
00:08:55,674 --> 00:09:00,374
But, I talked to those two with the kitchen door between us.

132
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,074
-Is that right? -Yes.

133
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,674
We were cleaning the living room

134
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:06,674
in front of the kitchen back then, you see.

135
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:10,774
Tamami asked us what we'd like for dinner.

136
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:13,874
We also asked her if she needed help,

137
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:17,174
she said that it's fine...

138
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:20,174
I'm sure she was in the kitchen.

139
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:21,274
I see.

140
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:24,474
Sumika was also there back then too, correct?

141
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:29,074
No, Sumika was cleaning upstairs alone.

142
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:31,874
I thought it'd be faster if we cleaned together,

143
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:34,774
so I went to the living room to call them.

144
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,274
After that, we continued cleaning together, the three of us.

145
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:43,574
It's true that Sumika was cleaning upstairs until that time too.

146
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:45,374
Because we heard the loud sound of the vacuum cleaner

147
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:49,474
as well as the parts of it hitting the walls and stuff.

148
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,374
If so...

149
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,274
The one who was capable of committing the crime

150
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:58,874
while you three, Sumika, Ran and Sonoko were cleaning

151
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:03,574
is Tamami who was in the kitchen alone at this time.

152
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,374
Wait!

153
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:11,174
I was really in the kitchen till Ninda came back from shopping!

154
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:13,374
I don't think Tamami could've done it, though.

155
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:16,274
-What? -The only place I cleaned with them

156
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:18,474
was the first floor where the bathroom is.

157
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:23,074
Since Tamami knows that I always thoroughly clean the corridors,

158
00:10:23,074 --> 00:10:25,974
I don't think she'd risk killing somebody on the first floor.

159
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:27,274
Besides...

160
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:30,974
Tamami's not that type of person.

161
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,774
Then, who on earth?

162
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:35,674
Who else?

163
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,874
The one who killed Hakuya.

164
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,674
The Red Woman.

165
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:42,174
Who else could it be but her?

166
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:58,104
The Red Woman?

167
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,504
You mean of 15 years ago?

168
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:00,704
Yes.

169
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:02,104
Fifteen years ago,

170
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:05,404
that red devil who committed murder

171
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:07,404
at a nearby rental villa.

172
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:11,404
She must have been hiding in the forest somewhere.

173
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,704
The one who cracked the window of this rental villa

174
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:17,704
and threw in a lot of apples inside.

175
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:23,504
The one who stuck a lot of red rose petals in the hot water tank

176
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:26,604
and splashed red paint onto the door.

177
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:32,004
Were all the works of The Red Woman.

178
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:37,404
But, why did Hakuya have to fall victim to The Red Woman?

179
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,404
The killer's a murderer you know!

180
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:42,004
How the hell can you ever understand

181
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,404
what's going on inside the mind of a psycho?

182
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:47,604
Back then, the front door wasn't locked.

183
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:51,404
The Red Woman doesn't know about Sumika's cleaning habit,

184
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:54,604
sneaked in without being seen by anyone

185
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:56,704
and killed Hakuya!

186
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:58,804
She made us try to think of her

187
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:02,404
by putting a lot of red tomatoes in the tub!

188
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:08,704
That's impossible.

189
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:11,404
The death of the murderer called The Red Woman,

190
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:15,604
Komayo Takeno, has already been confirmed.

191
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:16,804
What?

192
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:20,304
But, in the news program that was aired the other day,

193
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:22,704
they said she was still on the run.

194
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:24,604
Three years after that incident,

195
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:29,404
do you know that a girl's body was found in the swamp of this forest?

196
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:30,904
Yes.

197
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:33,304
That's Satoko.

198
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,704
She was our classmate.

199
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,004
I see.

200
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:40,804
The fact is, another skeleton

201
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:44,404
thought to be killed three years before that was also found then.

202
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:48,004
Since the murder weapon knife was also found on the ground then,

203
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:52,404
we kind of figured that it was Takeno's body but...

204
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,904
Takeno had set fire to her house before committing the crime

205
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:58,204
and all her belongings went up in flames,

206
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:02,304
therefore, we couldn't do a DNA match on her for quite some time.

207
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:06,504
But, we found that Takeno's mother who died last week,

208
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:10,104
had secretly kept her umbilical cord.

209
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:13,704
So, after we did a DNA search of the bone marrow of the skeleton,

210
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:15,604
it turned out to be a perfect match.

211
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:21,504
That's why The Red Woman disappeared a long time ago already.

212
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:25,904
This was scheduled to be announced to the media tomorrow.

213
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,704
Since this case was of interest to many,

214
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:29,804
the Nagano Prefectural Police Department

215
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:32,504
is going haywires trying to handle this case.

216
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:35,904
Then... Then, who is the killer?

217
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:40,804
Don't tell me it's the ghost of The Red Woman or something?

218
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:42,404
Up against a ghost,

219
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,604
my bat for self-protection doesn't have a chance.

220
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:50,304
I hope you're going to protect us all, Ms. Police Detective.

221
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:53,004
Well, calm down.

222
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,904
Will all three of you

223
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:58,604
wait in your rooms until the investigation is over?

224
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:03,904
I see.

225
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:07,404
So, this is the bat you brought to confront The Red Woman?

226
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:08,904
Yes.

227
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,404
I brought it along so that I could use it to shoo away

228
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:14,404
the one who was doing the pranks at this rental villa too, though.

229
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,204
And, how about it?

230
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:19,404
There're no visible marks on it

231
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:21,804
or luminol reaction detected on it either.

232
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:25,104
This isn't the murder weapon that was used to strike the victim to death.

233
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:27,104
-But... -But?

234
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:29,104
There seems to have been something stuck on to it

235
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:31,404
and it's a bit sticky.

236
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,904
Did you do anything to it?

237
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,804
No, nothing in particular.

238
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,504
Hey.

239
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:39,204
Why's there a fan in this room

240
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:41,304
when the air conditioners running?

241
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:42,304
Beats me.

242
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:45,704
Maybe a guest that doesn't like air conditioners

243
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:48,304
took it out of storage and let it out?

244
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,704
Officer Uehara.

245
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:51,204
Anything?

246
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:52,604
Well.

247
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:54,804
What?

248
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:56,504
The murder weapon is that dumbbell?

249
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,804
The thing that kept the corpse underwater in the tub?

250
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:02,604
Yes. Judging from the wound and the way the skull caved in,

251
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:04,804
it's probably the weapon.

252
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,304
-Anything from Inspector Yamato? -Hey, Conan.

253
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:08,904
No, not yet.

254
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:11,704
What is it?

255
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,304
What do you think?

256
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:16,004
That's...

257
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:17,204
But, why?

258
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:20,904
Also, snatched this tomato from the site.

259
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:22,704
I get it.

260
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,404
Don't want to try it out?

261
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:26,604
Yes! Of course.

262
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:32,204
Just as I thought.

263
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:35,404
Yes. No doubt about it.

264
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,404
So, the killer is.

265
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:38,804
Yes.

266
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,704
Most probably.

267
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:49,704
Oh, no. It's started to rain.

268
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:52,104
It sure looks like The Red Woman's going to appear.

269
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:54,404
Hey, cut it out

270
00:15:58,904 --> 00:15:59,904
What?

271
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:02,604
I thought I saw a woman with long hair

272
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:05,604
standing outside the window right now.

273
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:08,704
Cut it out! That's enough!

274
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:10,404
Black out?

275
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,104
What's wrong?

276
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:17,504
Did somebody just go by?

277
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:18,704
Yes.

278
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,204
What? Who is it?

279
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,904
Tamami? Ninda?

280
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:40,904
What's with this black out?

281
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:45,104
Who is it?

282
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,704
Rather, you shouldn't be leaving your room until told to.

283
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:55,104
Where's Sumika's room?

284
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:56,204
This way!

285
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,604
Hey, are you okay?

286
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:10,304
Who did this to you?

287
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:12,904
Red woman.

288
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,004
Red woman?

289
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,004
No way possible, right?

290
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:22,904
Her death's been confirmed.

291
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:24,504
But...

292
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:26,204
After the black out,

293
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:29,204
somebody was tapping on the window.

294
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:30,604
So, I opened the window.

295
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:34,904
A woman with long hair was there.

296
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:37,904
And suddenly came slashing at me with a knife.

297
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:40,204
When I tried to flee, she slashed my back.

298
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:45,204
Are you sure she was The Red Woman?

299
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:47,504
Did you see her face?

300
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:49,004
No I didn't.

301
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:52,104
It was dark so all I saw was a silhouette.

302
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,604
But if she had long hair and was holding a knife...

303
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:57,804
Isn't she The Red Woman?

304
00:17:57,804 --> 00:17:59,504
Sumika!

305
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:02,104
What's wrong?

306
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:03,804
I'll treat her

307
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:06,504
so will you help me take her to the living room?

308
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:09,404
And let's all gather in the living room

309
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,904
until the lights come back on again.

310
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:15,604
Besides, it's dangerous to go off on your own in this dark.

311
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:19,004
It's cut with something sharp.

312
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:20,704
The wound looks shallow, though.

313
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:23,104
Get me some disinfectant, Ran.

314
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:24,404
Yes, sure

315
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:28,604
Hey. Is this whole area really having a black out?

316
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:29,804
Yes.

317
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:32,404
A thunder bolt seems to have fallen on the substation.

318
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:35,204
It's going to take some time till it recovers.

319
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:37,104
You mean the killer attacked taking advantage

320
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:39,404
of this coincidental black out?

321
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,604
It'll sting a bit.

322
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,804
Okay.

323
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:48,304
But, is it true that The Red Woman attacked you?

324
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:50,704
Yes. This wound is proof positive.

325
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:53,504
But... she's dead, isn't she?

326
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:57,304
Don't tell me that the umbilical cord used

327
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,304
for the DNA test was somebody else's?

328
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,704
No way.

329
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:03,704
Her relatives also testified that her mother

330
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:09,404
had been refusing to submit the umbilical cord to the police,

331
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:12,504
because she didn't want to believe that her daughter was dead.

332
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:17,104
Only, if so, there are several unexplainable points.

333
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:19,004
Unexplainable points?

334
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,804
The villa burglaries.

335
00:19:20,804 --> 00:19:22,404
From about ten years ago,

336
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:25,904
we've been receiving reports

337
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:28,604
of victimized rental villas near here.

338
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:30,904
It's not pranks like what you mentioned a while ago

339
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:37,304
like windows being cracked and things being thrown in.

340
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:40,704
Somebody breaks the locks of the villas open

341
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:43,704
and secretly lives there for some time.

342
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:46,804
Testimonials of people having seen eerie silhouettes in the forest

343
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:48,904
have also been reported.

344
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:50,804
That's why the Nagano Prefectural Police Department,

345
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:53,204
couldn't conclude for sure

346
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:56,604
that the skeleton found in the swamp was actually The Red Woman.

347
00:19:56,604 --> 00:20:00,704
Then the person that I saw by the window was.

348
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:03,504
-Sonoko. -You saw it? When?

349
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:04,804
Where did you see it?

350
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,104
Before the black out.

351
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:10,704
Right outside that window. It was there.

352
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:13,304
Behind the trees.

353
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:16,804
She was looking this way with her neck tilted.

354
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:20,604
The woman with the long hair.

355
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,804
It's that woman.

356
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:35,104
She's the one who attacked me.

357
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:38,404
No way. Does she really exist?

358
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,904
The evil spirit of The Red Woman?

359
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:45,604
Let's hurry and get out of here, everybody.

360
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:49,504
That's right!

361
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:53,504
Otherwise, we'll all end up like Hakuya.

362
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:56,204
There're no such things.

363
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:58,404
Evil spirits or goblins.

364
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:00,704
Witches or wizards.

365
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:04,404
They all belong to the world of fantasy.

366
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:08,204
Not even one of them exists in this world.

367
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:11,604
Right, Conan?

368
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,504
Oh. Yes.

369
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:15,404
So, rest assured.

370
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:16,504
Even if there were to be somebody,

371
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:18,704
that person is a mere human.

372
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:24,104
It's somebody who can be controlled by my Jeet Kune Do and Ran's Karate.

373
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:26,004
Yes.

374
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:28,304
It's been on my mind for some time,

375
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:30,004
but who's talking?

376
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:34,104
You don't look to be a mere classmate of Ran's.

377
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:37,204
I'm sorry I haven't introduced myself.

378
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,104
I'm Masumi Sera.

379
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:42,004
A high school girl detective, I guess you could say?

380
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:45,804
She's our classmate, Sera's younger sister,

381
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,804
and we called her here along with her friends,

382
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:52,604
to solve the eerie occurrences happening in this rental villa.

383
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,504
He tells us that he's busy and can't make it

384
00:21:55,504 --> 00:22:01,404
but his younger sister who came back from the States may have time to.

385
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,004
Really? You've come back from the States?

386
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:05,004
Yes.

387
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:07,804
I've been living in the States since three years ago but...

388
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:11,604
I got homesick for Japan and returned.

389
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:18,804
In order to meet again with the magician.

390
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:49,404
Maybe there's really is something in the forest...

391
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:51,504
Hiding out there.

392
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:54,804
End up like Satoko and Hakuya.

393
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:57,404
The evil spirit of The Red Woman is going to kill us.

394
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:03,904
Nobody's going to be killed.

395
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:07,404
The evil spirit of The Red Woman that you're all talking about

396
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,904
doesn't exist

397
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:11,404
Next Conan,

398
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:15,404
"The Tragedy of The Red Woman (Revenge)"
