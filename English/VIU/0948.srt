1
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:13,065
Welcome to...

2
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:17,365
"Tatsuki Naito (29), Host" -the Beika Dinosaur Museum show.

3
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:21,565
Today's performance features two stars of the Cretaceous era:

4
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:25,566
Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops.

5
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:31,766
Enjoy the show, everyone.

6
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,866
Here you go.

7
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:42,265
We give these out to everyone who attends the show.

8
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:43,266
Thank you.

9
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,065
"Nobuhisa Shida (55), Director" -It's only once a day,

10
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:47,165
so enjoy yourselves.

11
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,565
Here you go.

12
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:49,766
Thank you.

13
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,565
Oh, no!

14
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,365
Tyrannosaurus is on a rampage!

15
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,366
Be careful, everyone!

16
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,166
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

17
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:13,666
Looks like Triceratops has come to stop him!

18
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,465
Are you okay?

19
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:18,865
Are you hurt?

20
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,465
-I'm fine. -Sorry for scaring you.

21
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:22,666
It's okay.

22
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:28,966
The eternal rivals, Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops!

23
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,665
Who will win?

24
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,466
It's the showdown of the century!

25
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,965
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

26
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,065
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

27
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:43,865
An intense battle between two dinosaurs.

28
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,865
What will happen at the end of their fight?

29
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,265
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:49,165
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,066
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:38,844
"The Man Crushed by a Dinosaur."

33
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,333
That was so intense.

34
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,433
Yes, it was very exciting.

35
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,233
It was scary, though.

36
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:48,733
Were you hurt?

37
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:52,333
Nope. The host helped me.

38
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:56,233
Anyway, those were rather realistic dinosaurs.

39
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:58,033
Yeah.

40
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,133
What was that?

41
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:02,734
It sounded like something rather large collapsing.

42
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:08,333
Oh, no. What should I do?

43
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:11,033
Miss, what happened?

44
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,834
"Yua Katsuragawa (26), Clerk" -The dinosaur fossil inside...

45
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,033
It's an emergency!

46
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:20,833
The dinosaur bones fell apart!

47
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,933
Get the director!

48
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,033
Got it!

49
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:27,233
"Yoshito Kuchiki (35), Curator" -I don't believe it!

50
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,933
My Brachiosaurus!

51
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,533
Gosh. How did this happen?

52
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,933
There's a person!

53
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,733
There's someone crushed underneath it!

54
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,733
Hurry! We need to get them out quickly!

55
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,234
Yeah...

56
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:41,833
The director...

57
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,533
That's the director!

58
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,734
What?

59
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,834
What's this?

60
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,234
"Beika Dinosaur Museum."

61
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:07,033
He was crushed by a dinosaur.

62
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:09,133
It's hard to believe.

63
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:12,533
Stay away from the crime scene, kids.

64
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:15,333
Officer Takagi, was this an accident?

65
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:17,333
Oh, actually...

66
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,233
We don't know anything yet.

67
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:24,233
You're saying this second exhibition hall was closed the whole time?

68
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,633
Yes.

69
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:27,633
The exhibition isn't for a while.

70
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:31,133
All the exhibits were under construction.

71
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:35,133
We were in the middle of temporarily assembling this Brachiosaurus.

72
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:39,433
The director was just assigned to this museum last month.

73
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:41,533
He was rather excited about it.

74
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:44,533
It's possible he came to check on the exhibits.

75
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:47,433
I can't believe he got caught in this accident.

76
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,633
Actually, about that...

77
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:53,833
We determined the wires supporting the fossil

78
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,633
were cut by someone.

79
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:59,134
-What? -They were cut?

80
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,033
You're right.

81
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:05,433
So were these. And these.

82
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:09,133
But it would take a lot of time to cut all these wires.

83
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,933
Yes. That's why we believe

84
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:14,633
the culprit cut most of the wires beforehand,

85
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:19,533
and cut the last one when the director arrived.

86
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:21,733
The tool we believe was used to cut the wires

87
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:25,233
was right next to the collapsed fossil.

88
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:28,233
According to reception and security,

89
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:33,133
nobody entered or exited the building or grounds

90
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:35,133
before or after the fossil collapsed.

91
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:39,333
Which means one of us...

92
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,534
Murdered Director Shida?

93
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:45,433
Murdered?

94
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:48,533
Agasa, take those children somewhere else.

95
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,933
Sorry. Come on, let's go.

96
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,533
-We shouldn't get in the way of the police. -What?

97
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:57,333
What were each of you doing when the fossil collapsed?

98
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,933
The host had nothing to do with it.

99
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:02,533
He was onstage the whole time.

100
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,334
Yeah. Thanks, miss.

101
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,434
"Beika Dinosaur Museum."

102
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,234
Isn't this...

103
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:21,533
I see.

104
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:27,233
Yua Katsuragawa, you were alone in the office the whole time?

105
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:28,433
Yes.

106
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:29,933
And Kuchiki?

107
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:32,833
I was in the museum's prep room.

108
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:36,534
I was preparing the fossils for display... alone.

109
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:41,834
Which means the two of you don't have alibis.

110
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:46,833
Inspector, I think I know who the culprit is.

111
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,333
What?

112
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:52,933
Kuchiki, are you saying I did it?

113
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,033
Yeah, that's right. You did it.

114
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,833
It was obviously you.

115
00:07:56,834 --> 00:08:00,333
Hold on. Why do you think she did it?

116
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:03,033
-Because Director Shida... -Kuchiki!

117
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:06,533
Some things shouldn't be said.

118
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:09,033
The police will find out during their investigation anyway.

119
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:13,234
The director was trying to make her his.

120
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:18,833
Katsuragawa, is that true?

121
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:22,634
It's true. My mother's been ill.

122
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:26,533
When I talked to the director about it,

123
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:30,034
he said he'd pay her medical bills if I became his girlfriend.

124
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:34,034
Director Shida was an awful person.

125
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:37,833
But I didn't do it!

126
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:42,433
Besides, I'm not the only one who wanted to kill him!

127
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:45,434
Kuchiki, you hated the director!

128
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:48,333
Naito, you knew, didn't you?

129
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:51,433
I... Well, yeah.

130
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,133
That's right.

131
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:58,934
That man... When Shida became the director the museum...

132
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:03,533
Fossil exhibits?

133
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:07,033
We need flashier events that will attract more guests.

134
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:10,033
We're going to put on a show that will draw tons of kids.

135
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,533
But, sir,

136
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:14,433
these plesiosaur fossils are academically significant...

137
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,033
Shut up!

138
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,334
It's just worthless garbage!

139
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:20,934
Throw it all away!

140
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:27,533
Yeah, I hated him.

141
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,933
But it wasn't me!

142
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:32,333
Let's all calm down.

143
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,633
We'll talk to each of you in greater detail.

144
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,133
Katsuragawa, you're first.

145
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:39,334
-This way. -Okay.

146
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:49,533
Kuchiki, I'm sorry about your fossils.

147
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:50,834
Don't touch me!

148
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:53,934
That hurts!

149
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,434
"Beika Dinosaur Museum."

150
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,733
I was so close to showing everyone.

151
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,833
Mister.

152
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,633
Oh, it's you kids.

153
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:16,734
You really like dinosaurs.

154
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:22,533
I've thought about them my whole life.

155
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,933
I understand how you feel.

156
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:29,733
Just imagining these incredible animals

157
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:34,634
walking the earth millions of years ago excites me.

158
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:40,133
Yeah. Long before we were born,

159
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:43,533
these guys were really walking around.

160
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:45,233
It's nice, isn't it?

161
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:48,033
They're not like your show!

162
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:51,633
It's true. My show just uses costumes.

163
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:55,634
But like you, I wanted everyone to enjoy them.

164
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,233
It's just a sham.

165
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:01,333
I want people to see the real thing.

166
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,133
I take pride in my work.

167
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:07,933
That's no reason to accuse someone of murder.

168
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,433
Yua, did it go okay?

169
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:14,333
Yes. The office Katsuragawa

00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:16,333
was in the back of the staff room.

171
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:18,533
We learned it would've been impossible

172
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,433
for her to leave around the time of the incident

173
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:23,133
without being noticed by the other staff.

174
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:25,533
That's right, I'm innocent.

175
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:29,834
Which means the only suspicious person is you, Kuchiki.

176
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:33,533
Me? That's enough!

177
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:35,033
Now, now.

178
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:39,233
Kuchiki, we found several pieces of evidence.

179
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:40,734
Evidence?

180
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,945
"Director's Office" -This was inside...

181
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:58,045
the trash can.

182
00:11:58,046 --> 00:11:59,545
"We need to talk.

183
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:04,646
Come to the Brachiosaurus in exhibition hall 2. From Kuchiki."

184
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:10,445
See, Kuchiki? It was you.

185
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:13,645
I've never seen that. I didn't send that letter.

186
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,245
Stop making excuses!

187
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:17,145
Yua, calm down.

188
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:19,845
You've done enough. I'll take over.

189
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:25,345
Kuchiki, you cut several of the wires beforehand.

190
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:29,345
You went to get the director when the show started.

191
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:34,446
Then you went to the exhibition hall and cut the last wire.

192
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,946
No! I didn't do it!

193
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:42,445
Do you know what this is?

194
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:45,045
That's a fossil coating agent.

195
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:47,045
A coating agent?

196
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:51,245
Yes. According to forensics, it's a type of resin.

197
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:57,046
It's used to preserve fossils because it's highly transparent.

198
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:00,745
See? Like this.

199
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,745
Hey, that's the same as the ones we got.

200
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:04,746
-Yes. -Yeah.

201
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:07,845
This was spilled on the floor of the crime scene.

202
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,045
What?

203
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:13,245
According to forensics, it was spilled rather recently.

204
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:17,545
Kuchiki, you use this liquid regularly, don't you?

205
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,845
Yes, but...

206
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:23,246
You can tell us more in another room.

207
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:29,345
I can't believe he did it.

208
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:30,645
It's a shame.

209
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:34,046
I thought only good people liked dinosaurs.

210
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:37,946
What's this?

211
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:45,945
The director's office...

212
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:48,245
Exhibition hall 2...

213
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,146
The central event hall...

214
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:02,945
What's going on with Conan?

215
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:08,145
He's probably thinking about that dinosaur show.

216
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:12,345
Him, too? It was really intense.

217
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:14,245
They're the same.

218
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:18,045
Huh? Ayumi, your clothes are dirty.

219
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,345
Huh?

220
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:21,646
You're right. When did that happen?

221
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,546
Let's see...

222
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:28,745
I found it.

223
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:31,145
Conan, is this it?

224
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:32,745
I knew it.

225
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,045
Nice work, Genta.

226
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:36,546
No problem.

227
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,345
Agasa, again?

228
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:47,945
Inspector Megure, are you sure Kuchiki is the culprit?

229
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:50,145
Yes. He has no alibi,

230
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,045
and he left something at the crime scene.

231
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:56,945
The thing is, I find that hard to believe.

232
00:14:56,946 --> 00:15:00,645
Kuchiki has spent his life researching dinosaurs,

233
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:03,845
and loves them from the bottom of his heart.

234
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:07,345
I can't imagine him destroying that.

235
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:10,945
So you're saying someone else did it.

236
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:15,645
But everyone else in the museum has an alibi.

237
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:19,245
Yes, especially the show's host Naito.

238
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:22,846
You could say your alibi is perfect.

239
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:28,245
The dinosaur show was really fun.

240
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:29,445
Thanks.

241
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:32,545
You were onstage the whole time.

242
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:34,445
Huh? Yeah.

243
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:38,945
But you were only seen onstage

244
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:41,246
for a few seconds, right?

245
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:49,446
Naito was first seen at the start of the show.

246
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:55,445
Welcome to the Beika Dinosaur Museum show.

247
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:59,845
What if he had exited the stage immediately afterwards

248
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:02,346
and gone to the director's office?

249
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:08,545
You mean you think I did it?

250
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:11,945
But I was commentating the whole time.

251
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:14,745
Your headset is wireless.

252
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:18,845
You could've gone to the director's office while speaking.

253
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:21,645
These two truly are eternal rivals!

254
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:24,845
Tyrannosaurus rex, king of the carnivores!

255
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:28,246
Triceratops, behemoth of the herbivores!

256
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:36,245
Please! I didn't go to the director's office.

257
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,645
Isn't there only one show a day?

258
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:41,045
What?

259
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,146
There was a lot of confetti.

260
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:47,946
We found one piece in the hallway in front of the director's office.

261
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:52,846
Maybe it fell after getting stuck to you.

262
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:58,246
You returned to the stage shortly afterwards.

263
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:05,745
By briefly showing yourself,

264
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:08,045
you gave the audience the impression

265
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:11,045
that you were onstage the whole time.

266
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:13,545
You disappeared into the smoke

267
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:15,545
and exited the stage once again.

268
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:17,645
This time you went outside

269
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,945
and headed to the rear entrance of exhibition hall 2,

270
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:22,346
where the fossils were kept.

271
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,645
Naito, aren't you in the middle of a show?

272
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:34,545
Oh, no! Triceratops is in trouble!

273
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:38,845
Everyone, grant him your strength!

274
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:41,945
Cheer for him as loudly as you can!

275
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,845
You can do it!

276
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,146
Triceratops!

277
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,746
Don't let him beat you!

278
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:59,145
You used the sound effects of the dinosaur show

279
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,645
to mask the sound of the falling fossil.

280
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:04,745
After spilling the coating agent on the floor,

281
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:08,045
you returned to the stage and ended the show.

282
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,445
You're making it up.

283
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,545
There were pieces of fossil

284
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:15,845
near the rear entrance of the exhibition hall.

285
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:21,445
They must've stuck to the bottom of your shoe

286
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:23,446
when you stepped on them before falling there.

287
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,845
You're the one who used my dinosaurs to kill the director?

288
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:32,445
No! I didn't do it.

289
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,845
The fossils collapsed after the show ended.

290
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:38,745
Right, kids?

291
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:44,045
See? It's just his imagination that I killed him.

292
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:47,446
Hey, isn't this your show costume?

293
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:52,945
There was a sound system remote in the pocket.

294
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,945
You used this to play the sound of it falling

295
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:57,446
after the show ended.

296
00:18:58,646 --> 00:18:59,845
What was that?

297
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:03,345
It sounded like something rather large collapsing.

298
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:07,845
To make us think the fossil had fallen in that moment.

299
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,245
I see.

300
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:11,045
Call forensics.

301
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:13,445
Have them examine the director's office

302
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:14,745
and the rear entrance to the exhibition hall.

303
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:17,345
-Yes, sir! -Naito.

304
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:20,846
We're going to examine the bottoms of your shoes.

305
00:19:21,846 --> 00:19:23,545
It was perfect.

306
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,345
Perfect.

307
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,045
So why?

308
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,245
Because...

309
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,845
you were acting a little weird.

310
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:32,846
What?

311
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:34,945
You suddenly defended the clerk

312
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:37,645
and explained Kuchiki's actions.

313
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,445
It's because you were eager

314
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:43,446
to frame Kuchiki according to your plan, right?

315
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:46,945
One other thing.

316
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:50,545
There's a stain on your costume's pocket.

317
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:54,545
You kept the coating agent in your pocket.

318
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:58,345
For whatever reason, it leaked.

319
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:03,345
When you helped Ayumi up during the show,

320
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:06,546
you created a stain on her clothes, too.

321
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:13,146
I see. So that's how it is.

322
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,845
Naito, why?

323
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:19,846
Why did you do this?

324
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:32,146
Director Shida was going to kill me.

325
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:37,645
Shida and I were actually working together.

326
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:42,545
I used the money I had to help him acquire this museum.

327
00:20:42,546 --> 00:20:45,745
But once he became director,

328
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,646
he said he wouldn't pay me back.

329
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:50,946
On top of that...

330
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:03,545
You hurt your right arm then.

331
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:04,845
Yeah.

332
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,745
So I killed him before he could kill me!

333
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:12,945
Then this museum would become mine!

334
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:15,445
Then...

335
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:16,746
Darn it!

336
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:19,346
Darn it!

337
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:45,045
What an awful case.

338
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:48,845
They were fighting over the same prey,

339
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:51,645
like a couple of savage dinosaurs.

340
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,745
-You're wrong. -What?

341
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:55,745
Not even the most savage dinosaur

342
00:22:55,746 --> 00:22:58,345
would pursue its prey so recklessly.

343
00:22:58,346 --> 00:23:00,645
They attack when they're hungry.

344
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:04,245
They attack in order to survive.

345
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:08,046
Only humans attack others for their own gain.

346
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:13,645
-Hey. -Ai.

347
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:16,846
Just kidding. I saw it on TV yesterday.

348
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:24,445
I feel hungry all of a sudden.

349
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,545
Doc, buy me a hamburger.

350
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:29,145
What a good idea! I'd like sushi.

351
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:30,845
I want a chocolate parfait.

352
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:33,445
Wait, wait. I never said I'd buy anything.

353
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,945
-What? -I'm not buying you anything no matter what you say.

354
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:38,245
They certainly have the appetites of dinosaurs.

355
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:40,346
Gonna eat ya.

356
00:23:42,846 --> 00:23:46,245
"Next Episode" -I hope they decide to use it.

357
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:48,445
Just kidding.

358
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:50,346
"Challenging All Cops and Detectives."

359
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:53,845
Throw it back on the balcony!

360
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:55,745
Including the food scraps!

361
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:59,445
That's how he made someone else do the killing.

362
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:02,345
Manipulating another so he wouldn't get his own hands dirty!

363
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:06,746
You have to save me, Mouri!

364
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,145
Next Conan,

365
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:12,846
