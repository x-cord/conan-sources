1
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:04,448
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:05,648
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:07,348
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:08,848
Today's episode is made up of two parts.

5
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:10,648
You need to deduce twice as much as usual.

6
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:12,148
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:13,748
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:15,948
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:58,922
A new member of the Black Organization has made his move.

10
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:01,223
His code name is Bourbon.

11
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:04,023
Is he after Ai?

12
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,623
The members of the Youth Detective Squad

13
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:07,423
are asked by Kaito Sugiura

14
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:10,623
to check on one of the residents of the apartment

15
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:14,222
who acts suspiciously every night.

16
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:16,923
But when we got there, we found that the apartment has gone to ashes.

17
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:20,123
In Kaito's burnt diary, the three residents of the apartment

18
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:21,623
are referred to as their nicknames,

19
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:25,923
Red Person, White Person and Yellow Person.

20
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,623
It says that the Yellow Person

21
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:29,923
is the one who was acting suspicious.

22
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:31,523
The person who set fire to the apartment

23
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:33,723
is most likely the Yellow Person as well.

24
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,023
I, Kuroshiro,

25
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:44,023
will now reveal the truth as clear as black and white.

26
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:46,423
As well as which one among them

27
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:49,923
is the yellow arsonist.

28
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:56,023
"Conan VS Double Code Mystery"

29
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:00,623
Just what is this Yellow Arsonist all about?

30
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:03,923
I heard you saying something about a diary too.

31
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:07,723
Well. It's the diary of Kaito, the son of the landlord of this apartment

32
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:09,723
that was burned down by fire.

33
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,223
It is written in the diary

34
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:15,523
that the Yellow Person suddenly came back in the middle of night

35
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:17,923
and had an argument with his father.

36
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:20,823
"Ryuhei Hosoi (25), Carpenter" -All three of you were out

37
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:21,923
"Subaru Okiya (27), Postgraduate Student" -on the night of the fire,

38
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,123
and came back in the morning.

39
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:24,723
"Ginya Makabe (29), Freelancer" -Right?

40
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:27,823
That means someone's lying!

41
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:30,623
That liar, the Yellow Guy,

42
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:33,123
is the one who set fire to the apartment!

43
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:36,523
It's true that I know the landlord's son.

44
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:39,923
Was anyone of us called the Yellow Person by him?

45
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:41,223
I wonder, too.

46
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:44,823
It's just words from a child, so don't worry about it.

47
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:51,023
You shouldn't tell anyone about the Yellow Person.

48
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,023
What? Why not?

49
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,423
If they find out that the Yellow Person is the arsonist,

50
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:59,823
they might all claim that they're not the one, right?

51
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,623
-I get it now. -I see.

52
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:05,523
No. That's nothing to worry about.

53
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:10,023
Because I already know which one among the three

54
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:12,023
is the yellow arsonist.

55
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:13,123
What?

56
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,323
Hey, kid. Are you serious?

57
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,423
Yes.

58
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,523
Ayumi, can you lend me that diary?

59
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:19,523
Okay.

60
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,323
Red Person and White Person

61
00:04:21,323 --> 00:04:24,023
are mentioned in Kaito's diary too.

62
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:27,223
So if we figure out who the Red and White Person are,

63
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:30,223
we'll be able to find out who the Yellow Person is.

64
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:32,923
So there's a Red Person and a White Person too?

65
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:36,323
Yes. It's written in the diary.

66
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:38,723
"The weather's been bad since this morning.

67
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:41,723
I've got to go to school soon,

68
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:44,223
but I'm sure the Red Person can sleep in today."

69
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:47,923
This hints that the Red Person does something every morning,

70
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:49,823
but since it was raining that morning,

71
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,323
he didn't have to do it, right?

72
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:55,323
What do you think that is?

73
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:57,223
He didn't have to hang the laundry.

74
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,923
Field day is cancelled if it rains!

75
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:02,323
Adults don't have field days.

76
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:04,023
It's sprinkling water.

77
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,923
Watering the flowers.

78
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:07,323
Oh, I see!

79
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,623
Yeah!

80
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,223
That's why the Red Person is the one

81
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:13,623
who said that he waters the plants of the apartment every day.

82
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,623
Mr. Okiya.

83
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:20,923
But kid, why did he call the man the Red Person?

84
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:25,423
Well, you found a lot of toy cars in Kaito's room, didn't you?

85
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:28,723
I'm sure that Kaito loves cars.

86
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:30,423
When you think of a red car,

87
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:32,823
the first thing that comes to mind is...

88
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:35,123
A fire engine...

89
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:40,523
I see. Kaito saw the man watering the plants with a hose,

90
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:42,523
then connected him to a fire engine,

91
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:45,523
and named him the Red Person.

92
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:49,323
So is the White Person named in connection with a white car?

93
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:52,623
But there are so many white cars around.

94
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:54,023
It's an ambulance.

95
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:56,423
In Japan, the colour of the vehicle

96
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,023
is determined by the Road Trucking Vehicle Law.

97
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:00,423
I see...

98
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:03,723
But which one of them is the ambulance?

99
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:06,223
What does an ambulance do?

100
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:08,323
Carry wounded people from place to place.

101
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:11,023
The paramedics give treatment in the car too.

102
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:13,223
Oh, I get it!

103
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:15,323
Band aid!

104
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,823
The White Person frequently gets hurt,

105
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,723
so he always carries band aids around.

106
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,823
So, it's Mr. Hosoi.

107
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,623
Come to think of it, he had also written in the diary

108
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:27,123
that when he came back from school and fell at the front door,

109
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:30,323
he was glad that the White Person happened to be going out.

110
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,423
Yeah. I gave the kid a band aid

111
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:36,323
because his knee was bleeding.

112
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:39,423
Things like that happened several times before,

113
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:42,123
but who'd ever think that he'd call a black guy like me the White Person.

114
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:44,823
Now, for the remaining Yellow Person.

115
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:46,823
A taxi's yellow.

116
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,823
But there are white and green taxis too.

117
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:52,723
It's the vehicle used for construction.

118
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:54,423
Yes. In other words,

119
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:57,523
the man who has soil in his fingernails.

120
00:06:57,523 --> 00:07:01,723
Mr. Makabe, you're the Yellow Person.

121
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,723
Just what are you talking about?

122
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,323
There's soil in my fingernails

123
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:09,323
because I ran around the mountains when I did the survival game.

124
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:11,023
If I remember correctly, you said that the colour of the paint bullet

125
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:15,323
wouldn't come off, so your clothes were ruined?

126
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:16,323
Yeah.

127
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:19,923
In the survival games carried out in Japan,

128
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,823
air soft guns that fire BB bullets are used.

129
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,223
The game that uses paint bullets

130
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:28,223
is a different game called paintball.

131
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:30,523
They... they're not that different.

132
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:33,423
But paint bullets contain water-based ink,

133
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:36,123
so the paint washes off easily.

134
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,823
Well...

135
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:41,423
Besides, you said you like the colour navy green

136
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:43,923
that's found on camouflage outfits,

137
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:47,423
but the type of green colour that's usually used on those outfits

138
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,423
is called olive drab.

139
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:52,223
Hey. Have you really ever played

140
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,123
whatever the game that you mentioned just now?

141
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,723
To tell the truth, I'm still a beginner.

142
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:58,923
I guess you can check the place

143
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:01,323
-where the yard of the apartment was. -What?

144
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:04,623
Putting together Kaito's words that the Yellow Person

145
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:06,623
was acting suspiciously every night,

146
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:08,623
and the fact that Mr. Makabe is going as far

147
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:12,723
as to lie about the soil between his fingernails.

148
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,123
It seems that Mr. Makabe was digging something out

149
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:17,423
night after night in secret.

150
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,423
So I'm sure that it's buried.

151
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:24,123
Something very important that he doesn't want anybody to see.

152
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:26,623
Perhaps it's the money

153
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,723
that you made from day-trading, am I right?

154
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,223
What is it exactly?

155
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:39,623
There are two briefcases.

156
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:42,323
The money I made by day-trading.

157
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:44,723
I think it was about 2 billion yen.

158
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,423
That's a lot of cash!

159
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:49,123
Why did you bury it in the yard?

160
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:51,923
I didn't want to get taxed on it.

161
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,923
But last night,

162
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:55,823
when I came back from the movies,

163
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:58,523
the landlord constantly asked me about it.

164
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:00,723
I was annoyed, so I pushed him away.

165
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:03,423
He fell down the stairs

166
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:07,323
and he didn't move at all, so I got scared.

167
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:09,823
I decided that if I burned everything down,

168
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:12,023
I could reset and start over.

169
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:13,723
Reset, you said?

170
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:14,923
Do you understand what you did?

171
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:16,523
It's not like you can just

172
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:20,123
turn off the switch of a game because you lost!

173
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:23,723
An apartment that existed for years and all the memories that surrounded it

174
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:26,423
were burnt to ashes in just one night.

175
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:29,323
It's not something you can reset.

176
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:33,423
Your game of life still has a long way to go!

177
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:36,723
I'll see that you pay for what you did, so ready yourself for it!

178
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,423
-That includes making amends to Kaito... -Yes, all right.

179
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,323
and his father who got affected in the case.

180
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:43,823
Inspector! It's the hospital!

181
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,123
The landlord's surgery is successful,

182
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:48,823
and Kaito seems to have regained consciousness too.

183
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:50,623
Oh, I see.

184
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,323
Thank god...

185
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:58,423
Well, I guess you're going to rebuild the apartment with the money you made

186
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,823
from playing money game.

187
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:01,823
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:04,223
Let's go.

189
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:07,223
But there's still one mystery left.

190
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:11,423
Yeah. Why is Conan's nickname Black and White?

191
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:13,823
What kind of car is black and white?

192
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:17,423
I'm sure that he referred to us, the police.

193
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:19,523
The police car.

194
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:22,123
It's just the perfect nickname for a boy

195
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,923
who puts the police to shame.

196
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,623
See you, kid.

197
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:26,723
Sure.

198
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:32,223
Shall we all go visit Kaito at the hospital now, then?

199
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:33,323
Okay!

200
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:37,023
Let's have Doc take us there because it's some distance away.

201
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:38,323
Doc?

202
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:42,223
You mean you have a doctor you're acquainted with?

203
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:43,723
Yes, we do!

204
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:47,223
All he does is make useless games every time though.

205
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:50,123
Oh. I'd sure like to meet him.

206
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:52,123
Okay, we'll take you there!

207
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,823
Thanks.

208
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,623
A post-graduate in the engineering department.

209
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,523
So, you eventually plan on getting a Ph.D

210
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:02,623
and become my business rival?

211
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,223
No. Of course not.

212
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:07,023
You sure live in a big house.

213
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:08,923
Are you living here with her, just the two of you?

214
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:10,723
-Yeah. -Then,

215
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:12,023
it wouldn't be a problem for you

216
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:13,823
having another person live here, would it?

217
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:15,723
Huh?

218
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:18,823
Well, the apartment I used to live in got burned down.

219
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:21,923
So if it's okay with you, would you let me stay here

220
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:24,423
until I find a new place to stay?

221
00:11:24,423 --> 00:11:25,823
Of course, I'll help you with your research

222
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,523
or assist you in anything during my spare time.

223
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,123
Yeah. I don't mind

224
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:34,523
as long as she agrees.

225
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:38,523
Would you like to stay in Shinichi's house then?

226
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,423
Shinichi's house?

227
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:43,323
Yes. No one's living there now.

228
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:46,523
Look. It's the house next door.

229
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:48,923
I've got the key to the house.

230
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:52,323
I see. It sure is a fine house, but is it really okay?

231
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:54,723
-Yes! -Wait a minute.

232
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:56,423
What's on your mind?

233
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,223
You don't even know him that well.

234
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:01,923
What are you going to do if he finds out about our secret?

235
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:03,523
Don't worry.

236
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:08,823
There are no bad people who are fans of Holmes.

237
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:10,023
What?

238
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,023
Here, this is the house key.

239
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,523
Are you sure you don't have to

240
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,323
ask for permission from the person called Shinichi?

241
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:20,023
Yes! I'll e-mail him later.

242
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:22,723
Thank you. You've been a great help.

243
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:26,523
But make sure you watch the house nicely.

244
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:28,723
Yes. Of course.

245
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:42,651
Gosh. Arsons, abductions, and hit and runs.

246
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:46,751
It's amazing how many different incidents happen one after the other every day.

247
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,951
-How can you be so easygoing? -Huh?

248
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:52,151
That man that's free-loading at your house.

249
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:56,251
Is it really okay to trust him so easily?

250
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:58,551
You mean the man called Subaru Okiya?

251
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:00,451
Don't worry about him!

252
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,051
I sure hope so.

253
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:03,851
I assure you.

254
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,651
-Conan! -Huh?

255
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,451
Look out!

256
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,851
Sorry, sorry.

257
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,351
Oh, boy.

258
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,851
A paper plane?

259
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:19,051
What's with its design?

260
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:20,451
Is it the Japanese flag?

261
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:22,551
Oh, don't you know?

262
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,151
There's an airplane guy that everyone in town is talking about.

263
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:28,651
During the last two days,

264
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:33,251
a total of almost 100 paper planes were found all over the city.

265
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:37,451
It seems that the same pattern was drawn on those airplanes too.

266
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:41,351
Come to think of it, I saw it on my cell phone news just a while ago too.

267
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:44,551
Well, I guess it's just some sort of prank,

268
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,651
because they seem to be flown only during the night.

269
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:50,051
It could be the doings of an adult who's stressed out at work.

270
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:53,451
Talking about stress, there's going to be a re-run

271
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,551
of a programme called "Stress Induced Murder".

272
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:59,751
Oh. You mean the Detective Saimonji Series by Kaori Shinmei.

273
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,751
I wish I could watch it again.

274
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,651
But we won't be able to make it.

275
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:07,851
The re-run is on today?

276
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,851
I couldn't watch the program when it was aired

277
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,451
because Pops was watching Yoko Okino on TV.

278
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,151
Wait a second.

279
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:16,851
It's exam day today,

280
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:20,151
so Ran will only have class in the morning.

281
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,451
I guess I'll ask her to record the program for me.

282
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,751
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Huh?

283
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,051
Ran's not home yet.

284
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,751
She said she'd be late today.

285
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,251
Huh, how come?

286
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:34,451
She said that she was going to go clean up the detective kid's house.

287
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:38,951
That busybody is doing unnecessary stuff again.

288
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:42,251
I wonder if I could ask you to do me a favour, Pops?

289
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,851
What? I'm not giving you allowance.

290
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,651
No, it's nothing like that.

291
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:49,151
Wait a second.

292
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:52,151
Oh, no! Over there right now...

293
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:54,451
If it's not that, what is it?

294
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:55,951
-Hey, Conan! -It's been reported...

295
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:58,551
-Really. What's with him? -That the kidnapper jumped off the roof

296
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,351
of that building while on the run.

297
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,651
The whereabout of the president who has been abducted remains unknown.

298
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:07,951
But how surprising.

299
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:12,251
The klutz is going to study in the States.

300
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:16,251
I mean, he came back to school and all. It was so sudden.

301
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:19,051
I wonder how Eisuke's doing.

302
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,051
-Speaking of which... -Huh?

303
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,451
How's Shinichi doing?

304
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:26,951
Is he not coming back yet?

305
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:28,751
No.

306
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,351
Waiting for Shinichi who's still not coming back,

307
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:34,951
Ran skitters off to go and clean his place again today.

308
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:38,351
I'm not skittering off anywhere.

309
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:42,851
But it seems like it's become a custom to come

310
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:45,151
and clean Shinichi's place once a month, don't you think?

311
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,751
Well, not really.

312
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:51,151
I told you about the delicious sandwich shop, didn't I?

313
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,951
That was really good, but...

314
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:56,651
I don't see why you have to go out of your way to take care

315
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,651
of that deduction freak who rarely even contacts you.

316
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:02,451
Come on. He seems to be going through a lot too.

317
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:06,451
Wait.

318
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:08,751
What's the matter?

319
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,151
Hey, isn't it kind of cool in here?

320
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:14,251
Like the air conditioner's on or something.

321
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:16,351
Now that you mentioned it, I think it is.

322
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,551
Shinichi?

323
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:20,551
Shinichi's back.

324
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:23,651
Shinichi!

325
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,151
Where are you, Shinichi?

326
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:32,851
You're here, aren't you? Answer me!

327
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:34,751
Shinichi!

328
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:41,251
There he is. In the restroom.

329
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,051
I tell you. If you were coming home,

330
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:46,051
why didn't you tell me?

331
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:54,251
Who are you?

332
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:55,851
Well...

333
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:58,251
Don't tell me that he's a thief?

334
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,451
Sonoko, stand back.

335
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,851
I mean...

336
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:10,851
Serves you right!

337
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:13,451
Ran, hurry and call the police.

338
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,451
Ran?

339
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,451
He didn't resist.

340
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,751
Who is he?

341
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:27,051
What? A university student who's been staying here from last week?

342
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,851
Is that true, Conan?

343
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:31,751
Yes. Didn't I tell you about it the other day?

344
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,551
The apartment that my friend's father owned

345
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,451
was burned down in a fire.

346
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,151
He used to be one of the residents there.

347
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,251
His name is Mr. Subaru Okiya.

348
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,551
Does Shinichi know about it?

349
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:45,351
Yes. I sent him an e-mail about it and he wrote back to me.

350
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,251
He said he doesn't mind letting him stay,

351
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:52,151
but he doesn't want you to talk too much about Shinichi in front of him.

352
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,751
Huh? Why not?

353
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:57,251
Because he doesn't want the man to become too interested

354
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,651
and start snooping around the house.

355
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,251
I see.

356
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:03,051
-Okay, everyone. Take your seats. -The teacher's here.

357
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,151
Bye.

358
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,051
Wait.

359
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,651
So that's the story.

360
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,051
-We're very sorry! -We're very sorry!

361
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,151
I'm sorry to have struck a kick at you without asking you for details first.

362
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:17,651
That's right, Ran.

363
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:20,551
Someone this handsome could never be a thief.

364
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:21,751
What?

365
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:26,151
You even said, "Serves you right" just now.

366
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:31,451
Well. I'm also at fault for not explaining things right away.

367
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:32,951
By the way, Mr. Okiya,

368
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:35,151
which university do you go to?

369
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:37,951
I belong to the department of engineering at Toto University.

370
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,051
He's not only handsome, but is an elite as well.

371
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:42,951
May I take a picture of you with my cell phone?

372
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:45,051
And I'd like to know your email address too.

373
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,551
Sure.

374
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:49,651
I'm going to tell Mr. Kyogyoku about it.

375
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:51,951
I'll just take a picture then.

376
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:55,051
Before that, may I go and buy something?

377
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,051
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

378
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:01,051
Then I'll go get you something as a token of my apology.

379
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:03,451
Okay, then.

380
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:05,251
Could you get me what you were eating a while ago?

381
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:08,351
At Welcome Burger.

382
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:12,051
Did we mention stopping over at Welcome Burger?

383
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,651
No. It's something really simple.

384
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:17,251
You, the girl with brown hair caught my attention.

385
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:20,051
When you thought I was a thief,

386
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:22,951
you blew your top at me and called me names.

387
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:25,151
But once you found out that I'm not a thief,

388
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:27,051
you pulled away from me

389
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:30,551
and hid behind this girl with long hair.

390
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,451
Normally, it should be the other way around.

391
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:38,051
I take it that you took a liking to me as the opposite sex,

392
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,151
and didn't want me to smell your bad breath.

393
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,651
In other words, it made me think that you might have eaten

394
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:49,351
the garlic sandwich that newly came out.

395
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:51,351
Wow!

396
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:54,051
But there are other food with garlic too.

397
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:57,051
I could tell from the way she held her cell phone just now.

398
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:58,051
-Huh? -Huh?

399
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:01,351
She deliberately used her ring finger when operating the cell phone.

400
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:03,151
There's probably some oil

401
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:06,751
left on her thumb, index finger and middle finger

402
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,851
after she ate the French fries.

403
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:11,751
Besides, there's a little bit of salt left

404
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:15,451
around your mouth too, long-haired girl.

405
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:16,451
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:18,451
Excuse us while we go to the restroom.

407
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:25,451
Who is he? He seems really smart.

408
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:26,751
Yes,

409
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,851
but maybe I've met him somewhere before.

410
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:34,051
He sort of looks familiar.

411
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:38,051
He must have reminded you of your hubby, Shinichi.

412
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,851
I mean, Subaru is just like a detective too.

413
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,151
No, they don't resemble each other.

414
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,251
Besides, Shinichi's not my hubby.

415
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,251
Well, as I see it,

416
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:51,751
Subaru is a cut above Shinichi when it comes to being a detective.

417
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,151
Do you think so?

418
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:57,451
But it's not that Shinichi's not good either.

419
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:59,251
Would you like to see them have a match then?

420
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:01,351
Subaru against Shinichi.

421
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:07,251
We're going to study the names of flowers today!

422
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,051
A mail? It's from Ran.

423
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:14,151
"You'll be able to solve the case

424
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:16,251
that's being talked about right now, won't you, Shinichi?"

425
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:18,651
I've got images of the actual thing I'm talking about,

426
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:20,651
so I'll send them to you.

427
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:23,451
What's this?

428
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:26,851
Isn't it the paper plane that Genta was flying this morning?

429
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:30,551
But the pattern's a bit different from Genta's.

430
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,351
There's another image.

431
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:39,051
Hey. Could this be...

432
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:43,251
So this was found in the yard of your house.

433
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,551
That's why I want to know

434
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:49,951
who the prankster is and why he flew paper planes like this.

435
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,251
I see.

436
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:55,351
This is an interesting code.

437
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:58,451
Don't tell me you've already figured it out?

438
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,851
It's here.

439
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:05,451
The mail from Shinichi. That was fast.

440
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:10,351
It's most likely that this paper plane is an SOS signal.

441
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:12,451
What? SOS signal?

442
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:15,151
Are you saying that someone's asking for help?

443
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:16,251
Right.

444
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:20,251
Moreover, the situation requires immediate action.

445
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:23,751
If you have an image of another paper plane...

446
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:26,551
The image of another paper plane...

447
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:29,151
I would like you to show it to me right now.

448
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:59,951
"Next Episode" -Oh, don't you know?

449
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:02,651
A high school detective by the name of Shin...

450
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:03,651
Kinichi.

451
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,851
I couldn't help but stop myself.

452
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:10,351
I got the feeling that I shouldn't talk about Shinichi to him.

453
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:12,751
I felt this certain uneasiness.

454
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,351
Someone's life may be in danger!

455
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:18,351
If it were you, you would never wait at times like this, would you, Shinichi?

456
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:21,451
Tell me what you would do at times like this, Shinichi!

457
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:22,651
Ran!

458
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:24,051
Next Conan,

459
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:28,351
"Deduction Match! Shinichi vs. Subaru Okiya"

460
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,351
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,351
"Squid"

462
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,251
Pudding is better than octopus.

463
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,999
-Why? -I can't tell you.
