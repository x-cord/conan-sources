1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,800
The light of summer is the brilliance of yesterday.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,800
After the tears, comes the change in life.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,300
How can a man be so unlucky?

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,100
An incident endangering his life occurs.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,800
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,600
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,900
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,860
Strange.

9
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm sure that the yakiniku shop was on this road somewhere.

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,560
It's okay already.

11
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,160
Let's go eat something else.

12
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,860
Shut up!

13
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,260
We're looking for it one more time.

14
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,360
What?

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,160
We're going to look for it again?

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,060
Let's go home, Pops.

17
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,260
We can't find it and it's already 6:30 pm.

18
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,960
It's only 6:30 pm!

19
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,260
I told you that I'd treat you to a luxurious meal while Ran is away.

20
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,560
It's a hit-and-run!

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,660
Hey! Hold it!

22
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,360
Somebody! Somebody call the police!

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,060
You idiot!

24
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,760
We need an ambulance right away!

25
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,960
Two passers-by have been hit by a car.

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,460
The place is at a backstreet of Beika Park.

27
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,560
Hurry!

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,560
He looks familiar.

29
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,660
He's the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

30
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,060
The unluckiest man in all of Japan?

31
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,360
Just some time ago, a video of him taken by his nephew

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,460
got the "Funniest Video Award" which was aired on TV.

33
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,860
My uncle, Mr. Shinzaburo Tatematsu,

34
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,360
is probably the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,360
When he walks, a lot of things come falling down at him.

36
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,160
When he tries to avoid danger, he always sprains his ankle.

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,660
That hurts...

38
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,060
If he lines up to get something,

39
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,160
-it will always runs out right before of him. -I'm so sorry.

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,160
Why does everything bad happen to me?

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,560
And now he ends up in a traffic accident.

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,160
No, that's not it!

43
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,460
That's not it?

44
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,060
The driver was waiting for them in the car for a while there.

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,560
And the moment the driver saw those two,

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,860
the car charged right at them.

47
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,960
What?

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,160
Then, this wasn't just a mere accident.

49
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
It's an attempted murder case.

50
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,160
"Bad Luck Grand Prix"

51
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,460
One of the witnesses happened to remember the license plate number.

52
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,460
It seems to have been a stolen car.

53
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,360
It hasn't been found yet.

54
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,860
And how about the victims?

55
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,460
It seems that they're both okay.

56
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,760
I'm glad.

57
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
Can you share me the details?

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,660
Yes.

59
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,660
According to the eyewitness,

60
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,360
he doesn't know what the culprit looks like

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,060
because he's wearing a cap and sunglasses.

62
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,660
Mr. Tatematsu who was on his way back from work

63
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,560
was coming from Beika Station.

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,460
Just when he met Mr. Okonogi who was taking a walk...

65
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,260
The car in waiting suddenly ambushed them.

66
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,060
Who was the car after at that time? Mr. Tatematsu or Mr. Okonogi?

67
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,060
We don't know.

68
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,460
The car seems to charge at those two the instant they met each other.

69
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,160
Huh? Then, maybe the culprit was after them both?

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,060
I don't know about that.

71
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,060
If the culprit really wanted to go after the lives of both of them,

72
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,760
targeting them one by one instead of two together

73
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,360
will heighten the success rate.

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
True.

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,760
Only one of them was the target after all.

76
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,960
Then why did the culprit charge at them at such queer timing?

77
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,260
Doctor.

78
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,560
Let's confirm with the two men whether they have any idea

79
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,860
of anyone who could be coming after them.

80
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,860
Thank you very much.

81
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,360
I think we'll be able to hear what Mr. Tatematsu has to say.

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,460
But as for Mr. Okonogi...

83
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Is uncle okay?

84
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,860
You are...

85
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,560
He is Mr. Kazuma Sakaki, Mr. Okonogi's nephew.

86
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,760
His nephew.

87
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,160
And she is his fiance.

88
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,860
My name is Tomomi Ichikura.

89
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,260
I was contacted by Kazuma and was shocked.

90
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,060
Thank you for coming.

91
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,360
It seems that he will be all right,

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
but it will take a while before he regains consciousness.

93
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,660
Who could've done such a thing to Mr. Okonogi?

94
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,160
That's right. Who on earth did it?

95
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,660
Officer Takagi.

96
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,860
There is something that bothers me.

97
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,460
It seems that Mr. Okonogi is a man of great financial standing.

98
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,060
However, he doesn't have any family and his only relative is his nephew.

99
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,260
Which means...

100
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,460
Yeah.

101
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,460
If Mr. Okonogi dies, all of his estate will go to his nephew.

102
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,660
Besides,

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,060
he seemed to have borrowed a lot of money from his uncle, too.

104
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,660
This evening at about 6:30 pm,

105
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,760
when Mr. Okonogi was hit by the car,

106
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
where were you, Mr. Sakaki?

107
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,560
-Are you suspecting me? -No way!

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,860
Now, now. Please calm down.

109
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,060
I'm sure the culprit was after the other man!

110
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,160
Mr. Okonogi just happened to get involved.

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
At any rate, the police have to confirm

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,160
everyone's alibi that is close to Mr. Okonogi.

113
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,660
Please give us your cooperation, Mr. Sakaki and Ms. Ichikura.

114
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,760
I was in my condo.

115
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,960
Huh?

116
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,260
Is something the matter, Ms. Ichikura?

117
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,060
Well, I thought he went to attend his company superior's farewell party.

118
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,160
I was planning to,

119
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,960
but I wasn't feeling too well,

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,060
so I took off from work in the afternoon.

121
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,060
I came home and slept right through.

122
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,760
Since I live alone, I have no one to verify this though.

123
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,060
And will you tell us where you were too, Ms. Ichikura?

124
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,260
What?

125
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Yes.

126
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,060
I was window shopping at Tohto Department Store in Ginza from 5:00 pm

127
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,660
and I went outside to go home about 6:30 pm.

128
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
Were you with anyone?

129
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,660
No.

130
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,260
I was alone too, so there is no one who can confirm this.

131
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,360
But there was a bit of a commotion back then.

132
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,460
A commotion?

133
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,660
Yes. So I mailed Kazuma about it.

134
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
That's right. I remember.

135
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,060
Let's see...

136
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,260
Oh, here it is.

137
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
A time bomb?

138
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,460
Okumura, do you know about this case?

139
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,760
No. I'll go check.

140
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,160
Huh? What's this?

141
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,660
Mr. Mouri.

142
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,560
Show that to me.

143
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,660
"I'm at Tohto Department Store now.

144
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,660
They said a time bomb was found in the women's restroom on the 5th floor.

145
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,260
Talk about scary."

146
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,460
I see. Understood.

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,960
There's no doubt about it.

148
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,160
At about 6:30 pm, a suspicious looking thing was found in the restroom.

149
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,160
There was a commotion where the customers and employees were all evacuated.

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,660
It turned out to be a bad prank

151
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,760
and the bomb turned out to be an absolute fake, too.

152
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,360
Fake?

153
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,460
You mean that was a prank?

154
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,160
And it was found not in the women's restroom on the 5th floor,

155
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
but in the men's restroom on the 6th floor.

156
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
What?

157
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,960
Well, it's usual for wrong information to go around during a commotion.

158
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,560
Right...

159
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,860
Besides, it doesn't matter if it was on the 5th floor or the 6th,

160
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,160
or whether the bomb was a fake or not.

161
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,960
It's a fact that there was a bomb scare at 6:30 pm,

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,360
and she had notified him of this incident at 6:40 pm.

163
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,460
This means that she was there at the time.

164
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,560
And to get from Tohto Department Store to Beikacho,

165
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,960
it would take at least an hour even at top speed.

166
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,360
In other words...

167
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,360
A coincidental bomb scare established your alibi.

168
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,460
You must be a lucky woman.

169
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,660
True.

170
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,460
By the way, Mr. Sakaki,

171
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,860
you owe Mr. Okonogi a lot of money, don't you?

172
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,960
Excuse me.

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,360
You're police officers, right?

174
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,660
Mr. Tatematsu?

175
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,560
Then, you must be the other victim?

176
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,060
That car...

177
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,060
That car tried to run me over to shut me up.

178
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,360
Shut you up?

179
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,960
What?

180
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,360
The day before yesterday was pay day.

181
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,360
I thought I'd go out once in a while and went to a supermarket nearby.

182
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
I bought expensive meat and sashimi.

183
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,660
However, as soon as I went outside,

184
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,060
I was mugged.

185
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,460
Afer that, I tried to go after the culprit...

186
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,360
and I broke my front teeth.

187
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,860
Talk about one disaster after the other.

188
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,060
You really are an unlucky guy.

189
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,160
I knew you looked familiar.

190
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,760
You appeared on TV once as the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

191
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,260
Yeah, everybody was watching it.

192
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,460
But that isn't the end of the story yet.

193
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,660
Last night, I received a call from that mugger.

194
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,360
How dare you report to the police.

195
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,060
I can't let you go alive since you have seen my face.

196
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,360
I'm going to shut you up forever.

197
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,060
Warning of murder?

198
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,160
And then today, just as the culprit warned...

199
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,260
But would a person who only mugged food,

200
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,060
go all out as to carry out a murder?

201
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,360
He's right.

202
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,460
But...

203
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
But it was the same guy!

204
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,760
The same guy?

205
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,260
Then, that's it.

206
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,260
The mugger tried to kill him to shut him up.

207
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,360
Yes.

208
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,860
Hey, I'm going to go check on uncle's condition.

209
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,960
Okay.

210
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,960
I wonder if this case is really that simple.

211
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,460
Mr. Tatematsu.

212
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,460
Are you acquainted with that man called Mr. Okonogi?

213
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,660
I didn't know what his name was,

214
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,560
but I see him there every morning.

215
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,460
I come home on the same train every day

216
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,260
and he also take his walks at the same time.

217
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
Please tell us more in detail

218
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,560
about the time you were mugged last night.

219
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,360
And also about the call you received last night.

220
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,060
Hey, we're going home!

222
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,360
We've figured out the culprit, so the rest is up to the police.

223
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,460
Something...

224
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,560
Something's not right.

225
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,460
"The next morning"

226
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,560
The point is the timing of the car that charged towards them.

227
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,160
If the car was actually after Mr. Tatematsu's life,

228
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,860
it would've been better to target him when he was alone.

229
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,260
Why did it have to be then?

230
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,460
Hey, kid!

231
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Pops.

232
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,260
What do you want so early in the morning?

233
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,260
Kids should keep their noses out of what's not their business.

234
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,060
I'm going to stop over at the hospital for a while.

235
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,760
Go home, understand?

236
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,560
Did something come up?

237
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,860
Yeah. That unluckiest man in all of Japan was really depressed.

238
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,660
He felt responsible for getting Mr. Okonogi involved in the accident.

239
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,160
So I thought I'd go encourage him a bit.

240
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,960
You're nice, Pops.

241
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,660
Silly!

242
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
I'm always very nice!

243
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,960
Got him involved?

244
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,360
Maybe it's the other way around?

245
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,060
If the culprit schemed the whole thing just to make it look that way,

246
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,560
everything falls into place.

247
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,260
If so, there must be somebody who saw the culprit!

248
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:39,503
Mr. Tatematsu?

249
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:43,403
Yes, only for these past few days though.

250
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:45,903
Let me see...

251
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:46,903
Was there anyone?

252
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:49,403
I wonder if she followed Mr. Tatematsu here.

253
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:51,903
There was a suspicious looking person.

254
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:55,503
Was that person a bit short and plump?

255
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:56,803
Nope.

256
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,603
She was a beautiful lady.

257
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:00,203
A lady?

258
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:02,003
I thought it was his girlfriend at first,

259
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:05,703
but it's so unlike of Mr. Tatematsu.

260
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,503
A lady?

261
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:08,603
Exactly.

262
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:11,903
It was no coincidence that the bomb was found.

263
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:15,803
At about 6:30 pm, an anonymous call was received at Tohto Department Store.

264
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:18,403
The person said that a time bomb was set in the restroom.

265
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:21,403
Was the bomb set in the women's restroom on the 5th floor?

266
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,203
It's surprising you know.

267
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:26,103
We haven't made it public because it's a secret investigation.

268
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:29,603
It seems that a child who came shopping,

269
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,703
moved it to the men's restroom on the 6th floor out of fun,

270
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,103
unaware that it was a fake bomb.

271
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:36,903
So that's the story.

272
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:38,503
I see the entire picture now.

273
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,403
Mr. Sakaki!

274
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:45,503
It's the kid from yesterday.

275
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,003
How's Mr. Okonogi?

276
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:50,203
We don't know when he'll regain consciousness,

277
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:52,403
so we decided to take turns and eat our meal.

278
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:56,403
Which means, only Mr. Okonogi and Ms. Ichikura are in the room together.

279
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:58,703
What is it?

280
00:14:58,703 --> 00:14:59,703
We've got to hurry!

281
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:00,803
What's up, kid?

282
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:01,803
Hey, hold it!

283
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:10,703
The case has been solved?

284
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,303
You said to come right away.

285
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:14,403
Did I say that? Me?

286
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,503
That's why we all rushed over here.

287
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:20,703
If I said so but don't remember, I may have a multiple character.

288
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:21,903
I went to check!

289
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:25,603
It was just as you said, Pops!

290
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:27,603
Did I say something to you, too?

291
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:28,803
So, hurry!

292
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,903
Hey!

293
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,303
What are you doing?

294
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,203
What...

295
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,103
What are you doing, Tomomi?

296
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:58,603
Just what is going on, Mr. Mouri?

297
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:02,003
-Mr. Mouri? -Me?

298
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,203
I mean, what am I supposed to say at such an unexpected situation?

299
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:10,403
The door of multiple personality is starting to open.

300
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,603
Did it come?

301
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,203
Ms. Ichikura.

302
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:20,803
Were you trying to make it look as if he had difficulty breathing

303
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:24,603
after drowning him with that wet towel?

304
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:30,103
Because you failed to kill him after the hit-and-run yesterday.

305
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:35,603
But as to yesterday's case, Ms. Ichikura has an alibi.

306
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:39,603
The one who came charging with the car is the one who mugged me.

307
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:44,703
Ms. Ichikura planned all this out.

308
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:50,903
To begin with, the person the culprit was after is Mr. Okonogi.

309
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,803
What?

310
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:57,203
Mr. Tatematsu, you were exploited by the culprit.

311
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:59,803
I was exploited?

312
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:03,603
Ms. Ichikura schemed to kill Mr. Okonogi.

313
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:06,103
But with just a simple murder plan,

314
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:09,003
she knew she could fall under suspicion.

315
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,403
She was thinking of a good way to work things out

316
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:14,603
and began watching Mr. Okonogi's daily life.

317
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:24,203
She finds out that he always passes by Mr. Tatematsu while taking a walk.

318
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:28,303
Ms. Ichikura remembered Mr. Tatematsu's face.

319
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:30,303
He was the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

320
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:33,803
She had seen him on TV.

321
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,003
At that time,

322
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:40,603
Ms. Ichikura probably thought up this plan of exploiting Mr. Tatematsu.

323
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,503
So she followed him.

324
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:46,903
She may have known his face from watching him on TV,

325
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:49,203
but she didn't know his name.

326
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:51,703
In order to find out, she...

327
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,303
I made Conan go and confirm it.

328
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:57,103
It turns out that a person living in the same apartment remembered it.

329
00:17:57,103 --> 00:18:01,603
She said a suspicious lady followed him on his way home from work.

330
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:04,103
You carried out your plan.

331
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:06,703
First, you mugged Mr. Tatematsu.

332
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,003
Was that you?

333
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:10,803
The following day,

334
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,203
you got his phone number from his name and address

335
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:17,303
and called Mr. Tatematsu to warn him that you'd kill him to shut him up.

336
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:19,603
Then you chose yesterday to carry out the crime

337
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:22,203
because you knew that Mr. Sakaki was going to a farewell party

338
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:27,203
and would have a definite alibi, so he wouldn't be suspected.

339
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:29,903
You put a fake time bomb in the women's restroom

340
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:32,303
on the 5th floor of the Tohto Department Store.

341
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:40,503
After that, you rushed over to Beikacho.

342
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:44,103
Just as you warned, you executed your plan of fake killing Mr. Tatematsu.

343
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:46,503
You made it look as if Mr. Okonogi coincidentally happened

344
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:50,403
to get involved in the accident and tried to kill him.

345
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:53,703
You called Tohto Department Store right away.

346
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:58,303
I set a time bomb in the women's restroom on the 5th floor.

347
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,403
If you don't hurry, it'll explode.

348
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:02,903
You sent your fiance the mail

349
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:06,103
just about the time you figured the bomb would be found

350
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,203
and a commotion would be taking place.

351
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:13,003
Isn't that right, Ms. Ichikura?

352
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:17,903
But the alibi scheme that you thought up got the better of you.

353
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:20,003
The contradiction between where the fake bomb was actually found

354
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:22,203
and the contents of your mail.

355
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,903
That's what concluded the suspicion towards you.

356
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:29,003
Tomomi.

357
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,703
Well...

358
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:34,903
It's all so stupid.

359
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:42,703
I wonder why it was moved from the place I put it.

360
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:45,903
Tomomi...

361
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:50,903
-You... -It seems that a child who came shopping moved it.

362
00:19:52,503 --> 00:19:55,303
This world just isn't fair.

363
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:59,303
The bomb is moved.

364
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:02,503
The man I tried to kill is alive.

365
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:05,003
And now a famed detective comes along.

366
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,603
Maybe I'm even more unlucky than you.

367
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:11,203
Why'd you try to kill uncle?

368
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:12,503
Because...

369
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:17,403
I wanted the money.

370
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:22,403
I decided to marry you in the first place

371
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:24,303
because I figured if your rich uncle dies,

372
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:26,603
I could get a hold of his estate.

373
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:30,103
But your uncle turned out to be so alive and kicking.

374
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,803
I just couldn't wait for him to drop dead.

375
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:33,903
Money?

376
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:36,603
So you were just after the money to begin with!

377
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,103
Of course!

378
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,603
Otherwise, I would never go out with somebody like you.

379
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:48,203
Really...

380
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:50,203
So stupid.

381
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,803
Tomomi?

382
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:54,403
Uncle!

383
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,003
Kazuma.

384
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,503
I'll go get the doctor.

385
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,503
What happened, Tomomi?

386
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:21,303
I'm glad that you woke up.

387
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:42,203
What a horrible woman.

388
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:44,603
I think she can start off anew.

389
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,203
Huh?

390
00:21:46,203 --> 00:21:49,003
I know it's strange for a jinx like me to say so.

391
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,703
It's true.

392
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:58,103
I'd like to believe so.

393
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:36,103
Beer in the morning is so delicious!

394
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:38,503
A re-run due to popular demand?

395
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:41,103
So here goes!

396
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:49,203
Talk about super unlucky!

397
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:56,103
You shouldn't laugh at others, you know.

398
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,003
"Next Episode" -Huh?

399
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:03,003
I have to do it!

400
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:09,103
I think only three of them are suspicious.

401
00:24:19,303 --> 00:24:20,503
Genta!

402
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:27,803
Next Conan, "Genta's Knockout Shot (Part 1)"

403
00:24:43,503 --> 00:24:45,903
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,903
"Parking validation"

405
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,003
I've done it.

406
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:50,003
What did you do?

407
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:51,503
In the next episode, it's got to be made clear, whether it's red or white.

408
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:52,703
I think you want to say, whether it's black or white.
