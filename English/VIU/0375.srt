1
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:23,180
Today's code is pretty difficult.

2
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:24,780
The star and the killer are called by the same name.

3
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:26,480
Search and see through the telescope trick!

4
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,880
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:29,680
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,781
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,864 --> 00:02:00,063
We go over to a pension in the mountains to observe stars.

8
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,863
Besides the owner of the pension, Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi,

9
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:07,063
three people received an invitation card, Ms. Etsuko Nonomiya,

10
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:11,063
Mr. Hajime Futagawa, and Mr. Heihachi Mikami.

11
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,863
We went to look at the stars...

12
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:15,864
When we got to a hill nearby,

13
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:18,163
to our surprise we found a skeletonized corpse!

14
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,363
Moreover, in its hand it was holding six cigarettes

15
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:22,364
thought to be a dying message.

16
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:25,864
-And, that night... -What was that sound?

17
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:28,664
Mr. Futagawa?

18
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:34,063
The same dying message again?

19
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:36,563
No, this time...

20
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,264
there's one more.

21
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:46,164
"Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 2)"

22
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,063
True.

23
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:52,163
There are seven cigarettes in all.

24
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:54,063
What does this mean?

25
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:57,763
It's likely that the person that the six cigarettes stand for,

26
00:02:57,764 --> 00:03:03,663
which Mr. Kono, who was killed a year ago was holding

27
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:07,363
and the person that Mr. Futagawa is trying to describe

28
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:09,963
using the seven cigarettes may not be the same.

29
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:13,663
Maybe the killer deliberately added one more

30
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,963
just to throw investigation off.

31
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:17,663
That's not possible.

32
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,563
We heard something drop to the ground

33
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:23,263
and went running over right away.

34
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,263
There was no light when we ran over here, was there?

35
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:29,363
No, it was pitch dark.

36
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:32,963
Which means that one who killed Mr. Kono,

37
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,563
and the one who killed Mr. Futagawa are two different people.

38
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:38,664
Or, it could be that Mr. Futagawa tried to leave some kind of clue behind.

39
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:42,663
There's blood on just one match.

40
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:45,064
There is blood on his hand that was holding the cigarette case.

41
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:51,563
There's blood on the other cigarette case in his pocket too.

42
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,764
It could be that...

43
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:00,664
Your detective badge is beeping.

44
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:05,263
Oh, it's me! Can you see me?

45
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:07,663
Above. Look up!

46
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,764
Dr. Agasa!

47
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:13,463
Hey, is anybody there?

48
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:14,863
No, no one in particular.

49
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:17,163
We didn't see anyone, did we?

50
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:19,563
But, we did find something on the ground!

51
00:04:19,564 --> 00:04:20,863
Something on the ground?

52
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:22,963
A cell phone.

53
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,563
There's a mail that hasn't been sent out.

54
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:28,263
What's written on the mail?

55
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,264
"Will."

56
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:30,863
A will.

57
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:33,663
A will?

58
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:36,963
Mr. Futagawa is dead?

59
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:39,263
Oh no. It can't be.

60
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:42,363
He fell off the cliff and I think he died instantly.

61
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:47,363
Mr. Futagawa's cell phone was found on the cliff.

62
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:51,163
A mail "will" with no "send to" address was found in his cell phone.

63
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:53,363
There was a will in his cell phone?

64
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:55,563
This is what is written.

65
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:58,363
I invited everyone to this pension

66
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:02,563
because I wanted to confess before everyone what I did a year ago,

67
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,063
here at this pension.

68
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:08,463
Right. The one who killed Mr. Asao Kono a year ago is I,

69
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,263
Hajime Futagawa.

70
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:13,163
Ms. Etsuko Nonomiya, who was his fiance,

71
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:17,163
I am sorry to have killed someone so precious to you.

72
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:20,663
Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi, Mr. Kono's upper classman during his university days.

73
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:25,663
I am sorry for throwing dirt on this pension that you manage.

74
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:28,063
And Editor Mikami,

75
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:32,563
please carry on with Space Sunday even after my death.

76
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:35,563
He died because I had a slight argument with him

77
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:37,763
on the cliff and pushed him.

78
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:39,263
He unfortunately fell off

79
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:42,863
I was going to confess to this truthfully

80
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:44,563
and ask for your forgiveness.

81
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:47,163
But I found it hard to come up with the subject.

82
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:48,863
Therefore, I have decided to make amends by killing myself

83
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:53,863
before the police arrive here tomorrow, Hajime Futagawa.

84
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:56,463
Then, he's dead after all, Asao's...

85
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:58,463
Asao's really...

86
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:03,263
I'm sorry, please accept my apologies too, as his superior.

87
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:05,563
Don't cry, Etsuko.

88
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:09,063
Now we know why he suddenly disappeared

89
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,063
as well as found out who killed him.

90
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:12,263
But, I wonder...

91
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,763
Would a person who writes a letter then commit suicide,

92
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:17,563
leave something like this behind?

93
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:19,363
What?

94
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:22,163
Mr. Futagawa, who fell from the cliff,

95
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,263
was holding on tightly to these seven cigarettes.

96
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,963
Mr. Kono had six.

97
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:28,764
Mr. Futagawa was holding one longer cigarette more.

98
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:33,963
If Mr. Futagawa killed Mr. Kono,

99
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:35,963
and if he realized that the message was about himself,

100
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:37,863
leading him to commit suicide.

101
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,564
I don't think he would increase the number of cigarettes, do you?

102
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:45,263
On top of that, there's blood only on the one that has been increased.

103
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:47,863
There was blood on Mr. Futagawa's hand

104
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:52,563
and the other cigarette case that was in his pocket.

105
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:54,363
There were also traces of him having been hit

106
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:56,463
on the head with a steel pipe too.

107
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:57,863
Hit?

108
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,463
Yes! I think the blood got on

109
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:03,863
when he touched his bleeding head with his hands.

110
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:06,263
In other words, while the someone on the cliff,

111
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:09,363
who hit Mr. Futagawa on the head, stole his cell phone

112
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:10,763
and was keying in the will,

113
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,063
Mr. Futagawa deliberately took out one cigarette

114
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:14,963
from another cigarette case that he had,

115
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:17,163
and put that extra cigarette

116
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:19,263
into the original cigarette case with the six cigarettes inside it,

117
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,663
and completed the message.

118
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:24,563
I feel that this is indeed a dying message.

119
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:25,963
Oh no.

120
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:29,063
He probably had the cigarette case with six cigarettes in it,

121
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:33,563
to verify whether Mr. Kono's dying message applied to him.

122
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:35,263
Wait.

123
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:36,363
If there were seven,

124
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:40,364
doesn't that mean that you're the killer, Mr. Amatsuchi?

125
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:46,164
Mr. Mikami's name Heihachi is also seven cigarettes.

126
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:53,463
Aren't your initials seven cigarettes too, Ms. Nonomiya?

127
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:55,863
Come, come, let's stay cool.

128
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:59,363
Then all three of you, didn't see him in the forest?

129
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:01,063
-No. -No.

130
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,764
Then, let us check all your rooms.

131
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:08,763
We don't want the one who hit Mr. Futagawa with the steel pipe,

132
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:12,264
hiding it somewhere and come after us with it, do we?

133
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:17,063
Hey, don't mess things up too much.

134
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,663
Oh, you brought a telescope with you, sir?

135
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:23,363
Yeah. It's the one that was in the editing room.

136
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:27,663
A lens barrel, a stand, a finder and a tripod.

137
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:31,763
The lens barrel of a telescope is not hard enough to hit someone with.

138
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:34,463
A tripod like that would probably bend

139
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:36,163
if you hit someone with it, right?

140
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:37,663
True.

141
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:41,663
You tried a lot of different cigarettes too, didn't you, sir?

142
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:42,664
Yeah.

143
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:46,163
I couldn't figure anything out though.

144
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:48,863
Hey, that's enough!

145
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:51,063
How long are you going to keep searching?

146
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,663
The only thing that could serve as a murder weapon

147
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:54,463
would be this umbrella.

148
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,863
But, it's not bent anywhere.

149
00:08:56,864 --> 00:09:00,663
Of course not. Because I'm not the killer.

150
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:03,664
What about the liquor bottle you had?

151
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:06,363
I threw it away in the forest.

152
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,763
When I threw you guys off.

153
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,563
Threw us off?

154
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,663
You came after me, didn't you?

155
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:16,263
You, the freckled boy and the girl with the bangs.

156
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,463
I suddenly felt nauseated back then

157
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:20,464
and was throwing up behind a tree.

158
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:30,463
You were trying to figure out Mr. Kono's dying message too, weren't you?

159
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:35,063
Yes. But I didn't think they were Mr. Futagawa's initials.

160
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:38,464
I didn't know his first name.

161
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:43,263
Then, finally, it's your turn Mr. Amatsuchi.

162
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:46,763
But since this pension is in its entirety like your own room,

163
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:48,463
I guess we'll ask the police to investigate

164
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,163
when we call them in the morning.

165
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:51,363
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:55,363
Make sure you tell the police to search inside the forest!

167
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:58,263
Because if I were the killer, I'd hide the murder weapon there.

168
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,563
Yes.

169
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,763
Ai, so how was it?

170
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:05,463
I searched every nook and cranny of Mr. Futagawa's room

171
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:07,263
for the thing you told me to look for

172
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:10,563
but found nothing.

173
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,063
That's strange.

174
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:14,263
If the killer left such a will behind and killed him,

175
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:17,263
it should be around somewhere.

176
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:19,663
While you were investigating the rooms,

177
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:22,463
I was here watching over the people who were waiting.

178
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:25,163
That man called Amatsuchi is suspicious.

179
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:28,263
-He sure is suspicious. -Why?

180
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,063
Because he was looking over the guest list over and over.

181
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,063
Yes, really carefully, over and over.

182
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:36,263
And with a frightening face like this.

183
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:37,963
The guest list.

184
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:43,163
Come to think of it, Mr. Mikami and Mr. Futagawa said that

185
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:45,163
they met Mr. Kono only once.

186
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:47,563
After Mr. Kono's whereabouts became unknown,

187
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,963
these two men have been here several times.

188
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,063
Here it is.

189
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,563
It's probably this day.

190
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:55,363
The day when Mr. Kono died.

191
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:59,463
Yes, after Mr. Kono and Ms. Nonomiya's names

192
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:01,763
come the names of Mr. Mikami and Mr. Futagawa,

193
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:03,263
so there's no doubt about it.

194
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,764
Maybe this is...

195
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:10,464
I see, so that's the story.

196
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:15,664
Ai, come here a minute.

197
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:23,264
Okay! Please.

198
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:26,263
I agree with Ayumi too.

199
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:27,463
Right?

200
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:30,763
A Fusae brand wallet about this size.

201
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:33,264
If you get it for me, I'll help you.

202
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:38,563
Its hurt.

203
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,063
Ai! What's wrong?

204
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:44,063
-Ai, are you okay? -Ai!

205
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:46,363
Oh no! She may have appendicitis!

206
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:48,763
What? Does it hurt, Ai?

207
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:51,763
But, we've got a problem. The phone won't connect.

208
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:53,563
And even if we were to carry her down,

209
00:11:53,564 --> 00:11:55,263
-who knows how long it'll take. -Ai!

210
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,263
It hurts, Dr. Agasa.

211
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:59,564
Do something, Dr. Agasa.

212
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:05,664
Its hurt. Help.

213
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:16,063
Hello, could you send an ambulance up here?

214
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:18,363
Yes, a child suddenly fell ill.

215
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,064
Just as I thought.

216
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:30,501
Hello, please send an ambulance up here.

217
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:31,701
-Yes, a child suddenly fell ill. -No joke.

218
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:35,101
I thought the modular cable for the phone was gone?

219
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:37,502
The address is Gunma prefecture...

220
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:44,302
Conan?

221
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:46,601
We have to contact the ambulance quickly or Ai will...

222
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:48,401
Just what do you think you're doing?

223
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:51,301
There's no need to call one I was just acting.

224
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:56,801
In order to reveal the one who hid the modular cable

225
00:12:56,802 --> 00:13:01,501
and flattened the tires of our cars to confine us here.

226
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:04,801
Don't tell me that the one who used Asao's name

227
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,901
and sent out the invitation card to gather us here was...

228
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:08,701
You.

229
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:12,001
You're the one who left a will in Mr. Futagawa's cell phone,

230
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:13,501
made it look like he committed suicide

231
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,701
and pushed him off the cliff,

232
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:18,901
Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi!

233
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:19,902
Oh, no...

234
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:27,902
Wrong.

235
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:30,701
Wrong?

236
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:34,101
It's true that Mr. Amatsuchi is the one who invited everyone here

237
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,701
and confined us here.

238
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,401
But, he's not the killer.

239
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:39,401
Why not, Conan?

240
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:43,101
It was in the will that the killer wrote, wasn't it?

241
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,701
That the killer's the one who invited everyone here.

242
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:49,301
If Mr. Amatsuchi was the one who killed Mr. Futagawa,

243
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:51,601
wouldn't he have made it look like...

244
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:55,001
Mr. Futagawa was the one who confined everyone here?

245
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:59,601
And he would've hidden that modular cable into Mr. Futagawa's clothes,

246
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,101
or hidden it in the room.

247
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:02,801
True.

248
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:05,801
Mr. Amatsuchi called everyone here

249
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:08,001
because he found the bones,

250
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:10,901
the ring and dying message cigarettes of Mr. Kono,

251
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:14,301
whose whereabouts became unknown a year ago.

252
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:17,401
If not, he couldn't have been so accurate

253
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:18,901
just taking a quick glance at the cigarettes

254
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:20,501
and remarking that there were four long cigarettes

255
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:22,501
and two short ones, right?

256
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:25,101
Yeah. I sent out the invitation

257
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:27,101
to the people who spent the night here that day

258
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,201
because I found those things.

259
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,001
I figured that if the killer found out

260
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,701
that I found the bones and the message,

261
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:35,701
the killer would confess.

262
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:38,201
But, since Mr. Futagawa died,

263
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:39,601
I couldn't come out and say so.

264
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:43,101
Which means then that the person who killed Mr. Futagawa is...

265
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:47,501
Of course! The killer is that woman called Ms. Nonomiya, right?

266
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,901
What a thing to say?

267
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:51,601
That is possible.

268
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:55,801
If she realized that the cigarettes stood for Mr. Futagawa's initials.

269
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:59,001
Avenging the death of her fiance that was killed.

270
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:00,901
That's more than enough motive.

271
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:06,401
No, Ms. Nonomiya said she passed us in the forest.

272
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:09,701
She couldn't possibly have gone up the hill before us,

273
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,201
meet Mr. Futagawa and push him off the cliff.

274
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,901
But when Mr. Futagawa fell off,

275
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:16,901
all three of you ran right over, didn't you?

276
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:19,801
If somebody was watching that from on top of the cliff...

277
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,901
Seen from on top the cliff

278
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:24,901
were only three little lights the size of a bean.

279
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:29,001
It's impossible to make out who the three of us were from that distance.

280
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:31,701
In other words, by means of elimination

281
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:34,001
the only one capable of being the killer is,

282
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:36,201
Mr. Futagawa's boss and editor,

283
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,002
Mr. Heihachi Mikami, you are the killer, right?

284
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:47,302
If the other two aren't the killer, you say that it's me?

285
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:53,101
But, Mr. Futagawa was holding seven cigarettes.

286
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:56,601
That was a message pointing out your name, Heihachi.

287
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,101
It's only a coincidence.

288
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:02,101
And, besides, why do I have to go and kill Futagawa?

289
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:06,801
If he did kill the guy called Kono a year ago, then the more so.

290
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:08,801
I have no obligation to avenge the death

291
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,301
of a person that I've met for the first time.

292
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:12,601
True.

293
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:17,101
But that's only if Mr. Futagawa had actually killed Mr. Kono.

294
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,401
What?

295
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:22,001
I looked through the guest book

296
00:16:22,002 --> 00:16:26,101
and noticed that Mr. Mikami's name was listed after Mr. Kono's name.

297
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:28,101
It dawned on me that maybe Mr. Kono knew Mr. Mikami's name

298
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:31,201
only by sound and not the kanji character.

299
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:32,701
By sound?

300
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:35,201
The kanji for the word "mi" in Mr. Mikami's name

301
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,701
is also pronounced as "o", right?

302
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,101
Yes, the usual kanji character for "Mikami"

303
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:40,601
is made out of the word three (San) and top (Ue).

304
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,501
The number of strokes for the kanji character are...

305
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,701
One, two, three...

306
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:46,901
-Six! -Six!

307
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:50,501
Right, the six cigarettes left behind by Mr. Kono

308
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,901
as well as the seven cigarettes left behind by Mr. Futagawa

309
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:58,601
are both dying messages that stand for Heihachi Mikami!

310
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,901
Mr. Futagawa increased the number of cigarettes

311
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:02,801
to make it easier to understand.

312
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:04,401
He chose the same brand of cigarette

313
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:07,901
because the killer for both incidents was the same person.

314
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,701
Come to think of it,

315
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:14,901
Mr. Futagawa was laughing while looking at the guest book back then.

316
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:18,301
That's when he realized that Mr. Mikami killed Mr. Kono.

317
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:20,301
So, when he tried to confirm it,

318
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:23,701
he was probably killed instead, no?

319
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:26,901
This is ridiculous. Do you have any evidence?

320
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:31,501
The evidence is the bag that was found in your room.

321
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:37,001
If something like the steel pipe that killed Mr. Futagawa is found,

322
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:40,001
it will serve as concrete evidence!

323
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,001
Hey.

324
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:45,101
You checked that bag a while ago.

325
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:47,901
Yeah. I couldn't find the steel pipe,

326
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,801
but I couldn't find something that should've been there either.

327
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,101
Something that should've been there?

328
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:53,901
The heavy-weight for the telescope.

329
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:57,301
You put something else into this lens barrel

330
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:59,701
and removed the heavy-weight.

331
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:02,401
In order to keep the weight what is should be.

332
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:05,401
So, will you show us the inside of the lens barrel?

333
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:08,001
No matter how well you wipe it,

334
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:10,001
the luminol reaction from the blood that stuck to it

335
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,801
after you hit Mr. Futagawa is bound to be there.

336
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:16,801
Futagawa's blood is definitely still here.

337
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,701
So, you're the one after all.

338
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:21,301
Right. I went out of my way to look after him

339
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:22,901
and see that he made it to the desk,

340
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:25,001
yet he had the nerve to say to pay him 50,000,000 yen

341
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:27,801
if I wanted him to keep his mouth shut about the murder.

342
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:31,401
All I did was punish Kono for not being grateful.

343
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,701
Punished him?

344
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:34,901
Just what do you mean?

345
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:37,102
A comet.

346
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:43,701
A year ago, that day, the guy named Kono came to ask me a favor.

347
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:49,001
He asked me to verify whether the comet he found was a new one or not.

348
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,501
You mean the comet that was named after you?

349
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:57,601
It was found by that man and I confirmed it on that cliff.

350
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,401
Don't tell me that you killed Asao

351
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,401
so that you could hog that comet all for yourself?

352
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:05,301
I asked him to put my name on the comet, of course.

353
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:07,101
But that guy...

354
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,502
Talk about ungrateful.

355
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,001
No, I can't.

356
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:15,501
We've already decided that the name of the star is...

357
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:16,702
Amatsuchi, Nonomiya, Kono comet.

358
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:20,001
I thought...

359
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:21,301
Come to think of it,

360
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:24,801
he mentioned that the time's finally come.

361
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:28,201
I thought that he found somebody else.

362
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:32,301
It was a dream I've held since childhood too.

363
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:36,101
And yet he refused to listen to me.

364
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:38,501
So, I figured that I'd go and submit it before he does

365
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:40,501
and headed back for the pension.

366
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:43,801
Then, that guy came clinging onto me so I brushed him away

367
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:46,301
and he fell off the cliff.

368
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:49,801
Then, later when you came here again

369
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:51,101
in order to hasten skeletonizing of the corpse,

370
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,801
you poured lime over it, right?

371
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:53,802
Right.

372
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:55,601
What a surprise it was to find that.

373
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:59,201
Mr. Amatsuchi was the sender of the invitations.

374
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:02,001
I thought it was Futagawa all this time.

375
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,201
Hey, hurry and take out the steel pipe.

376
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:05,601
Stop pushing me.

377
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:07,902
It's a steel pipe...

378
00:20:08,902 --> 00:20:11,601
but, not an ordinary steel pipe.

379
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:14,001
Shot gun.

380
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:17,102
Okay! You line up there too!

381
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:23,201
In Futagawa's case, I just hit him to avoid the gun shot,

382
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:26,401
but this time I'll finish you all off in a blow.

383
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:28,302
I'll sure need a lot of lime.

384
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:33,101
No need to be scared little lady.

385
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:37,101
I'll turn you into a star in no time.

386
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,601
What are you doing brat?

387
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:40,901
Can't you see? I'm wearing my shoes.

388
00:20:40,902 --> 00:20:42,701
Shoes?

389
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:45,801
You idiot! Do you think you can get away?

390
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:48,101
No. Mine's the same as yours.

391
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:49,801
What?

392
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,802
Mine is also...

393
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,602
not an ordinary shoe.

394
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:00,202
See.

395
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,501
Aren't you glad

396
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:16,201
now that your name will finally be branded

397
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:19,702
as one owned by a criminal, a convict, rather than comet?

398
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:55,401
I wonder why Mr. Kono was so obsessed about the name of the comet?

399
00:22:55,402 --> 00:22:58,101
I can understand him wanting to name it after his fiance, Ms. Nonomiya,

400
00:22:58,102 --> 00:23:01,301
but why couldn't he let Mr. Amatsuchi wait and name it after Mr. Mikami?

401
00:23:01,302 --> 00:23:02,401
Then, this wouldn't have happened.

402
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:06,001
But, they were upper classman and under classman at the university.

403
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:08,801
-They were probably very good friends! -Guess so.

404
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:11,001
I don't think that's all there is to it.

405
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:13,401
He really didn't want to leave out Mr. Amatsuchi

406
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:15,701
because "Ama" from Amatsuchi's name, "No" from Nonomiya's name,

407
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:17,801
and "Kawa" from his name, when you them line up horizontally

408
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:19,601
stands for Amanogawa, which means the Milky Way.

409
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:21,101
-I understand. -I see.

410
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:23,601
Conan, you're fantastic!

411
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,701
Hey, will you guys be a little quieter?

412
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:28,701
I was going to go to the country over to grandma's place

413
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:32,001
and I get dispatched so early in the morning like this.

414
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,901
I guess it'll be a while till I get to go again.

415
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:36,601
I'm so sleepy...

416
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:38,301
Where?

417
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:39,901
Where did you call just now?

418
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:42,201
Grandma's place in Tottori.

419
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:44,702
Tottori?

420
00:23:57,902 --> 00:24:01,401
"Next Episode."

421
00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:02,502
Ran!

422
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:10,302
Who the heck is he?

423
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,602
Darn, where'd they go?

424
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:20,501
What with this siren?

425
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,401
Maybe...

426
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:24,001
Next Conan,

427
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:28,002
"Time Limit 15:00."

428
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:46,701
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:47,901
"Tent."

430
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,601
It's time limit for Saturday's homework.

431
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:50,901
Hey, it's already Monday night.

432
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:52,902
-I've got to watch Detective Conan. -It just ended.
