1
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,232
Darn it!

2
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:09,932
This is why I hate rainy days.

3
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:12,632
You should've stayed home then.

4
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,432
No way, idiot!

5
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:17,432
What better chance can there be since Ran's not home!

6
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:20,632
What makes you think I'll stay home and not go drinking?

7
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:24,332
But Ran prepared dinner before she left.

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,933
It's not my fault if you get scolded later, you know.

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,232
Look at you!

10
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:32,533
You're tagging along with me, too!

11
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:38,233
You can make more excuses with me around, can't you?

12
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:43,132
And? What do you want to eat?

13
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,433
Well...

14
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:47,433
What was that?

15
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:49,332
Pops that sound just now...

16
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,433
Yes. It could be a traffic accident!

17
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,732
A canvas stained black with crime.

18
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,232
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

19
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,232
The headlights shine on the scene of the incident.

20
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,532
Is it a mere accident? There is an unexpected turn of events.

21
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,332
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,232
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,733
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:56,501
"Bus Stop in the Rain"

25
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,870
Hey, you! Are you all right?

26
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,769
How is he?

27
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,269
He's just passed out.

28
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,569
But why's he in the middle of the road like this?

29
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,569
Pops! Over there!

30
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,570
What is it?

31
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,770
What?

32
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,469
No good.

33
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,569
He's dead.

34
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,269
Call the police, kid.

35
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,470
I don't think we need to.

36
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,869
The car parked on the center line...

37
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,669
Inspector?

38
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,670
Mr. Mouri?

39
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,869
Why are you both here?

40
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,269
We were on our way back from a case

41
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,169
when we saw a suspicious looking car stopped on the center line.

42
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,769
But what are you doing here, Mr. Mouri?

43
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,669
Well, you see...

44
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,369
We happened to be walking nearby when we heard the sound of a crash.

45
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,770
So we ran over here and this is what we saw.

46
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,869
I guess there aren't any security cameras around.

47
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,069
Yes.

48
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,869
Besides, in this rain and darkness,

49
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,569
I guess we can't expect any eye-witnesses either.

50
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,069
This means we have no choice but to ask him what happened.

51
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,869
Is he okay?

52
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,469
It's seems his life is in no danger.

53
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,969
Besides, I think the ambulance will also be here shortly.

54
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,469
I guess we'll just have to wait for him to regain consciousness.

55
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,769
And, what's the identity of the victim?

56
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,869
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,169
There were a wallet and cell phone in his pocket.

58
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,069
From his ID card we found that he is Mr. Naohiro Tsutsumi, age 31.

59
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,669
The cause of death is most probably a brain contusion

60
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,970
due to strong impact to his head.

61
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,569
It seems he's had a drink.

62
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,070
So he may have been drunk and jumped out before the car or something.

63
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,170
But we can't assume it was an accident yet.

64
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,569
All you ever do is get in the way at crime scenes.

65
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,270
So, stay still and wait here.

66
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,270
My head...

67
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,069
What?

68
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,469
Don't you remember anything?

69
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,369
Remember?

70
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,670
I was driving...

71
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,769
That's right. I...

72
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,669
What happened to the person I ran over?

73
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,570
Is he all right?

74
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,469
Unfortunately...

75
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,270
Oh, no.

76
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,770
Are you okay?

77
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,369
Are you hurt?

78
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,269
I'm fine.

79
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,969
Just to be safe, let's have you examined later.

80
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,669
The ambulance will be here soon.

81
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,670
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,169
How is he?

83
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,569
The inside of his mouth is cut,

84
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,169
but it seems he has no other injuries.

85
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,669
We'd like him to accompany us to inspect the scene of the accident then.

86
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,070
No problem.

87
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,869
Then, would you please come this way?

88
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,870
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,469
"Toshiaki Kikuchi (31)" -Let's start with your name.

90
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,569
I'm Toshiaki Kikuchi.

91
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,070
Where do you work?

92
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,169
I'm unemployed right now.

93
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,270
I see.

94
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,270
Alright, then.

95
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,970
Tsutsumi?

96
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,069
Tsutsumi!

97
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,869
Tsutsumi.

98
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,569
It's you after all.

99
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,470
How did you end up like this?

100
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,669
Why?

101
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,170
Do you know him?

102
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,170
Yes.

103
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,569
How could I have run over you?

104
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,770
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,770
I'm so sorry!

106
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,169
Are you friends with the victim?

107
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,769
He was an ex-colleague of mine at the same company.

108
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,969
What do you mean by ex?

109
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:59,569
Tsutsumi and I were both laid off recently.

110
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,269
We entered the company at the same time

111
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,769
and were on good terms with each other, you see.

112
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:11,169
We were laughing about that fact we got laid off at the same time, too.

113
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,869
I see.

114
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,469
It may be tough on you,

115
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,069
but will you give us details on the circumstances of the accident?

116
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,070
Yes, sir.

117
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,569
After eating dinner at a restaurant owned by a friend of mine,

118
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,970
I was driving back home.

119
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,869
I noticed a person holding an umbrella came out in front of my car

120
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,169
and slammed on the brakes.

121
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,970
But in this rain and darkness...

122
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,670
I know I'm just making excuses.

123
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,169
You said you finished eating dinner,

124
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,369
but of course you didn't drink, did you?

125
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,069
No way.

126
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,970
Not even a drop.

127
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,570
That umbrella...

128
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,770
This umbrella is the victim's.

129
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,370
What are you doing, sir?

130
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,869
Oh, it's you.

131
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,569
I came to get my own umbrella.

132
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,569
I can't keep sharing umbrellas with the officer for too long, you see.

133
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,670
Inspector Megure, the paramedics brought this over.

134
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,369
It seems like they found something.

135
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,970
Seems so.

136
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,469
What seems to be the matter?

137
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,970
They found a suicide note from Mr. Tsutsumi.

138
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,070
"Life is too hard. I'm at my limit."

139
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,369
No.

140
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,870
He left a suicide note.

141
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,469
In other words, this is not an accident,

142
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,270
but suicide.

143
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,470
Where did they find that suicide note?

144
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,370
The paramedics found it in Mr. Tsutsumi's pocket.

145
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,169
Mr. Kikuchi.

146
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,269
Would you have any idea why he would commit suicide?

147
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,569
After being laid off,

148
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,369
he was energetically trying to find another job.

149
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,170
But things didn't work out as well.

150
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,469
How I wish I could win the lottery or something.

151
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,469
More importantly, how's looking for a job coming along?

152
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,869
What?

153
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,069
There are no companies that would be interested in hiring me already!

154
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,570
Don't say that, Tsutsumi.

155
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,969
Thanks to your unpleasant talk,

156
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,970
I'm turning sober.

157
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,869
Darn it!

158
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,269
Hey, Kikuchi. Lend me money, will you?

159
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,969
You got some going away money from the company, didn't you?

160
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,269
I used it all up already!

161
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,869
Gosh.

162
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,569
Just give me the money!

163
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,469
Hey!

164
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,170
I'm going to borrow a bill.

165
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,470
What do you intend to do from now?

166
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,469
Beats me.

167
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,869
If worse comes to worse, maybe I'll commit suicide or something.

168
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,770
Commit suicide?

169
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,069
Come on. I'm only joking.

170
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,170
See you.

171
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,669
I see.

172
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,169
He was laid off from the company and also had money problems.

173
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,669
I didn't think he was cornered to the point of having to commit suicide.

174
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,669
He should've come talk to me.

175
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,770
Officer Takagi, there's something on the back.

176
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,670
You're right.

177
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,869
Looks like a piece of string.

178
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,969
That's...

179
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,570
What did I tell you?

180
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,869
Don't get carried away.

181
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,569
It hurts!

182
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,369
Stay away.

183
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,069
The rain's starting to pour harder.

184
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,069
Let's take shelter from the rain, too.

185
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,270
Good idea.

186
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,069
Well, there's nothing really suspicious,

187
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,469
so I guess this can be concluded as a case of suicide.

188
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,969
How heavy will my sentence be?

189
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,169
Well...

190
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,269
It all depends on the inspection of the traffic department,

191
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,769
so it's still hard to tell just yet.

192
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,169
But I doubt it'll be worse than forward inattention

193
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:57,069
and professional negligence resulting in death.

194
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,869
I see.

195
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,269
No.

196
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,169
This is not suicide.

197
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,269
Darn it.

198
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,170
I have nothing conclusive yet.

199
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,369
Darn it! I'm soaking wet!

200
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,670
This coat doesn't repel water at all!

201
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,770
I got it!

202
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:36,884
It must be here somewhere.

203
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:42,984
I found it!

204
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:47,684
The guys from the transportation department are sure taking their time.

205
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:51,183
According to the paramedics who came a while ago,

206
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:55,084
there was a multiple collision accident on Beika Ohashi Bridge.

207
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:58,883
Today's was sudden...

208
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,083
Mr. Mouri!

209
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:01,484
Has it come to you already?

210
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,383
Don't tell me it's the usual?

211
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:07,183
Yes, I figured it out.

212
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:10,984
This was a premeditated murder committed by Mr. Kikuchi.

213
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:16,483
But you were saying it was suicide till just a while ago.

214
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:17,484
Yes.

215
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:21,883
I was completely deceived by Mr. Kikuchi's true to life act.

216
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:24,083
What nonsense are you talking about?

217
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,483
Mr. Kikuchi.

218
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:29,083
There are several things in your testimony that doesn't make sense.

219
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,783
Hey, Conan. Show the you-know-what to the inspector.

220
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:34,283
Okay. Inspector Megure!

221
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:36,783
I found this near the car.

222
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:39,284
I think it's Mr. Tsutsumi's umbrella.

223
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:45,283
It looks like an ordinary umbrella.

224
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:50,583
Mr. Kikuchi testified that a person holding an umbrella came bursting out.

225
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:51,983
Huh?

226
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:55,483
That umbrella was closed, wasn't it?

227
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:59,483
Maybe it closed from the impact of the accident or something?

228
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:03,383
That umbrella is a jump type umbrella.

229
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:06,083
It opens at the push of a button,

230
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:11,584
but when you close it, you need to slide the part called the runner.

231
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:17,883
As you can see, unless you deliberately close it,

232
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,784
the umbrella can't close.

233
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:27,383
Then, when did Mr. Tsutsumi close his umbrella?

234
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:32,283
It's hard to imagine he closed it himself after he was hit.

235
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:33,883
If so...

236
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:35,383
You're right.

237
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,783
I must've remembered wrong.

238
00:15:37,784 --> 00:15:41,283
Tsutsumi didn't have his umbrella open to begin with.

239
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:42,583
Yes, I'm sure of it.

240
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,183
No mistake about it.

241
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:47,083
Oh, you remembered wrong.

242
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,683
It's true.

243
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:51,583
My mind was a mess after the accident.

244
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,383
According to my deduction,

245
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:59,083
I think Mr. Tsutsumi closed his umbrella so he could get into your car.

246
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,384
Am I wrong?

247
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,883
What do you mean?

248
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:06,683
When I got to the scene,

249
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:09,583
the interior light of the car was on.

250
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:12,383
Hey, you! Are you all right?

251
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:15,883
And when you went back to your car to get your umbrella

252
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:17,883
and closed the door on the passenger's seat side,

253
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:20,183
the interior light of the car went out.

254
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:21,283
In other words,

255
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:24,883
somebody had opened the door of the passenger's seat once.

256
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,983
And for some reason,

257
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:29,383
the door wasn't completely closed.

258
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:30,883
Mr. Kikuchi.

259
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:33,383
Why did you go out of your way to take the umbrella

260
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:36,283
that was in the backseat from the passenger's seat side?

261
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,483
Well...

262
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:41,583
You thought that the interior light of the car being on

263
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,583
would serve as proof that you tried to let him on your car

264
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:48,783
and tried to hide the evidence, didn't you?

265
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,283
Wrong!

266
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:54,283
Mr. Kikuchi, you summoned Mr. Tsutsumi out to this empty road

267
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:57,484
with no security cameras around.

268
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:03,283
And when Mr. Tsutsumi came,

269
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,484
you urged him to get in the car.

270
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,083
Mr. Tsutsumi closed his umbrella to get in the car

271
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:12,183
and the moment he placed his hand on the door,

272
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:14,484
you suddenly put the car in reverse.

273
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:20,084
He must have received the abrasions on his right hand fingers then.

274
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:27,183
Then, you stopped once.

275
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:30,683
You then headed the car straight for Mr. Tsutsumi

276
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:33,284
who was standing there not understanding what was going on.

277
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:35,683
Hold it.

278
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:38,983
Why did he have to put the car in reverse?

279
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:42,283
He needed to earn acceleration speed

280
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:45,183
in order to run over a person and kill him.

281
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:47,883
The fact that the side mirror on the passenger's seat side

282
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,483
is bent towards the windshield

283
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:53,983
is proof that the car reversed once.

284
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:56,983
The side mirror probably hit Mr. Tsutsumi

285
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,284
when the car was put in reverse.

286
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:11,283
After running over Mr. Tsutsumi,

287
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:16,284
you took the suicide note that you had prepared and left the car.

288
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:22,383
Then you hid the suicide note in the pocket of Mr. Tsutsumi's jacket,

289
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:24,083
returned to your car

290
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:25,884
and pretended to be passed out.

291
00:18:29,884 --> 00:18:32,983
This is the full story of the case.

292
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:35,883
It's true that everything falls into place.

293
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,383
But do you have proof?

294
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,383
You can't conclude me as being a killer with just what you have, can you?

295
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:43,683
Right.

296
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:45,983
Only this much of circumstantial evidence isn't enough

297
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:47,683
to conclude that Mr. Kikuchi is the killer.

298
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,983
There's proof.

299
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:52,984
Please look at the suicide note that Mr. Tsutsumi had on him.

300
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:56,183
What is it?

301
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:58,283
Please take a good look at the paper.

302
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:00,384
Don't you think it's much too clean?

303
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:06,483
If Mr. Tsutsumi was run over

304
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:09,183
with the suicide note in the pocket of his jacket,

305
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:13,183
it's odd that the paper is not more crumpled.

306
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:15,883
Now that you mentioned it, I guess so.

307
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:19,483
Next, the way the suicide note is wet is strange.

308
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:21,283
He's right!

309
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:23,783
A part of it isn't wet.

310
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:25,483
What do you mean?

311
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:29,884
That means that the suicide note was waterproof.

312
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:33,483
Why would something like that be done to the suicide note?

313
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:35,683
It wasn't the note itself.

314
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:39,683
The note was probably placed together with other waterproof items.

315
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:44,284
Therefore, the water repellent was transferred onto it.

316
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:47,483
Officer Takagi.

317
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:51,083
Please check the dashboard of Mr. Kikuchi's car, will you?

318
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:52,184
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,083
I found it.

320
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,984
The car wax and the towel to wipe it off.

321
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,083
Mr. Kikuchi.

322
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,883
You waxed your car today, didn't you?

323
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:13,183
The fact that only the sleeve of your right hand

324
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:15,984
is repelling the rain proves it.

325
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,483
If the blue fiber that's on the suicide note

326
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:25,483
and the fiber of that towel matches,

327
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:29,483
it will be obvious that you put the suicide note

328
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:30,984
into Mr. Tsutsumi's pocket.

329
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:40,683
Maybe you were hoping that the evidence would be washed away by the rain,

330
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:43,384
but it seems to have backfired on you.

331
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:48,883
When he was laid off from the company,

332
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:52,183
he told our boss a lot of things

333
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,084
to discredit me and got me laid off, too.

334
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:02,683
What?

335
00:21:02,684 --> 00:21:04,383
Tsutsumi!

336
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:06,883
Why did you lie like that?

337
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:08,384
Thanks to you, I...

338
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:12,483
There are no reasons.

339
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:16,284
I just wanted to drag somebody down with me.

340
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:22,483
You mean you had the nerve to ruin my life just for that?

341
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:26,283
Well, since we were both laid off together,

342
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,683
we might as well be friends.

343
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,284
Okay, buddy?

344
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:37,484
My life was ruined because of his whim.

345
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:41,284
I couldn't forgive him!

346
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,783
So, we finally get to eat dinner.

347
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:20,784
Yes.

348
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,384
It's raining again.

349
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:28,883
Huh? Where's my umbrella?

350
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:30,583
That's right!

351
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:33,383
I left it at the bus stop!

352
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:34,984
I'd better hurry back to get it...

353
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:40,684
What a classic case of "danger past, God forgotten."

354
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,283
"Next Episode"

355
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:46,583
If only you didn't tag along,

356
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:49,383
it would've been a great drive!

357
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:51,484
But Ran asked me to come with you.

358
00:23:52,684 --> 00:23:56,983
Thank goodness, you seem to have completely overcome your problem.

359
00:23:56,984 --> 00:23:59,383
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Mouri.

360
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,683
This is where I would like you show you next.

361
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:03,883
An amusement park!

362
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:06,483
If so, what's her motive?

363
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:12,484
