1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:01,978
Anniversary.

2
00:00:01,978 --> 00:00:03,978
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:03,978 --> 00:00:05,478
This never happened before.

4
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:08,878
Ran explodes at her mother who takes off her wedding ring.

5
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:10,278
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:11,778
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,978
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:32,738
Ms. Kuriyama, please answer the door.

9
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:44,138
Ms. Kuriyama.

10
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:47,138
Ms. Kuriyama...

11
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:48,438
That's right.

12
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:51,138
She's out doing an errand for me.

13
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:00,938
Yes!

14
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:04,138
But who could it be, so early in the morning?

15
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:11,938
Huh?

16
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,938
Congratulations! Mother!

17
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:16,338
Ran?

18
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:18,438
And Conan, you too?

19
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:24,338
Well? Congratulations for what?

20
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,738
Don't tell me you forgot?

21
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,638
It's your anniversary.

22
00:03:28,638 --> 00:03:30,738
Anniversary?

23
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,838
It's not my birthday.

24
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,138
Not that.

25
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,238
Today is your... Remember, remember...

26
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:39,038
Today is the day you and dad dated for the first time.

27
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,338
It's the anniversary of your first date!

28
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:46,638
What's with the excitement?

29
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,738
I was cleaning up the bookshelf last night

30
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:51,238
and found an old album.

31
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,538
Other than the pictures,

32
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:55,338
I found a lot of things handwritten by you, mom.

33
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:57,938
First hand-made dish anniversary.

34
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,438
First argument anniversary.

35
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:03,338
Dad's first successful job anniversary.

36
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:05,338
Right, Conan?

37
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:07,338
Oh, yeah.

38
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:10,838
I guess you could call it the indiscretions of youth.

39
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,238
So as your daughter,

40
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:15,838
I thought I should congratulate you on this anniversary.

41
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,938
Sorry.

42
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:21,338
I'm afraid I just don't happen to be in the mood

43
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,838
to linger on the memory of such an old mildewed story of the past.

44
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:32,738
"Attorney Eri Kisaki Falls in Love"

45
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:38,138
And next time,

46
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:41,138
please don't bring me flowers again.

47
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:43,638
Because he'll eat them.

48
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:47,938
There seems to be flowers that are poisonous to cats.

49
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:49,838
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:52,938
Then I guess I'll decorate them in the bathroom here.

51
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,438
Let's see...

52
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:59,138
A flower vase...

53
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,838
Will you get that vase for me, Conan?

54
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,038
Okay.

55
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:10,438
Here goes.

56
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,738
No, not this.

57
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:17,738
Can you use the flower vase that's on the shelf?

58
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:20,638
Okay.

59
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:21,638
Hey...

60
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:24,638
Are you angry about something?

61
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:25,938
Huh?

62
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:27,938
No, I'm not.

63
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:30,938
But you seem a bit annoyed since we came here.

64
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,738
Hello.

65
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:43,638
This is the Kisaki Law Office.

66
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:47,638
What? Right now?

67
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:51,338
Yes, I don't mind.

68
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:53,438
Thank you very much!

69
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,138
I'll be right over then.

70
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:56,938
Yes. Yes.

71
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,138
I'm sorry, Ran.

72
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,138
I'm going out for a while.

73
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:10,938
Please take care of Goro for me, okay?

74
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,938
It's just about time for him to use the litterbox.

75
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:19,538
I'm sure Ms. Kuriyama will be back soon, too.

76
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:26,938
I wonder who it was?

77
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:28,638
The person who called her on the phone.

78
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,838
I don't know.

79
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:34,138
Maybe it's some lawyer that she owes something to?

80
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,638
Oh, hey! Don't go in there!

81
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,838
Don't go in there, kitty.

82
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:50,838
Huh? A picture?

83
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:53,138
It must've been inside this vase.

84
00:06:56,538 --> 00:07:00,538
I wonder who's the man in the picture with mom.

85
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:06,038
He must be the one who just called her a while ago.

86
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:08,538
Huh? Why do you say that?

87
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:11,538
There's a phone number written in back of the picture, right?

88
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:18,738
It's the same phone number in the calls history list.

89
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:23,738
But this man sure doesn't look like a lawyer

90
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:27,638
that she owes something to, does he?

91
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:30,738
I guess not.

92
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:35,738
It couldn't be that mother was hiding this picture,

93
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,638
that's why she didn't want me to use this vase, could it?

94
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:41,538
I think your imagination is getting the better of you.

95
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:44,238
But there's only trash inside!

96
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,738
I'm sure she set it up, so if I looked in here,

97
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,538
she could claim it was a waste paper basket.

98
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,638
Her wedding ring.

99
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,938
Come to think of it, she wasn't wearing her ring.

100
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:04,838
Which means that maybe...

101
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:07,638
She's having an affair?

102
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,538
Let's go after her, Conan!

103
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,138
I think we can still make it if we go now!

104
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:15,638
Huh?

105
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:21,438
I'm back.

106
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:24,238
Huh?

107
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,138
Ms. Kisaki? Ms. Kisaki?

108
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:31,038
The vase is on the floor

109
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:33,438
and trash is scattered,

110
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:36,538
and a mysterious bouquet of flowers.

111
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:40,138
I smell a case.

112
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,438
I guess not.

113
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,538
All right.

114
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:57,538
Conan!

115
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,038
Yeah. I'll be right there!

116
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,838
There she is!

117
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,438
There's no doubt about it.

118
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:12,138
It's that guy...

119
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:13,438
Ran.

120
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:19,138
Welcome. A table for two?

121
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:20,738
Oh, yes.

122
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:28,038
But why?

123
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:29,738
Why would mother...

124
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,038
There's no use thinking.

125
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,238
I'll go ask her directly.

126
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:39,038
Why don't you wait and see?

127
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:42,938
We don't know if he's a bad guy or not.

128
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:44,838
Well, that's true...

129
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,238
Meg.

130
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:53,438
You're as beautiful as ever, sweechi.

131
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,438
Thank you!

132
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:58,138
Sweechi?

133
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:01,038
What's with the baby talk?

134
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:04,538
But he doesn't look like her love mate.

135
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,838
I don't think he is Ms. Kisaki's type.

136
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:10,938
But Dad also does that when he gets drunk.

137
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:15,738
"Ran, sweechi. Could you get me another drinky?"

138
00:10:15,738 --> 00:10:18,038
I mean, he baby talks a lot.

139
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:21,538
And everyone knows that dad likes women.

140
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:25,338
So although very unlikely, he could be mom's type.

141
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,438
Look, Conan!

142
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:34,038
Look at the guy's arm.

143
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:35,938
It's full of scratches.

144
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:39,838
I guess he's not that much of a good person after all.

145
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:41,938
Oh, hey.

146
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:47,638
Mom.

147
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:49,638
She's shaking?

148
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,538
The shaking...

149
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:54,038
No matter what I do,

150
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:55,538
the shaking won't stop.

151
00:10:57,938 --> 00:10:59,638
She's crying.

152
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:04,138
Mom rarely ever sheds tears.

153
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:09,338
Why would she...

154
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:11,638
cry over a womanizer, baby talker like him?

155
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,738
Why him?

156
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:16,738
Wait a second.

157
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:20,638
The picture, trash and ring that were hidden in the vase,

158
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,638
the impulsive baby talk,

159
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:26,238
the many scratches on his arm,

160
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:29,738
and the words that came out with tears,

161
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:31,238
"The shaking won't stop."

162
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:36,038
How can I...

163
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:37,538
Don't worry.

164
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,838
I'm sure it's just a dream.

165
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:43,038
It's all just a dream.

166
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,838
Huh?

167
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:49,038
So after seducing mom and making her cry,

168
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:51,338
he's convincing her that it was just a dream and dumping her!

169
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,238
I won't forgive him.

170
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:59,238
I'll never forgive that guy!

171
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:10,186
I see. So that's what it was.

172
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:13,986
If my deduction is correct, that guy is...

173
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:15,986
From the way he baby talks,

174
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,486
the many scratches on his arms

175
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:22,486
and the fact that she's meeting him at a place like this.

176
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:28,286
Her shedding tears in front of him saying, "The shaking won't stop."

177
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,986
And the reply he gave her.

178
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:34,986
Don't worry. I'm sure it's just a dream.

179
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,186
It's all just a dream.

180
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:40,986
Everything falls into place.

181
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:44,686
The reason the wedding ring along with the crumpled papers

182
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:49,186
was found inside the flower vase was probably...

183
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:53,286
Ran, it's a mistake.

184
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:56,086
That guy is not having an affair with your mother.

185
00:12:57,686 --> 00:13:00,186
I won't forgive him.

186
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:03,386
That guy, never...

187
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,586
Shoots!

188
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,486
-Huh? -Huh?

189
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:23,186
You've got it all wrong!

190
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:24,186
Ran?

191
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:28,486
That guy is...

192
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:31,286
He's just a vet!

193
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,286
A vet?

194
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:40,786
This baby talk womanizer?

195
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,886
I don't think he's a womanizer.

196
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:48,286
But he was making passes to the woman just a while ago!

197
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,386
Meg. You're as beautiful as ever, sweechi.

198
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:52,486
Right?

199
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:54,886
He wasn't saying that to the lady,

200
00:13:54,886 --> 00:13:59,086
but to the dog she was carrying.

201
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:05,586
They say there are many vets who baby talk when examining animals.

202
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:07,986
I think he just talked that way impulsively?

203
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:10,386
Isn't that right, sir?

204
00:14:10,386 --> 00:14:11,686
Yeah.

205
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:16,286
By the way, the scratches on his arms were made by animals.

206
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:19,886
Not all animals are quiet when they're being examined.

207
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:24,786
Besides, he was also flipping over the dog's ear.

208
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:26,286
Ear?

209
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:27,686
Yeah.

210
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:29,886
He was checking the inside of the ear

211
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:33,886
and smelling it to see if the dog was sick or not.

212
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:35,886
That's how I figured it out.

213
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:38,686
Only a vet does something like that.

214
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:45,786
I heard them saying that on a special program of vets on TV.

215
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:49,486
But you were crying, mom.

216
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:51,486
You said you couldn't stop shaking.

217
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:53,886
You were also shedding tears.

218
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:57,286
And he answered that it was a dream or something to that effect.

219
00:14:57,286 --> 00:14:59,786
How silly.

220
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:04,486
I was talking about Goro, not me.

221
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,986
Goro?

222
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:11,586
Goro suddenly began twitching in his sleep.

223
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,486
The twitching wouldn't stop for some time.

224
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:17,886
The cats I had before have never acted like that.

225
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:22,286
I was worried sick that it might be some kind of illness.

226
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:25,886
That's why I came to talk it over with Dr. Tobe.

227
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,486
I was so busy with work

228
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:30,586
and couldn't make it while his clinic was open,

229
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:35,886
so I called to ask him if he could somehow make time for me somewhere.

230
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:39,286
And today he returned my call.

231
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,786
He told me there's a dog cafe that he visits every morning.

232
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:44,886
He would like to hear my concern out here.

233
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:48,886
You mean that was the call you got when we were at your office?

234
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:50,686
Yes.

235
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:52,786
I wanted to bring Goro here with me

236
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,686
and have Dr. Tobe examine him directly.

237
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:58,786
But since this is a dog cafe...

238
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:01,686
Then the dream was...

239
00:16:01,686 --> 00:16:04,486
It is the cause of the shaking.

240
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:06,486
It happens sometimes.

241
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:08,486
Some cats dream that they are playing in their sleep

242
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:12,486
and twitch because their nerves react.

243
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:16,786
Remember? Pops usually flings his arms up in joy when sleeping.

244
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,086
It's the same thing.

245
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,286
There it comes! It's a dark horse!

246
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:23,386
Cats do stuff like that, too?

247
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:27,686
Yeah, cats and humans are alike in that aspect.

248
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,186
They talk in their sleep, too.

249
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:34,786
So, I don't think there's anything to worry about, Mrs. Mouri.

250
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,686
I see. I'm glad.

251
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,086
Really.

252
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,686
But, mom, how terrible!

253
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:45,286
How could you throw your wedding ring in the trash?

254
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:46,786
Trash?

255
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,586
The vase that I tried to put the flowers in this morning

256
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:52,186
and you told me not to.

257
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:57,286
I found it thrown away along with crumpled paper after you left.

258
00:16:57,286 --> 00:17:00,786
I thought I lost it somewhere,

259
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,186
but that's where it was.

260
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:06,686
You mean you didn't put it in there?

261
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:09,286
That's Goro's toy box.

262
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:12,386
Those crumpled piece of papers are Goro's toy.

263
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,986
He plays soccer with them.

264
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,886
He's such a good boy

265
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:20,586
that he puts everything inside that vase after he finishes playing.

266
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:23,586
I did see him playing with that ring once.

267
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:26,086
He must've found it on the desk or something

268
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,286
and put it away together with the other things.

269
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:31,886
He put Dr. Tobe's picture in there, too.

270
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:36,086
So you weren't the one who hid it there.

271
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:38,986
I see.

272
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:40,286
You thought that I hid the ring

273
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:44,086
and was seeing a man you didn't know.

274
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:47,886
You thought I was having an affair?

275
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,886
Yeah.

276
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:55,986
Well, you looked sort of annoyed before you left.

277
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:59,186
But after the phone call, you went out looking happy.

278
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,086
I couldn't help it.

279
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:03,686
I was worried about Goro

280
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:07,986
and I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to make you worry.

281
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:13,686
Now that you know what's going on, go home!

282
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:18,086
You're going to the karate club camp this afternoon, right?

283
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:19,686
Oh, right.

284
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:22,586
She's scary.

285
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:30,486
Nice meeting you. Goodbye!

286
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,486
Conan!

287
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,586
Let's go!

288
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:37,486
Thank you.

289
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,586
Goodness.

290
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,586
But too bad.

291
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:48,886
I was kind of expecting a kind of...

292
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:51,986
love affair, you know?

293
00:18:51,986 --> 00:18:53,386
Huh?

294
00:18:58,386 --> 00:18:59,586
What's the matter?

295
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:04,386
Something about how mom's acting today bothers me.

296
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:07,986
She doesn't seem to be her usual self.

297
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:11,286
Like she said, that's because she was worried about Goro.

298
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:13,886
No, that's not it.

299
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,986
She just didn't seem to be herself.

300
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,686
So...

301
00:19:22,686 --> 00:19:26,186
That outfit you're wearing with the chest part being open like that.

302
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:29,886
You usually don't dress like that.

303
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:32,786
I thought that maybe you were using your cat

304
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:36,086
as an excuse to come to see me.

305
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:42,486
You know that I'm hurt over having separated from my wife last year.

306
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:45,686
Am I wrong?

307
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,486
Oh, well...

308
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,286
That's not really...

309
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:52,486
That's right! It's what she was wearing!

310
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:56,486
She usually doesn't wear something provocative like that.

311
00:19:58,186 --> 00:20:01,986
I'm sure that mom did have some feelings for him after all.

312
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:03,486
Oh, wait.

313
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,886
I'm going back to that cafe again!

314
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:07,186
Ran!

315
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:10,286
Why did we go there?

316
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:12,086
Huh?

317
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,186
Why did we go there?

318
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:19,986
Look. Why did we go to your mother's office?

319
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,286
Did you forget?

320
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,386
We were cleaning the bookshelf

321
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:25,986
and found an old album.

322
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:29,286
Inside the album, there was a picture of mom and dad

323
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:30,986
on their first date.

324
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:35,986
The picture...

325
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,786
First date anniversary?

326
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:41,886
You're wearing the same outfit you wore then?

327
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:44,386
Yes. I'm a bit too old for this already, but...

328
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:52,386
Today after work and after I had you examine Goro,

329
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:56,486
I was planning to go to dinner with him.

330
00:20:56,486 --> 00:21:02,286
I figured if I met him wearing this outfit, we could laugh and make up.

331
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:06,986
Then, why don't you two hurry and get back together again?

332
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:09,686
It's not all that simple.

333
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,586
Besides, my daughter found out that today was the day,

334
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:17,186
so I pretended not to care.

335
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:20,286
I guess I'm going to call off my plan.

336
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:25,486
What a lucky guy your husband is.

337
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:29,286
Having you think of him that much.

338
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:31,586
Thank you.

339
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:35,586
But I'm sure he's already forgotten.

340
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:40,686
That nice day is an old memory after all.

341
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,886
Hey, Kogoro!

342
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:18,986
No good, he's totally wasted.

343
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:20,186
Strange.

344
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:25,286
Just until a few minutes ago, he was grumbling and glaring at his phone.

345
00:23:25,286 --> 00:23:28,786
I wonder why he's dressed up like this though.

346
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:31,686
It's as if he's ready to go on a date or something.

347
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,186
Look at him, all sprawled out.

348
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:38,686
Gosh. I wonder who he took after.

349
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,486
Really?

350
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,586
I wonder who he took after.

351
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:53,786
How can I focus on camp now?

352
00:23:56,486 --> 00:24:01,586
"Next Episode"

353
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:03,086
We need an ambulance right away!

354
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,186
He looks familiar.

355
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:10,186
Who was the car after at that time? Mr. Tatematsu or Mr. Okonogi?

356
00:24:11,186 --> 00:24:15,086
I wonder if this case is really that simple.

357
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:20,286
If so, there must be somebody who saw the culprit!

358
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:26,486
Next Conan, "Bad Luck Grand Prix"

359
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:44,386
Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:46,486
"Luck of a bad person"

361
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,986
Detective Conan is not going to be aired again next week.

362
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,286
I wonder if I'm a jinx.

363
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:51,086
After this break, there will be no break for a consecutive 10 weeks!
