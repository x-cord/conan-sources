1
00:00:00,547 --> 00:00:04,747
Ran's mother and an attorney, Eri Kisaki, was kidnapped.

2
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:08,946
However, Attorney Kisaki escaped from her captors,

3
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:11,846
hid in the abandoned building

4
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,046
and used the phone she stole from the kidnappers

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,946
to ask Ran for help.

6
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:16,947
"Eri Kisaki"

7
00:00:18,147 --> 00:00:21,446
"I've been captured by some bad people."

8
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:24,546
"Could you call the police?"

9
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:26,446
What?

10
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:30,447
Is that true?

11
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:35,946
She responded.

12
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:38,346
She says she doesn't know where she is.

13
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:43,146
Darn! Sounds like she was kidnapped from her office.

14
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:46,446
"Eri Kisaki: Just kidding! I'm joking!" -It was just a joke?

15
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,446
Geez, Mom.

16
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,146
But wait...

17
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:52,146
Look.

18
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:53,546
The icons are different.

19
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:57,646
They're probably not the same Eri you just added.

20
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:58,946
Hold on.

21
00:00:58,947 --> 00:01:02,846
If the person using Eri's usual icon is an impostor...

22
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:08,046
The one without an icon is the real Mom...

23
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,146
"What are you talking about? I'm the real Eri!"

24
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:11,646
Darn it.

25
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:15,946
Now we don't know which messages are coming from the real Eri.

26
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:17,046
We do.

27
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:19,346
-Huh? -What?

28
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:21,746
You can tell, Conan?

29
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:24,346
Attorney Kisaki is a lawyer, right?

30
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:25,646
Yeah...

31
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:29,746
Shinichi told me lawyers use Western commas

32
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:30,747
"Japanese Comma" -instead of Japanese commas

33
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:32,846
"Western Comma" -in their documents

34
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:35,846
when writing horizontally.

35
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:40,746
That habit shows up in their normal writing, too.

36
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:42,146
You're right.

37
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:44,646
The messages I received from Mom before

38
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,846
all have Western commas.

39
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:49,046
Using what few hints we could gather

40
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:50,846
from our exchanges with Attorney Kisaki,

41
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:53,247
we headed out to rescue her but...

42
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:58,146
Which means it's likely she's hiding in a closed space

43
00:01:58,147 --> 00:02:02,546
where she can't see out any windows.

44
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:05,146
Focus your search on those kinds of places.

45
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:06,546
Got it.

46
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:11,346
So we need to search all the lockers and drawers in this building.

47
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:12,546
That's right.

48
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:14,747
I'll call you if we find her.

49
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,646
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

50
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,646
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

51
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,246
Her life depends on a game of hide-and-seek!

52
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,646
Hurry, Pops! Get there in time, Ran!

53
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,246
He sees through the one and only truth.

54
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,246
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

55
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:13,747
His name is Detective Conan!

56
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:59,657
"Attorney Kisaki's SOS (Part 2)"

57
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,156
Huh?

58
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,956
What are you doing, you idiot?

59
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,956
She can't hide in there!

60
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:31,856
And your stomach's growling.

61
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:33,356
She doesn't seem to be in here.

62
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:34,556
Let's go.

63
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:35,657
Okay.

64
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:44,357
I'm lucky that I'm hungry.

65
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:03,056
Zojo Temple?

66
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:04,656
What are we doing here?

67
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,756
Conan said to come here.

68
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:09,156
Let me see your phone.

69
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:11,456
Wait, Conan!

70
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:13,456
Attorney Kisaki, are you listening?

71
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,856
There's going to be another loud noise shortly.

72
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:17,556
If you hear the sound,

73
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:20,356
could you tap your phone with your fingernail again?

74
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:22,756
You'll know what sound I'm talking about

75
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,757
as soon as you hear it!

76
00:06:29,257 --> 00:06:31,056
About one second.

77
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,956
Based on the speed of sound,

78
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:36,756
she's about 340 m from here.

79
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:39,556
She's somewhere one kilometer from the church next to the detective agency

80
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:43,057
and 340 m from Zojo Temple.

81
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:49,356
In other words, Attorney Kisaki is in either Buroku-cho or Sutan-cho.

82
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:51,356
But which is it?

83
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:56,057
Both districts have abandoned buildings a kidnapper could use.

84
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:01,156
I told you,

85
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,556
I'm not hungry!

86
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:08,956
Liar! Your stomach was growling in that room.

87
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,356
-Hey. -Huh?

88
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:12,956
Take me to that room.

89
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:15,157
But no one was in there.

90
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:21,657
It seems the doe we're hunting is hungry.

91
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:24,456
Seriously?

92
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,456
She really isn't in here.

93
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:29,756
No, these drawers are still warm.

94
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:32,156
She was hiding here until recently,

95
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,356
but moved somewhere else.

96
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:35,556
Hey...

97
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,556
If she got out of here,

98
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,256
then she must have seen what's outside the window, right?

99
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:44,056
If she and her daughter are messaging each other separately

100
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,656
through the app,

101
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:48,856
she might have told her where we are.

102
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:50,156
Calm down.

103
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:52,756
I've already hacked his phone.

104
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:54,956
As long as she's using it,

105
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:58,756
we'll know everything she and her daughter

106
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,456
say to each other.

107
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:02,156
Yeah, but...

108
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:03,656
Besides,

109
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:07,456
even if she tells her what she sees out the window,

110
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:11,356
we'll know where she's hiding right now.

111
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,556
You're right.

112
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:14,257
You're always so smart.

113
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:17,356
I see.

114
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:20,457
If they can read all our messages...

115
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:23,257
I'll have to risk it.

116
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:26,056
Please.

117
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:27,357
Please figure it out.

118
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:31,856
Conan, what are you doing?

119
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:33,457
Sorry.

120
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,756
You got a message from Attorney Kisaki.

121
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:39,256
What? No way.

122
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,056
She said, "The crab's only half-boiled,"

123
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:44,556
"but as a result, the two swordfish look delicious."

124
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,556
"Since it's light out tonight, why don't we eat outside?"

125
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:49,856
What is this?

126
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:53,456
This is no time to be talking about food.

127
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:56,056
"The crab's only half-boiled,"

128
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:59,756
"but as a result, the two swordfish look delicious."

129
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:02,256
"Since it's light out tonight,"

130
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:04,357
"why don't we eat outside?"

131
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:06,657
A full moon.

132
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,156
Two swordfish.

133
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,257
And a half-boiled crab.

134
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:16,956
I see.

135
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,256
So that's how it is.

136
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:21,656
Sutan-cho?

137
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:26,156
Yeah. Attorney Kisaki is probably somewhere in Sutan-cho.

138
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:27,956
Are you sure, Conan?

139
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:30,656
How do you know that?

140
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,956
I get that Eri's in either Buroku-cho or Sutan-cho

141
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:35,856
since they're within the overlapping area

142
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:39,056
of a one kilometer radius circle

143
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:41,256
around the church next to the office

144
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:43,156
and the 340 m radius circle around here,

145
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:46,156
but how were you able to narrow it down to Sutan-cho?

146
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:49,356
The message Attorney Kisaki just sent us.

147
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:50,556
Huh?

148
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,056
Let's see.

149
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,556
It said, "The crab's only half-boiled,"

150
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:56,556
"but as a result, the two swordfish look delicious."

151
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:59,956
"Since it's light out tonight, why don't we eat outside?"

152
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:02,056
What about this says Sutan-cho?

153
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:04,756
Crabs are black when they're alive,

154
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,856
but they turn red once they're boiled, right?

155
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,656
Yeah...

156
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:13,256
So if they're half-boiled, then they're not very red.

157
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:15,356
In other words, something that's normally red

158
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:18,356
that's still partially black.

159
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:20,156
Something that's normally red...

160
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:24,556
But still partially black right now?

161
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,156
"Since it's light out tonight"

162
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:30,156
refers to the full moon out tonight.

163
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:33,956
And there's only one building that shuts off half its lights

164
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,857
when there's a full moon out.

165
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:42,256
The Toto Tower!

166
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:43,356
Now that you mention it,

167
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:47,756
the top half of its lights are off tonight.

168
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:53,556
I've heard the Toto Tower shuts off half its lights on full moons

169
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:59,256
so the moon can be seen more clearly.

170
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:04,156
Then what does "the two swordfish look delicious" mean?

171
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:07,556
The "delicious" refers to something that looks pretty,

172
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:10,156
and the English word for the animal is swordfish.

173
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,656
Sword refers to a blade or katana.

174
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:14,656
Since there are two of them,

175
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:17,856
she's telling you to think of something with two blades.

176
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:20,056
Something with...

177
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,356
Two blades?

178
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:26,157
Wasn't there a really strong samurai who used two swords?

179
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:29,256
The two-sword fighter Musashi Miyamoto!

180
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:34,256
That's right. And what building is related to Musashi?

181
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:35,656
Speaking of Musashi,

182
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:38,856
the Bell Tree Tower is 634 m tall,

183
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,556
which spells Mu-sa-shi (Six-three-four), right?

184
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:44,456
Yeah. If she's able to see the Bell Tree Tower clearly

185
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:47,656
because the Toto Tower is darkened,

186
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:51,556
then Attorney Kisaki must be someplace

187
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,256
she can see the Bell Tree Tower behind the Toto Tower

188
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:55,157
or somewhere in Sutan-cho.

189
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:58,756
Hey, this can't be good!

190
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:01,256
After that lawyer sent some nonsensical message

191
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:04,656
about crabs and swordfish to her daughter,

192
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:09,356
and looks like she keeps getting closer.

193
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:14,056
Even though I'm sending her false information as the lawyer.

194
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,057
Let me see that.

195
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:17,957
"No! I'm not in Sutan-cho!"

196
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:18,957
"I'm not sure. When I escaped from the suitcase,"

197
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:19,957
"I was already inside."

198
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,456
It's the commas.

199
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:24,156
The commas?

200
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:28,056
She was using Western commas instead of Japanese commas

201
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:31,456
to help her daughter differentiate between our messages and hers.

202
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:32,756
Now that we know that,

203
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:35,856
send her messages using Western commas.

204
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:38,556
That should confuse her daughter again.

205
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,456
Got it.

206
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:43,956
Well, even if her daughter gets here,

207
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:48,856
we'll just capture her and skin her along with her mother.

208
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:53,556
Hey, what kind of building did Eri say it is?

209
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:54,656
No way!

210
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,256
The guys who kidnapped Mom

211
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:58,656
started using Western commas in their messages.

212
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:00,056
What?

213
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:03,056
"I'm not sure. When I escaped from the suitcase,"

214
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:05,556
"I was already inside."

215
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:10,656
"Based on the walls, I think it's a reinforced concrete building."

216
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,256
"Don't be fooled!"

217
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:16,456
"The walls are wood, so it could be a wooden building."

218
00:13:16,457 --> 00:13:19,556
Reinforced concrete? Wood?

219
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:20,857
Which is it?

220
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:23,756
This isn't good.

221
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:26,556
They noticed I was using Western commas.

222
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,257
Then how about this?

223
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:34,557
She responded.

224
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,456
"The first floor is a garage."

225
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:42,356
"I think it has some yellowish warm mouse-gray shutters."

226
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:44,156
"There aren't any gray shutters!"

227
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,156
"It was a wooden door!"

228
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:50,356
Darn! Now we don't know

229
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:52,156
if there are shutters or a wooden door.

230
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:55,556
No, it's the mouse-gray shutters.

231
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:57,656
What? How do you know?

232
00:13:57,657 --> 00:14:00,256
Because Mom told me before

233
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:04,756
that things with animal names seem warmer.

234
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:08,356
Anyway, which gloves do you prefer?

235
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:13,056
Well, I guess I'd choose the black ones.

236
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:17,656
Oh, I prefer the gray ones.

237
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,256
Really?

238
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:21,156
Because they're mouse-gray.

239
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:25,657
Don't things seem warmer when they have animal names?

240
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:36,957
Yellowish mouse-gray shutters...

241
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:41,457
It's this abandoned building!

242
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:56,793
That's...

243
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,392
Ran! Honey!

244
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:02,192
I'm up here!

245
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,892
-Eri! -Mom!

246
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,793
We're on our way!

247
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:11,593
I finally caught you, you tricky little lawyer.

248
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:16,992
We wanted to film you apologizing to us naked,

249
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:19,193
but it looks like the police are coming.

250
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,292
So we'll settle for knocking you out,

251
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,192
stripping you naked,

252
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:26,393
and uploading a dirty video of you to the web.

253
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,193
You idiot.

254
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:34,792
The only person in this world

255
00:15:34,793 --> 00:15:37,993
who's allowed to see Eri naked is me!

256
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:40,593
Darn it!

257
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,193
Osoto!

258
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,292
Into...

259
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,393
triangle choke!

260
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,592
Honey, are you all right?

261
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:06,592
Yeah. Anyway, who is this guy?

262
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:10,592
An abusive husband whose wife divorced him.

263
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:13,792
In order to get revenge for losing to me in court,

264
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:18,292
he gathered a group of other husbands who lost to me to kidnap me,

265
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:21,392
so they could film a video of me apologizing.

266
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,392
I see.

267
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:25,292
Anyway, where are the other two?

268
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:26,492
Huh?

269
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:29,692
The skinny gambler and the fat cheater.

270
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:32,692
They should still be somewhere inside this building.

271
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,393
Oh, in that case...

272
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:40,493
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

273
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:47,092
What's going on?

274
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,193
Hey!

275
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:59,593
Hey, get out of the way!

276
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:08,893
I won a kendo tournament once...

277
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:22,492
Ran, are you okay?

278
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,592
Yeah, I'm fine.

279
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:27,792
I'm more worried about Mom.

280
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,792
Actually...

281
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:34,192
I'm more worried about these two.

282
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:35,593
Although...

283
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:41,893
She won the moment she kicked in the shutter.

284
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:47,992
By the way, honey...

285
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,092
Huh?

286
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,292
How did you come in through the window?

287
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:53,092
We're on the fourth floor.

288
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:56,092
Well, you know.

289
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,592
"You know"?

290
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,992
Was there an emergency staircase outside?

291
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:02,692
What does it matter?

292
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:04,593
Don't worry about the details.

293
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,592
That's right.

294
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:09,292
It's an abandoned building in Sutan-cho.

295
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:11,693
Please get here immediately, Officer Takagi.

296
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:17,492
Now that we've called the police, this case is solved.

297
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:20,692
No, there's still one thing that hasn't been solved.

298
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:21,793
Huh?

299
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:25,592
You, Conan.

300
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:27,692
What? Me?

301
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:30,592
The detective skills you demonstrated to get us here.

302
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:33,892
It's hard to think that was the work of a grade school student.

303
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,593
Conan, are you...

304
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:47,392
Yeah, you're right.

305
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,493
Huh?

306
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:52,393
It's exactly what you think.

307
00:18:57,793 --> 00:18:59,892
-See? -Huh?

308
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,192
What?

309
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:03,092
"Shinichi" -You heard him.

310
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:06,392
I was so busy giving instructions to the kid,

311
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:09,192
I didn't get to eat dinner.

312
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,792
Tell your mom to check who it is

313
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:16,592
before opening the door for any clients without appointments.

314
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:17,892
Later.

315
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:20,792
Hey, wait. Shinichi!

316
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,492
He was talking to me on the phone the whole time,

317
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:28,592
since you and your mom were busy chatting.

318
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:33,592
I see. You were holding your phone the whole time.

319
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:35,992
So that's what it was.

320
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:38,792
Huh? I thought you noticed...

321
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:41,993
You really are just Conan.

322
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:45,692
Right.

323
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:46,993
Of course.

324
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,292
That was close.

325
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,792
So she did suspect me.

326
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,292
I was right to record my own voice.

327
00:19:58,293 --> 00:20:01,092
"The Metropolitan Police Department" -Good work, Takagi.

328
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:03,292
No, thank you, Mouri.

329
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:05,992
I'd like to interview you about the case,

330
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:07,392
so if you could come down to the station...

331
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:08,592
I can't.

332
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:11,892
Sorry, but that'll have to wait until tomorrow.

333
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:16,393
I've got a dinner and movie date with my wife after this.

334
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:21,093
Right?

335
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:23,593
Yes.

336
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,892
No way. They're interlocking fingers.

337
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:33,993
Is this what you call a lucky hit?

338
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:43,792
In that case,

339
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:46,692
then I'll call you later to arrange a time.

340
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:48,892
Please do.

341
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,692
Thank you.

342
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:52,793
In that case, enjoy your evening.

343
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:23,092
"Court Detective, Saki Kirie" -No, I didn't just win the case.

344
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,992
I, Saki Kirie, simply saw the truth.

345
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:28,092
That's right.

346
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,492
You only ever need...

347
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:33,792
one truth.

348
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:36,592
She's so cute.

349
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:39,092
That was great.

350
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:42,592
The incompetent detective character wasn't a bad guy either.

351
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:43,692
Yeah.

352
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:45,592
What is this?

353
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:47,592
Huh?

354
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:50,592
She was giving out objections like candy.

355
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:53,592
You'd just be making a terrible impression

356
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:56,092
on the court by pestering them,

357
00:22:56,093 --> 00:23:00,092
and there's no way a lawyer could suddenly make a witness speak

358
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,392
without permission from the judge.

359
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:03,592
The scene in which she drunkenly

360
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:06,292
complained about the case to the bartender

361
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,892
was presented as comical,

362
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:11,992
but she'd be disciplined for breaking confidentiality like that.

363
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:16,192
And how dare she speak so highhandedly in court?

364
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:19,792
Wasn't that unduly pretentious?

365
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:22,092
You're not that different.

366
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:25,292
Maybe they modelled her character after you.

367
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,792
That can't be.

368
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:28,792
I'm nothing like her.

369
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:30,092
Yeah, you're right!

370
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:34,392
-Yoko's a better lawyer than you! -Why does it always turn out this way?

371
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:35,592
Come to think of it,

372
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:38,692
"Eri Kisaki" -Saki Kirie is an anagram of Eri Kisaki...

373
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,193
"Saki Kirie" -Saki Kirie is an anagram of Eri Kisaki...

374
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:46,592
"Next Episode" -Why do I have to apologize?

375
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,992
Don't play dumb! You know exactly why!

376
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:52,192
"Hiroshi Kagazume" -Two Nichiuri Sports reporters

377
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:54,592
"Akira Hashizume" -famous for their articles on scandals.

378
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:56,093
And that...

379
00:23:57,893 --> 00:24:00,092
turned out the worst way possible.

380
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,792
Was it suicide?

381
00:24:01,793 --> 00:24:04,892
That's what we thought at first, but...

382
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,393
Footprints?

383
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:12,593
