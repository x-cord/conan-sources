1
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:05,347
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:07,247
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:08,947
This is an eerie 3-part story.

4
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:10,747
The map of the fires are trying to tell us something.

5
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:12,547
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:14,447
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,448
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:56,404 --> 00:02:02,403
"Red Horse In The Fire (Case)"

9
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:06,903
So, that was when I told that lady to back off.

10
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:09,203
I told her to give in,

11
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:13,404
that she had no chance of winning this game.

12
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,603
But it's all thanks to Pops.

13
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,303
Because he solved the hidden message that Heiji had put in the code

14
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:22,904
and saved us.

15
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,103
What?

16
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,403
-We... -Well, let bygones be bygones!

17
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:32,903
Pops, your glass is empty.

18
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,604
Here, have another shot.

19
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:39,803
You're the one who brought the subject up.

20
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:42,503
But that lady was really the pits.

21
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:45,303
She tried to burn us to death.

22
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:47,003
Burn you to death?

23
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:48,703
She was going to set fire to her own house

24
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,503
and tell the court that somebody who held a grudge on her

25
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,803
set fire to her house,

26
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,703
didn't make it out of the house in time and burned to death.

27
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:58,403
Well, that sure was dangerous.

28
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:00,803
If worse came to worse, it could've been blamed on

29
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:04,003
the arsonist that's been causing panic in this area.

30
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,603
An arsonist?

31
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:07,003
From the start of this year,

32
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:09,803
there have been a series of arson cases.

33
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:13,203
A series, which means that the method of arson is the same?

34
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:16,803
No. There's no similarity in the method of arson,

35
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:20,403
but there's always this one thing left at the site of the fire.

36
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:22,704
A doll of a red horse.

37
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,103
A red horse?

38
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:27,603
I see.

39
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:32,303
The arsonist is hinting on the code word of the police "Red horse".

40
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,503
What?

41
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,903
The arsonist is probably making fun of the police

42
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,303
and provoking the police,

43
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:42,603
"I'm the arsonist. Catch me if you can."

44
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:45,303
Well, but it's fortunate that

45
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:49,104
nobody died in the three arsons committed so far.

46
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:54,403
And? Are the three cases connected in any way?

47
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:58,403
Well, it seems that these three cases are not connected at all.

48
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,203
The addresses are scattered, too.

49
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:03,703
The first one was at Rizencho 1-chome,

50
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:07,003
the second at Toriyacho 2-chome

51
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:09,804
and the third at Okuhocho 3-chome.

52
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:14,403
Which means the next arson will be in the 4-chome area somewhere.

53
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:15,803
Yeah.

54
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:20,303
If the arsonist is setting fire at random, it's possible,

55
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:24,403
so the police is keeping an eye on the 4-chome area within town.

56
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:27,703
But there are so many 4-chomes all over the place.

57
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:31,203
But I know of a house that may be a target.

58
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,803
What?

59
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:35,803
I was asked by Mr. Kusukawa a while ago

60
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:36,903
to go over to a person's house

61
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:38,803
to take over investigation of a suspicious person

62
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:42,403
that was seen late at night loitering around a house

63
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:45,003
near Haidocho 4-chome.

64
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,603
Well, I don't really have anywhere to go this holiday,

65
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:51,203
so I'll take Pops and this kid go to that person's house tomorrow.

66
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,203
Okay, kid?

67
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:55,603
You can take dad, but not Conan.

68
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:56,704
What?

69
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:00,803
Excursion?

70
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:03,803
We may be able to get a clue to the serial arsonist

71
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,403
and you're going to go hand in hand on an excursion, you brat?

72
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:10,303
What's the big deal? He's only a kid.

73
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:13,903
But I wonder if the weather's going to be okay. It's still raining.

74
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:17,703
It'll be fine, because of this!

75
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:21,503
This sunny boy doll always cleared the weather

76
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:24,203
for Shinichi's important soccer matches.

77
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:26,703
Ran, you make me so jealous!

78
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:30,003
Well, it's hard going to root for him in the rain besides.

79
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,903
That's why it's most likely going to be a fine day tomorrow, Conan.

80
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:34,304
Yes.

81
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:40,004
"Mouri Detective Agency"

82
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:05,503
Strange.

83
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:08,803
The odds of the rain clearing used to be 100%.

84
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:11,903
Maybe you didn't wish hard enough, Ran.

85
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,403
Because it's not for Shinichi.

86
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:17,503
Don't be ridiculous! That's not true!

87
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:19,603
Huh? Strange.

88
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:21,003
When we hung it out last night,

89
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:22,904
it was facing out towards the window.

90
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:26,903
Well, it can't be helped.

91
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:30,903
The weather depends on the mood of the sun.

92
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:32,804
Don't tell me that he...

93
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:38,503
Your sunny boy doll's starting to take effect now?

94
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:40,903
Well, too bad.

95
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:44,503
The heavens are going to punish you one of these days.

96
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,303
We'll do some more shopping and go home.

97
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:51,603
Heiji and Pops, work hard at your detective job!

98
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:52,803
Yeah.

99
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,304
Let's go, Conan.

100
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:58,203
Those two really get along well, don't they?

101
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:01,503
Kazuha, don't tell me that you're jealous of Conan?

102
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,403
That's not it!

103
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:06,303
And? What time and where in 4-chome?

104
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:08,203
What? Let's see.

105
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:11,704
Haidocho 4-chome at the Moromizu residence at 16:00.

106
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:18,003
Don't worry, because Pop's agency is not on 4-chome.

107
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,703
I see.

108
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:22,403
"Morozumi" -There! Here it is!

109
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:25,703
But we're 30 minutes late for the appointment.

110
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:27,803
What should we do?

111
00:07:27,804 --> 00:07:30,403
It's only 30 minutes.

112
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:31,903
Mr. Kusukawa told me not to be late

113
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:35,104
because this person's really fussy about time.

114
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:38,003
Hello.

115
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,604
I don't need any!

116
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,403
Please leave!

117
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:46,004
I'm going to call the police if you don't!

118
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:52,903
So like I told you, I'm not here to sell anything to you.

119
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,103
"Takanori Genda (42)" -I just brought some catalogs of

120
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:59,203
the hanging scrolls and vases that we sell in our store.

121
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:01,003
I've been telling you for a while now.

122
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:04,403
I'm not interested in dusty junk like that!

123
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:08,303
Then I'll leave our catalog and a key holder

124
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:09,503
that will bring about good business,

125
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:12,403
so please stop by at our shop when you feel like it.

126
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:15,503
No need to worry. I'm not so hard up for money

127
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:17,704
that I have to rely on something like that!

128
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:22,203
Go on! And leave right this minute!

129
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:24,604
I'm sorry to have intruded on you.

130
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:33,903
And? Now, what's with all of you?

131
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:37,904
Well, we're detectives here in place of Mr. Kusukawa.

132
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:41,103
Never mind that case already.

133
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,603
It seems to have been my imagination.

134
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,103
What?

135
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:50,503
Hey. What's the story?

136
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:52,103
It can't be helped

137
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:55,403
because Mr. Kusukawa was confined from 3 days ago.

138
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:59,703
But, isn't it strange to say that it was just her imagination

139
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:01,803
when she was troubled enough to hire a detective?

140
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:05,604
Yeah. I swear there's something fishy about that lady.

141
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:17,403
Hello.

142
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:19,703
You're early today, Sensei.

143
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:23,403
See! I did just as you told me.

144
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:26,003
"Misao Soga (45)" -From Feng Shui's point of view,

145
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,703
it is very good to decorate ceramic ware,

146
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:30,103
which is said to be great for any direction,

147
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,503
at the front door of the house that is the entrance of good luck.

148
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,204
Well, let's talk inside.

149
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:38,903
He's just a teacher of Feng Shui.

150
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:41,403
May I help you?

151
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:43,203
Nothing really.

152
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:45,604
Talk about a lot of make-up.

153
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:50,303
Hey, what's with you?

154
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:52,603
I thought I told you not to come here anymore, Keiko!

155
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:54,803
Don't get angry at me, Ryoko.

156
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:57,003
I've been unlucky this month.

157
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,004
So, I wonder if you can spare 100,000 yen...

158
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:59,603
No, 50,000 yen will do.

159
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:02,203
If you're unlucky, why don't you do something about it

160
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:03,704
with your own fortune-telling?

161
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:14,104
She's a fortune-teller.

162
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:18,903
Gosh. Two hours have passed already.

163
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:22,403
Waiting in a place like this is going to get us nowhere.

164
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:26,503
But the man that just went in hasn't come out yet.

165
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:28,904
I'll go check inside.

166
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:31,904
Hey!

167
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,304
Hey, you!

168
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:52,903
He seems to be looking for something.

169
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,104
Yeah.

170
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:58,403
Too bad.

171
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:01,403
It's not there, no matter how hard you look.

172
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:04,903
It's a video tape that is proof of our relationship,

173
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:08,503
so of course I hid it someplace very special in this house.

174
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:12,003
I'm keeping it as a guarantee that you will divorce your wife

175
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,303
and marry me instead, Sensei.

176
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:17,503
My husband will be coming home soon.

177
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:22,003
You're going drinking with your college friends, aren't you?

178
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:24,904
You may relax on the sofa till then.

179
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:37,903
Really, I don't understand adults, honestly.

180
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:39,503
It's scary because even your relationship with your wife

181
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:42,803
who you've been living separately from all these years seem to look better.

182
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,103
Be quite.

183
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,103
Hey.

184
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:48,603
Isn't that guy from before?

185
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:49,903
Who?

186
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:52,104
I wonder what he's doing.

187
00:11:57,504 --> 00:12:01,304
He's probably working overtime because he can't fill his quota.

188
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:05,404
It seems her husband's finally come home.

189
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:10,003
I'm home.

190
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:12,403
Oh, my. Hello, dear.

191
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:14,503
Hello, Morosumi.

192
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:17,503
-Soga, you're here already. -Yeah.

193
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,503
"Akira Morosumi (45), Psychiatrist" -Let me use the bathroom.

194
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:22,903
Can you get the engine running while you're waiting?

195
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:26,303
No. If you're going out drinking, walk.

196
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:28,003
Okay.

197
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:30,503
And would you like to come along too, for a change?

198
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:33,303
No thank you, because I can't drink.

199
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:36,403
I also want to watch the soccer game that will be aired at midnight,

200
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:38,603
so I'd like to take a short nap, too.

201
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:41,204
Really? Too bad.

202
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:46,003
The conversation that the two men would have over drinks

203
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:48,503
drew some interest, but...

204
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:50,203
How long do you intend to stay fooling around out there?

205
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,503
Hurry up and come on home!

206
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:57,703
We got a call from Ran, so we decided to head on home.

207
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:58,803
But...

208
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:01,203
Hey, Heiji! Just what do you think you're doing?

209
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,503
I went out of my way to make dinner for you,

210
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,503
and it's all cold already!

211
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,303
Where are you now?

212
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:10,003
The Morosumi residence where I accepted the work of the detective.

213
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:12,303
What?

214
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:16,403
You just said you're headed home because you finished the job!

215
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:19,203
Yeah, that's what we were planning to do,

216
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:22,303
but we passed a fire engine on the way back.

217
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,203
We got concerned and headed back to the residence

218
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,503
and found it blazing outrageously.

219
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:27,504
What?

220
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:30,104
The Morosumi residence...

221
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,230
Hey, this way! Hurry!

222
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,530
Ryoko...

223
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,129
Ryoko...

224
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,029
It seems like that woman didn't escape in time.

225
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,129
Gosh. If we just kept watching,

226
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,429
this wouldn't have happened.

227
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,429
But isn't it strange?

228
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,529
Those two went out to drink, right?

229
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,429
Not even an hour has past yet,

230
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,829
and I wonder why they came back?

231
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,429
True.

232
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,130
Maybe they had a premonition of some kind?

233
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,629
See, mommy? It came after all, didn't it?

234
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,929
A red horse that causes fire.

235
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,629
What?

236
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,529
Hey, kid. How come you knew that a red horse was coming?

237
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,229
Because I saw it.

238
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,129
When and where?

239
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,729
Hey, who are you people?

240
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,629
You really saw it?

241
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,829
I'm not lying! It was only the shadow of the horse, but...

242
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,629
-Shadow? -Yes.

243
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,029
It was when I was watching Kamen Yaiba in the living room.

244
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,929
When Yaiba's first song started,

245
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,029
it suddenly got bright outside,

246
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,929
so I looked outside and was surprised.

247
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,330
A shadow of a horse about this big was on the curtain!

248
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,629
Which way is your house?

249
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,229
On the right of the burning house? Or, on the left?

250
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,630
To the right.

251
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,830
Hey!

252
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,729
A horse!

253
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,030
By the window, there's a red horse!

254
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,029
Which means that the room that boy was watching TV in, is this room.

255
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,729
Yeah. The shadow of the horse showed up on this curtain.

256
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,629
Kaimen Yaiba starts at 7:30 pm.

257
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,329
If it got bright during the opening of the program

258
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,729
and the shadow was reflected...

259
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,829
The arsonist set fire and put the horse in place a little

260
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,629
after 7:30 pm.

261
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,229
Yeah. At least we know that the arsonist

262
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,830
was near this window about that time.

263
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,930
So, the horse set the fire after all, right, mommy?

264
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,029
Two hours later,

265
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,229
the fire that took the life of Ryoko Morosumi

266
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,730
was finally extinguished.

267
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,029
Will you let me in just for a minute?

268
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,529
No way.

269
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,129
Then, will you at least tell me where the fire first broke out?

270
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,329
No way.

271
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,529
What's the big deal giving out a little info?

272
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:21,629
I can't do what I can't do, even if it's for you, Mr. Mouri.

273
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,229
Hey, hey. The scene of a fire

274
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,430
is not territory for the homicide division, is it?

275
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,329
Old man fire of the 1st division?

276
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,629
Hey, Mouri!

277
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,129
How dare you call your former superior old man fire!

278
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,029
Former superior?

279
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,529
Inspector Yuminaga of the Metropolitan Police

280
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,629
Arson Investigation Division section 1.

281
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,529
I thought you belonged to the homicide division?

282
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,529
I used to be in the arson division for a little while.

283
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,630
You sure caused me a lot of agony.

284
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,729
Every time there's a fire, you claim that it's arson

285
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,429
and go out to the scene of the fire,

286
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,129
and step all over the personal effects left there.

287
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,229
God knows how many complaints I got of you from the fire department.

288
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,629
Right?

289
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,129
The same goes for you, too.

290
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,929
This fire is undoubtedly arson.

291
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,829
The red horse was found at the site of this fire, too.

292
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,329
We checked it out with the forensic officers

293
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,929
and found that it was a perfect match with the other three horses.

294
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,829
But Mr. Yuminaga, isn't there a possibility

295
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,829
that somebody who saw the incident in the newspaper or something

296
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,729
tried copying?

297
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,229
You idiot!

298
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,929
How can you make the exact same horse

299
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,929
by just seeing it in the papers?

300
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,629
That plastic horse is made of the same mold,

301
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,729
and is not sold anywhere,

302
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,129
so the arsonist probably took fun in making it himself.

303
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,229
The arsonist was probably having fun challenging the police,

304
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,629
but somebody has been killed this time.

305
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,229
So, the fun's over.

306
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,330
And where did the fire start?

307
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,129
Who's this boy here? Your assistant?

308
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,529
Yes, well, sort of.

309
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,329
The fire started in the hut beyond the right side of the house.

310
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,029
The storeroom with the window where the red horse was placed.

311
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,029
There were traces of kerosene poured on the floor.

312
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,929
So, the arsonist probably poured the kerosene in

313
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,830
from the open window and set fire.

314
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,429
There were a lot of strange footprints by the window of the room

315
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,729
in the foreground of the storeroom.

316
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,729
If we check the footprints carefully,

317
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,130
I'm sure we'll at least get to grab the tail of the arsonist.

318
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,929
Well, the thing is...

319
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,829
What?

320
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,230
Your footprints are mixed up in the footprints there?

321
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,729
I'm actually here

322
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,729
because I was asked to come here by Mrs. Ryoko Morosumi,

323
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,829
the victim who died of the fire.

324
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,329
She asked me to come check on a suspicious person

325
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,429
who was doing something around her house late at night.

326
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,229
But the lady said that it was just her imagination

327
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,729
and told us to leave,

328
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,229
so we were watching her for a while.

329
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,329
Then a strange character who seemed to be a Feng Shui Sensei came by,

330
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,429
so having no other choice, we went into her yard

331
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,329
and looked inside through the window

332
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,429
and saw a pretty bad scene.

333
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,229
Pretty bad scene?

334
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,829
It seems that this man was having an extra-marital affair with Ryoko,

335
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,229
and was ransacking the rooms looking for the video

336
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,729
that was evidence of their affair!

337
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,129
That act of yours sounds more than pretty bad to me.

338
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,529
Well, but I guess I'll have to take molds of your shoes later.

339
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,929
Don't tell me you think that we're suspects?

340
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,129
You idiot!

341
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,429
It's to discriminate your footprints with the arsonist's!

342
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,529
I see.

343
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,729
And? Is that man that had an affair with her,

344
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,129
the only one that came by the house?

345
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,629
No, four people came in all.

346
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,229
That man who had the affair and Ryoko's husband.

347
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,229
Ryoko's older sister who seems to be a fortune-teller.

348
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,130
A timid guy who came and left a catalog of his store with her.

349
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,230
But the Sensei of Feng Shui and Ryoko's husband are not arsonists.

350
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,229
According to the testimony of the kid next door,

351
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,429
the red horse was placed by the window at exactly 7:30 pm.

352
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,529
The Sensei and her husband went out to drink at about 7:20 pm.

353
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,129
So, the two couldn't have done it.

354
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,329
And we were contemplating for about 5 minutes

355
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,929
whether to follow the two or not.

356
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,429
But at that time, there was no smoke nor fire at all.

357
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,329
The only concern is why those two came back so early

358
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,829
despite having gone drinking.

359
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,229
That's because a neighbor called the husband's cell phone

360
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,230
and told him there was a fire.

361
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,529
Which leaves the older sister who is a fortune-teller and the timid man.

362
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,929
Talking of fortunetelling,

363
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,529
there's a floor in the building of Haido Station

364
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,829
where fortune-tellers gather.

365
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,329
Then, the lady may be there.

366
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,829
-Let's go! -What? Yeah.

367
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,929
What? Ryoko died?

368
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,529
Are you serious?

369
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,929
Yes.

370
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,029
What a stupid child.

371
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,629
I warned her time and again to be careful

372
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,229
because I saw signs of disaster by fire in her!

373
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,129
Our father's funeral is not finished yet,

374
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,230
still why is everybody crossing over like this?

375
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,529
If you will excuse me asking,

376
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,929
where were you at around 7:30 pm?

377
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,229
I was here!

378
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,929
Right?

379
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,029
Yes. We are all under contract

380
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,429
to start fortune-telling from 7:30 pm.

381
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,130
I'm so sorry.

382
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,929
The only one left is the timid man.

383
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,229
Do you remember any characteristics of that man?

384
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,929
Well, his height was about 160 centimeters,

385
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,329
and he was wearing round glasses. He seemed to be in his forties.

386
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,029
I think he's an antique shop owner or something.

387
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,529
Since he was going around passing out catalogs,

388
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,130
I think his shop is somewhere nearby.

389
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,529
Mr. Yuminaga, does it ring a bell?

390
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,729
No.

391
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,329
It can't be.

392
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,430
He couldn't have.

393
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,029
"Next Episode" -The four red horses

394
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,329
that were found at the serial arson sites.

395
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,929
I wonder why only the horse left at the first site

396
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,329
is burnt black like this?

397
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,929
Rabbit?

398
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,429
Don't tell me that...

399
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,629
Hey. Isn't this Guan Yu?

400
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,029
But, what a flashy colored horse he's riding.

401
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,229
Well, this is the Red Rabbit Horse.

402
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,130
It's a super horse said to be able to run a thousand miles in a day.

403
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,230
