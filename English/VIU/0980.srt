1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,980
Welcome.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,480
This is the only place that can grant your wish.

3
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:12,908
Oh, yeah?

4
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:16,148
My wish, huh?

5
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:19,597
Surely you came here because you knew that.

6
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,827
You simply have to believe.

7
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:24,408
As long as you follow my instructions...

8
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:29,538
I'll commit the perfect crime, right?

9
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:35,337
Exactly. I'm like a modern day Professor Moriarty.

10
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:41,548
Providing people like you with the perfect crime is my job.

11
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:43,298
I see...

12
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:52,707
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,397
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

14
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:56,527
A world-famous planned crime!

15
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:58,287
The old man is selected for an undercover operation!

16
00:00:58,288 --> 00:00:59,897
Always determining the one truth

17
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:01,747
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

18
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:04,118
his name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:48,148
An Encouragement of the Perfect Crime

20
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:50,654
Yes, that's correct.

21
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:55,154
Several strange cases have occurred in the city recently.

22
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:58,203
I see. What's this?

23
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:01,994
Marriage fraud, bank robbery, and burglary.

24
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:07,694
Though they seem unrelated at first, these cases have something in common.

25
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:09,794
Take a look at these notes.

26
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:12,194
What's this?

27
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:15,304
They look like instruction manuals for crimes.

28
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,353
According to the arrested culprits,

29
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:23,564
they purchased the plans from a man calling himself a criminal adviser.

30
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:28,194
That's what's thriving in the underworld now?

31
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:33,783
Said criminal adviser is a vigilant man.

32
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:37,303
We only recently determined his location.

33
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,954
So we have a request for you.

34
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:42,944
What is it? Spit it out.

35
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:46,034
An undercover operation, huh?

36
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:50,214
You'd be more like an adviser.

37
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:56,224
Since it's a special case, we'd appreciate it if you joined us.

38
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,073
I see.

39
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:02,144
It takes a talented adviser to take down an adviser.

40
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:05,184
I hope he's got some decent advice to give.

41
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:08,383
What are you doing here?

42
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:14,034
Since it's an undercover case, I thought we'd seem less like cops with me around.

43
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:17,704
What kind of criminal brings a child with him?

44
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,253
Why not let him come, Mori-san?

45
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:23,704
When Conan-kun's around, the investigation always seems to go mysteriously well.

46
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,964
His office is in there?

47
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:32,753
Yes, definitely.

48
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:33,923
Let's go.

49
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:36,834
Yes, ma'am. Mori-san, we appreciate your help.

50
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:40,974
My name is Sato. I made an appointment the other day.

51
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,174
Welcome.

52
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:47,484
This is the only place that can grant your wish.

53
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:49,484
You're the one we've heard about?

54
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:50,814
Yes.

55
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:57,053
I am the modern day Professor James Moriarty.

56
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:00,744
I am Hamanaka Misao, criminal adviser.

57
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:04,744
What does a criminal adviser do?

58
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:07,523
You're asking that now?

59
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:10,754
Isn't that what you're looking for?

60
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:14,254
In this office are all documents related to crime,

61
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:18,504
and all the tools you need to carry one out.

62
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:23,103
In other words, as long as you follow my instructions,

63
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:26,264
you will be able to commit the perfect crime.

64
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:27,554
What?

65
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:32,653
Aren't you the famous detective Mori Kogoro?

66
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:36,403
Which means yours companions must be,

67
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:40,904
judging by their appearance, police officers.

68
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:43,034
Of course he figured it out.

69
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:47,204
Hamanaka-san, could we speak with you?

70
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:49,584
Very well.

71
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:55,394
I've always wanted to speak with a detective or the police.

72
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:59,663
You can start by taking a look at these instruction manuals.

73
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:00,894
Let me see.

74
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:04,344
I did indeed write these.

75
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,854
What? You admit it?

76
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:09,883
What point is there in lying about that?

77
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:12,333
I produced all of these.

78
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:16,003
They are undeniably blueprints for crimes written by me.

79
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,864
Plots for novels.

80
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:20,864
Plots for novels?

81
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:25,364
Plots are like the plan for a novel or play, right?

82
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:31,033
Yeah. They're like a summary or framework of a story.

83
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,044
You mean...

84
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,213
A plan for a crime.

85
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:39,093
Indeed. I sell those plots.

86
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,714
Primarily plots for crime novels.

87
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:44,084
What's this?

88
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:45,224
My price list.

89
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:46,644
Price list?

90
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:50,533
I've ranked them according to the nature of the crime.

91
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:53,603
My selling point is the variety I offer.

92
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,644
I offer plots all kinds of crimes.

93
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:59,753
Murder, robbery, fraud...

94
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:02,744
There's even one called "thumbtack in slipper."

95
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:07,253
I offer an exhaustive list of crimes from murder to light offenses in complete versions,

96
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:11,744
simple versions, abridged versions, and first half only versions.

97
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:14,754
What's a first half only version?

98
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:18,043
I'm meeting the needs of my customers.

99
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:23,264
Some of them said they wanted my plots but couldn't afford them.

100
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:27,264
So why did this person get caught?

101
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:31,184
This is a simple version of a bank robbery plot.

102
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:38,563
Ah, he made the mistake of not acquiring a plasma torch.

103
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:41,984
He was arrested because he cheaped out and failed to break into the vault.

104
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:43,864
How about this one?

105
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:48,814
This is an abridged version of a purse snatching plot.

106
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:54,124
The culprit was simply too fat to run away.

107
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:58,373
Then what about this first half only version of a burglary?

108
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,134
They were arrested easily.

109
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:03,793
I remember that case well.

110
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:08,903
I can't believe they committed a burglary without wearing gloves.

111
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:10,144
That's it?

112
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:13,934
Sounds like everyone who follows your plots gets arrested.

113
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:17,053
You were lying when you said you sold perfect crimes.

114
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:19,073
Th-That's not true!

115
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:21,734
There are plenty of criminals who haven't been arrested.

116
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:28,114
I sold a plot that's been unsolved for several years.

117
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:32,124
Could you tell us more about that case?

118
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:36,193
Unfortunately, I cannot do that.

119
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:40,124
I can't just give away my customers' information.

120
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:43,884
Maybe so, but we can't just let it go.

121
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:50,303
I wish I could help you, but trust is essential in my business.

122
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,054
No hard feelings.

123
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:56,493
Hold it right there.

124
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:01,463
Don't forget that I'm just a crime novel adviser.

125
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:04,324
I simply sell ideas for novels.

126
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:07,324
I'm not committing any crimes.

127
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,324
You understand that, don't you?

128
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:14,334
Furthermore, I don't encourage my customers to commit crimes.

129
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:19,843
The plots laid out on the table are all works of fiction.

130
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:22,763
The characters, organizations,

131
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:28,013
and names are products of my imagination and bear no relation to actual persons or events.

132
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,014
Why, you...

133
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:35,264
In other words, the police can't lay a finger on me.

134
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:46,984
What?

135
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:51,244
Hamanaka Misao, you're under arrest for abetment.

136
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:58,853
No matter what you say, your plots are causing actual crimes.

137
00:09:58,854 --> 00:10:00,753
You're guilty of abetment.

138
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:02,624
B-But...

139
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:07,143
Were you working as a criminal adviser without even knowing that?

140
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:08,554
Well, I...

141
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,173
Now confess.

142
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:10,804
What?

143
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:12,804
The crimes you're involved it.

144
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,433
Tell us about every last one.

145
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,434
Y-You can't be serious.

146
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:18,843
Are you sure?

147
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:22,314
If you don't cooperate now, you'll regret it.

148
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:26,293
How you're treated after incarceration, testimony during the trial,

149
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:27,984
the impression made during bail hearings...

150
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:33,244
A lot of things that will shape your life are about to happen to you.

151
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:39,873
Hey, Takagi. Are you sure you needed an adviser?

152
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,504
Yeah...

153
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:44,504
Well? What's it going to be?

154
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:47,004
Transfer complete.

155
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:49,743
Roger that. Make a backup.

156
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:50,504
Got it.

157
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,903
We've obtained information on five cases.

158
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:58,764
Of those five, three are unsolved, and two are currently in progress.

159
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:03,394
We found detailed information on the suspects and their methods.

160
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:06,933
Takagi-kun just sent you the data.

161
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,283
Got it.

162
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:12,653
We've received strong information relating to a number of unsolved cases!

163
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:15,063
This is a rare opportunity for us!

164
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:18,664
Call on all officers and arrest all the suspects!

165
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,073
Have everyone head to the scene!

166
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:21,664
Yes, sir!

167
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:28,334
Don't move!

168
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,884
Who are you?

169
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:32,304
Suspects confirmed! Arrest them!

170
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:34,053
Suspect arrested!

All right!

179
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,194
Only one case remains!

180
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:58,704
Ishigami Takashi's Revenge Plan.

181
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:03,204
The suspect's name is Wada Tatsumi, forty-eight years old, single.

182
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:06,243
He has three previous offenses and is currently unemployed.

183
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:08,834
He was just recently released from prison.

184
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:12,133
The scheduled time of his crime is today at 4 PM.

185
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:15,714
Since it's just after three now, we don't have much time left.

186
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:19,433
The plot is a complete version of a murder.

187
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:25,163
The method is to use an odorless gas to blow up an entire building.

188
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:26,854
A gas explosion?

189
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,854
There's even a blueprint showing a remote detonator.

190
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:34,053
Does he plan to blow up the evidence, too?

191
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:39,823
Ishigami Takashi was Wada's superior at a company he worked for ten years ago.

192
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:43,624
Apparently he believed he was responsible for Wada's firing.

193
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:48,874
The police are already heading to the suspect's house and the target's office.

194
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,874
The case should be resolved soon.

195
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:54,754
Police!

196
00:12:58,384 --> 00:12:59,583
What?!

197
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:02,833
Wada's apartment is empty. The suspect isn't here.

198
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,814
Damn! Keep an eye on the area.

199
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,564
How are things over there?

200
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:11,033
We haven't seen the suspect.

201
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:16,484
We've secured the alleged target Ishigami-san, but there hasn't been any unusual activity.

202
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:21,113
The suspect Wada is attempting to cause a gas explosion.

203
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:24,933
Search every nook and cranny for hidden gas cylinders.

204
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:25,874
Got it.

205
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,294
3:30 already.

206
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:34,294
According to the plot, a lot of people will get caught up in the explosion.

207
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:37,264
We must do whatever it takes to stop the explosion.

208
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,054
Got it.

209
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:45,054
Nothing was found at Ishigami-san's workplace.

210
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:47,064
What's going on?

211
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:50,863
Maybe he's not carrying out his plan yet?

212
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,564
The scheduled date is today.

213
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:56,404
On top of that, we haven't determined the suspect's location.

214
00:13:56,914 --> 00:14:00,074
I don't think we should be optimistic.

215
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:04,324
Where is it? Where is the detonator?

216
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:16,674
Gas Density

217
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,887
We're running out of time.

218
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:28,137
We need to find clues from here quickly.

219
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:33,406
I told you, as long as my customers follow my instructions,

220
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,017
they can commit the perfect crime.

221
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:40,086
Remember! What did you and Wada discuss?

222
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,366
What did we discuss?

223
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,296
Tell me every last word that was said. Got it?

224
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:50,206
A-All right, but I did most of the talking.

225
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:52,206
Was there anything about him that seemed odd?

226
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,106
Odd?

227
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:55,787
Come to think of it...

228
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:59,056
Surely you came here because you knew that.

229
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:01,636
You simply have to believe.

230
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:04,047
As long as you follow my instructions...

231
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:09,177
I'll commit the perfect crime, right?

232
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:13,116
For some reason he knew my catchphrase.

233
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:15,656
He came to buy one of your plots.

234
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:18,146
It's not that odd that he knew.

235
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:20,687
I suppose not.

236
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,056
Oh, right. He said he wanted the detonation to be controlled remotely instead of automatic.

237
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:30,697
Perhaps he wants to deal the killing blow himself.

238
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:34,207
Does he hate his target that much?

239
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:36,707
I believe so.

240
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:40,707
Gas Density

241
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:45,547
Wada clearly stated that his target was Ishigami-san, right?

242
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:47,486
Yes.

243
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,847
I write my plots after listening to my customers' requests.

244
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,186
Then Ishigami-san is definitely his target.

245
00:15:55,187 --> 00:16:00,637
Isn't guarding the target and waiting for the suspect to arrive our best option?

246
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:05,617
Detective Takagi is right, but something's off...

247
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:08,437
Well, I guess I've got to do it.

248
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:19,126
No forewarning again...

249
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,627
Th-This is...

250
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,127
The Sleeping Kogoro.

251
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:25,877
I have a few questions for you.

252
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,886
Gas Density

253
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,887
Explosion Ready

254
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:37,396
First, why do you believe he came to see you?

255
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,916
Why? Because of my excellence, obviously.

256
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,016
What?

257
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:44,066
Fine.

258
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:46,897
Let's assume he heard of your reputation somewhere.

259
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:52,296
When you spoke with him, did you think there was anything strange about him?

260
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:54,657
I'm not sure.

261
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,636
I find it strange.

262
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:59,667
He may have been fired,

263
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:04,297
but why did he plan such an elaborate assassination?

264
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:06,286
You're right.

265
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:11,427
You may hate someone for firing you, but usually you wouldn't want to kill them.

266
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,386
He paid a lot of money for it, too.

267
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:15,476
Yeah.

268
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,356
Are you certain?

269
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:17,937
What?

270
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:21,556
I've been doing this job a long time.

271
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:26,566
The actions of a criminal hardly fall within what's considered sensible.

272
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:30,806
A long time? How long have you been doing this?

273
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:36,907
W-Well, at the very least, I think it's been about ten years.

274
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:39,267
Hey!

275
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,167
Conan-kun?

276
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,916
What is it?

277
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,296
Did you figure something out?

278
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,417
That's definitely it.

279
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:47,066
If my reasoning is correct...

280
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,167
Conan-kun?

281
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,436
I was wondering where the bathroom is.

282
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,506
The bathroom's at the end of the hallway.

283
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,677
Thanks.

284
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:56,896
There's no time.

285
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:57,927
Mori-san.

286
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:04,496
Do you recall the cases you plotted seven years ago?

287
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:05,437
What?

288
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,317
Judging by your reaction, you've forgotten

289
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,816
about the robbery that took place seven years ago on this day,

290
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:13,317
for which Wada Tatsumi was arrested.

291
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:14,257
What?

292
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:18,627
Does Hamanaka have something to do with Wada's arrest?

293
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:21,096
I remember now!

294
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:24,146
He attacked some black market lenders in Beika City!

295
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,327
That's right.

296
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:30,467
It's the plot for the robbery you wrote seven years ago.

297
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:32,216
Y-You mean...

298
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,196
According to police documents,

299
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,967
after attacking the black market lenders that were his target,

300
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:42,726
the high performance security cameras of the shopping mall

301
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:45,477
along his escape route captured his escape vehicle,

302
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,727
his license plate number,

303
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:52,727
and even the driver Wada's face.

304
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:58,617
It was your mistake for failing to take into account the shopping mall.

305
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:05,377
Wada probably believed it was your fault that he was arrested.

306
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:10,376
The fault of the sloppy plot you wrote.

307
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:12,377
Explosion Ready

308
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,387
You're right. That was my mistake.

309
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,066
In other words, this is what happened.

310
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:22,576
Wada Tatsumi recently finished his sentence and was released from prison.

311
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:26,397
Several days ago, he visited your office for the first time in seven years.

312
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:31,387
However, you didn't remember the robbery or Wada himself.

313
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:34,907
What's why he chose to act.

314
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:38,407
He remembered your catchphrase.

315
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:43,476
He was that fixated on you.

316
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:44,536
In other words...

317
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:46,576
The target isn't Ishigami-san.

318
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:47,327
No.

319
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:49,136
His target is you!

320
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:50,257
What?

321
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,547
Th-Then the detonator is...

322
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:54,936
Yes.

323
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:58,087
The detonator is here!

324
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:11,256
H-Hello?

325
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:14,697
Hamanaka, you know who I am, don't you?

326
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:17,406
You're Wada Tatsumi-san.

327
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:20,576
Do you know why I called you?

328
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:22,197
N-No, I...

329
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,636
I wanted to hear your voice one last time.

330
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:27,707
What? W-Wait!

331
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:31,877
Farewell, you fraud.

332
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:38,417
Damn. Why isn't it exploding?

333
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,637
It won't explode, Wada-san.

334
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:43,427
Who are you?

335
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:46,736
We just shut off the gas,

336
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:50,687
and the detonator you installed in the air purifier was removed.

337
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,796
You were first arrested for a burglary, right?

338
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,906
When I examined the entrance to Hamasaki-san's office,

339
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:01,447
I found signs of lock picking.

340
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:06,707
Knowing the detonator was hidden in his office narrowed down the hiding places.

341
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,366
In order to make a gas heavier than air explode,

342
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:13,707
the detonator needed to be as close to the ground as possible.

343
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:15,027
Damn.

344
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:18,717
But how did you know I was here?

345
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:25,016
Because you asked to make the detonator remote controlled instead of automatic.

346
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,227
That's how you'd take your revenge.

347
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:31,307
So I thought you'd be someplace you could see the explosion.

348
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,326
I lost.

349
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:40,457
Wada Tatsumi, you're under arrest for attempted murder!

350
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:10,596
Nice work, Mori-san.

351
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,617
Oh, you know...

352
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:18,167
Thanks to you, we were able to solve five cases at once.

353
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:24,756
Ultimately, Hamasaki's perfect crimes turned out to be armchair theories.

354
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:25,816
I know.

355
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:30,177
If it means making people hate you enough to want to kill you, it's not worth it.

356
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:33,687
I suppose it was unfortunate for him

357
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:37,347
that you had a great adviser like me.

358
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:42,127
Who do you think you are?

359
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,867
Bocchan Restaurant?

360
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:51,686
Now you've done it, you dastardly red shirt!

361
00:23:51,687 --> 00:23:53,497
Please, Yamaarashi-san.

362
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:56,627
You suspect the president? What a fool.

363
00:23:56,877 --> 00:24:00,377
The sun may forgive you, but I will not!

364
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:04,877
The young master's sense of justice is this old Kiyo's pride and joy.

365
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,517
Young master? Kiyo?

366
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:12,897
The next episode of Conan is "Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant, Part One!"
