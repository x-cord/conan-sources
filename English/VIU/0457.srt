1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:01,441
Dazzling!

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,383
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:05,983
A big fuss is made over a handkerchief at a drama location site.

4
00:00:05,983 --> 00:00:07,783
An incident dyes even the maple leaves red.

5
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:09,383
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:11,283
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:13,683
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,665
Conan, be careful.

9
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,065
Don't carry yourself overboard.

10
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:22,165
-Okay. -Hey, glasses kid!

11
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:23,265
How is it?

12
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:27,565
Shut up. I don't see it.

13
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,265
Are you sure it's this tree?

14
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:32,865
-I wonder if he's going to be okay. -You're right!

15
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:35,865
I wonder if the glasses kid is really going to be able to find it?

16
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,965
That's not what I meant.

17
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:43,565
Hey. Is it really here or what?

18
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:45,665
How about it, Conan?

19
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,065
Did you find Sonoko's handkerchief?

20
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,165
It's red! Red, okay?

21
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:52,165
It's a precious red handkerchief!

22
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,465
So, look really good, okay?

23
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,865
Why didn't you hang on to it and not let it go?

24
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:00,965
But I don't see it anywhere at all.

25
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:03,265
That's strange.

26
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,165
It looked like the handkerchief

27
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:17,665
was blown away by the wind and got stuck on that tree.

28
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,565
What? Did you find it?

29
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:23,665
Yes.

30
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:26,265
Well, I did find it but...

31
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:31,265
A handkerchief that was blown away by the wind

32
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:34,465
would never tie onto a branch on its own.

33
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,365
Hey! Did you find it or not?

34
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:39,365
Come on and tell me!

35
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:41,865
-Sonoko... -Hey, glasses kid!

36
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:44,365
-could that thing you're stepping on be? -Are you listening?

37
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,965
What?

38
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,565
Stepping on what?

39
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,165
Oh, no...

40
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:56,165
Ran...

41
00:03:58,165 --> 00:03:59,965
Sonoko.

42
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:04,365
I guess I found it.

43
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,165
Conan!

44
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,365
Conan Edogawa!

45
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,265
Well...

46
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:14,965
Conan!

47
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:22,265
"Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 1)"

48
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:25,365
Hey.

49
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,565
Hey, are you listening?

50
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:30,765
Sonoko.

51
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:35,165
Isn't it about time for you tell me?

52
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:39,265
Why you suddenly wanted to come visit this scarlet maple leaves?

53
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:41,465
-Hey. -Yeah, that's true.

54
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:44,565
Oh, see this red handkerchief?

55
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:48,465
You can't tell even by looking at this handkerchief?

56
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:50,565
Handkerchief?

57
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:52,365
Red?

58
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,265
No, not at all.

59
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:58,865
Then you must at least know the title, don't you, Ran?

60
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,165
The title?

61
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:03,465
"Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

62
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:05,265
It's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

63
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:08,065
Oh! That's the super lovey-dovey drama

64
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:09,665
that was really popular last year, isn't it?

65
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:10,965
Right...

66
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:18,165
Don't tell me you weren't watching it.

67
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:20,165
You like that kind of drama too, don't you?

68
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:21,465
Yeah...

69
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:24,665
But Yoko Okino's program was on at the same time

70
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:28,065
and dad was watching it while recording her program so...

71
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,865
He's still head over heels over Yoko Okino.

72
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,265
What does that drama have to do

73
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,565
with the red handkerchief though?

74
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:43,365
Well, I don't think brats can understand even if I told you about it,

75
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:46,565
but I, Sonoko, will go out of my way and explain it to you.

76
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:47,765
Hey...

77
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:53,165
It's about a rich family's daughter and a young military officer.

78
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:56,665
It's a love and romance story!

79
00:05:56,665 --> 00:06:00,265
They first meet because the military officer takes the handkerchief

80
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:02,565
from a red maple tree for her.

81
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,365
Some time later, they fall in love with each other.

82
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:11,465
However, a bad superior officer who envies their relationship

83
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:14,365
frames the young military officer for something

84
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,465
he had no recollection of doing.

85
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:18,265
He ends up becoming a fugitive whose whereabouts become unknown.

86
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:22,865
Just about when the war is about to end,

87
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,965
the young lady receives a telegram from him.

88
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,565
It said, "I will wait for you on New Year's day morning

89
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:32,165
under the maple tree covered with red leaves."

90
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:36,365
But New Year's day morning?

91
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:38,665
The maple leaves all wither away in winter.

92
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:39,965
Right.

93
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,365
All the rich young lady could figure out was

94
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:43,065
that he meant the mountain they first met

95
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:46,265
where there were maple trees covered with red leaves.

96
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:48,265
She had no idea as to where it actually was,

97
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:49,965
so she walked through the snowy mountain

98
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:52,765
looking for him all by herself.

99
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:56,065
But, of course, all there was in the mountain

100
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,065
were trees with leaves that had withered away.

101
00:06:58,065 --> 00:06:59,665
Viewing red leaves of maple trees in winter

102
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:02,065
is an impossible thing to do.

103
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:04,565
She thought that "this meant we can never meet again,

104
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,665
so please don't wait for me."

105
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,965
But, just as she was ready to give up and go.

106
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:10,565
A certain scene strikes her eyes!

107
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,365
In the snowy white landscape of winter,

108
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,765
a red handkerchief is tied onto a branch of a tree

109
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:18,365
with leaves that had withered away.

110
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:21,765
This bright red handkerchief!

111
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:27,465
And they finally reunite under that tree.

112
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:30,165
They elope...

113
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,465
and the story ends happily ever after.

114
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:34,365
Oh, how nice!

115
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:39,365
That young military officer is strong, tanned

116
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:42,465
and has a simple and honest manner of speaking. He's so awesome!

117
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,265
You mean like Kyogoku?

118
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,665
Right! Exactly!

119
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:50,265
I watched the DVD again the other day and got hooked on it!

120
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,665
The love story of a rich young lady

121
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:55,065
and a strong and tanned young military officer.

122
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:58,765
It's just like me and Makoto, don't you think?

123
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:05,465
That's why I came to this mountain where the drama was filmed.

124
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:06,565
See!

125
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:09,465
I came to tie my red handkerchief onto the branch of a tree!

126
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:13,465
I see, so that you get to see Kyogoku!

127
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:16,165
But won't you get scolded for tying it on without permission?

128
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,465
Don't worry!

129
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:20,865
No one will notice just one handkerchief on the branch of a tree!

130
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:23,465
No, I think someone will notice.

131
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:26,265
-What? -How do you know, glasses kid?

132
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:27,365
Just how...

133
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,965
Hey!

134
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:39,065
What's that?

135
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,265
It's full of red handkerchiefs!

136
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:42,465
Sonoko.

137
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:45,965
Could this be the place that was used for filming the scene in the drama?

138
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:49,565
Yes. The young military officer was waiting here

139
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,465
with his back leaning against a large rock.

140
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,565
So I think so.

141
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:58,665
In other words, a lot of other people felt the same way.

142
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,165
What shall I do, Ran?

143
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:05,365
-I already e-mailed Makoto about it! -What?

144
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:06,665
I wrote, "I'll be waiting for you under a maple tree

145
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:09,665
with red leaves on the eve of eve."

146
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,865
What shall I do?

147
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,965
Sonoko, you're really something.

148
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,665
You actually send e-mails with such implications.

149
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:18,165
But I'm sure you'll get to see him!

150
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,465
I mean, there are so many handkerchiefs tied on here so...

151
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:23,265
I'm sure that if you wait around here, he'll come and meet you.

152
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:24,765
Sonoko?

153
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,565
It doesn't mean a thing if he doesn't come under my handkerchief!

154
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:31,765
Come to think of it, I found one too.

155
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:32,765
Found what?

156
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:35,065
A red handkerchief was tied to the branch of the tree

157
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:37,865
that I climbed on just a while ago.

158
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:39,365
No way!

159
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:42,365
That place is quite some distance from here!

160
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,865
What if handkerchiefs are tied onto the branches of

161
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:47,165
every maple tree in this area?

162
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:49,665
Where is Makoto...

163
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:52,965
Where is Makoto supposed to wait for me?

164
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:55,665
Even before you worry about something like that,

165
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:57,865
I wonder if that martial arts freak would know anything

166
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,865
about where the "Red Maple Tree in Winter" was filmed.

167
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:06,165
Okay, then as a last resort...

168
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:08,665
Here, glasses kid, wait here.

169
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:10,065
Oh, okay.

170
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:12,265
-Ran! Come help me. -What?

171
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:15,265
We're going to remove all the red handkerchiefs on this mountain!

172
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,365
What?

173
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,165
Hey, Sonoko.

174
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:22,065
The fate of Makoto and I depends on this!

175
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:24,365
Sonoko...

176
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,565
Is she okay or what?

177
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:27,865
Makoto...

178
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:31,865
Sonoko, look out.

179
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,065
Sonoko...

180
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:35,565
I'm sorry

181
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:38,165
that it turned out like this just because of me.

182
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:40,265
-Oh? -What?

183
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,965
You're removing all those handkerchiefs

184
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:42,965
because they'll get in the way of

185
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:44,965
viewing the red leaves of the maple trees, right?

186
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:48,265
Yes, sort of.

187
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,165
What did you mean when you said just because of you?

188
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:57,365
Aren't you the one who wrote the original "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"?

189
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,065
I'm a great fan of yours!

190
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:02,165
Oh, no, I'm just a staff working on that drama.

191
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,165
An AD (Assistant Director).

192
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,265
You're not the original writer?

193
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,365
I'm sorry, I disappointed you.

194
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:12,465
No, you didn't disappoint me or anything, right, Ran?

195
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:13,865
Oh, of course not.

196
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:17,065
But I'm the one who introduced this mountain to the playwright

197
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:19,665
who asked me if I knew of any beautiful mountain

198
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:23,065
that could be used for the drama.

199
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,765
This is my hometown

200
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:27,565
and I used to play on this mountain a lot in my childhood.

201
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:30,865
And while we were looking for a place to film the drama,

202
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:33,165
I found a red handkerchief tied to the branch of

203
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,765
a maple tree covered with red leaves.

204
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:37,365
When I told the playwright about this,

205
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:41,265
he said that he could use the story and rewrote the script.

206
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,765
-What? -Is that right?

207
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:46,365
Then it became so popular

208
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:48,165
that I was scolded by the owner of the mountain

209
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,465
who said that people began camping here without permission

210
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:54,165
or tying red handkerchiefs on the branches of the trees.

211
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:58,465
He shouted, "Thanks to you, my mountain is full of handkerchiefs!"

212
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:02,065
Gosh.

213
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:03,465
You were too, Sonoko.

214
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:05,065
Well, on the other hand,

215
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:08,265
the store owners of the shopping arcade and hotels are happy

216
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:10,465
because customers have increased.

217
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,365
People hardly ever come here

218
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,165
other than the season when the leaves change color.

219
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:17,765
That's why all the calls that are made to the town offices

220
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:19,365
regarding this are referred to me,

221
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,865
so talk about tough.

222
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:24,865
I get calls like, "Where's that mountain?"

223
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:27,565
or "Please take me to the place the last scene was filmed."

224
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:29,565
Even today, I got a call from a fan

225
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,165
saying that he'll pay me, so to tell him

226
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:35,065
where the original tree with the handkerchief was tied on is.

227
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,965
So, I was going around looking for that tree since this morning

228
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,665
and I'm pooped.

229
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,365
I feel sorry for you.

230
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:41,465
You can say that again.

231
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:43,065
Oh, that's right.

232
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:46,265
Will you relay a message for me?

233
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,365
-What? -What?

234
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,565
I forgot the phone number of that fan.

235
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:51,565
And all I want you to do is write,

236
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:54,265
"I found the tree you were looking for,

237
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,465
so please come to the place

238
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:58,165
where the rock that was used in the last scene is"

239
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:00,465
on the message book that is placed at the lobby of Akagi Inn

240
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,565
right in front of the station.

241
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:07,165
I was supposed to meet that fan today at the inn

242
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:09,765
but I don't think I want to go all the way down

243
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,165
and come all the way back up again just to guide that person over.

244
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:14,765
I figure it's too tough on me.

245
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:20,065
Oh, then I think we should put your name on that message.

246
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,465
Oh, I see.

247
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:24,765
My name is...

248
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:25,765
"Hozumi."

249
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:28,365
If you write my name in katakana,

250
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,165
I'm sure the person will know who I am!

251
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,865
Are you sure writing it in katakana is enough?

252
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:35,765
Yeah, because I only talked to the person over the phone.

253
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:39,565
But that person said that he's a great fan of that drama

254
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:42,065
and had been here many times.

255
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,665
He also sent me an e-mail this morning

256
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,665
saying that he checked in to the inn this morning

257
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,165
and will be looking forward to hearing from me,

258
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,465
so I'm sure you won't have trouble finding him.

259
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:51,565
I already told him that if something comes up,

260
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,665
I'll write it in on the notebook too.

261
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,565
I'm sorry and thanks.

262
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:58,765
-Oh, okay. -Oh, okay.

263
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:06,465
"Akagi Inn"

264
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:07,965
Let's see.

265
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:12,265
"I found the tree that you were looking for."

266
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,565
"Please come to the place

267
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:18,465
where the rock that was used in the last scene is."

268
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:19,965
"Hozumi."

269
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:23,865
I guess this'll do.

270
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,465
Yes, I think that's good.

271
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,565
Okay, Sonoko, let's go have something to eat.

272
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:31,365
-What? -I'm starved.

273
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:32,565
I guess so.

274
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,765
-Conan, let's go. -Okay!

275
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,465
Oh? You're coming along too?

276
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,265
Of course, I'm going.

277
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:42,465
Oh, no! Not Kitada again. That's sexual harassment.

278
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,965
I thought so too.

279
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,465
Did he try to do something to you again, Ran?

280
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:48,365
I'm really going to give it to him!

281
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,265
"Message Book" -Who's Kitada?

282
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
So, I heard Kitada was brushed off after all!

283
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,120
What's the matter, Sonoko?

284
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,820
You haven't been eating at all.

285
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,920
Are you feeling sick or something?

286
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,720
Sonoko.

287
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,920
Maybe I should go back there after all.

288
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,020
Go where?

289
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,220
Where we were a while ago.

290
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,320
What?

291
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,220
To tie that handkerchief on.

292
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,620
What? Right now?

293
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,520
This is nothing new.

294
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,620
Here goes capricious, rich young lady.

295
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Would you not be bothered if you were me, Ran?

296
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
This is just an example but...

297
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Ran, you planned to wear your favorite color, red,

298
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,820
to meet up with Shinichi at a certain place.

299
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,320
But he saw a cute girl wearing red walks by and followed her.

300
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,920
You got to meet him

301
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,620
but you forgot to wear red.

302
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,320
It's just like that.

303
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,920
It's the same situation that I'm in now, isn't it?

304
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,720
What the heck is Sonoko talking about anyway?

305
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,120
Let's go, Sonoko! Right now!

306
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,220
What?

307
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,420
Yes!

308
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,720
She gets all carried away easily.

309
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,220
But with handkerchiefs tied on branches of trees

310
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,320
all over the mountains here,

311
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,720
even if you tie yours on,

312
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,020
nobody will know which is yours.

313
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,520
Don't worry!

314
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,920
See!

315
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,320
I wrote my name big enough to see on it

316
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,720
and attached it to a twig like a banner.

317
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,020
This way, Makoto can find it easily, right?

318
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,420
It's nowhere near romantic like "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

319
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,520
Sonoko?

320
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,320
What?

321
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,320
It's getting dark and getting kind of spooky.

322
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,620
Really?

323
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,420
Okay, let's hurry then.

324
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,820
I'm almost done.

325
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
"Hozumi"

326
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,520
Pocket diary?

327
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,120
This pocket diary...

328
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,520
Isn't this...

329
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,620
Doesn't this belong to that AD we met a while ago?

330
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,020
True.

331
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,020
Did he drop it?

332
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
I guess.

333
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,620
There's blood on the calendar.

334
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,720
It seems to have been traced with a bloody finger.

335
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,020
But why April 1st?

336
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,920
Besides...

337
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,320
it seems to be a bit wet.

338
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Okay, let's turn that diary in to the police later.

339
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,920
Okay. Let's go, Conan.

340
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,020
Okay.

341
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
Blood...

342
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,720
It's not dry yet.

343
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
Don't tell me that...

344
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,820
What?

345
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,920
Conan!

346
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,420
Get back here, you glasses kid!

347
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,120
See! It's because you run off like that!

348
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,720
What?

349
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,620
What's wrong, Ran?

350
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,020
He's the man we met a while ago, right?

351
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
Yeah.

352
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,420
The owner of the diary.

353
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,520
The one who asked us to leave a message.

354
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
The corpse is still warm.

355
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,020
Not even 30 minutes have passed yet since he was killed.

356
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,620
There's soil in between his fingernails.

357
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Soil in between his nails? Why?

358
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,020
Hey. I think we should call the police, shouldn't we?

359
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,120
Yes!

360
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,820
Hello? Is this the police?

361
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,420
Soil between his fingernails.

362
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,320
Blood on the calendar of his diary.

363
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,120
April 1st.

364
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,420
I wonder what kind of message Mr. Hozumi is trying to relay.

365
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,620
Yes. A man is lying on the ground with a knife pierced through his chest.

366
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,720
Yes.

367
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,420
Somebody...

368
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,720
I sense somebody here.

369
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,720
Not only that...

370
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
it's not only one or two people.

371
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,120
What's going on?

372
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,820
"Next Episode" -I see.

373
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,520
The red maple leaves in winter

374
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,020
was simply to mark this grave.

375
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,620
What's going on?

376
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Conan!

377
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,220
Glasses kid! Who are these people?

378
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,320
Next Conan, "Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 2)"

379
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,220
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,220
"April 1st"

381
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,520
April fool? Is it a lie or true (A homonym of 'makoto')?

382
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,220
What? Makoto? Where?
