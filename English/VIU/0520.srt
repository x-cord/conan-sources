1
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:03,214
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:05,314
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:05,314 --> 00:00:09,114
The deeply mysterious message in the very expensive wine.

4
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:10,614
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:12,714
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:15,314
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

7
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:56,118
"Accusation in Wine Red"

8
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:07,718
Greetings, Mr. Shiratori.

9
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:09,918
Welcome to my retreat.

10
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:13,418
"Murozou Honjyou (42)" -I hope you enjoy tonight's celebration.

11
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:17,018
Thank you for inviting me.

12
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,918
By the way, where is Mr. Mouri?

13
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,118
Right over here,

14
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:22,518
and I have Grand Vin.

15
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:23,718
Dad.

16
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:28,418
You can't shake the wine like that.

17
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:29,418
Why?

18
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:31,218
It will take time for the dregs

19
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,018
to settle back down into the bottle.

20
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:34,018
Dregs?

21
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:35,718
Dregs are the tannins and pigmentation

22
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:37,918
that collect at the bottom of the bottle

23
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:39,918
and change the taste of the wine.

24
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:44,518
It is all right.

25
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:48,018
But having you here is such an honor.

26
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:50,918
Mr. Hirose would be pleased to see you.

27
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:53,318
The honor is mine to be here for Mr. Hirose's 70th birthday celebration.

28
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:55,918
I know that he is the president of the National Wine Association

29
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:58,818
and the recipient of a prestigious French medal.

30
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:02,818
This is very exciting for me.

31
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,118
-You over there. -Yes.

32
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:10,418
Can you explain tonight's arrangement to Mr. Mouri?

33
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:15,518
I was wondering if you could do a skit for tonight...

34
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:16,718
What do you think Mr. Mouri?

35
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,318
Of course.

36
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:20,718
Excuse me for a second.

37
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:24,418
This is the scenario.

38
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,418
Dad, are you sure about this?

39
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:28,618
Leave it to me.

40
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:30,018
Oh, really?

41
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:34,018
You have hidden in the trunk of the car.

42
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,218
The culprit is you.

43
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:41,118
No, there should be another line before that.

44
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:42,518
Oh, yes.

45
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:45,118
Oh, bother. Why me?

46
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:50,718
You can take the ropeway up to the peak of the mountain.

47
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:52,318
The view is amazing.

48
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:53,518
You should take a stroll outside.

49
00:03:53,518 --> 00:03:54,918
I think we will.

50
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,118
Let's go, Conan.

51
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,118
Okay.

52
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,218
What are you doing here without an invitation?

53
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:07,218
Are you here to cause some trouble?

54
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:09,418
Speak up, Akamaru.

55
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:14,518
"Goro Akamaru (50)" -I hear you have the Magnum 1959 Petrus.

56
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:19,218
Yes, a wine that probably you can never taste in your lifetime.

57
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,818
Can you really understand the taste?

58
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:25,818
I know you couldn't even tell

59
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:27,718
the taste of a slightly different Neuf du Pape.

60
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:32,218
Well, poor Mr. Hirose.

61
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:35,018
It is his 70th birthday.

62
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:38,018
I should have been the one to present this party.

63
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:39,018
Shut up.

64
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:43,818
Conan, let's go.

65
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:44,818
Okay.

66
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:52,218
Today is the day that everyone will see who you really are.

67
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:55,318
Go and make a fool of yourself out there.

68
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:56,618
Conan.

69
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:10,818
What's the matter?

70
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:11,818
Look.

71
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:15,718
I can't see anything.

72
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:22,718
"When you couldn't find anywhere to put the body,

73
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:25,918
you hid the body inside the trunk of the car."

74
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:30,218
"But your wife who didn't have the slightest idea

75
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:33,318
drove the car..."

76
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,518
"Don"t underestimate me.

77
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,018
I am the one and only Detective Kogorou Mouri."

78
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:46,818
Excuse me.

79
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:47,918
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,218
That was a quick walk.

81
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,718
We were going to take time,

82
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:58,718
but Conan said he had a stomachache.

83
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:15,718
What are you doing?

84
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:17,018
I...

85
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:19,318
I was looking for something.

86
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:21,918
I guess I left it somewhere inside the house.

87
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,018
Where should I put this?

88
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,118
Oh, right. There is fine.

89
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:32,818
Excuse me, do you think that man knows where it is?

90
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:36,218
The man that had white hair and yellow jacket on.

91
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:38,818
You were talking to him.

92
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:41,818
Yes. We had some business to deal with.

93
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,518
But, he went home already.

94
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,018
I see.

95
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:57,018
"Of course, I cannot say that you are the culprit

96
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,818
by just assessing the situation."

97
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,718
And...

98
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:02,618
"We need..."

99
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:04,818
"We need some evidence."

100
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,418
Did you find it?

101
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:10,718
No.

102
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:13,518
Do you know when they arrived here?

103
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,918
At 4 o'clock, I think.

104
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,718
I was looking for...

105
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:52,518
Again?

106
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:56,918
Is it a hamster or something that you are looking for?

107
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:59,718
It must be really hard to find.

108
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,718
No, it's a ball.

109
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,018
You can only enter here with Mr. Honjou's fingerprint.

110
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:13,718
Fingerprint recognition system.

111
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:15,418
So only Mr. Honjou can enter here.

112
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:16,618
I guess.

113
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:19,818
Stop right there.

114
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:27,018
Mr. Koike, don't worry about the preparations for the party.

115
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:30,418
Can you go and find this ball this child is looking for?

116
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:35,318
And you can go upstairs and watch TV while you wait.

117
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:36,318
Okay.

118
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,818
Masked Yaiba.

119
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:48,218
Do you like Yaiba too?

120
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:50,518
My grandchildren love them too.

121
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:52,518
They're going to be in kindergarten this year.

122
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:54,818
I like him too.

123
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,518
I can't do this. The lines are too long.

124
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:02,518
I told you if you were sure you could do this.

125
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:08,018
I can ask Mr. Honjou if he can change it to a regular speech?

126
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:09,518
That would be great.

127
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:22,718
Conan.

128
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:24,618
How is your stomachache?

129
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:27,218
It's not so bad.

130
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:32,218
But I need to go again.

131
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:33,618
Conan.

132
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:39,518
Mr. Honjou, do you think you can change Mr. Mouri's skit

133
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:41,818
to a regular speech for tonight?

134
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:44,318
He cannot remember all the lines.

135
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:47,718
That is too bad, but of course.

136
00:09:47,718 --> 00:09:51,518
Do you think I can have a moment with you, Mr. Mouri?

137
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:27,918
This is...

138
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:35,018
I see. He did hide Mr. Akamaru here first,

139
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,318
but thought I would find it somehow,

140
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,418
so he moved the body.

141
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:43,218
A place that is completely safe.

142
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:44,918
It must be the wine cellar.

143
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:58,681
Thank you for traveling so far, Mr. Hirose.

144
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:01,581
I am the one to thank you.

145
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:05,781
"Shinya Hirose (70)" -This is such a huge party.

146
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:07,881
Mr. Honjou, everyone,

147
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,481
thank you so much.

148
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,781
That over there is Mr. Hirose,

149
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:13,781
the president of the National Wine Association

150
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,681
and the main guest for tonight.

151
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,081
That's the medal from France.

152
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,681
To Mr. Hirose. Celebrating his 70th birthday

153
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:28,081
and for his continuing success. Cheers.

154
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:29,481
-Cheers. -Cheers.

155
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,281
It's delicious.

156
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,681
Mr. Mouri, don't forget about your speech.

157
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:51,481
Let's now savor the highest-quality Bordeaux wines

158
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,281
that I have chosen for this evening.

159
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:57,281
A 1985 Chateau Haut Brion.

160
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:01,081
Is that expensive?

161
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:05,881
Yes. It costs more than 100,000 Yen.

162
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,881
I am looking forward to this.

163
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:11,181
It's not only the price that makes a good wine, you know.

164
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,581
Here you are.

165
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:31,181
Very soft and elegant.

166
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:33,481
Delicious.

167
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:36,281
Mr. Mouri, you also enjoy the smell

168
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,881
and color of the wine too.

169
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:46,181
Next, we have a 1982 Chateau Mouton Rothschild.

170
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:49,281
That is a beautiful label.

171
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,181
They call it an "Etiquette"

172
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:52,481
Etiquette?

173
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,481
Yes.

174
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:58,781
Every year the Mouton has different artists for the artwork.

175
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:01,881
They are known for their artistic designs.

176
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:06,281
Chagall drew their etiquette for 1970.

177
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:07,581
Wow.

178
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:11,881
This is a 1992 Chateau Le Pin.

179
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:16,481
A 1986 Chateau Lafite Rothschild.

180
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:19,481
And a 1990 Chateau Margaux.

181
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:29,781
Congratulations, Mr. Hirose.

182
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:32,681
Tell me about the incident

183
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:35,481
that occurred in Shouhei Kusaka's wine cellar.

184
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,981
Well, I can say that without me,

185
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:40,081
that case might have gone unsolved.

186
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:44,281
Mr. Hirose, would you excuse me for a second?

187
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,081
Mr. Honjou.

188
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,381
Yes?

189
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:50,181
I do not see Mr. Akamaru anywhere.

190
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,181
Who is Mr. Akamaru?

191
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:58,081
He is a French translator and a famous wine critic.

192
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,281
He was here at 3 o'clock.

193
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:04,581
And why do you know that?

194
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:06,581
I just saw him earlier.

195
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:07,781
Right?

196
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,881
Yes.

197
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,281
He said that he was sorry

198
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:16,181
that he could not be here for the celebration.

199
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:18,781
I see, that is too bad.

200
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,781
I will have to prepare for the next presentation.

201
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:29,081
And, about that incident...

202
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,781
Yes, yes.

203
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:32,081
Conan.

204
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,081
Huh?

205
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,481
Conan said he had a stomachache earlier.

206
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:38,581
Probably drank too much juice.

207
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,281
Dad, are you okay?

208
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:48,281
That was a close one.

209
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:50,981
Nothing... Everything is okay...

210
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:52,381
No problem.

211
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:55,481
Hey, little boy.

212
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:59,981
Is this what you've been looking for?

213
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:02,581
It was in the corner of the parking lot.

214
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:05,681
Yes, this is it. Thank you.

215
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,181
For half a century,

216
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:15,181
this wine has been waiting for us.

217
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,881
This is a gem in a bottle.

218
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:24,381
A 1959 magunum bottle of Chteau Petrus.

219
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,381
A 1959?

220
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:27,581
Magunum?

221
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:33,581
And I present this to you, Mr. Hirose.

222
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:35,981
Thank you Mr. Honjou.

223
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:38,481
This is a great pleasure.

224
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,181
This wine should have been uncorked

225
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:44,081
and decanted a few hours ago

226
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:45,981
But when it comes to a wine of this caliber,

227
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:49,681
it should be fully enjoyable even if we uncork it now.

228
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:58,381
What is this?

229
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:00,881
Dad, you did do something.

230
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:03,281
I'm terribly sorry.

231
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:05,381
There was an accident.

232
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:09,081
That's all right.

233
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,681
After half a century,

234
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,881
even if I pour it directly into the glasses,

235
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:16,681
I contend that we will find it just as satisfactory.

236
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:18,281
Will that be okay?

237
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:21,081
Wine should be treated like a woman.

238
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:25,881
For you Mr. Hirose.

239
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:43,481
What is the matter?

240
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,981
The dregs have been mixed.

241
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:48,181
The flavor is off too.

242
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,781
That cannot be.

243
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:01,181
May I?

244
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:02,281
Of course.

245
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:04,281
Thank you.

246
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:09,281
You are right.

247
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:13,181
Why?

248
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:14,881
Did you shake the bottle?

249
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:17,381
I wouldn't do such a thing. I am not an amateur.

250
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:20,481
Perhaps the temperature in the storeroom got too high.

251
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,381
That's also impossible.

252
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:23,981
The temperature in the storeroom

253
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:26,581
is kept perfectly regulated through computer control.

254
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:28,881
Then it is a mystery.

255
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,981
This maybe...

256
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:47,281
Being mocked by Mr. Akamaru,

257
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:49,581
Mr. Honjou killed him in rage

258
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:53,581
and hid him inside the barrel by the tennis court.

259
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:56,581
But when he noticed that I was sniffing around the house,

260
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,681
he decided to move the body to safer place.

261
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:02,081
He moved it from the tennis court to the wine cellar.

262
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:08,481
But Mr. Akamaru was still alive.

263
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:20,181
And he noticed the Petrus kept in the cellar.

264
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,681
Petrus.

265
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,581
Try this, Honjou.

266
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:44,181
Judging that Mr. Akamaru hasn't shown up,

267
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:47,581
he might be unconscious, or worse...

268
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:52,481
How do I get inside the wine cellar?

269
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:55,181
Only Mr. Honjou can open it.

270
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:57,381
I know.

271
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,881
I don't know how it...

272
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:09,281
The wine is getting to me...

273
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:12,881
Dad.

274
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,481
Is this the famous "Sleeping Kogorou"?

275
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:20,881
That is the famous...

276
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:24,781
Mr. Honjou, it seems like you have fallen into a trap.

277
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:27,081
-A trap? -Yes.

278
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,781
Someone in this party who is jealous of you

279
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:32,381
must have come to this party to embarrass you.

280
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,281
They sneaked into your wine cellar

281
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:38,081
to ruin the wine you have just served.

282
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:41,481
That's right. That must be it.

283
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,381
Who did it?

284
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,481
But that's impossible.

285
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,681
In order to get into the wine storeroom,

286
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:52,181
they would have to use my fingerprints to unlock the system.

287
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:53,881
Most likely the culprit

288
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:57,481
is someone who's familiar with the security system.

289
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:01,681
And it's possible they might still be hiding in there,

290
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:04,481
which is where the remaining wine is.

291
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:06,281
That would be horrible.

292
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:09,581
We have to stop that from happening.

293
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:11,581
Let's go to the cellar now.

294
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,881
Oh no. I can go alone.

295
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,181
It's dangerous.

296
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,281
We don't know what this culprit is capable of.

297
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:19,981
And we do not want to lose any more wine

298
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:23,281
while we try to get them.

299
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,281
But...

300
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:26,281
-I will go too. -Me too.

301
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,181
-We should hurry. -Where is the wine cellar?

302
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:37,281
Mr. Akamaru. Mr. Akamaru.

303
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:38,981
Can you hear me?

304
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:39,981
Mr. Akamaru.

305
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:43,381
Call the ambulance.

306
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,781
Yes. Right away.

307
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:50,481
What is all this, Mr. Honjou?

308
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:52,881
I... I...

309
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:55,981
Mr. Honjou, I will notify the police.

310
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:04,281
He always mocked me.

311
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,681
Said that I have no class or education

312
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:11,581
to present myself as a wine lover.

313
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:16,381
Mr. Honjou, do you really love wine?

314
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,981
Yes, I do.

315
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,381
Well, I don't think so.

316
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:24,981
The wine cellar is a sacred place for the wine lover.

317
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:27,781
And to use that to cover up a crime

318
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:28,781
is unforgivable.

319
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:37,481
Luckily, Mr. Akamaru was stabilized.

320
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:40,481
And the case was closed.

321
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:44,681
Perhaps the true victim in this case might be

322
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:47,381
the bottle whose taste was ruined when it got involved

323
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:49,581
in the dirty infighting between humans...

324
00:21:49,581 --> 00:21:51,981
That bottle of wine.

325
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,981
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The sweetness, the soft flavor.

326
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,681
Vintage wine does make the difference.

327
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:26,881
How much was that wine?

328
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:28,181
It was 10,000 yen,

329
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:33,381
but I had the people at the store switch it to a 1000 yen bottle.

330
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:42,081
"Tres Bien"

331
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:46,781
It's lucky for us that you can't recognize the taste.

332
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:51,381
This thing I'm feeling...

333
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:52,381
It can't be?

334
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:53,881
Yeah, that's right.

335
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:55,981
It's the antidote for APTX 4869

336
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:57,581
that could maybe change his body that had become that of a child

337
00:23:57,581 --> 00:24:00,481
to the body of a high school student that it used to be.

338
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,581
Shinichi?

339
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:06,781
Shinichi!

340
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:10,381
Don't tell me that you...

341
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:14,781

00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:32,781
"Shinichi Kudo".

345
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:34,081
What? Me, the clue?

346
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,581
Said something?

347
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:37,414
No... The first episode of the New Year!
