1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:02,674
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:04,574
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:07,474
An unexpected misunderstanding at a premier preview of a movie.

4
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,274
The Youth Detective Squad stop the case before it happens!

5
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,674
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:12,174
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:14,375
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,469
The game is over!

9
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,369
You have no way out!

10
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,969
You're out! Dark Sashimu.

11
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,469
What are you saying...

12
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,170
Can you catch a big shock...

13
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,970
like me?

14
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,070
Don't think...

15
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,870
It's feels like water...

16
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,570
"Worldwide release on the 30th of October!"

17
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,670
"Witness the legendary ending!"

18
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:56,870
Witness this event of the century.

19
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,969
Talk about a long line.

20
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,469
It can't be helped.

21
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,769
It's the last of a popular movie that's been playing for 20 years.

22
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,769
But, we're sure were lucky

23
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,269
to be able to get a hold of the ticket of this preview.

24
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,669
You got it from Yoko Okino, didn't you?

25
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,469
Yeah, be grateful to me.

26
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,569
Because I'm the one that had Pops ask Yoko Okino for it,

27
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,270
thinking that we had nothing to lose either way.

28
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,169
Well...

29
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,969
I'm not done yet.

30
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,269
I'll show you

31
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,269
the power of the master swordsman of darkness.

32
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,669
Your powers

33
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,969
don't stand a chance

34
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,669
against this master swordsman of light, Bei-Ju.

35
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,269
I'll defeat you with the sword of the sun of the woman,

36
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,269
warrior of fire, Kisasa!

37
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,770
I won't lose.

38
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,070
-That's hurt! -I'll bet you guys don't feel a tinge of gratitude.

39
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,770
"Preview of Karma and Friendship."

40
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,869
Hey, hey, come back here and stand in line!

41
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,669
Who cares, we've got tickets to go in, right?

42
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,069
Even if we don't stand in line,

43
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,569
if the time comes we get to go inside, don't we?

44
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,169
But, as far as the seats, it's first come first serve,

45
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,169
so you won't get good seats if you don't stand in line like you should.

46
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,569
I guess so, but just thinking that I'm going to get to see it

47
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,369
before any of my other classmates...

48
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,969
It's so exciting.

49
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,069
It's hard to stay still.

50
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,169
In that case, you have to dress up properly.

51
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,369
"Bungo Tatei."

52
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,469
As for Dark Sashimu's two sword style,

53
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,669
you've got to hold the long sword in your right hand

54
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,869
and the short sword in your left hand.

55
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,269
Moreover, Bei-Ju wears his eye patch over his left eye,

56
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,469
and Kisasa's sword of the sun is long

57
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,569
so you've got to stretch it out like this and use it.

58
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,569
Wow! This sword stretches!

59
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,169
You're really knowledgeable, aren't you?

60
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,170
Yes.

61
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:51,669
The fact is, I have the items that these children have too.

62
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,069
This guy is a maniac.

63
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,969
You like Star Blade too, don't you?

64
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,869
Yeah, I've been a great fan since I saw the first series

65
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,569
when I was about your age.

66
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,669
Besides, I met my girlfriend for the first time

67
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,069
at the preview for this movie too.

68
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,469
She's not with you today?

69
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,269
No... well, you know...

70
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,569
Did you have a fight or something?

71
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,369
Don't tell me you fought because you had only one ticket?

72
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,269
No, it's nothing like that.

73
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,769
My friend, Narukawa, who also likes Star Blade

74
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,370
kept bugging me to give him this ticket last night by phone but...

75
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,869
Hey, hey.

76
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,569
You've got to hang on nice and tight to your ticket.

77
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,769
It's an important ticket, you know.

78
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,169
Sorry, sorry.

79
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,369
It's only a while more till the doors will open.

80
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,969
-Please stand in one straight line! -It's the swordsman of darkness,

81
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,769
-Dark Takio! -Really!

82
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,069
Oh yeah, would you like me to take a picture of you with him?

83
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,570
-Yes, please! -Yes, please!

84
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,570
Okay, smile.

85
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,969
Thank you, sir!

86
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,469
You're welcome.

87
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,969
I'm sorry and thank you so much.

88
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,169
Oh, not at all.

89
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,869
By the way, I'm...

90
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,269
Here's my name card.

91
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,369
"Bungo Tatei, Freelance Photographer" -Mr. Bungo Tatei.

92
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,869
You're a camera man.

93
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,669
Yes, so I'll guarantee that the outcome of the picture will be good.

94
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,569
Would you like me to take a picture of you too, sir?

95
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,169
Okay.

96
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,769
Then, I'll take the picture with that camera.

97
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,570
Okay, say cheese!

98
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,269
Thank you.

99
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,169
I will send you the picture,

100
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,269
so could you write your name and address in my pocketbook here?

101
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,969
Okay.

102
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,470
Let's see...

103
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,770
Huh?

104
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,569
Oh, did you finish writing?

105
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,570
Oh, yeah.

106
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:38,770
Okay, I'll send it as soon as it's developed and printed.

107
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,269
To this address, right?

108
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,770
Of course, you don't have to pay me, so please don't worry.

109
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,869
But, I'm really looking forward to Dark Takio.

110
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,769
Yes! I wonder what he's going to do in this movie.

111
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,969
He's so strong. That is very exciting!

112
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,969
-Don't worry! -What?

113
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,369
I'm sure that Bei-Ju and Kisasa will beat Dark Takio up!

114
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,769
Evil never wins over good.

115
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,170
Huh?

116
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,370
The phone...

117
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,569
Yes, this is Tatei.

118
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,769
Oh, Narukawa?

119
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,269
What? Come in front of the second Okuho Building now?

120
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,869
Yeah, okay.

121
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,070
I'll be right over.

122
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,069
I'm sorry, could you keep my place for me?

123
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,969
I'll leave my things here so...

124
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,269
Okay, no problem.

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,070
I'll be right back.

126
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,070
Hey, mister.

127
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,069
Didn't that guy say something?

128
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,469
What do you mean something?

129
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,469
Didn't he take money from you or something?

130
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,369
No, all he took was our picture.

131
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,169
He insisted to take a picture of us too just a while ago.

132
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,269
He was really a pain.

133
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,769
I thought he was a new type of swindler or something.

134
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,570
I guess not.

135
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,969
"Joji Narukawa" -Hey, Narukawa!

136
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,969
-Huh? -Thanks for waiting.

137
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,069
What was that call all about?

138
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,169
You're the one who told me to call when I got here, right?

139
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,069
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

140
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,169
If it's not something important, I'm going home!

141
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,669
I don't have that much time to waste either!

142
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,069
Don't worry.

143
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,469
I'm sure you'll like it.

144
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,270
It's a present from the bottom of my heart...

145
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,869
that I got for my best friend.

146
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,969
But, that man was saying something strange a while ago, wasn't he?

147
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,969
Yes. He said that Dark Takio would be defeated by Bei-Ju and Kisasa!

148
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,869
He also said that evil never wins over good.

149
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,769
Oh, but isn't it only natural that justice wins over evil?

150
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,469
But, Dark Takio is on their side since the previous movie!

151
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,869
He went against Dark Sahimu!

152
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,769
When he took off his skull mask, he was really good looking,

153
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,370
so I know he's a good guy!

154
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,269
I wonder why that man said so.

155
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,969
Maybe he's going to betray everybody again in this movie?

156
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,269
What?

157
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,269
He probably didn't see the previous Star Blade V.

158
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,569
Hey, don't look through other people's things.

159
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,069
See, there are two tickets for the preview of this movie three years ago,

160
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,570
unused in between the pages of his pocketbook.

161
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,769
Hey, the thing that's smeared on one side of the ticket...

162
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,669
It's probably bloodstain.

163
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,869
Although it looks pretty old.

164
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,269
Blood?

165
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,569
Don't tell me somebody had a bloody fight over those tickets?

166
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,769
What?

167
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,869
I don't know about that,

168
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,169
but I'm pretty sure that the owners of these two tickets are...

169
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,769
that man called Tatei that we saw a while ago

170
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,869
and the woman in this picture.

171
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,569
There's no mistaking that.

172
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,769
It looks like the picture was taken in a car.

173
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,269
The date on the picture

174
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,669
is the same as the one on the ticket bought three years ago.

175
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,869
I wonder why he didn't go to the preview.

176
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,069
I wonder...

177
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,569
The elevator?

178
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,869
Yes.

179
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,669
Go straight down that aisle and you'll see it on the left.

180
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,469
Thank you.

181
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,269
Hey, Narukawa! The elevator's on the left side of the aisle!

182
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,269
Hey, it's not that hard to find, is it?

183
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,369
Sorry, I'm really bad at directions.

184
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,069
"Film content" -Strange.

185
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,569
Something's strange?

186
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,169
It's just notes, isn't it?

187
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,669
Remember, that man called Tatei a while ago

188
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,969
ripped the page off his pocketbook

189
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,269
and put it inside his film case, didn't he?

190
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,669
When he did so, I first thought that he did that

191
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,769
so he wouldn't forget what he had taken,

192
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,169
but all the films are numbered

193
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,969
and the details of what are in the films

194
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,869
are written out in his pocketbook.

195
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,069
Besides, none of the other pages in his pocketbook are ripped off,

196
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,269
and all the other films that are completed are all in his bag.

197
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,270
Why only that film is not?

198
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,969
Come on, hurry up and show me the present you got for me!

199
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,869
Hold your horses.

200
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,569
I'll give it to you soon.

201
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,670
When we arrive at the right place.

202
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,869
Talking about film, there's something that's also bothering me.

203
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,870
What?

204
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:15,169
When I took a picture of him a while ago,

205
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,569
he rewound it right away.

206
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,569
But there were still 15 more films left.

207
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,069
Don't you think that's strange?

208
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,769
The film was taken out before it was all used up.

209
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,769
He deliberately ripped the page with Dr. Agasa's address on it

210
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,169
out of his pocketbook and put it away in his pocket.

211
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,469
The blood stained preview ticket of three years ago,

212
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,970
and a friend who is a fan of Star Blade called him...

213
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,870
Don't tell me that he's...

214
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,969
Hey, Tatei!

215
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,669
Can we come in here without permission?

216
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,769
This is the roof.

217
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,169
Do you remember, Narukawa?

218
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,170
What?

219
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,669
It was a fine day like today

220
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,869
when we met her, Ami

221
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,269
at the preview of the movie, wasn't it?

222
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,469
I see! I got it!

223
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,069
That man is probably here on his job!

224
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,569
So, in order to separate the film from his work photos,

225
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,169
he took it out.

226
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,869
-Oh, come on... -What?

227
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,769
If he's here on the job,

228
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,269
he wouldn't have to stand in line like this, would he?

229
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,870
I guess so.

230
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,470
Maybe he has no intention...

231
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,270
of coming back here.

232
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,152
What?

233
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:37,352
Hey, hey, did you forget?

234
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:38,952
It happened only six years ago.

235
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:40,852
Of course I remember!

236
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,352
You mean the first time we met Ami

237
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:44,952
at the preview of Star Blade IV, right?

238
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:49,452
We found her holding her ticket and lost,

239
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,752
so we brought her here.

240
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:56,352
To this same place six years ago, didn't we?

241
00:12:56,353 --> 00:13:00,452
And three years ago, it was this same place too.

242
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:02,352
Hey, don't tell me...

243
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:06,252
you're angry about the accident that killed Ami three years ago?

244
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:10,052
It's true that I was the one driving at that time,

245
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,852
but the police said so too, didn't they?

246
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:14,752
That the truck that rammed us was to blame!

247
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:19,253
That the driver doze off, ran the red light and crashed into us.

248
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,352
Darn.

249
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:24,552
It's true that back then I overslept

250
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,052
and was a bit flustered myself too,

251
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:29,452
but I wasn't speeding or anything like that.

252
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:33,352
Besides, why are you bringing such an old topic out

253
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,252
at a place like this?

254
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:36,752
What?

255
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:39,753
I'll give you a present from me to you.

256
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:44,852
This is the ticket to the preview of Star Blade?

257
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,852
You called and asked

258
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:49,052
if I had any extra tickets, right?

259
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,752
But, you said you didn't have any left last night.

260
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:52,753
I got urgent business to attend to suddenly

261
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,352
so I ended up not being able to go.

262
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:57,552
That's why I called you this morning.

263
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:59,552
Besides, I thought that if I gave it to you here,

264
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:02,852
it would also make Ami happy.

265
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:07,952
Remember? The accident happened right below here, didn't it?

266
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:11,052
Yeah, right.

267
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,352
Since that accident,

268
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,552
we haven't been comfortable with each other,

269
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,853
so this is a token of me making up with you.

270
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:22,852
Hey, hey, they'll be opening the doors in five minutes!

271
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:23,853
What?

272
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:24,952
If you don't hurry,

273
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:27,152
you won't make it in time for the event to be held before the movie.

274
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:28,652
No joke?

275
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:30,652
Okay, thanks Tatei!

276
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:33,652
Yeah. Go and watch the movie closely for me too!

277
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:37,552
Okay! I'll go watch really closely the actions of Dark Takio,

278
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:39,852
your favorite character!

279
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:41,752
Although I'm pretty sure Bei-Ju and Kisasa

280
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:43,752
are going to beat him up.

281
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:44,852
Yeah.

282
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:47,052
I'll treat you to something some other time in exchange for this ticket!

283
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,153
Yeah.

284
00:14:57,653 --> 00:14:58,853
Ami.

285
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:05,453
I'm sorry to have left you all alone three years ago.

286
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,752
Hang on.

287
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:18,453
I'll head over to where you are from now.

288
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,453
No use.

289
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:27,952
Even if you jump off from there now...

290
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:30,653
It'll only look like any other suicide.

291
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:35,152
Because I'll testify that

292
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:38,952
I saw you jump over the fence by yourself!

293
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:43,452
You're the boy that was standing in line for the pre-screening.

294
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:45,752
You seem to be misunderstanding something,

295
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:48,252
I was leaning over just to see the landscape.

296
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:50,753
The scenario you wrote goes like this...

297
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:57,052
First, you randomly chose somebody who was standing in line.

298
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,952
Befriend them by telling that you're a great Star Blade fan.

299
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:03,053
Then, you take pictures with that person.

300
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:06,652
Saying that you'd send the picture you took,

301
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:10,152
you'd have them write their name and address into your pocketbook.

302
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:11,552
You rip off the page

303
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,252
and put it inside the film case and put it into your pocket.

304
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:17,452
You probably then told your friend to call you when he arrives

305
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:19,952
and lured him out here.

306
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:21,552
When your friend calls you,

307
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:23,852
you shout his name as well as where he is,

308
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:26,553
and make the people that you have befriended remember both.

309
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,752
Then you leave the line, saying that you'd be right back,

310
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:34,452
meet your friend and take him to this roof,

311
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,752
then all you had to do was to give your friend the ticket

312
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:37,352
and jump from this roof.

313
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:43,152
Since we were chosen by you to become friends with you,

314
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,352
if you die and our picture, name and address

315
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:46,552
are found among your belongings,

316
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:49,552
the police will most naturally contact us.

317
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:52,252
If the police learns from us

318
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:55,752
how much of a fan of this movie you are,

319
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:57,052
and that the friend who called

320
00:16:57,053 --> 00:17:01,152
really wanted your ticket for the preview,

321
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,952
and if he is found to be holding the preview tickets

322
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:07,552
with your fingerprints on it,

323
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:10,752
they would most probably think...

324
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:14,452
This friend of yours called you just before the preview

325
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:17,152
and pushed you off the roof

326
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,653
and stole the ticket from you.

327
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:22,952
By the way,

328
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:25,952
you deliberately asked where the elevator was

329
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:29,252
because you wanted to leave an impression that you were with a friend.

330
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:31,452
You also deliberately dropped your ticket

331
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:34,853
to get my friend's fingerprints on it.

332
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:39,652
After the preview, if among the tickets that the police collect,

333
00:17:39,653 --> 00:17:43,152
they find a ticket with the fingerprints of your friend

334
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,552
and my friend fingerprints on,

335
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:49,652
it would serve as proof that when you met us today,

336
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,253
you in fact had that ticket with you.

337
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:56,452
You're a smart boy.

338
00:17:56,453 --> 00:18:00,052
But, I wonder if the police will really believe the testimony

339
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,852
and deduction of just you alone.

340
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:04,553
They sure will!

341
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,752
He alone may not do, but...

342
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,952
-If there are five of us... -They'll believe us!

343
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:13,152
Besides, we passed the man

344
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:15,552
that looked to be your friend just a while ago,

345
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,352
but I think he's already left the building

346
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:20,452
and headed for the movie preview.

347
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:22,952
So, even if you were to jump off now,

348
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:26,352
there would be a time discrepancy and your trick would go to waste.

349
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:28,452
Too bad.

350
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:29,952
Darn.

351
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:32,052
You don't understand a tinge of how I feel.

352
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,152
In fact we do.

353
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:38,052
Your motive for doing this is because three years ago,

354
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:40,952
your girlfriend died of a traffic accident,

355
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,452
in which this friend of yours was driving, right?

356
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:46,252
How did you find out about it?

357
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:50,252
You had a ticket and picture stuck inside your pocketbook, didn't you?

358
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:54,152
It was the preview ticket of Star Blade V three years ago,

359
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:56,152
and the picture was of you and your girlfriend

360
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:59,752
sitting in the backseat of the car.

361
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:02,052
The one who took the picture was probably the driver

362
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,552
and a friend who agreed to take your picture.

363
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:08,252
Moreover, there was blood on one of the tickets,

364
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:09,752
and the date on the picture was the same

365
00:19:09,753 --> 00:19:11,152
as the date of the preview three years ago,

366
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:13,452
so it's not hard to deduce.

367
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:17,652
An accident that prevented you from going to the preview occurred,

368
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,752
and the one who was to blame for it was that friend of yours

369
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:23,352
that you tried to set up as a killer for murdering you,

370
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:27,352
as well as the one who was most probably driving the car.

371
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:29,452
Yeah, exactly.

372
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:33,652
If he didn't over sleep that day...

373
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:36,552
If only he had come to pick us up at the appointed time...

374
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:38,252
We wouldn't have had to run into that hateful truck

375
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:40,253
with the driver sleeping at the wheels!

376
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:46,152
But, that's...

377
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,852
Holding a grudge against the wrong person, isn't it?

378
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:53,952
Yeah. I thought so too and held back my feelings.

379
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:57,952
But, after a long absence of three years he calls me and says,

380
00:19:57,953 --> 00:20:02,052
"Do you have any extra tickets for the preview of Star Blade VI?"

381
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:05,152
And after taking the ticket from me,

382
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:08,552
he headed happily towards the theater.

383
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:11,452
As if he'd forgotten about what happened three years ago.

384
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:13,252
All he was thinking about

385
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,652
was the confrontation of Dark Takio against Bei-Ju and Kisasa.

386
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:18,152
Those two are not going to fight!

387
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:21,752
Dark Takio is now on Bei-Ju and Kisasa's side!

388
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,152
I see.

389
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:27,252
Neither he, nor his friend hasn't saw Star Blade V.

390
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:31,252
But, his friend still wanted the ticket, which means...

391
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:34,452
Is the site of the accident that happened three years ago near here?

392
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,852
Yeah.

393
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:37,552
That's why I was going to jump off from this building.

394
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:39,053
Please take me there.

395
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:48,452
He's the man we passed a while ago in the building.

396
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:51,252
But, that's not where the theater is.

397
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,952
Narukawa?

398
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,752
Where's the site of the accident?

399
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,252
Over there.

400
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:58,252
She was dragged blown over by the truck

401
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:00,653
and crashed into that guard rail.

402
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:05,653
Something's stuck here.

403
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:08,852
Just as I thought.

404
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:10,352
What's that?

405
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,752
The ticket for the preview of Star Blade VI.

406
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,152
What?

407
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:18,852
The ticket of three years ago is stuck on this side.

408
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:21,152
It's all beat up from wind and rain though.

409
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:23,652
But, why would he...

410
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:25,352
What an idiot!

411
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,652
He wanted your girlfriend to see the preview!

412
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:32,652
If he offers it here, it may reach the heavens, right?

413
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:38,052
Besides, since he said nothing about it to you,

414
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:43,652
I'm sure he liked your girlfriend too.

415
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:45,953
Almost as much as you did.

416
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:16,852
There's only three minutes to go

417
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,352
till the event before the preview starts.

418
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:20,452
What?

419
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:23,852
Why don't you come to the preview with us too?

420
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:27,252
Watch it closely, and tell your girlfriend about it!

421
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:30,152
The fact is, we have one extra ticket.

422
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:32,753
It's Pops' ticket because he decided not to come.

423
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:36,052
Thank you.

424
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:37,552
But, I don't think so.

425
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:39,752
Because I didn't see Star Blade V yet.

426
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:44,152
And, as for Star Blade V and VI,

427
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:45,452
I'll buy the DVD

428
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:47,453
because I want to watch it with him at his house.

429
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:56,053
They're late.

430
00:24:08,253 --> 00:24:11,852
The mini cars, dolls and books that were lined out on the shelf

431
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:14,952
almost all of them are upside down.

432
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,853
How come?

433
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,252
Next Conan,

434
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:28,153
"Result of the Tumble (Part 1)"

435
00:24:43,953 --> 00:24:46,452
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:48,152
"Collection."

437
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,652
Collector appears in the next episode!

438
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,452
Haibara, what are you collecting?

439
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:52,753
It's a secret.
