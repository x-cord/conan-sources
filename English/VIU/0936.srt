1
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:05,491
I wonder what Conan is doing right now.

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:10,491
The Dr. Agasa said he suddenly had to go to Hokkaido.

3
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:14,591
He's probably stuffing himself full of tasty foods, like eel.

4
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:17,791
Yeah, right. He's not you.

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,091
So...

6
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:20,491
"Farmer's Market" -Tada!

7
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,091
We should go to this event without him.

8
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,691
The Beika City Farmer's Market?

9
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:29,291
"Beika City Farmer's Market" -It's an event where farmers

10
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,891
bring their produce to sell.

11
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:35,591
Lots of food trucks are coming, too.

12
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:38,591
And kids in grade school or younger eat free.

13
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:42,591
I see. So that's what you're after.

14
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,991
There's a police event, too.

15
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,891
See? He's wearing his uniform,

16
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:52,591
but this is Inspector Megure, right?

17
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,991
You're right.

18
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:56,391
Forget that. Let's hurry.

19
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,491
I'm hungry.

20
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,891
What?

21
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:02,591
What do you mean it won't arrive in time?

22
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:04,891
Didn't you say you ordered it?

23
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,791
Hey, keep your voice down.

24
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,491
"Yuji Yamawaki (33)" -The shipping company made a mistake.

25
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:12,291
What can we do?

26
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,391
We'll have to give up on today.

27
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:15,391
"Kaori Kanno (29)" -We can't!

28
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,591
What do you think we've been preparing for?

29
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:21,691
If the stuff won't arrive today, we can just go buy it.

30
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,791
Yeah, but...

31
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,291
No.

32
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,591
"Nobuo Kadokura (32)" -There's still time. It could still work out.

33
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,691
You're right. Let's have an explosive time,

34
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,691
just like we planned.

35
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,791
What?

36
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,591
Did you hear that?

37
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:36,591
Yeah.

38
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:39,291
She said something about having an explosive time.

39
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,491
Speaking of explosions...

40
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:43,591
A bomb!

41
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,391
What's wrong?

42
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,691
Did something happen?

43
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:55,791
I thought I heard someone.

44
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,691
Must've been my imagination.

45
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,891
It sounds like they're planning to set off a bomb at this event.

46
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,891
But it's just a farmer's market.

47
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,391
What are they going to explode?

48
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,591
Inspector Megure?

49
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:20,291
In my eyes are maximum creation.

50
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,991
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

51
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,591
The Youth Detective Squad are minus Conan!

52
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,391
How will they handle the bombing case?

53
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,091
He sees through the one and only truth.

54
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:28,891
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

55
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,391
His name is Detective Conan!

56
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:18,416
"Intrigue at the Food Court"

57
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,757
We overheard something terrible.

58
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:27,057
What should we do?

59
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:30,457
You're asking me? What can we do?

60
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:34,657
Well, shouldn't we tell the police?

61
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:36,857
But will they believe us?

62
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:40,757
It'll probably end with them shooing us away like they always do.

63
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:45,457
If only Conan were here...

64
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:47,557
Nicely done, Ayumi.

65
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,857
You realized something important.

66
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,557
If you want the police to believe you,

67
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:55,557
you need to calmly come up with a plan.

68
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:56,757
That's it!

69
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,557
Let's calmly come up with a plan

70
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:00,857
so the police will believe us.

71
00:05:00,857 --> 00:05:03,257
What? That's easier said than done.

72
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:09,157
I hate to admit it, but I wish Conan were here.

73
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:11,157
Come on.

74
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:13,657
Aren't you The Youth Detective Squad?

75
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:18,457
What's the most important part of a police investigation?

76
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:22,957
Is it evidence?

77
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:25,257
So you do know the answer.

78
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:27,457
If you want the police to act,

79
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:29,357
you need evidence first.

80
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:30,557
That's it!

81
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:35,157
We need evidence that they're planning to set off a bomb.

82
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:37,157
Then the police will believe us.

83
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:38,857
See you guys in an hour.

84
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:41,557
-Got it. -Make sure there aren't any leaks.

85
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,557
We know.

86
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:46,157
Hey, they're leaving.

87
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:47,357
What should we do?

88
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:49,857
We should split up and follow them.

89
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:53,657
What? But I'm hungry.

90
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,357
Excuse me, Genta.

91
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,357
If you catch the bad guys,

92
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,957
you might be rewarded with lots of tasty food.

93
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:02,957
What?

94
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:07,457
And the other two are counting on you.

95
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:11,157
Oh, right. Yeah, you're right.

96
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:14,057
Okay, let's split up and follow them.

97
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:15,457
Didn't I just say that?

98
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:16,657
Yeah.

99
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:20,557
Officer Sato, security is in place.

100
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:23,557
We just finished combing the area for suspicious persons, too.

101
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,157
The background checks on the food truck owners

102
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:27,657
and vendors came back clean?

103
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:29,657
Yes. We've asked them to present

104
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,257
the identification papers they prepared beforehand

105
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:33,757
when they enter the park.

106
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:37,757
Okay. Inspector Megure's speech is in about two hours.

107
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:40,957
Let's patrol the area again.

108
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:44,157
What? Roger...

109
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:47,457
What?

110
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:50,457
Officer Takagi, what are you doing? Let's go.

111
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:51,457
Sorry.

112
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:57,157
This guy...

113
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:02,157
Darn bad guys.

114
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:06,257
How far is he going?

115
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:07,257
This is bad.

116
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:18,957
Genta.

117
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:21,457
Try to calm down.

118
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:22,857
Okay.

119
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:26,457
And you should stay a little farther back.

120
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:28,557
I know that.

121
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:35,557
Genta, Genta.

122
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:38,557
You can't just look at his face.

123
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:41,057
Memorize his clothes and possessions

124
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:42,757
and use them to spot him.

125
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,257
All right.

126
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:05,457
"Vegetable Oil"

127
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,457
What's he buying all that stuff for?

128
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:17,257
They're all highly flammable objects.

129
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:19,657
What? Then are they actually...

130
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:42,757
"Singaporean Restaurant"

131
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:58,057
What's wrong, Ayumi?

132
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:00,557
There's a strange sound coming from inside.

133
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:03,657
It's okay. I'm here for you.

134
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:04,657
Okay.

135
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:17,357
Watch your step.

136
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,857
Walk slowly and carefully.

137
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:20,857
Okay.

138
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:32,757
Who are you?

139
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:07,757
Hello?

140
00:10:21,757 --> 00:10:24,757
Why are you making that face, Mitsuhiko?

141
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,257
There's something strange about his actions,

142
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:31,057
but I don't know what it is.

143
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:35,457
Good grief. I thought you were smarter than this.

144
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:41,457
Don't I always tell you how important it is to observe?

145
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:45,257
Think back on the things you saw.

146
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:46,557
You're right.

147
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:50,257
He was sitting in the non-smoking section.

148
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,057
But after taking a seat once,

149
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:55,057
he switched to a different table closer to the front.

150
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,557
Why did he do that?

151
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:01,057
I know!

152
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,957
The back of the restaurant is near the smoking section.

153
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:06,357
The smell of cigarettes bothered him.

154
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:09,157
So he hates cigarettes.

155
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:13,557
Why did he stop at a cigarette shop?

156
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:22,557
He bought something.

157
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,657
Something's definitely fishy.

158
00:11:24,657 --> 00:11:25,657
Yes.

159
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:40,557
Hey, kid.

160
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:42,657
You got some business with me?

161
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,890
I see. So you overheard us.

162
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,190
Explain yourselves.

163
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,390
What's so funny?

164
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,290
Sorry. An explosive time, huh?

165
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,490
I see.

166
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,590
That certainly sounds like we're setting up a bomb.

167
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,590
What? You're not?

168
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,190
Hey, what's going on?

169
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,190
Who's the kid?

170
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,690
Mitsuhiko!

171
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,090
Be careful!

172
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,790
He was buying oil and gas at the hardware store!

173
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,690
They must be planning to build a bomb with it!

174
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,390
No way.

175
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,190
Listen, this is a misunderstanding.

176
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,090
This is our food truck.

177
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,390
We're trying to sell our chicken rice here today.

178
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,790
Chicken rice?

179
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,290
It's a famous Singaporean dish.

180
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,690
We work at a nearby restaurant called Marina.

181
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,590
We decided to participate in this event

182
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,190
to show off our best dish.

183
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,090
If we do well today,

184
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,490
the restaurant will get lots of customers starting tomorrow.

185
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,790
The explosive time you heard us talking about

186
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,990
was in reference to explosive sales.

187
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,790
Chicken rice, huh? That sounds good.

188
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,990
Then what did you get at the cigarette shop?

189
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,990
These. I had a printer friend make them for me.

190
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,390
Since I ordered them late,

191
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,590
they weren't finished until today.

192
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,790
I was supposed to pick them up at a cafe,

193
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,190
but he was too busy to come,

194
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,190
so he called to say he left them

195
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,690
with that shop he regularly visits.

196
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,290
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

197
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,590
It seems like we were confused.

198
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,490
They're not bad people.

199
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,490
Where'd you find this girl?

200
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,490
I ran into her when I returned to the restaurant

201
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,190
to pick up the prepped chicken.

202
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,890
Since I had the apron and knife we use to butcher chicken,

203
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,990
I scared her.

204
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,690
They were just trying to cook.

205
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,690
Chicken rice, huh?

206
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,790
Are you going to back down now, detective?

207
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,490
Of course not!

208
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,590
Then hold out a little longer.

209
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,890
Hold out?

210
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,990
But why do you need so much oil and gas?

211
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,790
There was a mistake, and our stuff didn't arrive.

212
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,990
We did the basic prep work at the restaurant,

213
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,790
but we heat up the soup and make the sauce

214
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,890
inside the food truck.

215
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,190
We received our eating and cooking utensils,

216
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,890
but we don't have any oil or gas.

217
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,790
We considered giving up,

218
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,190
but we managed to get everything in time

219
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,990
by going out and buying it.

220
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,090
Although the unnecessary expense

221
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,690
will probably put us in the red.

222
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,090
Don't worry. If we spread the name Marina here,

223
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,490
starting tomorrow...

224
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,090
Our sales could explode!

225
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,290
This might have been a misunderstanding on our part.

226
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,390
After all, they say there's no such thing as an evil cook.

227
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,790
Yeah, you're right.

228
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,390
Sounds like it was a misunderstanding.

229
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,390
Yes.

230
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,290
Well, don't worry about it.

231
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,490
Detectives are bound to make mistakes.

232
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,490
Ayumi, are you sure you want to give up?

233
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,990
Isn't there one last thing you need to confirm?

234
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,690
Let us eat your chicken rice.

235
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,790
-What? -What?

236
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,890
If you really work in a restaurant,

237
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,390
you should be able to make some chicken rice.

238
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,290
Good grief.

239
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,990
We don't have a choice.

240
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,790
We're not open yet, but...

241
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,990
We'll make an exception for you.

242
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,290
All right!

243
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,290
Three chicken rices ready.

244
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,790
Got it.

245
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,090
Thanks for waiting.

246
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,890
Use as much sauce as you'd like.

247
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,690
We didn't make it too spicy.

248
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,490
What? This is chicken rice?

249
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,590
It's nothing like what I imagined.

250
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,190
It's not red.

251
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,990
What you normally eat

252
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,790
is fried rice flavored with ketchup, right?

253
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,090
Singaporean chicken rice

254
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,790
is rice cooked in chicken broth

255
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,290
and topped with steamed chicken.

256
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,890
Then you cover it with whatever sauces you want and eat it.

257
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,390
It's the national dish of Singapore.

258
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,190
-Thanks for the food! -Thanks for the food!

259
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,990
It's delicious!

260
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,390
It's good!

261
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,490
This sauce goes perfectly with chicken!

262
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,890
Has this resolved our misunderstanding?

263
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,590
Yeah.

264
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,990
More!

265
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,690
We're really sorry.

266
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,690
We were just confused.

267
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,490
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

268
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,790
Thanks for the food.

269
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,190
It was great.

270
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,790
Can I ask you something?

271
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,790
What is it?

272
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,390
Why do you have a giant star on your food truck?

273
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,390
What? Oh, this?

274
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,690
We like stargazing.

275
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,890
On our days off, we always go stargazing.

276
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,390
We just went last week.

277
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,390
Really?

278
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,990
Be careful on your way home.

279
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,690
And come to our restaurant.

280
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,290
-Okay. -Okay.

281
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,790
Huh? You kids.

282
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,790
Officer Sato and Officer Takagi.

283
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,190
What are you doing? The event hasn't opened yet.

284
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,190
Oh, this and that.

285
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,590
Those guys made us chicken rice.

286
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,990
Chicken rice? You mean rice flavored with ketchup?

287
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,290
No! Singaporean chicken rice is totally different!

288
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,190
You serve steamed chicken over rice

289
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,690
and eat it with all kinds of sauces.

290
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,590
It's the national dish of Singapore.

291
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,790
Did they teach you that?

292
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,290
-Yes! -Yes!

293
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,490
They certainly must work at a Singaporean restaurant.

294
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,890
That's quite the flashy food truck, though.

295
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,490
There's a giant star on it.

296
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,890
Oh, that's...

297
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,790
They said it's because they like stargazing.

298
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,890
They go stargazing on their days off.

299
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,890
Really? Is that so?

300
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,790
Well, we've got work to do.

301
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,190
-Bye! -Bye!

302
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,090
Jeez. Those kids were odd.

303
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,390
I wasn't sure what to do

304
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,790
when she followed me to the restaurant.

305
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,790
They were strangely intelligent,

306
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,790
but kids are kids.

307
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,490
The deal is done.

308
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:32,290
If that old woman learned a bomb was exchanged at her shop,

309
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,190
she'd be paralyzed with fear.

310
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,290
Will it work?

311
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,690
It doesn't seem very powerful.

312
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,690
We're inside a car.

313
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,790
If we set it up near the gas tank,

314
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,590
the truck itself will be a bomb.

315
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,090
And we've got oil, gas tanks, and fuel accelerants.

316
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,390
I was worried when I heard the bomb wouldn't arrive

317
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,390
because of the shipping company's mistake.

318
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,890
But if all this stuff explodes at once,

319
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,090
he won't stand a chance.

320
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,590
Not Megure.

321
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,890
What about me?

322
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,490
Don't move!

323
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,790
I remember you.

324
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,590
We arrested you when you tried to rob a bank

325
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,390
seven years ago.

326
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,490
I heard you'd gotten out,

327
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,090
but to think you'd do this for revenge.

328
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,790
All of Marina's employees are under our protection.

329
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,490
After entering the restaurant before opening

330
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,390
and stealing the ID's of the employees,

331
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,190
they had them prep the chicken rice

332
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,390
before tying them up and trapping them in storage.

333
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,590
And plotted to blow us up in the park.

334
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,290
They bought the bomb on an illegal website.

335
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,790
The cigarette shop was just used as a drop-off location.

336
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,190
The cyber crimes unit identified the bomb maker

337
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,190
and arrested him.

338
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,590
I thought our plan was perfect.

339
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,390
How did you figure it out?

340
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,490
Thanks to some detectives.

341
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,790
You didn't know what the star on this food truck meant.

342
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,090
What?

343
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,890
America is sometimes called "rice country,"

344
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,090
and Russia is sometimes called "dew country."

345
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,190
What about Singapore?

346
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,190
Is it...

347
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,590
That's right. It's "star country."

348
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,590
I thought it was strange that someone working

349
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,190
at a Singaporean restaurant wouldn't know that.

350
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,090
Darn it!

351
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:43,090
The Youth Detective Squad actually did a good job this time.

352
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,190
I hope Conan comes home soon.

353
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,090
I was so sure it was a case.

354
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,090
Who cares? The chicken rice was good.

355
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,290
Hey, why don't we stop by Dr. Agasa's place?

356
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,390
Good idea.

357
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,290
He might have some tasty food.

358
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,790
You're still hungry?

359
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,490
For dessert.

360
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,290
-Dr. Agasa! -Dr. Agasa!

361
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,690
While the kids were visiting the Dr. Agasa,

362
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,890
we were caught up in a terrible plot because of him.

363
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,890
"Next Episode" -It's Sun Wukong.

364
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,290
That's right. He's riding the Jindou cloud.

365
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,090
What a beautiful ship.

366
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,390
It's Talos.

367
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,390
If they don't stop, the company won't last.

368
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,490
Tadashi?

369
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,090
Where are you?

370
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,790
Next Conan,

371
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,690
"The Killer Fist of Talos (Part 1)"
