1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,081
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:05,881
After the tears come live broadcasting.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,481
No anime has been this unique.

4
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:08,881
The incidents run in real time.

5
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,181
Keep an eye on the case.

6
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,581
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,181
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,181
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,911
Hi and howdy.

10
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,511
Here we are tonight again.

11
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:02,711
Every Monday at 7.30pm,

12
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:06,911
"Search and catch the girls, the Runaway Special"!

13
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:10,611
Tonight we are broadcasting live from down town Nengyoucho.

14
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:14,611
The Runaway Girls will run into the Nengyoucho...

15
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:18,811
Hanehacho and Kabutomicho.

16
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,011
If the three challengers can catch all three Runaway Girls

17
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:24,911
within 30 minutes of live broadcasting,

18
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,011
a prize of one million yen will be awarded.

19
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:28,911
Are you ready, girls?

20
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:31,711
Three, two, one, go!

21
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:37,911
"26 minutes left until one million yen."

22
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:44,911
Now, let's start searching and looking for them, guys.

23
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:50,711
There aren't many shoppers around.

24
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,011
Do they make money here?

25
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:54,811
That's why they need some of those things

26
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,011
to attract customers.

27
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:00,411
Look at that gigantic hourglass they put up there.

28
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:03,111
They want people come and meet in front of it.

29
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:07,911
Hum. A 30 minute hourglass. Fantastic.

30
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:10,411
How stupid of me. I should have made reservations.

31
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:12,411
They say it's full.

32
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,211
Okay, let's go somewhere else.

33
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:17,011
Oh, well. What shall I say, it's a...

34
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,711
I made an 8pm reservation already.

35
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,911
Hey. We have to wait 30 minutes then.

36
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:27,011
They say it's delicious there.

37
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,611
I expected a casual Italian dish,

38
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:31,511
not an extravagant cuisine.

39
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,011
Anyway, guys, we'll meet here a little before 8pm.

40
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:37,011
Until then, let's go our own way.

41
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,511
Let's break it up, guys.

42
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,611
Dad?

43
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:46,011
Sigh... I knew it.

44
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:47,511
What would you do, Conan?

45
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:51,011
They have a bookstore for mysteries upstairs.

46
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,711
I'll be looking for dresses.

47
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:56,811
Well, a little before 8pm, then.

48
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,111
Gotcha!

49
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,211
"Remodeling. Wet paint."

50
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:10,111
Sorry, the stairs are closed all day today!

51
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:13,011
Use the stairs over there, boy.

52
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:16,511
Sweet Chinese chestnuts! They are so delicious!

53
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,311
They are all natural Chestnuts. Yes, they are!

54
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,211
"Mystery Books."

55
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:40,011
"Real 30 Minutes."

56
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,411
That's right.

57
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:53,211
A man was stabbed on the second floor of the Yonehana Broad Mall.

58
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,711
Please come quickly.

59
00:04:58,411 --> 00:04:59,711
He is still breathing.

60
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,111
He was stabbed from behind on the left side

61
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,411
and fell down forward.

62
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,411
So his face hit the floor hard.

63
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,411
If he was stabbed only a moment ago,

64
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:17,111
then chances are the culprit is still in this building.

65
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:21,511
Ha... Haibara?

66
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:24,111
You seem to be in love with criminal cases

67
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:27,311
or is it that the cases are calling you, Conan.

68
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,111
So, you're here too.

69
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:32,411
Over there, I was in that medical bookstore.

70
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,911
Then I heard a scream.

71
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:37,211
Did you see anyone suspicious?

72
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,111
Nope.

73
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,511
His fat wallet is intact,

74
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:43,411
so it's not a robbery.

75
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,211
What are you doing, guys?

76
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,511
Don't mess around. Go away.

77
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:49,311
And people, please step back.

78
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:50,611
The police is coming.

79
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,111
This way, officers! Beyond, on the second floor!

80
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:08,311
Dad!

81
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:11,811
Huh? Who's calling me, Dad?

82
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,011
What a...

83
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,211
"23 minutes left until one million yen" -Bingo! Piyo-chan's got caught!

84
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:24,411
You still have four more to go. Keep it up, guys!

85
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,211
We are the police.

86
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:31,711
Everybody, step back, please.

87
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,211
Inspector Megure has arrived in no time at all.

88
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:35,811
Yeah.

89
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:39,911
The victim's Yukio Nishiyama.

90
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:41,811
An ambulance will arrive soon, sir.

91
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,011
Okay.

92
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,511
She is Shiori Yamaguchi, she found the victim first.

93
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:47,111
She says she works a that shop over there.

94
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:48,411
"Movies."

95
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:52,011
And that is Mr. Koide, the manager of the cosmetics shop.

96
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:56,311
The police got the first call at 7.30pm.

97
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:58,111
Did you make the call?

98
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:01,711
What? Oh. Was it that time of day?

99
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:04,211
7.30pm?

100
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:05,511
I see.

101
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:09,411
Did either of you notice something, anything?

102
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:13,211
Well, let me tell you, Nishiyama and Miss Yamazaki

103
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:15,611
have not been getting along very well.

104
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:16,711
Nishiyama...

105
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:19,511
Did you know the victim?

106
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:23,011
Everybody in this Broad Mall knows him and hates him.

107
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,611
He kept annoying us by messing up things on display

108
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,411
and never tidies them up.

109
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,711
He breaks a lot in here as well and troubles them.

110
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:32,811
Every shop here have been harassed.

111
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:35,511
He is a real pain to us.

112
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,511
However...

113
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:43,011
Shiori here... I mean Miss Yamaguchi is an exception.

114
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:45,211
He hasn't done anything to her.

115
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,111
He calls her by her first name?

116
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,011
I guess they're quite intimate.

117
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,511
Why don't you give it to me straight?

118
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,811
You want to say I stabbed him, don't you?

119
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:54,111
I didn't say that.

120
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,911
Just what do you mean, Miss?

121
00:07:56,911 --> 00:08:00,611
He holds a grudge against me because I dumped him.

122
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:03,511
And he keeps annoying me all the time.

123
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,611
What nonsense!

124
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:09,011
Everybody knew Nishiyama liked you.

125
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:13,111
That's why he didn't do any bad things at your shop.

126
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:17,011
You and Nishiyama were arguing just two days ago.

127
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:18,411
They say you two were talking so loud

128
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:19,811
that everybody in the Mall could hear you.

129
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,011
I heard you, too.

130
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,611
Why don't you talk about yourself?

131
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:23,811
Do you think I don't know?

132
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:29,011
Mr. Koide has been threatened by Nishiyama to pay money.

133
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:30,311
What?

134
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,311
It's not actually a threat...

135
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,711
It happened sometime ago. Mr. Koide hit Nishiyama.

136
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,411
In other words, you had to pay for compensation.

137
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:43,911
Stop talking about unnecessary things!

138
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:44,911
But...

139
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:48,411
Excuse me, please let me through.

140
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,011
I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri!

141
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:53,311
Now everybody need not worry about anything.

142
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,211
Conan.

143
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:00,011
Oh, Ran.

144
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:01,311
Hum...

145
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:03,711
Mr. Mouri, don't touch anything.

146
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,111
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

147
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,211
What's that bag he is carrying?

148
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:11,411
He got it at a pachinko parlor.

149
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:16,511
You shouldn't be wasting your luck on things like that, Pops.

150
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:19,611
And where were you at that time?

151
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:21,011
Hum...

152
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:23,411
Oh, no, dad...

153
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:30,111
"20 minutes left until one million yen" -Now, another girl's been caught.

154
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,311
"19 minutes left until one million yen" -Three more girls to go.

155
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:36,411
But the time limit is getting closer and closer.

156
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,911
Run, Girls. Run!

157
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,211
I heard the scream from the second floor.

158
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,411
And I came up quickly.

159
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,011
From the scene of the crime,

160
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,911
I can tell that not much time has passed

161
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,311
after Mr. Nishiyama was stabbed.

162
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:53,311
The other stairway was blocked.

163
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:55,211
That means the culprit...

164
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,411
had to go down these steps.

165
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:00,511
"Chinese Chestnuts" -Sweet chestnuts for you!

166
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,711
Hello, sir.

167
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:04,811
Oh, young man. You save if you buy a bag.

168
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:07,111
Sorry, I'm not a customer.

169
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,011
Oh, just as I thought.

170
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:11,511
You were here all this time, weren't you?

171
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,511
Right. I can't leave this stand,

172
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:16,211
so I can't go upstairs.

173
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:19,711
They say a man got stabbed?

174
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:22,111
Before you heard the scream,

175
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:24,611
did anyone come down the stairs?

176
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:25,811
Nobody.

177
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:27,311
And after that?

178
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,011
You're the first.

179
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,711
A few went upstairs, though.

180
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,711
Okay.

181
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:37,711
Alright, everybody. Get out quickly, please.

182
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,211
This place will be blocked off to the public.

183
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:41,811
No! Send everyone back upstairs!

184
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,511
What's the matter, Conan?

185
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:46,711
Nobody came down these stairs after the scream!

186
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:50,211
So the culprit may be still hiding upstairs!

187
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:52,511
I see. That's possible.

188
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,811
Hey, stop!

189
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:02,211
That's right! The culprit is inside this building!

190
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:06,011
I'm gonna catch him and I'm gonna make my day!

191
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,251
Cool down, Pops.

192
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:10,041
Let go of me, jerk!

193
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:11,464
Why did you run?

194
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,464
Why did you nab me?

195
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,264
This is an assault case,

196
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:17,064
so we have to keep you for a while.

197
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:18,064
Humph...

198
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:20,364
Make sure nobody enters into this building

199
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:21,764
and nobody goes out.

200
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,764
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:28,164
Huh?

202
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:35,764
This is a...

203
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,064
Why can't I go in?

204
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:46,664
We're investigating on an assault case.

205
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,864
-Shut up and move out of my way! -It's off limits until we complete...

206
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:50,064
That's enough. Lay off!

207
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:55,664
Shut up! Sensei can fire you if he wishes.

208
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:59,364
Wow. His sensei is such a big shot that he can fire a policeman.

209
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:02,964
Anyway, we are entering like always!

210
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:05,364
No! No one can enters!

211
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:10,864
This is Hasegawa, sir.

212
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,764
We are here to pick you up,

213
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,164
but the police won't let us in.

214
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:17,264
When you're finished, give us a call.

215
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:19,564
We'll be waiting outside for you.

216
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:28,064
Now three Runaway Girls' have been caught.

217
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:31,364
But the challengers are tired, too.

218
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,564
The only two remaining are Hinako and Lulu.

219
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:37,564
Run... run away.

220
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:39,964
Well, dining seems to be the last thing we can do for now.

221
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,064
Yeah, you're right.

222
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:54,264
So, this is Mr. Koide's shop.

223
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:57,364
I've got it.

224
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,164
Hey, you over there!

225
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:01,264
You've been shoplifting again at my place?

226
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:02,964
Don't start picking on me, man.

227
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:04,964
When did I ever do something like that?

228
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:08,664
Heck! You do it all the time. I know it.

229
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,464
Well, why don't you search my bag, then?

230
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:11,464
Go ahead!

231
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:13,164
Mr. Koide, may I have a minute with you?

232
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:14,564
Sure, sir.

233
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:16,864
What's with him...

234
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,964
Shoplifting is a crime, you know?

235
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:22,764
This will be my last time.

236
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,564
Catch one more and you get a million yen.

237
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,464
Can they make it in time?

238
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:34,564
What the heck.

239
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,964
You have seen the culprit, haven't you, Miss?

240
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:41,564
In that shop, they place lipsticks

241
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:43,864
in front of the glass case beside the aisle.

242
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,264
See, you an see them from here too.

243
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48,664
If you shoplift a lipstick over there,

244
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:51,364
you can see the scene of the crime on the other side too.

245
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,964
Why... why are you saying something like that?

246
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:57,664
Because you have been acting strange all this time.

247
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:01,564
It's natural to leave right away after shoplifting, right?

248
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:04,364
But you stayed here, why?

249
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:07,164
Because you were afraid.

250
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:11,564
You feared that you could meet up

251
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:15,064
with the culprit outside the building.

252
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,364
That's what you thought.

253
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:21,364
So, you attempted to flee among the commotion, didn't you?

254
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:24,464
Sigh, you're a wonder.

255
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,364
I give up. How could you see through it all?

256
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:29,964
I am a detective.

257
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:32,264
Wow, you are great, indeed.

258
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:34,564
Well, what kind of a guy was the culprit?

259
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:39,164
Well, it happened so fast, I didn't have time to look at his face.

260
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,564
He turned back and looked towards me.

261
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:44,264
I was too scared to look.

262
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:46,364
The culprit is a man and left handed?

263
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:49,564
Yes. I'm sure the knife was in his left hand.

264
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:51,564
What else? Anything special about him?

265
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:54,964
Oh, yes. He was wearing a coat.

266
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:56,064
A coat?

267
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:58,464
A thin, long, black one.

268
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,764
Hmm... by the way, Miss...

269
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:03,464
About this...

270
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:07,864
Oh, I feel I'm freed.

271
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:09,864
I won't shoplift anymore,

272
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,864
so don't worry, my dear Mr. Detective.

273
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,864
Haibara! What's the matter?

274
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:28,964
I went to look upstairs.

275
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:31,464
The police are investigating, aren't they?

276
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,264
Yes. They were after the whereabouts of the murder weapon knife

277
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:36,864
and any suspicious person.

278
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:38,764
Upstairs there are only several offices...

279
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:41,364
And a dental clinic.

280
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:43,364
Then it was easy to check.

281
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:44,364
You can say so.

282
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:46,964
Any disposed black coat there?

283
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:49,464
-A coat? -The culprit was seen wearing one.

284
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,064
I didn't see any.

285
00:15:51,064 --> 00:15:53,764
But I didn't look in men's room.

286
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:55,964
The police won't overlook it, I suppose.

287
00:15:55,964 --> 00:15:57,164
I agree.

288
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,264
There seems to be no place for him to hide.

289
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:02,464
Why did the culprit stab that man?

290
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:04,064
That's the key point.

291
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:07,064
Unless one of the shop clerks or managers is the culprit,

292
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:08,864
it can't have been because of a grudge.

293
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:12,064
The wallet was intact, so it was not robbery, either.

294
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:14,464
If the culprit and the victim were fighting or struggling,

295
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:17,064
someone should have heard them.

296
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:19,364
But it doesn't look that way.

297
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:20,764
That means...

298
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:24,064
The purpose of the culprit was in stabbing itself.

299
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:27,464
You mean, not out of the grudge against the victim?

300
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:30,464
There were two people who called the police.

301
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:31,964
Two?

302
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:34,064
One is Mr. Koide.

303
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:38,264
The other one called the police before Mr. Koide did.

304
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:41,264
He was probably the man in the black coat.

305
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:45,064
The police got the first call at 7.30pm.

306
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:47,064
Did you make the call?

307
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:50,664
Yes. He made the call before he stabbed Mr. Nishiyama.

308
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:55,064
The culprit wanted the police to arrive here quickly.

309
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,064
But why?

310
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:03,364
That explains it.

311
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:04,764
What is it?

312
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,164
The two over there.

313
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,664
They're scary.

314
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:12,664
Suppose the culprit wanted to keep those two outside?

315
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,864
He wanted to make trouble and call the police

316
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:18,764
and have the police designate this place off limits,

317
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:22,264
so he called the police beforehand.

318
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:25,464
He had no other choice but to achieve a certain purpose.

319
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:27,064
What purpose?

320
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:30,264
That guy standing outside, when refused entry by the police officer

321
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:33,164
was talking to someone in this building.

322
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:36,164
When you're done, call me, sir.

323
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:37,964
We will be waiting outside.

324
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:40,864
Apparently he was leaving a message

325
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:42,864
on the answer phone of the person he called.

326
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:46,064
You mean, a person who is in this building but can't answer,

327
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,764
so has his phone on answer phone?

328
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:50,564
They came here to pick up that person.

329
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:52,764
The initial purpose of the culprit

330
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:55,564
was to prevent the two bodyguards from entering the building?

331
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:58,864
The real purpose of the culprit

332
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:01,064
was to assault the person who was to meet those two.

333
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:03,364
That person was probably...

334
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:06,964
undergoing dental treatment

335
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:09,064
and had his cell turned off.

336
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:10,364
Right.

337
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:13,564
So long as the culprit knew what time the appointment was,

338
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:15,764
he could manage to be there

339
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:17,964
and make the police off limit the area.

340
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:26,964
Good evening, do you have appointment?

341
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:29,264
Yes...

342
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:33,164
Haibara! Call the Inspector.

343
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:34,164
Okay.

344
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:35,164
What's the matter?

345
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:37,364
If you're an emergency patient, you'll have to wait your turn.

346
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:42,064
Huh... is there anyone else waiting his turn?

347
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:45,564
Yes, there's one person.

348
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:47,464
Hey... can you tell me which person?

349
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:48,464
Huh?

350
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:51,764
The person is among the three over there, right?

351
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,964
Yes...

352
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:55,464
The one in the middle.

353
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:06,964
Gosh!

354
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,264
Next person, please.

355
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:38,064
Who the heck are you?

356
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:40,864
I've come to avenge the death of my wife!

357
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:43,464
-What... -Drop death!

358
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:48,064
Go...

359
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:56,464
Is the culprit there?

360
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:57,664
It's that man!

361
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:03,664
Well done, all of you.

362
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:06,564
I'm Taizo Masuda, a congressman.

363
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:09,464
I was almost killed by that guy.

364
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:14,864
You're the one who hit and run and killed my wife!

365
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:15,864
What?

366
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,864
Despite doing what he did,

367
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:26,564
a scapegoat was sent to the police pleading guilty to the crime...

368
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:28,164
Just what nonsense you are talking about?

369
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:30,364
I've looked into it!

370
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:32,864
It took me three months to find a witness!

371
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,664
Why didn't you tell the police about it?

372
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:37,864
They just ignored me!

373
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:40,264
He's a politician and big shot, you can't win.

374
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:43,364
So I decided to do it myself!

375
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:47,064
That doesn't give you the right to commit a crime.

376
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:48,064
Cut it out!

377
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:50,664
That's right, you dirty criminal.

378
00:20:50,664 --> 00:20:53,964
We'll hear you out as to the hit-and-run incident

379
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:55,464
at the Metropolitan Police!

380
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:59,864
That's the story.

381
00:20:59,864 --> 00:21:02,564
Stop committing further crime.

382
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:03,864
Throw away your knife.

383
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:50,164
Two, one, zero!

384
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:53,664
Too bad, there was only one more person left to go, but it's time out.

385
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,564
Oh yeah! No million yen win this week.

386
00:22:57,564 --> 00:23:00,364
Next week we will be broadcasting live from Beika-cho.

387
00:23:00,364 --> 00:23:01,764
Bye now folks.

388
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,864
Dad will treat us to an Italian dish.

389
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:07,664
So come with us, Ai-chan.

390
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:08,964
Don't hesitate.

391
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:12,864
It may be once in a lifetime that Pops will treat us.

392
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:14,564
Oh, what's the matter, Dad?

393
00:23:14,564 --> 00:23:15,664
No...

394
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:17,964
That restaurant was so crowded

395
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,264
that only the counter seats were open...

396
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:21,564
You don't say...

397
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:23,464
You couldn't make reservations...

398
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:25,864
I made the reservation, sure, but...

399
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,264
But what?

400
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:28,764
It was just for me alone.

401
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:29,764
What do you mean by that?

402
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:32,664
The lady at the reception desk was a real beauty

403
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:35,364
that I just couldn't decline...

404
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:37,164
Sorry, guys. But that's what happened.

405
00:23:37,164 --> 00:23:40,864
And this if for you, Ran, dear.

406
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:42,564
You're not getting away with this trash of yours!

407
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:44,964
So sorry...

408
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:49,964
He does it a lot, huh?

409
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:52,264
This is the worst time ever.

410
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,764
"Next Episode" -With Hattori and others?

411
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:57,664
Flower viewing?

412
00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:59,364
What? Disappeared?

413
00:23:59,364 --> 00:24:01,664
A young monk tells of an incident. A body disappears.

414
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:03,864
What's the truth behind it?

415
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:07,564
What was Hattori's real reason for coming all the way from Osaka?

416
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:08,664
From east and west, north and south,

417
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:12,364
four high school detectives get together on an uninhabited island.

418
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,664
A mystery on an isolated island.

419
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:15,964
Perfectly sealed room trick.

420
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:18,564
Hey, Hattori, what the heck are you talking about?

421
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:20,264
Next Conan's Special!

422
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:24,064
"Three days with Heiji Hattori."

423
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:41,664
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:44,264
Tatami and Window.

425
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:45,864
Tatami and window?

426
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,264
Are you afraid of Tatami?

427
00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:48,364
Great.
