1
00:00:02,242 --> 00:00:03,542
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:04,842
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:06,642
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:08,742
A rival of Shinichi appears again?

5
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,442
A match to solve the mystery of paper planes is launched!

6
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:11,842
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:13,542
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:15,142
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:58,906
A new member of the Black Organization has started to make a move.

10
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,506
He's skilled in collecting information,

11
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:03,706
observatory skills and also insightful.

12
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,106
His code name is Bourbon.

13
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:08,306
He shouldn't be taken lightly.

14
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:09,906
Although the case of Kaito Sugiura's apartment

15
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:12,406
being set fire to was solved,

16
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:14,906
one of the residents who lost his home in the fire,

17
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,506
Mr. Subaru Okiya, ends up freeloading at my,

18
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:22,206
that is Shinichi Kudo's house.

19
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:24,006
Ran and Sonoko, who didn't know about this

20
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:26,506
mistakenly thought that he was a thief.

21
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:33,206
I wonder if Subaru who was kicked by Ran is okay?

22
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:39,206
The recent talk of the town is the paper plane prankster.

23
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:42,806
Every night close to 100 paper planes are scattered throughout town,

24
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:46,106
and a strange mark is drawn on those planes.

25
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:49,506
When I saw the image of the paper plane

26
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:51,706
that Ran had attached to the mail she sent me,

27
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:55,106
I realized that there was an important message hidden behind it.

28
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:57,506
The message was...

29
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:06,506
"Deduction Match! Shinichi vs. Subaru Okiya".

30
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:09,606
Another type of paper plane?

31
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,206
Yes. If I remember correctly, it said in the news

32
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,806
that close to 100 paper planes were retrieved in town

33
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:16,406
the day before yesterday and yesterday morning.

34
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:19,406
So, if the message that is drawn on the paper planes

35
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:21,706
the day before yesterday and yesterday differ,

36
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,706
I just thought that maybe we could narrow down

37
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:28,306
the location of the person who sent out the SOS.

38
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:31,406
By the way, when did you find this in your yard?

39
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:34,106
I found it in the morning the day before yesterday.

40
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:35,606
Before that, tell me, will you?

41
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:38,906
Why is that paper plane a SOS signal?

42
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:41,606
It's the design that's drawn on the plane.

43
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:45,106
The size of the circles in front and back is practically the same.

44
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:47,706
And the length of the dashes are is as long as the three circles.

45
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:50,706
And the space between the circles

46
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:53,306
is just about equal to the size of one circle.

47
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:58,306
Yes, this is the Morse code that frequently used

48
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,306
as a means of communication.

49
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,906
You mean the Morse Code

50
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,606
that usually come out in old movies?

51
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:06,806
Yes, that's right.

52
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:09,806
The circles are short dots that are made by short taps.

53
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:12,706
The dashes are long dots made by long taps.

54
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:15,306
In the Morse code, three dots made by short taps equals "S"

55
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,606
and three long dots equals "O".

56
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:20,506
In other words, SOS would be

57
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:25,506
tap tap tap, dash dash dash, tap tap tap.

58
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:29,706
It's a signal asking for help.

59
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:31,406
That's what's written in the mail.

60
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:34,606
No! You mean Shinichi figured it out too?

61
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,306
Yes. It also says

62
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,306
he wants to see images of other paper planes if there are any,

63
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:40,106
and he'd like me to send them to him.

64
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:42,806
Shinichi? Come to think of it,

65
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:46,006
the name of the owner of this house is Shinichi too, isn't it?

66
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,106
Don't you know him?

67
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:49,606
He's a high school detective named Shin...

68
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,006
Kinichi.

69
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:54,806
There's this boy that likes to make a deduction in the same class.

70
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:58,406
So he's name is Kinichi and not Shinichi?

71
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:00,506
Yes. The Shinichi that's living here

72
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:03,306
is just an ordinary high school student that can't do much.

73
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:05,106
An ordinary high school student?

74
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:08,806
I just can't help feeling otherwise about him though.

75
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:10,306
What makes you say that?

76
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,406
Because there is

77
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:15,506
no trace of anything that shows that he had been living here.

78
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:16,806
None of his clothes, no diary,

79
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:19,106
or albums and the like are anywhere in sight.

80
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:22,806
Well, at least nowhere that can easily be seen that is.

81
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,806
You think so?

82
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:27,306
It could be that he didn't want us to see his things

83
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:30,506
knowing that we'd come to clean his place up and hid them all somewhere.

84
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:32,806
Taking about cleaning up,

85
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:36,306
even the employee that we stopped over at a while ago was told by the owner

86
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:42,006
to clean up the paper plane that was stuck to the sign of the shop, right?

87
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,506
Then let's go get it right away.

88
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:46,806
Wait, Ran!

89
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:53,106
Hey, just what's this Kinichi thing about?

90
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:57,606
That's because Shinichi told me a while ago not to tell that man about him.

91
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:59,006
Shinichi told you that?

92
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:00,506
It seems that he sent Conan a mail

93
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:03,106
saying that he doesn't want the man to take an interest in him

94
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:05,806
and start searching around the house for things.

95
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:13,606
I guess detectives like to search around about other people

96
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,606
but don't like it the other way around.

97
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:17,706
Yes.

98
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:19,406
Besides,

99
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:22,006
I kind of couldn't help stopping myself

100
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,106
from talking about Shinichi to him.

101
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:29,106
A feeling that I shouldn't. A kind of anxiousness.

102
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:32,506
Next, we'll try writing the names of flowers in Katakana!

103
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:35,106
Ran is sure taking her time.

104
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:38,306
It can't be that there was only one type of paper plane.

105
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:44,406
Finally. Let's see.

106
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,106
It seems that the paper planes of yesterday

107
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,106
and the day before yesterday are different.

108
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,506
I'll attach the image.

109
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:51,806
What's this?

110
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:53,806
There's no design on it.

111
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,006
A closer look at it

112
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:00,206
shows five dashes on the folded crease of the body of the paper plane.

113
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:03,606
In Morse code, five long dashes means "zero".

114
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:06,006
What on earth does the zero stand for?

115
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:10,906
There's a design on the other side too.

116
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:14,906
But it looks like a line had been drawn along the folded crease.

117
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:19,206
This... this is...

118
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,606
The mark of an antenna?

119
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,306
Of a cell phone?

120
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,306
Really, they're exactly alike!

121
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,106
In other words, if you match it up

122
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:34,106
with the five dashes that are drawn body of the paper plane,

123
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:35,306
there is zero radio wave.

124
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:38,806
Moreover, taking into consideration the first SOS. The message is,

125
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,306
"I'm in a place where cell phones are out of service range,

126
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,806
so please help me".

127
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:48,306
Wow! Subaru, you're a fantastic detective.

128
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:50,306
But, all we know now is that

129
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:52,906
the person is in a place where cell phones are out of range.

130
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,306
Out of service range,

131
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,606
you mean in a cave in the remote mountains or something?

132
00:07:56,606 --> 00:08:00,706
But the paper planes were retrieved only in town.

133
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:01,806
Then, maybe in the basement!

134
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:03,506
How would anyone be able to fly a plane from the basement

135
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,606
to the yard of your house Sonoko?

136
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:07,606
Oh, right.

137
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:08,906
Wait.

138
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,006
If paper planes were retrieved the day before yesterday and yesterday,

139
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,006
I'm sure that even today...

140
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:15,106
I see, the news on TV!

141
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:17,606
The identity of the kidnapper on the run

142
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:20,206
who jumped off the building early this morning

143
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:21,606
has not yet been verified.

144
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:24,006
"Ikuo Shirota" -The whereabouts of the president of the shipbuilding

145
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:27,206
that has been kidnapped has not been found yet.

146
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,206
The police are

147
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:30,806
investigating the case as one of a grudge against Mr. Shirota,

148
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:32,006
and are attempting to identify the kidnapper...

149
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:34,406
Every station is airing news about this incident.

150
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:36,906
They reported on the morning news

151
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:41,606
that this man used his experience back when he used to be a sailor,

152
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:44,006
to enlarge his company.

153
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,806
Maybe...

154
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:47,506
What is it, Subaru?

155
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,206
Maybe this case

156
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:51,706
is connected in some way with the incident of the paper planes.

157
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:56,606
If he's been abducted and is being confined somewhere...

158
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,506
It's very likely that he's avoiding the eyes of his kidnapper

159
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:02,006
and flying paper planes night after night.

160
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:05,506
Then, you're saying that President Shirota is the paper plane prankster?

161
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:08,206
Yes, I think it's very likely.

162
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:09,706
If he used to be a sailor before,

163
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,906
it's not surprising that he knows how to use the Morse code

164
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:15,406
that's used in emergencies.

165
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:18,806
He's probably not aware that the kidnapper committed suicide

166
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:22,106
and is still trying to get help secretly.

167
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,506
I see.

168
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:26,206
Even if the kidnapper happens to see this and pick it up,

169
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:29,206
he would think nothing of it except as some child's play!

170
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,806
It seems that the paper planes that were retrieved yesterday

171
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:31,906
and the day before yesterday

172
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:37,506
were made by ripping off pages from a magazine.

173
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,806
President Shirota probably cannot move around much

174
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:43,006
and the most he can do is get hold of that magazine.

175
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:45,906
Oh, no.

176
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:49,606
Now, for a follow-up report on the paper plane prankster.

177
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:50,706
Here it is!

178
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:54,306
I am at a park near the Beika Tower Condominium

179
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:57,206
where the paper planes in question were found this morning.

180
00:09:57,206 --> 00:10:00,706
As to the design on the paper planes that are of interest,

181
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,806
there is nothing on this side,

182
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:05,306
but on the opposite side, there is one circle

183
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:09,006
and four imperfect circles that are drawn symmetrically.

184
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,306
Moreover, at a close look,

185
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,206
there is a weird looking crease on it.

186
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,606
The mystery gets even deeper.

187
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:16,206
Crease?

188
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:18,206
We can't see it very well on the TV.

189
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,006
Hey now, it's class time.

190
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:36,806
But Conan is engrossed in folding paper planes.

191
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:38,306
Hey, Conan.

192
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,106
That's something you should be doing during recess.

193
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,506
I'm sorry, Teacher. But can you leave me alone?

194
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,306
You know what...

195
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:47,406
Somebody's life may be in danger!

196
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:48,706
Is that right?

197
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:50,106
Yeah.

198
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:52,106
The one who's flying this

199
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:54,506
is probably President Shirota who was kidnapped

200
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,106
and he's being locked up in a place where the cell phones

201
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,106
are out of service range.

202
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,306
The fact that he can fold and fly so many paper planes

203
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,506
despite being in his situation,

204
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:03,506
just goes to show that it's most likely

205
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:06,806
that he's being left without getting any care since he's been locked up.

206
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:09,206
If he by chance hasn't eaten or drunk anything,

207
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:11,106
things may be for the worse.

208
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:13,606
They should be able to narrow down the President's whereabouts

209
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,106
with the paper planes that were retrieved this time.

210
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:17,906
But what is this anyway?

211
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:21,406
These four unclosed circles and strange crase?

212
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:24,706
Wait a sec. If this is also a Morse code,

213
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:28,306
the unclosed circles are probably a set.

214
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:29,306
Two circles make a set.

215
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:30,406
Four circles equal two circles,

216
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:33,006
plus there is one circle that is originally there...

217
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,106
One circle equals "E" and two makes "I".

218
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:40,106
If read romaji style it would either be "ei" or "ie"(house).

219
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,106
Just where is the house anyway?

220
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:47,206
Subaru.

221
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,206
There are many different ways to fold paper planes, aren't they?

222
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,306
There are many kinds.

223
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:55,706
Like cicadas and sparrows.

224
00:11:55,706 --> 00:12:00,506
I think there were other things that it resembled that can't even fly.

225
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,006
I see.

226
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:17,806
It's over here!

227
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:25,744
Hey, Conan, what's that?

228
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,744
A paper plane?

229
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:29,744
It looks like a squid!

230
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:31,244
But I think if so,

231
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:33,844
you'd have to fold the head part once more.

232
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:36,644
No, this is just fine.

233
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:38,144
The person who flew this

234
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:39,644
wanted to make the people who picked it up

235
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,844
make the paper plane like this.

236
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,344
Don't tell me that you're talking about

237
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:47,444
the paper plane prankster that's the talk of the town now?

238
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:50,444
Yeah, you spread the squid out once like this

239
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:54,044
then, turn the paper upside down and fold the plane.

240
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:58,344
See, it looks just like the paper planes

241
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,744
that were retrieved today, doesn't it?

242
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,244
I see.

243
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:05,944
A squid is made by a queer crease and two separated black circles.

244
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:09,844
The person wanted to relay the real message to the people this way.

245
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:13,944
Wait up, wasn't the paper plane thing supposed to be a prank?

246
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:16,544
It seems that the paper planes that were retrieved

247
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,244
the day before yesterday, yesterday and today

248
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,244
all had different designs on them.

249
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:24,944
So, I guess it'd be safe to say some kind of message is behind them?

250
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:27,744
But who for what reason?

251
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,144
In order to find out,

252
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:32,644
we'll need Conan to solve the code first and then...

253
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:34,544
He's gone?

254
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:35,644
Conan?

255
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,744
Bei?

256
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:42,744
You mean those three circles mean "bei"?

257
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:44,844
Yes, most likely.

258
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:47,444
This is probably a Japanese Morse code,

259
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,144
so one circle would be pronounced "hei",

260
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:51,144
but since there are two, it indicates a voiced consonant,

261
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,944
so put together, it's pronounced "bei".

262
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:58,744
But what's the message?

263
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,844
Can't you tell by this shape?

264
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,344
Shape?

265
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:03,444
A squid?

266
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:06,344
So, if you put these two together...

267
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:07,544
Bei.

268
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,544
Squid. ("Ika" is pronunciation of "squid" in Japanese)

269
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:10,944
-Beika! -Beika!

270
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:13,244
In other words, Beikacho.

271
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,444
A play on words?

272
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:15,944
Well, if you get to the bottom of things

273
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,244
codes are similar to a play on words too.

274
00:14:18,244 --> 00:14:19,344
If they're paper planes

275
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:22,544
the President Shirota who was kidnapped and confined flew,

276
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:25,844
so long as the kidnapper can't make out the message,

277
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:28,644
whether it's a play on words or whatever, it really doesn't matter, does it?

278
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:32,044
Then, where is President Shirota?

279
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:33,744
If I remember correctly, the first paper plane

280
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:35,144
sent out the message SOS.

281
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,144
The next message was,

282
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:39,244
"A place where cell phones are outside of service range."

283
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,444
If we connect all three messages it would come out to,

284
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:44,144
"Help me, I'm confined in a place in Beikacho

285
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,544
where cell phones are out of service range."

286
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:50,444
I wonder if there's a place like that in Beikacho, besides a basement.

287
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:51,944
A tall building.

288
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:55,644
The base station antenna for cell phones

289
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,344
is faced towards the ground where the inlet density is high,

290
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:02,844
so if you're anywhere higher than that, it's hard to connect.

291
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,244
Even if connection is successful,

292
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:05,344
because of its height,

293
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:07,744
it'll pick up multiple radio waves from the base station

294
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:09,444
and roaming will frequently occur,

295
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:12,244
resulting in out of service range.

296
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,844
There are two tall buildings in Beikacho,

297
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:18,544
but it would be difficult to confine a person in a place

298
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,944
where people go in and out to make the beds.

299
00:15:20,944 --> 00:15:22,444
Therefore,

300
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:26,844
President Shirota is most likely confined in the Beika Tower Condominium.

301
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,344
No, that's pretty close from here!

302
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,244
Well, the out of service range was probably indicated

303
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:33,544
just to make locating the place he is confined easier,

304
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:35,044
because I'm pretty sure

305
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:37,844
that the kidnapper took his cell phone away from him already.

306
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:40,744
We'd better notify the police ASAP about this.

307
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:43,544
Telephone?

308
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,444
Ran, it's me!

309
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,644
Shinichi!

310
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:50,544
Where are you now?

311
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:52,244
Still at your house.

312
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,344
All the better.

313
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:56,444
Go to the Beika Tower Condominium nearby!

314
00:15:56,444 --> 00:16:00,744
That's where President Shirota who was kidnapped is confined.

315
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:03,044
That means that you solved the mystery of the paper planes?

316
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,744
Yeah, but I'll explain later.

317
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:07,244
The desk in my room.

318
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:09,744
In the second drawer, you'll find binoculars!

319
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:13,144
Take that and ride the observatory elevator of the Beika Hotel.

320
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:15,044
Have Sonoko call the police

321
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:16,144
and go there right away!

322
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,644
I wanted to go with Ran too.

323
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:24,544
Well, let's let the he and she take care of the site.

324
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:26,144
He?

325
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:31,044
Kinichi, was it? The one who likes to make deductions.

326
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:49,744
But Shinichi, from here I can only see one side of the condo.

327
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:53,144
Yeah, if he's on the side that you can't see, it'll be a waste,

328
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:54,644
but it's better than not even giving it a try!

329
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:12,144
-Did you find it? -Yes.

330
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:15,344
The room to the very right on the east side of the 36th floor!

331
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:16,644
The window is slightly opened

332
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,944
and there are many paper planes on the veranda.

333
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:21,344
Ran! Just because you found the place he's being confined,

334
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,944
don't go barging in there on your own, now!

335
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,644
Although the likelihood is close to nil,

336
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,744
an accomplice of the kidnapper may still be there!

337
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:32,544
Yep. I'll e-mail Sonoko who's at the police about this and...

338
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:37,944
What's up, Ran?

339
00:17:37,944 --> 00:17:39,444
Oh, no.

340
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:41,944
The paper plane that just came flying

341
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:43,944
is folded with a 10,000 yen bill.

342
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,144
What?

343
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:46,544
There's nothing drawn on it,

344
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:48,244
but I wonder if this is President Shirota's paper plane too?

345
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:50,044
Yeah, most likely!

346
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:52,444
Even if nothing is drawn on it, if money comes flying,

347
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:54,844
everyone would go nuts and search where it's flying from

348
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:56,544
and the police would surely be notified.

349
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:57,744
That's what he's after.

350
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,144
But flying something like this in broad daylight

351
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:01,844
would be taking the risk of the kidnapper finding it out,

352
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:04,344
means President Shirota is taking a sink or swim chance!

353
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:08,344
In other words, it means that President Shirota is in pretty bad condition.

354
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:10,044
The first time the paper plane was found

355
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:11,644
was the morning the day before yesterday,

356
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:12,644
so it's already been more than three days

357
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:14,644
since he first started flying the paper planes.

358
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,744
Moreover, the kidnapper committed suicide.

359
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:20,244
If he's being left as is and give no food or water,

360
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:23,544
he could be on the verge of starvation or be extremely dehydrated.

361
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:26,344
I'll call the police and ambulance,

362
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:27,344
so you wait there, Ran.

363
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:30,144
What would you do, Shinichi?

364
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:33,144
You wouldn't wait in times like this, would you, Shinichi?

365
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,244
I'm going!

366
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,244
Wait!

367
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:39,744
I told you there's a possibility that the kidnapper's accomplice is there.

368
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,744
But you did say that the possibility is close to zero, right?

369
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:44,544
I know that if it were you, you would dash right in there

370
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:46,444
and rescue the man.

371
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:49,544
Tell me how to do it, Shinichi!

372
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,244
Shinichi!

373
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:56,544
I'm Yamakawa from TMS Insurance.

374
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:57,544
Please come in!

375
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:10,044
Yes? Who is it?

376
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:13,444
I was riding the elevator of the hotel on the opposite side just now

377
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,444
and happened to see

378
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,844
a suspicious looking figure of a person on the veranda here!

379
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:19,544
Please call the police right away!

380
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:20,544
Yes!

381
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:24,944
There it is!

382
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:29,744
By law, all skyscrapers must be equipped with emergency exit ladders.

383
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,644
Use the ladder from the room right above his room.

384
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:45,444
Who are you?

385
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,744
You're President Shirota that was kidnapped, aren't you?

386
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:50,644
I saw your paper planes and came to help you.

387
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:53,844
When you get there, first lay him down sideways,

388
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,344
and of course don't forget the pillow.

389
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:59,344
Then dampen a handkerchief with tap water and place it against his mouth.

390
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,744
That's the best emergency aid you can give him.

391
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,044
The ransom.

392
00:20:05,044 --> 00:20:06,944
Was it given to him?

393
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:07,944
Don't worry.

394
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:11,044
Everything's been solved, so please rest assured.

395
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,844
Oh, no. Don't tell me that there's an accomplice after all?

396
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:18,144
I'm...

397
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:25,944
Okay, we'll take over from here.

398
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:27,644
We were told about you.

399
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,344
-You're Ms. Ran Mouri, aren't you? -Yes.

400
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:33,444
Is the one who called us your boyfriend?

401
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:35,444
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

402
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,744
Can you relay a message to him?

403
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:40,644
He needs to state briefly and clearly what the situation is.

404
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:42,744
I understand that he is panicky

405
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:46,644
but just yelling isn't do anyone any good.

406
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:50,244
Well, we really did get the message that he was desperate, though.

407
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:56,444
The room turned out to be the room of the kidnapper himself,

408
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:58,144
and he had no accomplice.

409
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:00,944
He committed crime because he had debts.

410
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:02,844
President Shirota, who had been confined,

411
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,544
recovered with no complications,

412
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:07,644
and the queer paper plane case was closed.

413
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:14,044
That Shinichi panicked and yelled his head off

414
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:17,144
at the paramedics and police officer?

415
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,844
He was so calm when he was telling me what to do.

416
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:21,744
It's not like him, is it?

417
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:24,244
Well, that's because he was worried about his beloved wife

418
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:25,744
being in a pinch.

419
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,344
It can't be,

420
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,744
he's not that kind of character that guy.

421
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:32,844
I mean, I'm not his wife.

422
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:35,944
Well, to be honest, it could have been.

423
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:38,844
I honestly don't remember what I said back then.

424
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,944
I was all heated up

425
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:44,844
and I just had one thing in mind.

426
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:50,144
That I had to protect the tomboy rescuer over my dead body.

427
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:20,944
Come to think of it,

428
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:25,044
I wonder who won the deduction match, Subaru or Shinichi?

429
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:26,144
Beats me.

430
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:27,444
Deduction match?

431
00:23:27,444 --> 00:23:30,644
Well, President Shirota was safely rescued,

432
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:34,144
so I'm sure Subaru must be toasting in celebration now.

433
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,744
Toast in celebration?

434
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:38,044
I found on the kitchen shelf

435
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:41,644
a bottle of liquor that I didn't see before when I went to clean the house.

436
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:02,844
"Next Episode" -I'd like you to read my fortune.

437
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:04,744
It's something I'd really like to know about.

438
00:24:08,244 --> 00:24:09,544
A red-flanked blue-tail.

439
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:13,444
Ms. Reika?

440
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:16,844
The door's locked!

441
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:20,944
In other words, this is...

442
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:22,244
a locked door murder!

443
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:24,444
