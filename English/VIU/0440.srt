1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,330
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:01,331 --> 00:00:03,230
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:04,530
Awesome stuntman!

4
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,830
There is a glimpse of a sad incident behind the glamorous scenes.

5
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:09,330
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:11,030
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:13,431
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,860
Masked Yaiba!

9
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,442
You shall not get away!

10
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:26,842
Darn it.

11
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:42,842
Curses!

12
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,242
I won't let him run away!

13
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,641
Yaiba?

14
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,242
Darn it!

15
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,942
What?

16
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:55,742
"Extreme Car Stunt."

17
00:03:57,242 --> 00:04:00,041
Absolutely! Absolutely no way!

18
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,141
I can't adopt such a plan!

19
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,941
Too dangerous.

20
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:07,441
-I think so, too. -Who's talking to you?

21
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,841
Keep quiet, kid.

22
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:13,641
Sure, it's dangerous. Dangerous for other stuntmen.

23
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:15,641
But I can do it.

24
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:18,741
I've experienced a stunt like this many times before.

25
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:20,441
Right, Mr. Kijima?

26
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:23,341
"Daisaku Kijima (40), Cameraman" -Yeah, I guess so.

27
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:24,641
But...

28
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:27,041
Let's do it without a cut, Mr. Kijima.

29
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,741
No cheating.

30
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:33,041
Only one cut till I run in here and fall, please.

31
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,941
Besides, your figure of coming out of the car

32
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,142
won't be filmed from below. But...

33
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:43,542
Mr. Rikiishi, you are already...

34
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:48,141
To think that we get to see Yaiba on location. Gorgeous, isn't it?

35
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:49,541
Just as expected of you, Dr. Agasa!

36
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,541
He's really a big face!

37
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,341
You mean his face is widely known.

38
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:54,342
Look!

39
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:56,941
They gave me a bunch of Masked Yaiba's seals!

40
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:59,041
And I don't have most of them.

41
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:00,241
Really?

42
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,641
What did you say? What do you mean by "already"?

43
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:03,841
Be frank with me.

44
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:04,842
What? What's going on?

45
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:07,041
-Looks like they're in trouble. -An argument?

46
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:10,041
As I said, we can now make impressive films freely

47
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,841
using digital technology, more impressive than real stunts.

48
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:14,741
-That's why I said so. -Are you saying that

49
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,541
you don't need antiquated stuntmen like me?

50
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,641
No, I am not saying that.

51
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:22,441
A car driven by Masked Yaiba is coming up to the roof.

52
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,441
The Masked Yaiba car stops.

53
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,641
Suppose that his car is A,

54
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:28,341
and the other car is operated with a remote controller.

55
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,641
Let's call it B.

56
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:35,442
Replacing Car A driven by Joker, Car B speeds towards the fence.

57
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:42,641
Because the camera is shooting from below, this replacement can't be seen.

58
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,942
And digital enhancements will be added to it later.

59
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:51,341
This kind of stunt will be enough for this scene.

60
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:53,742
Darn it.

61
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:06,241
The steering wheel is OK, the brakes are OK.

62
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:08,441
So, that's the story.

63
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,041
Get it over with quickly.

64
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,541
I've gotta make preparations.

65
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,241
Hey, Kijima, you're finished,

66
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:17,041
being at the beck and call of this green-horn.

67
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,841
-What? -Please stop it!

68
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:21,642
This plan is final.

69
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,641
I've got the producer's OK, too.

70
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:26,342
I will go by this!

71
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:30,942
Thank you very much for understanding!

72
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:33,941
Are you sure?

73
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,141
You're going to regret it.

74
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:37,341
Let go of me!

75
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:40,341
You know, with the swooshes!

76
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:41,941
Yeah, the part with all the flashes!

77
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,241
I love that part.

78
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:47,141
Well, after lunch, I will move to the next cut.

79
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:49,942
Get everything ready and stand by, please!

80
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:55,641
What a grouch.

81
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:58,841
Masked Yaiba will beat him anyway. Right?

82
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:00,542
It serves him right.

83
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:02,441
Hey...

84
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:05,541
This is just a drama, isn't it?

85
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,941
Heck! I feel awfully unhappy.

86
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:10,941
We've come all the way here and no shooting?

87
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:14,241
It's lunch time now, so it can't helped, Genta!

88
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:17,041
Let's have lunch, too.

89
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:20,441
If you say so...

90
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:23,242
Is there anyone who hasn't received box lunch yet?

91
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,541
My stomach's growling.

92
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,041
Come off it, Genta.

93
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:32,141
Your stomach reacts quickly.

94
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,441
Here we go!

95
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:34,741
"Masked Yaiba to Ayumi."

96
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:37,541
Are you sure my autograph is what you want?

97
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:40,442
Yes. Thank you very much!

98
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:45,141
Where did Genta and Mitsuhiko go?

99
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:48,941
Splendid! Even the number is the same!

100
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:52,241
These two cars will be exchanged on the roof of the building,

101
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:56,341
and the remote-controlled one will fall over.

102
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,241
I'm excited!

103
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:02,641
OK! This is in commemoration of having come here.

104
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,741
Oh, no! Genta!

105
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,441
Just what do you think you're doing?

106
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,042
What's going on, kids?

107
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,741
Nothing at all.

108
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,241
-Nothing! -No!

109
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,342
Excuse us.

110
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:31,842
Huh?

111
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:53,042
I'm counting on you.

112
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,241
Got a sec?

113
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:08,041
You gotta be kidding!

114
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:10,141
I can't believe you're still meddling!

115
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:13,741
-I'm not meddling! -Those two are arguing again.

116
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:16,441
I hope they will start shooting the film without a trouble.

117
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,541
I am worried a bit.

118
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,242
Mr. Rikiishi!

119
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:33,242
Huh, did it start?

120
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,941
Please somebody, stop him!

121
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,742
He is going to display the plan he was talking about some time ago!

122
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:23,041
Mr. Rikiishi!

123
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,641
It... it can't be!

124
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,141
That's why...

125
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:29,841
That's why, I told him not to!

126
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:33,442
Whatever is the matter? What happened?

127
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:41,641
The seat belt is almost unfastened.

128
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,242
This means...

129
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:47,441
Just before he broke through that fence on the roof,

130
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:50,141
he failed to get out of the car.

131
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:52,241
I guess that's how this case will be settled, an accident.

132
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:53,942
What's on your mind?

133
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,142
Maybe... this is...

134
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:07,142
Excuse me, Mr. Cameraman!

135
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:09,841
You were shooting a few minutes ago, weren't you?

136
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,842
Could you show it to me?

137
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,242
Just as I thought!

138
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:40,041
Oops!

139
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:42,142
I must check over there too!

140
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,041
Conan!

141
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:47,541
Where are you going?

142
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,641
He's going to outdo us again!

143
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,841
-Let's go too! -Okay!

144
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:54,142
Hey, you all!

145
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:10,541
This is...

146
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,141
What's up, Conan?

147
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:15,042
This is not an accident!

148
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:19,441
This is skillfully and carefully schemed murder.

149
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:21,542
What did you say?

150
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:31,228
The person who has died is Mr. Kengo Rikiishi, a stuntman, 38 years old.

151
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:34,628
Was the cause of death found to be from the fall?

152
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,728
Yes. When the car crashed to the ground,

153
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:39,328
the impact of the fall run through his entire body.

154
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,728
He died on the spot.

155
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,228
But to think that they would make a car fall over

156
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,128
from that height with a person inside,

157
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,528
that's quite a dangerous way to film something.

158
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:48,828
Wrong!

159
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:51,328
We would never let anyone do such a stunt.

160
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:53,528
What do you mean?

161
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,628
Well, he... Mr. Rikiishi did it of his own discretion!

162
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,128
He did a stunt he wanted to show and failed.

163
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,528
Exactly speaking, it was not a stunt.

164
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,028
It was a performance before the take.

165
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,728
I don't understand why did Mr. Rikiishi do such a thing.

166
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:10,128
He was driven to do so.

167
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,428
-Driven to do so? -Why?

168
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,328
I can understand him, too.

169
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:16,728
Young people are appearing one after another.

170
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,928
If I had stuck to filming only,

171
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:21,028
I would have starved to death a long time ago myself.

172
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,828
I am not saying we don't need a stuntman.

173
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:26,428
We absolutely need stuntmen for this kind of filming.

174
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:28,928
But, thanks to the development of digital technology,

175
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,828
stunts like those done in the past are no longer necessary.

176
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:36,028
But, it is also a fact that there are those who got fired because of this.

177
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:37,728
I can't do anything about it.

178
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,328
The staff producer's in charge of personnel.

179
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,428
The staff producer wanted to fire him,

180
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:45,529
but I heard that you stopped him.

181
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,928
Are you sure?

182
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:50,328
-You're going to regret it. -Let go of me!

183
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,928
I guess he was struggling

184
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,628
to keep the position you helped him from losing,

185
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:55,728
though it was held together only by a thin strip.

186
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,528
That must have been it.

187
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,728
You sound you understand, Mr. Kijima.

188
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:02,728
But, aren't you the one who attempted a direct appeal to the director,

189
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:05,128
and made it hard for him to keep his job in the first place?

190
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:09,328
Kengo seemed to know what you did behind the scene.

191
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:13,628
You gotta be kidding! Are you saying I did something to him?

192
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:14,928
You are the one got beaten by him,

193
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:18,328
because he nailed you for negligent maintenance, aren't you?

194
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,128
Come off it. No arguing here, please.

195
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,928
You often got beaten by him too, didn't you?

196
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:29,728
You would often scream "I'll kill him" at drinking parties.

197
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:32,728
What? Are you saying I did something more than that?

198
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:35,928
Officer, this is enough. Please make it clear.

199
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:37,528
This was an accident, wasn't it? This thing.

200
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:38,928
Well, let me see.

201
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,828
We'll have to get specialists to investigate and tell us

202
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:44,428
whether this was caused by negligence in maintenance or not.

203
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,628
Absolutely not!

204
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,228
The maintenance was complete.

205
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:49,528
But you have a motive.

206
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,428
The same goes for you too!

207
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,628
But at this stage,

208
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,828
the possibility of this being an accident is high, I would say.

209
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,328
See? Naturally!

210
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,929
Doc, you're on.

211
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:05,528
Wait!

212
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,329
Well...

213
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:13,628
This is a murder case, under the pretense of an accident.

214
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,828
What? What did you say?

215
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:19,028
What proof do you have for saying that?

216
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,228
Calm down. I want to confirm one thing.

217
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:25,628
About the late Mr. Rikiishi's personality.

218
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,128
Personality?

219
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,728
For example, the more dangerous a stunt becomes,

220
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,029
the more he wants to do it.

221
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:34,428
Yeah, right,

222
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:38,028
he had a tendency since his young days to go out of his way

223
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:39,428
to plunged into danger.

224
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:41,428
It's an occupational sickness.

225
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:44,228
Before doing so, careful preparation and training

226
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:45,728
are naturally needed, though.

227
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:48,328
A person who can do this is first-class.

228
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,628
How was Mr. Rikiishi?

229
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,128
He was first-class.

230
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,928
Yes, when he was young.

231
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:58,828
But, recently he perhaps became careless.

232
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:02,028
Say the murderer took advantage of this?

233
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,328
-What? -Just what do you mean?

234
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,128
Mr. Fukamachi.

235
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,828
What were you talking about with Mr. Rikiishi then?

236
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,528
He was saying he would show us a real stunt.

237
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,129
He wouldn't listen to me and...

238
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:20,228
It's the other way around!

239
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,229
The other way around?

240
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,828
What I am saying is, he was not the one who proposed it, you did.

241
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,728
By saying something like,

242
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:32,028
"Depending on your performance, they may agree to it,"

243
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:34,328
"though I would oppose to it in my position,"

244
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:36,628
and tempted him to do it.

245
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,328
Nonsense!

246
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:41,628
Are you saying that I killed him?

247
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:46,228
Yes, the murderer was you, Mr. Fukamachi.

248
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:47,728
Doctor Agasa.

249
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:50,228
He might have attempted to provoke Mr. Rikiishi,

250
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:52,028
but the one who actually drove the car

251
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:54,728
and failed the stunt was Mr. Rikiishi himself.

252
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,728
This is not a murder case!

253
00:16:56,729 --> 00:17:03,828
You are right. For that reason, you furthermore said to Mr. Rikiishi.

254
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:07,928
"No explosives are loaded in Car A for it to explode in mid air."

255
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:11,028
"So, sitting in Car A to do your stunt is meaningless."

256
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,128
"Don't do it."

257
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:16,628
After being told so, Mr. Rikiishi made up his mind

258
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:19,028
to quickly change to Car B, which is loaded with explosives

259
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:21,528
as soon as he arrives at the roof

260
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,828
and flee from the car just before it falls over.

261
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,428
He wanted to do a dangerous stunt

262
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:28,628
and show everyone how capable he is.

263
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:33,429
What? You mean that's Car B that was on the roof?

264
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:37,128
No,

265
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:41,028
this is Car A that had no explosives loaded in it!

266
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,128
I'm confused.

267
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,528
Me, too.

268
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,628
Wait a second.

269
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:48,228
I am sure that back then...

270
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:51,428
Officer Takagi, just in case, check the car on the roof.

271
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:52,429
Yes, sir!

272
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:57,928
Inspector! I've found it!

273
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,028
This is Car B, as we thought!

274
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:03,928
In other words, Mr. Rikiishi dared the stunt without changing cars.

275
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,228
He failed and fell over.

276
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:09,728
It was surely an accident.

277
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,428
Don't jump to conclusions.

278
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:16,428
Try recalling Mr. Rikiishi, right after the accident.

279
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,129
If you have any pictures of the site taken by the forensic officer...

280
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:27,028
-Conan! -Yes.

281
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,728
-This is it after all! -This!

282
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:32,528
The Masked Yaiba sticker that Genta put on the car.

283
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:36,628
He stuck them on the car that the man in charge moved to the roof.

284
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:38,328
Right, Genta?

285
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:39,928
Yeah.

286
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:41,528
No doubt about it.

287
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,328
He did change the cars on the roof!

288
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,628
Sorry.

289
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:49,329
I put the stickers on both cars.

290
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,028
No.

291
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:56,028
We therefore, can't prove that he changed cars.

292
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,529
No, it's not that. Here's what I want you to see!

293
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:03,428
Hey, Mr. Cameraman.

294
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:06,029
Could you show us the film you showed me some time ago again?

295
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:09,129
Stop, please!

296
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:12,528
See? His cape's not jammed.

297
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,128
What's this?

298
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:16,528
It doesn't look as if he opened or closed the door

299
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,928
until he got to the roof.

300
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:20,128
But, the explosive...

301
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:23,128
All that had to be done was to reload the car beforehand.

302
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,528
But it doesn't prove that he changed cars.

303
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:27,928
Conan!

304
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,328
I went up to the roof right away,

305
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:33,628
but, the hood was still hot.

306
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:36,128
It seemed as if the engine had just been stopped.

307
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:38,028
Oh, as you say...

308
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:41,328
Nonsense! So what?

309
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,328
Supposing... just supposing that

310
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:47,828
I had lured him to change cars on the roof,

311
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,928
I hate to say this but, he's the one who couldn't make it out of the car

312
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,728
before the car fell over, right?

313
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:55,928
Are you saying that his ability is no good anymore?

314
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,528
He could've stepped on the brake before he broke through the fence.

315
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,728
He couldn't even do that, which means...

316
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,329
I agree.

317
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:08,928
No, both getting out of the car and stepping on the brakes

318
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:11,728
were impossible to begin with.

319
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,028
I don't understand.

320
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,328
Please try to remember

321
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:20,028
what kind of Car B that was prepared on the roof was like.

322
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:23,828
In addition to explosives for a mid air explosion being set up...

323
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,428
A remote controller!

324
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,428
Where is the remote controller now?

325
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:29,029
That's...

326
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,828
This is it, isn't it?

327
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:38,828
Yes. He said he wanted to check it, so I lent it to him.

328
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:43,329
By using it, we can find out which car is A and which car is B.

329
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:56,429
What is this?

330
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:00,628
It seems to be crying.

331
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,028
Yes, it does.

332
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,929
Poor thing.

333
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:09,328
I had debts, so I used the production money.

334
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:12,628
He found out about it and blackmailed me.

335
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:15,628
That's why you took advantage of Mr. Rikiishi's mental tendency

336
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:18,128
and planned the murder.

337
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:21,828
Car A driven by Rikiishi reached the roof parking lot.

338
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:24,428
You used the remote controller at just about the time

339
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,229
he was to transfer to Car B.

340
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:34,328
The brake didn't work and the door didn't open.

341
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,229
The car fell over.

342
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,828
And afterwards, Mr. Rikiishi's death would be deemed an accident

343
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:46,028
he caused himself.

344
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:49,328
So long as everyone thought that he died in Car A,

345
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:51,828
all he had to do is return the remote controller

346
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:54,628
and act as if nothing had happened.

347
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:57,429
Isn't that what you thought?

348
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:37,928
I can't eat anymore.

349
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:39,628
Masked Yaiba, you look great.

350
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:42,728
You can't stick the sticker all over on there, Genta.

351
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:45,129
My deduction's gone down the drain.

352
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:47,429
I agree with him.

353
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:00,128
"Next Episode."

354
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:02,429
Did Mr. Yamamoto commit suicide?

355
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:06,228
There's something more.

356
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:08,129
Something that I haven't realized yet.

357
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:16,429
What is it?

358
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:22,428
Next Conan,

359
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,429
"The Fatal Ah."

360
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:44,528
Next Conan's Hint:

361
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:46,429
"Stir stick."

362
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:50,529
It's a stir stick but you shouldn't mix the case around.
