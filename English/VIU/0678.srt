1
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:06,231
Murderer!

2
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,531
My God!

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,531
This is bad, Mr. Glover!

4
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:18,531
I have one too.

5
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:21,931
The magistrate office will take this

6
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,631
as an opportunity to capture you.

7
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,031
If this should happen,

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,231
business as well as the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance will go down the drain.

9
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,931
No need to worry.

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,331
All charges against, I, myself, will clear.

11
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:37,331
I, Ryoma Sakamoto!

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,231
The vivid colored memories of summer

13
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:43,231
solve mysteries all season round.

14
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,431
The stage is in Nagasaki, at the end of the Edo Era.

15
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:47,431
Where did the scriptwriter disappear to?

16
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:49,031
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,031
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,431
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:37,488
"The Nagasaki Mystery (End of the Edo Era)".

20
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:49,288
We've time-slipped,

21
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,488
or so I thought, but...

22
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:52,588
As always,

23
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:56,288
Ran won first prize at the shopping arcade raffle drawing.

24
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:57,988
And, today,

25
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,888
"Nagasaki Station" -we arrived in Nagasaki.

26
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,588
"Confucius Shrine"

27
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:07,388
"Ooura Catholic Church"

28
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,988
"Glover Garden" -Glover Garden is a famous site in Nagasaki

29
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:14,188
where the mansion of the English merchant, Thomas Blake Glover,

30
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:16,888
who supported zealous men of noble ideals,

31
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:19,088
such as Ryoma Sakamoto stands.

32
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:24,288
What's she looking for?

33
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,988
-A heart stone. -A heart stone?

34
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:29,888
Among the stone pavement within the garden,

35
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:33,088
it is said that there are two heart-shaped stones.

36
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,788
If a couple finds them, it is said that they will get married,

37
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:37,888
or if they touch it, their love will be realized.

38
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:40,288
There seems to be many myths about it.

39
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,888
I found it!

40
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,788
It's cute!

41
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,788
I wonder where the other one is.

42
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,488
Who cares about something like that?

43
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:52,688
I'm more concerned about eating the famous Nagasaki Chanpon and Saraudon.

44
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,788
Murderer!

45
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,888
What was that?

46
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,788
I'm sure I heard murderer.

47
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:00,888
This way?

48
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,388
Move it!

49
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:07,388
Everybody, stay where you are and don't move!

50
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:11,188
Leave the rest to this famed Detective Kogoro Mouri!

51
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:14,888
What's with this victim?

52
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,088
He... he's revived.

53
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:22,588
Who on earth are all of you?

54
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,088
Cut!

55
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:32,788
Too late.

56
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:34,688
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,688
It's so misleading.

58
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:38,888
The filming of a two-hour TV mystery drama

59
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:44,988
staged in Nagasaki at the end of the Edo era was in session.

60
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:47,988
A murder occurs at the Glover Mansion,

61
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,188
and Ryoma Sakamoto who was sheltered here,

62
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:52,088
serves the role of a detective.

63
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:55,088
He takes Ine, a young woman doctor who studied Western medicine

64
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,688
by means of the Dutch language, as his assistant,

65
00:04:57,688 --> 00:05:01,388
and clears his name by solving the case.

66
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,288
How about it, Ine?

67
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:05,788
Was a gun used, after all?

68
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:09,188
"Kyonosuke Sasahara (33) as Ryoma Sakamoto"

69
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:12,588
To think that something like this would happen at this mansion...

70
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:15,588
"Benichiyo Yamashita (42) as Tsuru"

71
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:18,288
We've sure got trouble.

72
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:21,388
"Andrew Hatta (50) as Glover"

73
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,688
No doubt about it.

74
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,988
The cause of death is by gunshot.

75
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:29,488
"Futaba Nanao (23) as Ine Karasuma"

76
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:30,888
Cut!

77
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:32,688
Okay!

78
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:35,588
Hey! Are you sure it's okay?

79
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:36,788
It may be just acting,

80
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,188
but should a doctor say her lines with so much emotion?

81
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,788
"Keisuke Sakakibara (45), TV Drama Director" -It's okay!

82
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:44,188
Ine's still a new doctor, so that'll do.

83
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:47,388
"Akikazu Nakane (48), Cameraman" -Your acting was quite something, Ochiyo!

84
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,988
"Ryuhei Kishimura (30), Assistant Director" -Right, Benichiyo!

85
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:52,288
You think so?

86
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:53,788
I'm glad if you think so.

87
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,088
Next is the scene that Chubei Soneya,

88
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:01,788
a colleague of the victim appears.

89
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:03,888
Showtime, Mr. Sazanami!

90
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:04,988
Okay!

91
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:07,788
I'm counting on you, Bara!

92
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:11,088
"Chojiro Sazanami (45) as Chyubei Soneya"

93
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:14,088
Yeah, same here, Cho.

94
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:15,488
Where's Soneya's props?

95
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:16,788
Here they are!

96
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:19,488
"Kazuomi Sakota (35), Props Master" -They're all here.

97
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:25,888
Don't you think it's a bit too flashy?

98
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,488
No.

99
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,788
I wonder if you can do something about this comb too.

100
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:33,288
No, but that's Madame Butterfly's...

101
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:36,488
You really like opera, don't you?

102
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:39,188
But is it really okay, Bara?

103
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:41,388
To start filming when we still don't know how the story ends,

104
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,088
or more than that, who the culprit is.

105
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,888
Well, even if it's a bit delayed,

106
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:49,888
Tatsumi always comes up with a masterpiece.

107
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,488
She's quite a beauty,

108
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,188
that woman playing the role of the doctor.

109
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,188
You mean Ms. Futaba Nanao, right?

110
00:06:57,188 --> 00:07:00,688
She's a new actress that's expected to become popular soon.

111
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,588
You've got to be kidding!

112
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,488
We can't do that!

113
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,188
That's why I told you that won't do.

114
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:10,188
I told you to keep it hidden!

115
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:13,188
Mr. Sasahara is a handsome bachelors

116
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:14,488
and is always ranking at the top when it comes to

117
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,388
wanting him to be a boyfriend. That's what I heard from Sonoko.

118
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:19,288
I wonder if something's wrong.

119
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:22,988
Maybe it has to do with women?

120
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:24,288
No way!

121
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:26,788
We've got trouble!

122
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:29,688
"Taizo Ooki (52), Producer of a drama production company" -Tatsumi split!

123
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:30,688
-What? -What?

124
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:39,888
I knew he's been troubled recently, but...

125
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:43,888
After all of us who used to work together gathered together again...

126
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,288
Maybe we should wait a while more.

127
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:48,688
No, we can't wait any longer.

128
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:50,688
Is it?

129
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:52,288
If so...

130
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:53,588
That's right!

131
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:54,788
The thing is...

132
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,588
What?

133
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,788
Sleeping Kogoro?

134
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:01,788
Yes?

135
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:04,188
Please!

136
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:06,488
Please find the culprit of this mystery drama

137
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:10,188
with your deduction, Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:12,088
Huh?

139
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,788
Hey, hey.

140
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:16,288
"Kosaku Tatsumi (45), Scriptwriter" -The scriptwriter of the mystery drama,

141
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,988
Mr. Kosaku Tatsumi,

142
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:21,788
is a veteran who has a history of winning various awards.

143
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:23,388
On top of this drama being the work of Mr. Tatsumi

144
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:25,888
with no other original work to go on,

145
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:29,088
since it cranked in despite delay in the script being submitted,

146
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,688
there was no one but Mr. Tatsumi,

147
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,488
who knew what to expect was coming,

148
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:35,788
or who the culprit in the script would be.

149
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:40,188
If this drama goes down the drain,

150
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,788
our company will go bankrupt!

151
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,788
So long as you figure out who the culprit is, Mr. Mouri,

152
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:48,988
I'll take care of what comes up after that.

153
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,688
-Please! -Please!

154
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:58,688
It's impossible after all.

155
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:01,688
With no written script,

156
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:04,988
there's no way that I can figure out the culprit.

157
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:07,988
But, you accepted the work, didn't you?

158
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:09,088
You told them that there's no mystery

159
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,488
that the Sleeping Kogoro can't solve.

160
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:13,188
Well, you see...

161
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:15,988
It's true that there're not enough clues.

162
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:20,688
Huh?

163
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:24,488

00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:30,188
What's this?

168
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:31,988
Why is it in a place like this?

169
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,388
A band of artwork thieves.

170
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:35,388
That's it!

171
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:38,188
These are stories based on real cases, aren't they?

172
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:41,188
In other words, the culprit is a band of thieves?

173
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:43,088
But, nothing like that comes out

174
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:45,588
in the script that they have now, you know?

175
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:47,688
They're appearing from now.

176
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,488
I wonder about that.

177
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,788
If so,

178
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:53,688
it wouldn't have to be hidden in a place like this.

179
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,788
Yes, right, I'm leaving now.

180
00:09:57,788 --> 00:09:58,888
So,

181
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:00,888
I've got no choice but to do something about it, right?

182
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,288
Why this?

183
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:10,488
I'm exhausted.

184
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:13,888
So, there weren't many clues after all, were there?

185
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:15,388
That's why I've been telling you

186
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:17,888
the band of thieves are the culprits.

187
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,988
Hi, Mr. Mouri.

188
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:26,388
I'm Andrew Hatta, acting as Glover.

189
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:27,788
-What? -What?

190
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:32,788
I look more like the statue in Glover Garden

191
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:34,888
without my make-up, don't I?

192
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:37,288
No...

193
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,388
If I remember correctly, the Glover who helped Ryoma out

194
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:42,588
was about 30 years old.

195
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:45,388
Detective boy.

196
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:46,788
You're thinking that the actor

197
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:50,288
is older than the actual Glover, aren't you?

198
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,988
No...

199
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,488
It seems that Mr. Ooki's production company

200
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,288
is having quite a tough time.

201
00:10:58,288 --> 00:11:01,188
So, most of the performers in this drama

202
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:03,488
are acting for guarantees cheaper than the usual,

203
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:07,188
thanks to connections through Mr. Ooki and Mr. Sakakibara.

204
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,988
Does that go for you too, Mr. Hatta?

205
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:13,088
Yes, I've known everyone for a long time.

206
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,288
The director did mention

207
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:17,488
that all the colleagues from the past got together.

208
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:20,188
Yes.

209
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:25,088
Mr. Sakakibara, Mr. Ooki, Ochiyo, Mr. Sazanami and I

210
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:27,988
used to work together since the days we were still unknown actors.

211
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,588
Of course, the same goes for Mr. Tatsumi.

212
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:32,888
I see.

213
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:36,688
Since I was the only one who could be used to act as Glover,

214
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:39,188
the script was written so I was already married to Tsuru,

215
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:43,188
as a middle-aged couple.

216
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:46,388
Mr. Tatsumi may have not liked this,

217
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:49,088
because he used to place importance on being genuine.

218
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:53,288
Is that why he disappeared without finishing the script?

219
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:55,388
I have no idea.

00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:10,888
I wonder.

224
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,388
How about you, Bara?

225
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:13,588
Me neither.

226
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:17,588
Tatsumi used to be secretive about what he was planning to write, so...

227
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:23,088
Hey, what on earth are we going to do?

228
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:25,088
It's just a matter of time, you know.

229
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:40,688
Hey, Sonny.

230
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:44,488
You're the one who came with Mr. Mouri, aren't you?

Since they finished filming my part,

234
00:12:57,593 --> 00:13:01,893
I was thinking that maybe I would be able to help you,

235
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:04,293
or rather, take you around.

236
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,393
That'd be a great help!

we visited the places that were noted.

You mean this?

I bought it at a shop near the Glover Garden.

Yup.

Mr. Tatsumi was almost hit by a car.

271

What?

272
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:58,293
He said that somebody seems to have pushed him from behind.

Are you sure?

274

Well...

276
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:07,093
Anyway,

277
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:11,293
maybe Mr. Tatsumi disappeared because he feared for his life.

Hello?

Mr. Ooki.

289
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:18,093
What? You got the continuation of the script by mail from Mr. Tatsumi?

290
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:21,593
And, was the name of the culprit written?

I guess.

00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:50,193

Does she do karate or something?

302

She may not look it, but she's won the Kanto Tournament,

"Capitan room" - The continuation of the script that was received by mail

305
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:17,093
was also incomplete.

306

But the second murder case was written there.

307

The site of the crime was in the Capitan room of Dejima.

308
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:27,493
The victim is a secret detective hired by the Nagasaki magistrate,

309
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:28,993
and he left a dying message behind; the Japanese kanji character

310
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:31,793
for the number 9 (kyu).

311
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:36,093
And? What did he say?

312
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:41,593
Ask the daughter of the shipping agency Miuraya, Otei, for the details.

Cut! Okay!

We managed to fill the schedule in time,

315
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,393
but the problem is, "What now?"

316
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:51,993
Which means?

317
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:55,993
A new character appeared without previous reference.

318
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,093
There are a lot of mysterious dialogs too.

319
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,993
I'm sure it's a quite important role, though.

320
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,893
We don't have anyone to act the role.

321
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:05,593
We don't have the time or money to call someone from Tokyo either.

322
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:08,093
That's a problem, isn't it?

323
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:09,893
Right, it sure is.

324
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:12,893
How old are you?

325
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,793
I'm 17.

326
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,793
I see! We can do that too!

327
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,593
It can't be.

328
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:24,593
Please lend this to us!

329
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:26,593
No! No way!

330
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:28,593

331
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:30,693

00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:35,493
Give it your best shot!

334
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:36,893
Hang in there!

335
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:39,093
No, the other way!

336
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:41,193
That's why I don't like amateurs.

337
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:42,493
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,293
No, it's my mistake!

339
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:46,493
Hey, are you sure it's going to work?

340
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,293
It's not a school play, you know.

341
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,493
Don't worry, just relax.

342
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,393
Just say your lines

343
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:56,093
and we'll do the rest.

344
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,493
Yes...

345
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:00,093
Okay then, shall we try out the dialogs?

346
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:03,293
You can try first by looking at the scripts.

347
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:05,193
Please wait!

348
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:06,993
Let's start!

349
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:11,093
Mr. Sakamoto. I'm Otei, the daughter of Miuraya.

350
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,593
What would you like with me?

351
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:18,593
That's what the girls of the West wear,

352
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:20,693
called a dress, is it not?

353
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,993
The daughter of Miuraya is known to all in town

354
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:25,093
to be affected by European culture.

355
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:26,193
By the way,

356
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,893
the man that was "you know what" in the Capitan's room

357
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:31,193
was said to have left a writing "kyu" behind.

358
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,493
Do you know what it means?

359
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:35,993
Kyu?

360
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,893
Figures are important.

361
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,293
Figures will solve everything.

362
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,693
Right?

363
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:45,193
Yes, that's right.

364
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:47,193
Why me too?

365
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:49,593
Cut! Okay!

366
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,293
Break time!

367
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,393
But, what a strange dialog.

368
00:19:57,393 --> 00:20:00,193
"Figures will solve everything." What a line.

369
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:01,293
Come to think of it,

370
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:03,093
there seems to be a lot of actors and actress

371
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,893
with numbers in their names.

372
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:09,593
"8" -Andrew Hatta, acting as Glover, right?

373
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:10,893
Tsuru, his wife

374
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,693
"1,000" -is acted by Ms. Benichiyo Yamashita.

375
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,293
I guess so.

376
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:18,393
"7" -The same with Futaba, her last name is Nanao.

377
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:20,093
There are some on our staff too.

378
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:24,493
"3" -Mr. Ooki's name is Taizo.

379
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:26,793
"1" -Mr. Sakota's is Kazuomi.

380
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,993
Mr. Sakamoto, do you know?

381
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:37,293
That in Nakashima River here, there lives a monster.

382
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:38,693
What?

383
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:41,193
But, there's no need to worry.

384
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:42,593
The monster's weak point

385
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:46,093
is its second tooth from the left on its lower jaw.

386
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,593
Cut! Okay!

387
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:50,793
The monster's weak point...

388
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:53,093
This is another mysterious line.

389
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,193
This is...

390
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:58,193
Only this line is written in a different font.

391
00:20:58,193 --> 00:20:59,593
Maybe...

392
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:11,093
Maybe this could be a message from Mr. Tatsumi?

393
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:12,593
If Otei of Miuraya

394
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:16,693
was a character that was created to relay that message...

395
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:20,093
The thing thinkable is the truth of why he disappeared!

396
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:21,493
And, that is...

397
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:22,493
"Serial Art Theft Case"

398
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,493
"Illegally Sold Among Fans"

399
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:24,493
"A Large-scale Smuggling Organisation"

400
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:34,093
This is all I know.

401
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:38,093
Next, I will take you to the restaurant that first started Western cuisine.

402
00:21:39,393 --> 00:21:41,693
I've had enough! Count me out!

403
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:55,293
He was probably punched,

404
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:56,493
moreover, with bare hands.

405
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:58,393
Get a hold of yourself, Sakota!

406
00:21:58,393 --> 00:21:59,693
Where's the ambulance?

407
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,193
I called them. They'll be here soon.

408
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:04,193
Darn! Who did this to you?

409
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:14,793
Huh? Me?

410
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:15,893
What?

411
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:17,793
Ran?

412
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:19,093
Can't be!

413
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:21,793
The karate champion?

414
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:24,393
No, I didn't...

415
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:28,093
Hey, Sakota! Get a hold of yourself!

416
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:29,493
Sakota!

417
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:56,093
"Next Episode" -Why did Mr. Sakota point at Ran back then?

418
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:58,393
Where are you now?

419
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,893
I was just about to leave.

420
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:04,193
I was suddenly attacked by someone at the observatory.

421
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,993
I see! I got it!

422
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:09,093
The meaning of the dying message!

423
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:14,193
The culprit who attacked Mr. Sakota and Mr. Sazanami is...

424
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:16,093
you, Ran!

425
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:17,493
Next Conan,

426
00:24:17,493 --> 00:24:21,493
"The Nagasaki Mystery Theater (The Present)".
