2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:05,291
Confirmed M.

3
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:06,591
His cell phone is ringing.

4
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:10,091
Hello, Mouri's here.

5
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:14,791
Yeah, Nihonbashi Post Office.

6
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:15,791
I got it!

7
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:20,391
The man on the phone told me

8
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:23,191
to pick up the stuff at the post office.

9
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,391
And, he says I gotta make it there in 5 minutes.

10
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:26,591
Let me through.

11
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:30,691
M is going south down Chuo Boulevard.

12
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,691
I came to get my stuff that's supposed to be here.

13
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:41,791
Yes, sir, I.D. please.

14
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:03,591
This case started 5 days ago.

15
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:07,191
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

16
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,191
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

17
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:10,891
The culprit designates pops?

18
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,991
Cherry blossom viewing on a boat turns out to be a surprising case.

19
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,591
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,491
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:19,191
His name is Detective Conan!

22

"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 1)"

23
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:09,598
Bye! See you. Take care.

24
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:12,948
The employees of a company called New Image

25
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,748
that exclusively handles import of American cars,

26
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:17,348
are attacked one after the other

27
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,848
and are seriously injured.

28
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:26,248
And the president of New Image receives a threatening call.

29
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:29,448
24,000,000 yen?

30
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:30,748
You must be kidding.

31
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,848
I see.

32
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:41,148
So, 24,000,000 yen is the amount that fits just right into the briefcase.

33
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:42,648
Hey, Conan.

34
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,948
What're you doing in a place like this?

35
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:49,148
I went to the department store with Ran,

36
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:52,148
but happened to see pops running by.

37
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,048
Mr. Mouri is on duty right now,

38
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:55,248
so don't bother him, okay?

39
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:56,248
Okay.

40
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,748
Miwako. Did I keep you waiting?

41
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:03,748
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:05,348
I sure did.

43
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:07,948
I mean, it's your treat today, okay?

44
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,848
What? I mean, I always treat you, don't I?

45
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:12,748
Did you say something just now?

46
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:14,548
No, I didn't.

47
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:18,948
So shall we get going, then?

48
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:19,948
I guess so.

49
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:31,548
Put the money in this briefcase.

50
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:32,848
Throw away your cell phone.

51
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:35,448
I'll contact you with this transceiver.

52
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:37,348
Get on the Hanami Cruise Liner departing

53
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:41,248
at 05:45 pm from the foot of Nihonbashi.

54
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,948
Dispose of the microphone you're using to keep in touch with the police.

55
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:49,948
M is headed again north on Chuo Boulevard.

56
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:50,948
Roger.

57
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:54,548
Conan.

58
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,448
This is the memo that pops threw away.

59
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:59,248
I think it has something to do with your job.

60
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:01,648
Thank you. Be careful and go home.

61
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:07,548
Directions from the culprit are written on this memo.

62
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:09,748
Inspector Megure.

63
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:11,648
According to the culprit's memo,

64
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:14,348
they're going to be making contact using a transceiver from now on.

65
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:18,148
It says for him to get on a cruiser from Nihonbashi.

66
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:20,948
Well, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

67
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,248
Are you Mr. Ishida?

68
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,448
Yes.

69
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:28,448
We thought you weren't going to come anymore.

70
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:29,948
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:35,948
I'm sorry everyone, for making you wait.

72
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,248
Okay, since everyone's on board,

73
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,948
we'll start off.

74
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,548
The cruiser that M is on board has departed.

75
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:55,048
Sir.

76
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:58,448
The boat that just left is a cherry blossom viewing cruiser, isn't it?

77
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,348
Where is it going?

78
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:04,248
That's going to Sumida River then to Ooyoko River.

79
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,248
Would you like a pamphlet?

80
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,848
Thank you.

81
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,048
"Spring Cherry Blossom Viewing Cruise"

82
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:14,848
But, inspector...

83
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:18,448
Why did the culprit designate me to bring him the money?

84
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,848
The thing is, I don't really know.

85
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,448
Don't you have any idea why?

86
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,948
No, not at all.

87
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:29,748
He's also demanding that the police pull out completely.

88
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:31,048
He saying that if we ignore his demand,

89
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,148
the life of the employees are at stake.

90
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:37,048
Since I got ready the 24,000,000 yen that he's demanding,

91
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,048
so I'll leave it to you now.

92
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,748
I can't afford to endanger the lives of my employees.

93
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:43,248
I understand.

94
00:06:43,248 --> 00:06:46,348
You can count on me, Kogoro Mouri.

95
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:55,948
We will be entering Sumida River in about 10 minutes,

96
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,448
but the waves will be getting rough

97
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:59,948
so please take care not to fall off.

98
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:04,048
See, take a look at that.

99
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,848
Wow, it looks like something that would come out in the movies.

100
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:14,148
Tokyo viewed from the river is quite nice too, isn't it?

101
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:16,648
Sendai bori that is up ahead is called so

102
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:20,348
because the Sendai clan in the old days made it.

103
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:22,848
Is that right?

104
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:30,248
The cruiser that M is on board sailed under Minato Bridge just now.

105
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:33,148
The culprit's planning to get the money somewhere along the river.

106
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,348
Keep your eyes open.

107
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:35,348
Roger.

108
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:39,348
The waves of the transceiver

109
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:40,948
works only in a range of at most, 100 meters.

110
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:43,648
The culprit should be somewhere in this range.

111
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:45,848
Sato, where are you now?

112
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:48,548
We're waiting right across Eitai River.

113
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,548
We confirmed with the cruiser company

114
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:54,448
and found that it's supposed to go from Sumida River to Ooyoko River.

115
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:57,748
You two go on ahead to Ooyoko River.

116
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:58,748
Roger.

117
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,748
Wow. How wonderful.

118
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,248
Amazing.

119
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,648
It's about time you start working for me.

120
00:08:10,648 --> 00:08:13,748
That cruiser is headed for Oojima water gate

121
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:15,548
and will be going into Ooyoko River.

122
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:20,048
Then, put the briefcase on the roof of the cruiser.

123
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:22,448
Put it in the center so that it doesn't fall.

124
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:25,648
Then, go back to your seat and wait for the next contact.

125
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,248
It's not rolling anymore.

126
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:40,248
Ooyoko River is a canal, that's why.

127
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:43,548
A local feudal lord made this by order of the Edo Shogunate.

128
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:50,848
Amazing.

129
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:55,848
That brat...

130
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:58,948
Don't you get in my way, brat!

131
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:00,348
Lower your head!

132
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:04,948
That was close!

133
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:08,848
During high tide, water level rises, that the bridge gets so low,

134
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,948
we can't go under it even on this cruiser.

135
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:13,448
I see.

136
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:15,448
Well, I guess you don't bow so often or lower your head really low

137
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:18,148
and turn it into a good experience while you're at it.

138
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:19,148
What did you say?

139
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:22,648
The briefcase is on the roof.

140
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,348
It's impossible to pull the briefcase

141
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:40,748
up from the bridge in this crowd people.

142
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:41,948
Besides...

143
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:49,448
With so many surveillance cameras all over the place, the more so.

144
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,448
Did you wait long?

145
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:13,148
That was close.

146
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:42,748
M has entered Heikyu River.

147
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:46,748
The briefcase is on the roof of the cruiser.

148
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:49,248
What? Keep your eyes on the cruiser!

149
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,348
Roger!

150
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:51,848
I'll go get the car.

151
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:33,348
The briefcase is gone!

152
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:42,461
The briefcase is gone!

153
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:46,427
Conan? What brings you here?

154
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:47,927
The briefcase is gone!

155
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:49,227
-What? -What?

156
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:51,527
Bad news! We've got to contact the inspector.

157
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,727
Darn!

158
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:58,527
Pops!

159
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:01,327
Pops! We've got trouble!

160
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:03,127
Shut up! Don't bother me!

161
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,727
The briefcase on the roof is gone!

162
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:06,727
What?

163
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:12,527
It's gone! It's gone! It's gone! It's gone!

164
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:14,927
Hey, look out, sir!

165
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:18,127
The briefcase is gone!

166
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:22,927
Mr. Mouri!

167
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,527
How'd he do it?

168
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:30,727
How on earth the culprit take the briefcase?

169
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:39,327
"Mouri Detective Agency"

170
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,027
In other words,

171
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,827
you got instructions over the transceiver?

172
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:48,427
To put the briefcase on the roof after entering Ooyoko River?

173
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:49,427
Yes...

174
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:53,527
Yes.

175
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:55,927
You got nothing, no directions, after that?

176
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:56,927
No.

177
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:03,227
And, by the time you realized it, the briefcase was gone?

178
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:06,227
Yes, sir. Because he told me to go back to my seat

179
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:08,327
and wait for further contact.

180
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:09,727
What a shame.

181
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,327
And, Conan...

182
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:14,427
When did you last see the briefcase?

183
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,027
Well...

184
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:19,027
Over here. Totomi Bridge here.

185
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:23,727
The last we saw of it was Shiomi Bridge here.

186
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:29,427
And you realized that the briefcase was gone at Hamazono Bridge here.

187
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:33,927
In other words, the culprit would have had to take the briefcase

188
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:36,627
from somewhere between Heikyu Bridge and Hamazono Bridge.

189
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,727
Mr. Mouri, was there anything you noticed?

190
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:44,227
I'm very sorry.

191
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,727
It seems like I've caught a cold

192
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,827
That's obvious.

193
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,927
Oh, right.

194
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:53,827
Bback then, I heard a metallic sound of something banging onto steel.

195
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:56,127
A metallic sound?

196
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,927
If I remember correctly, somewhere around here...

197
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:02,527
I think it was a small bridge.

198
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:06,327
There were two small boats anchored under the bridge.

199
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:08,227
Were there people on the boats?

200
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:10,327
No, no one.

201
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:13,627
I heard the sound when the skipper veered the cruiser to the right

202
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:16,227
to avoid the boats and sailed under the bridge

203
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:18,927
What was that?

204
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:20,727
Maybe we hit a bridge?

205
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,127
No way.

206
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,327
If so the cruiser should sway more.

207
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:25,927
I see.

208
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:29,427
That was probably Shigure Bridge.

209
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:32,327
When we were watching from Shiomi Bridge,

210
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:34,727
Heikyu Bridge was in sight,

211
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:36,627
but there were no boats.

212
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:40,027
Besides, Ishihama Bridge just ahead of Shigure Bridge

213
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,227
has a water gate right behind it.

214
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:45,927
I don't think you'll get the impression of it being a small bridge.

215
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,427
I see.

216
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:50,027
The next bridge is already Hamazono Bridge

217
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:51,927
so I'm sure that there's no doubt that the metallic sound

218
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,927
was heard at Shigure Bridge.

219
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,727
But, I wonder if that metallic sound

220
00:14:57,727 --> 00:15:00,027
has anything to do with the case we're dealing with now?

221
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:02,027
Inspector Megure.

222
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,427
This was found near the water of Heikyu Bridge.

223
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:07,827
That's...

224
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,327
Mr. Mouri,

225
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,027
is this the briefcase?

226
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:16,827
No mistake, that's it!

227
00:15:16,827 --> 00:15:19,627
Open it and confirm the inside too.

228
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,227
May take a look?

229
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:33,827
Pops, the cloth of the lid of the briefcase is ripped.

230
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,027
What?

231
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:37,527
According to forensics,

232
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:38,927
just as Conan has mentioned,

233
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,927
the inside of the lid has been ripped off,

234
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:42,327
and further inside,

235
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:45,727
there seems to be a trace of something having been rigged onto it.

236
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:46,727
What?

237
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:49,227
Then, does that mean that the culprit used whatever it was

238
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:51,427
that was rigged on to it, to take the briefcase?

239
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:54,627
No, we don't know that yet...

240
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:58,427
Mr. Mouri?

241
00:15:58,427 --> 00:15:59,827
Dad.

242
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,027
Inspector.

243
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,527
I've figured out how the culprit had taken the briefcase.

244
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:05,627
Mouri.

245
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:07,927
He's not nasal anymore?

246
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,127
Rats.

247
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:12,027
It flashed upon me, that my nose suddenly unplugged.

248
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,727
Never mind that, but inspector...

249
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:18,627
The culprit probably used a strong magnet.

250
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,327
Magnet?

251
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,127
The characteristic of Ooyoko River

252
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:25,227
is that the water level greatly changes during high and low tide.

253
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:28,627
The distance between the bridge becomes very narrow.

254
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:30,427
The culprit probably checked the time

255
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:34,027
that the water level rises beforehand

256
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:38,527
and rigged a strong magnet onto the lid of the briefcase.

257
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,727
By doing so, when the cruiser sails

258
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:43,027
under the extremely narrow space of the bridge...

259
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,327
Wait a minute.

260
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:48,027
There are many bridges,

261
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:50,227
so there's no way of telling which bridge it would attach too, no?

262
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:56,027
No. So the culprit used an electromagnet

263
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,127
that would generates magnetic force at his convenience.

264
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,627
The electromagnet that is made by wrapping

265
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,927
a coil around a magnetic material generates magnetic force

266
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:07,227
only when electric current is applied to the coil.

267
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,427
The culprit probably embedded in the lid of the briefcase

268
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:13,027
an iron bar wrapped with coil and a battery.

269
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:17,727
Then, he installed a remote control switch that enables remote operation.

270
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,527
Finally, after everyone left,

271
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:45,227
he switched off the power and retrieved the briefcase.

272
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:51,327
Okay! Based on Mouri's deduction,

273
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:54,927
re-investigate the vicinity of Ooyoko River and Heikyu River.

274
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:56,027
-Yes, sir. -Yes sir.

275
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,827
Geez, dad...

276
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:04,527
Your cold will get worse if you sleep in a place like this.

277
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:08,527
I wonder why the culprit designated pops?

278
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,027
I wonder...

279
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:13,727
The papers of the cases that pops handled are still here, aren't they?

280
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,727
Yeah, I think they're filed.

281
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:19,827
Maybe we'll be able to figure something out by looking at those files.

282
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:27,227
Maybe that culprit is somebody who has a grudge against dad?

283
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:30,627
Could be.

284
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:45,627
Is anything wrong, Ran?

285
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:47,927
No, it's nothing.

286
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,327
I was just thinking that if it were Shinichi,

287
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:54,227
he would immediately solve a problem like this.

288
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,727
Don't worry.

289
00:18:57,727 --> 00:18:59,827
I'll solve it for you.

290
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,527
Just as would be expected of a member of the Youth Detective Squad.

291
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:06,827
Then, shall we solve it, the two of us, in place of dad?

292
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:07,827
Yes.

293
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,727
The keyword is New Image.

294
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:15,627
I'm sure that it has something to do with New Image and pops.

295
00:20:16,627 --> 00:20:20,527
"Mouri Detective Agency"

296
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:37,927
I found it.

297
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,527
Isn't this it?

298
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,227
This.

299
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:45,027
Satoshi Nishizawa, 32 years old.

300
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:49,927
Mechanic engineer for New Image, an import car dealer.

301
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:53,627
There is a request from Kaori Ida, 37 years old,

302
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,127
to find the person who has been stalking her.

303
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,527
As a result of the investigation,

304
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,527
it becomes apparent that the stalker is Nishizawa.

305
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,827
There was a court order prohibiting him from going close to her.

306
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:07,027
Thus, he was fired.

307
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,527
This is a case of 2 months ago.

308
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:10,727
What's his address?

309
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,727
Fukagawa, Koto ward.

310
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:14,627
Isn't this near Ooyoko River?

311
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:15,627
Yes.

312
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,027
This way.

313
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:57,427
It's that apartment, isn't it?

314
00:22:57,427 --> 00:22:58,427
Yes.

315
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:06,427
Mr. Nishizawa. Are you in?

316
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,027
Mr. Nishizawa!

317
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:12,627
It seems he's not in.

318
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:13,627
Yes.

319
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,027
It's open.

320
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:24,127
Mr. Nishizawa, aren't you home?

321
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:26,927
Mr. Nishizawa!

322
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:32,727
Conan.

323
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:43,827
No, Conan.

324
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:46,127
You shouldn't go into other people's houses without permission.

325
00:23:58,427 --> 00:23:59,927
Wait, Ran.

326
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:01,227
Look.

327
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:03,227
It's all the way up to the brim of the bath tub.

328
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:05,027
Nishizawa committed suicide.

329
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,327
Even if it may not be something too convenient for you?

330
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:11,327
I can see it wasn't an easy job. So, keep it.

331
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:14,727
Well, I'm sure we'll eventually come up with an answer.

332
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:17,627
But, no yellow flower looks to be in sight.

333
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:19,327
I have someone in mind.

334
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:20,627
You mean Nishizawa didn't do it

335
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,427
and he didn't commit suicide?

336
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,727
Next Conan,

337
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:27,927
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 2)"

338
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,627
Next Conan's Hint:

339
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:48,027
"Flower viewing boat".

340
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:49,527
Dad, are you okay?

341
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:51,527
I guess he'd like to run to see cherry blossoms,

342
00:24:51,527 --> 00:24:52,927
but the only thing that's running is his nose.
