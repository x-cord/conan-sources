1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,320
The Red Woman was seriously scary!

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,720
Well, the one who actually attacked wasn't The Red Woman, though.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,020
You can say that again.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,120
I wonder what would've become of us

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,120
if Inspectors Yamato and Morobushi didn't come back then.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,720
Even if the two didn't come,

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,220
I think we could've suppressed her hands down!

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,620
You're really strong after all!

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,420
Aren't you doing anything besides martial arts?

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,920
I was really into Jeet Kune Do when I was a child.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,020
I used to watch the video that my oldest brother used to send me

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,320
until I practically wore it out and trained myself with it!

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,020
Besides, there was also a practice hall in the neighbourhood too.

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,320
As for other sports,

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,920
I just did a bit of everything in PE class.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,320
But after I left for the States when I was in junior high school,

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,620
I played other sports sometimes with my friends over there too.

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,720
There were no practice halls where I went either.

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,420
Really?

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,520
I used to watch a lot of sports with Mom too.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,620
I can also tell that Conan is pretty good

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,720
at playing soccer too, you see.

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,520
Thank you.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,720
Which means your mother is still in the States?

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,820
Yes. Thanks to her being there,

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,320
I end up staying in hotels after coming back to Japan!

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,420
Well, I could've gone to live with my second oldest brother

28
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,520
who's been living in Japan all this time

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,220
but, he didn't want me to do so.

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,020
But living in a hotel?

31
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,820
I'll bet you're a girl that comes from a rich family or something?

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,820
My father's friend that's been taking care of us from before is rich.

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,220
Well, not as rich as your family, though, Sonoko.

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,820
I know of no other relative that I can depend on.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,620
Besides, I'm thinking

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,320
that I'd have to repay him when I grow up!

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,220
If she has only two older brothers and herself,

38
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,720
and know nothing of her relatives...

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,620
Who was that girl

40
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,520
that resembled Sera that I saw on her cell?

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,220
Hey, is that hotel near here?

42
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,520
Yes.

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,620
May we go over for a while then?

44
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,920
I'd like to see where you live too, Sera!

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,320
I guess so.

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,520
I guess I'll text mail him then.

47
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,620
I was actually supposed to meet my brother.

48
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,120
Oh, then don't bother.

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,620
It's fine.

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,720
I wanted to tell him directly about The Red Woman case

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,620
so I sort of forced myself onto him.

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,420
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

53
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,320
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,220
A popular novelist is confined to his hotel room.

55
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,420
A romantic novel transforms into a mystery.

56
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,920
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,720
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,920
His name is Detective Conan.

59
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:27,846
"The Romance Novel with the Unexpected Conclusion (Part 1)"

60
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:40,721
This hotel has 50 floors.

61
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:44,746
But, it's not as tall as our Bell Tree Tower.

62
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:45,946
Of course.

63
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:48,346
Because that's the tallest tower in Japan.

64
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:54,046
Well, I'm going to be moving out of here in a while again though.

65
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,646
Is that so.

66
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:10,346
Who were they?

67
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:12,746
Those grumpy looking men.

68
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,246
It seems that they're waiting for the manuscript

69
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:18,146
from a novelist that's being confined to this hotel.

70
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:20,046
If I remember correctly his name was...

71
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:22,746
Keigo Hiura!

72
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:26,546
-"Keigo Hiura (48)" -I'm a so-called writer of romantic novels.

73
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:30,946
I read your books!

74
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:34,046
I'm currently hooked on, "Telephone, Sea and I"

75
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:36,246
Oh, thank you so much!

76
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:37,446
Not at all.

77
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:39,846
You don't have to be meticulous, ok?

78
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:41,346
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:43,146
We'll be going then.

80
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,646
Okay.

81
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:46,446
How about you guys?

82
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,846
Why don't you guys join me for a meal here?

83
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:50,246
I'll bet you're hungry?

84
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,546
But...

85
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,546
We're here for the manuscript.

86
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:55,946
The deadline's closing in too, you see.

87
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:58,846
Oh, come on.

88
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,746
I think I ordered a bit too much food

89
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:03,246
and can't eat all of this by myself.

90
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,846
I'll guess I'll ask for his autograph later.

91
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:10,446
Look at this. You really went all out, didn't you.

92
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,246
No wonder a lot of people

93
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,446
were going in and out of your room.

94
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:19,746
Well, we haven't had lunch yet so it's pretty good timing.

95
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,146
Well, help yourself and dig in.

96
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:24,546
Room service.

97
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,146
Your wine, sir.

98
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:28,446
Here it is. Here it is!

99
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:30,946
Thank you for waiting.

100
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:32,846
This... This is it.

101
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,046
I've been waiting for you!

102
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:37,646
Hey, Mr. Hiura! Don't tell me you plan to drink?

103
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,546
Please put the wine in the decanter over there, will you?

104
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:42,246
Yes, of course.

105
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:44,646
Mr. Hiura.

106
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:47,946
Well, please take it as a token of my appreciation

107
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:50,346
for everything you've done for me so far.

108
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:53,346
Please go ahead and help yourself to your heart's content.

109
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:58,046
My priority is finishing the manuscript of the publishing company

110
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:01,046
that has editors that eat the most!

111
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,646
Come on.

112
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,046
The amount of food eaten?

113
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,646
Just how you going to measure that?

114
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:09,746
I'll just weigh you before and after you've eaten.

115
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:12,546
I've got scales too.

116
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,046
Beika Sushi.

117
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:15,346
Here it is.

118
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,446
There's more food coming?

119
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:21,746
Yes. Pizza, Chinese and doughnuts are on their way.

120
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:24,246
So eat up, will you!

121
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:26,646
While you're eating,

122
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,346
I'm going to take a bath and work over my plot.

123
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:33,946
Make sure you keep close guard

124
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:37,246
so I don't sneak out of this room

125
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:39,846
and get into trouble.

126
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:45,146
What a nice view!

127
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:48,846
It's like you can see that the earth's curvature!

128
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:51,846
This is the 30th floor after all.

129
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:05,246
Conan.

130
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:07,046
That's the bedroom.

131
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:09,946
It's messy, so don't go inside.

132
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:11,246
Is that so?

133
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:14,746
Well, if you want to look at the underwear that I've taken off left as is,

134
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,146
help yourself.

135
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:18,146
I think I'll pass.

136
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:22,146
Hey. Why don't we also get room service too?

137
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:24,246
Like the novelist a while ago!

138
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:25,846
That sounds good!

139
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:29,446
I was just about getting a little hungry too.

140
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:31,446
Then, just as promised,

141
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,946
I'll finish my manuscript in the order that you won.

142
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,246
So wait here!

143
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,846
Yes.

144
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:42,546
I heard that he was a bit weird.

145
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,046
But, he's way beyond that.

146
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:46,546
Well, he was going downhill for a while

147
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:49,946
but, he's picked up his past momentum recently.

148
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:54,646
That's thanks to the woman assistant he hired last year, right?

149
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:56,246
Yes.

150
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:57,846
Chiaki Minazuki!

151
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:02,146
It seems she's reserved a room right below Mr. Hiura's today too.

152
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,746
But, I haven't seen her around if she is.

153
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:07,246
I guess she's finding it hard to come because we're all here.

154
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,846
Since a scandalous article saying that she's his lover just came out too.

155
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:14,946
Come to think of it, our editing room got a blackmail fax,

156
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:19,046
saying that to pull that assistant apart from Mr. Hiura.

157
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:21,646
That came to our office too!

158
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:25,246
Well, he was a handsome novelist in the past.

159
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:28,146
His women fans are still alive and kicking, I guess.

160
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:32,746
Kyogoku's so cute.

161
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:33,846
He is, isn't he?

162
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:36,846
You don't sound like a master of Karate, at all.

163
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:39,546
-If he likes ramen so much... -Afternoon tea at a girls' gathering,

164
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,046
talking about love.

165
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:43,746
I feel kind of out of place here.

166
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:46,646
You don't you have any love stories, Conan?

167
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,746
A love story of a girl

168
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:52,446
that you've met somewhere before that you can't forget.

169
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:55,246
No. I don't.

170
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:58,846
Well... In his case,

171
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:02,646
I'll bet he's head over heels about Ayumi!

172
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:03,646
No way!

173
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,146
I thought it was Ai!

174
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,446
Oh, her?

175
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,746
Hey, which one do you like?

176
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,546
Which one?

177
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,146
I won't tell anybody so tell me, won't you?

178
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,546
I'd really like to know.

179
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:20,846
I'm telling you, it's you.

180
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:23,146
It's already 6 pm, isn't it?

181
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:26,946
Oh no! I've got to home and make dinner!

182
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:30,646
That brat got away.

183
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,146
See you later, then.

184
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:33,846
Thank you so much today

185
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,646
-Sure. -Hey, ma'am?

186
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,646
Ma'am, are you all right?

187
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:39,646
Ma'am!

188
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:43,246
The clear echoing of this voice.

189
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,646
It's coming from the floor below!

190
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,346
Oh, wait.

191
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,246
Wait up, I tell you.

192
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:07,022
Ma'am! Ma'am!

193
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,582
Are you all right, Ms. Minazuki?

194
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:11,082
Ms. Minazuki?

195
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:15,182
A ligature mark on her neck as if she were strangled by a rope like thing.

196
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:19,882
Defensive scratch marks made when she was strangled.

197
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:21,382
-Killed by strangulation! -Killed by strangulation!

198
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:24,582
Who are you two?

199
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:27,582
Her chin is starting to stiffen.

200
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:30,882
She's been dead about two to three hours.

201
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:33,482
Ms. Minazuki?

202
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:34,882
What happened?

203
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:36,482
What on earth happened?

204
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:38,282
Oh, Sir!

205
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,082
There you are!

206
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:43,382
You said you were going out just a bit to buy cigarettes and yet.

207
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:48,482
Ms. Minazuki was found lying on the ground in front of her room.

208
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:52,082
Minazuki, you mean your assistant?

209
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:54,682
She was killed.

210
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,382
Someone strangled her to death.

211
00:11:57,382 --> 00:12:00,482
-What? -What? Impossible. Why?

212
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:04,182
Maybe it has something to do with that fax.

213
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:08,382
We got a fax this morning saying,

214
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:11,882
"If you don't make his assistant quit, you're going to pay for it".

215
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:14,382
Why didn't you tell me that?

216
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:18,182
You had all the time in the world to tell me, didn't you?

217
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:22,182
You mean, I was unaware of what was happening to her

218
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:25,982
and just writing my romance novel?

219
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,382
I see.

220
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:33,682
The killer is...

221
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:34,982
That guy.

222
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,082
Champagne?

223
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:52,482
When you brought the champagne that he ordered,

224
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:54,582
you found this corpse, eh?

225
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:56,482
Yes, sir.

226
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:59,982
I brought it over because I was told to deliver it at 6 pm sharp.

227
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:02,282
The card key of the door was inserted through the door

228
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,882
and the door was slightly opened.

229
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:05,882
I opened the door wondering what was wrong.

230
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:09,282
Then, I found her lying on the ground.

231
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:10,682
What's the victim's identity?

232
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:12,482
Yes, sir. Her name is...

233
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,382
Chiaki Minazuki.

234
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,982
She was a very efficient assistant of mine.

235
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:20,082
I think she was going to turn 30 years old this year.

236
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:21,982
Who are you?

237
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:24,282
I am novelist, Keigo Hiura.

238
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:27,382
I'm the one who ordered that champagne too.

239
00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:30,082
Oh, so you ordered the champagne?

240
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:31,482
Yes, sir.

241
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:36,082
I reserved a room right above here to do some writing.

242
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,882
Since I was scheduled to finish about 6 pm,

243
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:42,382
so I was planning to have a toast with her.

244
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:45,282
But, I had no idea that something like this was happening to her

245
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,682
during the time I was writing.

246
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:51,382
Which means you came here because you finished writing your manuscript?

247
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:54,882
No, I was having a tough time trying to finish the last page.

248
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:56,482
Just about 30 minutes ago,

249
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,682
I decided to get some air while getting cigarettes

250
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:01,482
and think about what to write at the same time.

251
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:05,582
After buying my cigarettes at the vending machine two floors down,

252
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:07,782
and as I was going up the stairs,

253
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:12,982
I heard the bellboy scream and rushed over.

254
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:17,982
Then all you were doing back then was walking around, right?

255
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:23,282
How did you know she was killed when you were writing your novel?

256
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:26,982
It could've been that she had just been killed, and yet.

257
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:31,082
It's true that when the body was found,

258
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:33,682
her chin had begun to stiffen.

259
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:37,582
I think that two to three hours had passed since she died.

260
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:41,682
You didn't even touch the corpse and yet you knew,

261
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:43,182
maybe you should shift

262
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:47,382
from being a love novel writer to a mystery writer?

263
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:48,982
How about it?

264
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:51,182
She didn't come to my room.

265
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,382
She was supposed to have brought materials over to my room

266
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:58,982
two to three hours ago,

267
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,382
but she didn't come.

268
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,982
When I saw her body,

269
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:08,882
I just automatically thought that she'd been killed.

270
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:13,682
And is it true that she'd been killed two to three hours ago?

271
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:14,782
Yes, sir.

272
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:16,282
According to the coroner,

273
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,782
the estimated time of death is two and a half hours

274
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:20,182
before the body was found.

275
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:23,982
She seems to have been strangled to death around 3:30 pm.

276
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:26,282
Isn't that just around the time

277
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:28,882
all of you were having lunch in my room?

278
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:31,382
Yes. We started around just after 3 pm.

279
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:32,782
You are?

280
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,182
I'm from Nichiuri Publishing Company,

281
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:37,882
and an editor that is in charge of Mr. Hiura.

282
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:41,582
Since Mr. Hiura seems to have ordered more food than he could eat,

283
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:43,582
I was in Mr. Hiura's room eating lunch

284
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:46,582
with two other editors from different companies.

285
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:49,982
Were you writing a total of three manuscripts?

286
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:50,982
Yes.

287
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,482
The deadlines for all of them turned out to be the same day.

288
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:56,582
So, I decided to finish my manuscript

289
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,882
based on the amount of food each editor ate.

290
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:01,982
Which means Mr. Hiura ate with all of you too?

291
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:05,282
No, he went to take a bath

292
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:07,982
while we were eating saying that he wanted to think up a plot.

293
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,282
That's right.

294
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:12,582
Then, maybe you could've snuck out of the room.

295
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:14,182
No way!

296
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:18,182
Several people brought deliveries after that too,

297
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,982
but from the table where we were eating at,

298
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:23,482
the front door was in clear view.

299
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,282
We paid for things in his place too.

300
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:30,582
I don't think that he went near the front door while we were eating.

301
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:33,482
Until about what time were you eating?

302
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:35,682
Until about 4:30 pm.

303
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:38,682
After eating and leaving Mr. Hiura's room,

304
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:40,582
we waited for him in front of the elevator

305
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,082
where the door of Mr. Hiura's room was in clear view.

306
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,182
But, the only time Mr. Hiura came out of his room was

307
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:49,882
when he came to give the editor in charge his completed manuscript.

308
00:16:49,882 --> 00:16:52,682
As soon as he handed over the manuscript, he went right back.

309
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:55,482
I don't think he could've snuck out.

310
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:59,482
Which means you finished all your manuscript in short amount of time?

311
00:16:59,482 --> 00:17:03,782
Yes. Because all of them were more or less completed already.

312
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:05,582
However, as I mentioned a while ago,

313
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:07,582
as for the third manuscript,

314
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:10,182
"Telephone, Sea and I" that he was in charge of,

315
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,482
I was stuck at the last scene.

316
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:17,482
I gave him all the pages except the last page at a little past 5:30 pm,

317
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:20,382
and went out to buy cigarettes.

318
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:23,682
I figured he could read them while he was waiting.

319
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:25,282
Right?

320
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,482
Yes.

321
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:29,282
He went to the stairs holding a wallet.

322
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,682
You didn't take the elevator?

323
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:33,882
Taking the stairs help inspire me.

324
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:35,882
Besides, it's good exercise.

325
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:39,382
And while I was reading Mr. Hiura's manuscript,

326
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:42,282
I heard the bellboy scream.

327
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:45,682
Mr. Hiura called to tell me that something seems to have happened

328
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:47,282
on the floor below.

329
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,482
When I got here,

330
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:52,482
Mr. Hiura and the others were standing in front of the room.

331
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,782
I see.

332
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:58,282
Do you know of anyone who would've had something against Ms. Minazuki?

333
00:17:58,282 --> 00:18:00,782
The blackmail fax!

334
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:04,182
I'm sure the culprit's the one who sent that!

335
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:06,082
Blackmail fax?

336
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:09,382
We received one at our editor's office this morning too.

337
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:11,782
It said, "If you don't make Assistant Minazuki quit,

338
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,782
you're going to pay for it".

339
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:16,282
We tried checking where it came from

340
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:19,882
but it seems to have been sent from a convenience store somewhere.

341
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,082
But, why would such a blackmail fax be sent?

342
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:26,282
It's because a picture of me walking with her was taken by a magazine

343
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:28,982
with the headline, "A Lover's Scandal".

344
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,682
Thanks to that, my wife went back to her parent's place.

345
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:36,082
Mr. Hiura's novels consist mainly of genuine or platonic love,

346
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,782
and his fans are mostly women readers who hate illicit affairs.

347
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:43,782
How intimate were you really with Ms. Minazuki?

348
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:45,982
We had nothing going on between us.

349
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:48,782
She was an efficient assistant

350
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,582
that had ideas flowing out like running water.

351
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:54,382
She earnestly helped me with the novel, "Telephone, Sea and I",

352
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:57,082
that it could be called her work,

353
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:59,382
instead of mine.

354
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:02,282
I was thinking of introducing her as a novelist next year

355
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:05,382
so she could stand on her own two feet, but how unfortunate.

356
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:09,282
How unfortunate. Why?

357
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,782
Why was she...

358
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:41,382
We, the police will take things from here now,

359
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:44,882
so Conan and Sera, you two can head home.

360
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:49,582
Well, we may have to interrogate you later though.

361
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,982
Yes, sir.

362
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,682
Look at those spectators.

363
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:01,982
Since when did they crowd up like this?

364
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:15,482
Excuse me. Please let me through.

365
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:21,182
Where is she?

366
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:22,482
Where did she go?

367
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:29,982
Why are you scowling like that, Conan?

368
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:32,382
Didn't you see a girl?

369
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:34,682
A girl?

370
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:36,282
Sonoko, did you see a girl?

371
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:38,282
-I don't think so. -There is!

372
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:40,382
She was here in the crowd.

373
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,882
A girl who looked a lot like Sera. About Junior High School.

374
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:47,582
A Junior High School girl who looks like Sera?

375
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:51,282
But, she said that she has no sisters.

376
00:21:51,282 --> 00:21:53,782
Maybe you saw someone else?

377
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,382
I didn't make a mistake!

378
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:00,482
I'm sure I saw her.

379
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:02,082
The girl that was on her cell phone

380
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:06,282
that looked just like Sera.

381
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:07,982
Who on earth is that girl?

382
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:20,282
No joke?

383
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:23,082
The novelist Mr. Hiura is a murderer?

384
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:24,882
Really?

385
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:27,282
Yes. Most likely.

386
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:28,482
But...

387
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:31,982
If I remember correctly, didn't he have an alibi?

388
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:34,182
Back then, he was in his room

389
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:36,582
and the editors were keeping an eye on him.

390
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:39,482
Yes. That's why in order to shatter it,

391
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:42,382
we need to think of a way to get into the victim's room

392
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:45,082
that is one floor down.

393
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:47,882
After all, this is the 30th floor.

394
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:52,282
It's too scary to use a rope and enter from the veranda.

395
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:53,282
If the editors were eating lunch

396
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:56,482
in the living room where the front door was in view,

397
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:59,482
the veranda would've been in clear view,

398
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,982
Right, Conan?

399
00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:09,582
You think so, don't you, Conan?

400
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:11,782
Oh, yes.

401
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,482
Oh, no!

402
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:19,482
I forgot about making dinner!

403
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,182
I've got to call Dad!

404
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:24,382
I think Mr. Mouri's outraged by now.

405
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:27,682
Grudge over food is horrors, you know.

406
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:29,682
Hello, Dad?

407
00:23:30,782 --> 00:23:31,882
I'm sorry!

408
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:36,882
I was over at Sera's place and an incident occurred, you see.

409
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,982
It's no lie!

410
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:46,082
The caps for the shampoo and hair conditioner are gone?

411
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:48,982
We only came through the front door, you know?

412
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:52,282
Then, did you two knock the table down too?

413
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:55,782
There were many people who brought deliveries, right?

414
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,182
Yes.

415
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:59,582
How do you suppose I took the corpse

416
00:23:59,582 --> 00:24:03,782
to the room below from this room?

417
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:07,382
Right, that's was his purpose!

418
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:08,982
Next Conan,

419
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:12,882
"The Romance Novel with the Unexpected Conclusion (Part 2)"
