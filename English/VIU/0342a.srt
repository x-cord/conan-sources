1
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,033
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:06,133
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:07,633
Today's episode is a 60 minutes long special.

4
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:09,633
The bell of crime tolls at Huis Ten Bosch.

5
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,133
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:13,033
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:15,134
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:01,434
"Wide Map of Huis Ten Bosch."

9
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:04,534
Wedding at Huis Ten Bosch.

10
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:06,685
It's so romantic.

11
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:10,885
I've always wanted to go to Huis Ten Bosch.

12
00:02:10,886 --> 00:02:14,585
But, Sonoko, are you sure it was okay

13
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,885
for us to come along, too?

14
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,285
Are you sure it's not going to inconvenience anyone?

15
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:22,385
It's okay because I'd be bored if I went alone,

16
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:23,585
and besides, just in case something happens,

17
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:26,086
you're nice to have around.

18
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:29,285
In case something happens?

19
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:30,885
Well, this wedding

20
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:34,386
seems to have had a lot of hassles before it came to be.

21
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:41,085
But, Shinya and I have been friends since we just started walking.

22
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:42,685
And there was even a time

23
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:45,385
when people were thinking of getting us to marry each other.

24
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,185
It's not only because of that,

25
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:50,986
but I really want him to attain the happiness he deserves.

26
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:54,485
You're cool, Sonoko.

27
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,986
Drinks?

28
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,185
Conan, would you like anything to drink?

29
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:01,585
Yes.

30
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,585
Excuse me!

31
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:04,785
Yes.

32
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:08,485
I think I'll have...

33
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:11,385
-Excuse me, oolong tea please. -Please give me oolong tea.

34
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:12,386
Yes.

35
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:20,385
I'm sorry, but this is the last can of oolong tea that is left.

36
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:22,685
Then, go ahead and take it, sonny!

37
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:26,585
No, you order the drink faster than me, so you can have it.

38
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:27,586
Really?

39
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,586
Thank you for letting me have it.

40
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,185
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:35,285
Please give me one of those paper cups.

42
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:36,886
Okay.

43
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:45,186
Here you go, sonny.

44
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,785
Thank you!

45
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:51,385
Thank you so much.

46
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:52,386
No problem.

47
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,285
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:56,285
Coffee and tea, any orders for drinks?

49
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,885
"Junichi Takahashi (27)" -Sister and brother traveling together?

50
00:03:57,886 --> 00:03:59,585
How nice.

51
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:02,585
No, we are not siblings.

52
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:05,185
I wonder why each time I invite Ran to come with me,

53
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:09,585
this kid with the glasses tags along, too?

54
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:12,185
Sonoko, would you like a sip?

55
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,985
It can't be helped,

56
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:18,085
because if I'm not around, Conan won't be able to eat his meals.

57
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:19,186
Right?

58
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,485
Hey, Sonoko.

59
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:25,285
Gosh, what's bugging you?

60
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:27,386
I guess I'll try to stay off her nerves at least just for today.

61
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:41,286
"The Bride of Huis Ten Bosch."

62
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:47,886
"Huis Ten Bosch Station."

63
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:55,486
You...

64
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:57,885
You're the one we met in the Bullet train.

65
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:59,885
Well, what a coincidence.

66
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:02,085
So, you're all going to Huis Ten Bosch, too.

67
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:03,086
Yes.

68
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:05,285
Are you sightseeing alone?

69
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:08,985
Yes, please don't look at me with such sympathetic eyes.

70
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:11,685
Then, why don't you come with us?

71
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,085
-Is it okay? -Sure.

72
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:16,185
How delightful to be able to go around together

73
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:17,885
with cute girls like you.

74
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,685
Are you sure you don't mind?

75
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,486
But, the escort fee is expensive.

76
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:25,385
Only joking. Just kidding.

77
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:28,186
-You really surprised me. -Come off it, Sonoko.

78
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:32,586
How much longer are you guys going to take?

79
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:38,385
We're really at Huis Ten Bosche, aren't we?

80
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:39,985
It's so spacious.

81
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:43,386
It sure doesn't look like we're in Japan.

82
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,486
Sonoko!

83
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:58,185
There they are! Shinya, long time no see!

84
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,985
Thank you for coming all the way out here.

85
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:03,985
It's okay because I came to go sightseeing while I'm here, too.

86
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:06,285
She's my best friend, Ran and he's Conan.

87
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:08,785
I'm Ran Mouri, how do you do?

88
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,285
I'm Conan.

89
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,985
I'm Shinya Ohga.

90
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:14,285
She's my fiance, Akane.

91
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:17,486
I'm Akane Katori. Nice to meet you.

92
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:22,686
What a beautiful girl.

93
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:27,685
I'll be on my way then.

94
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,586
Thank you so very much.

95
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,185
Who is he?

96
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,485
His name is Mr. Takahashi,

97
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:38,085
and he's someone we got to know on the train.

98
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:40,586
Let's go now.

99
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,286
Look, there's a windmill!

100
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:56,286
This is Delft Bridge.

101
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:00,186
Look, there's a swan.

102
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:03,685
How graceful.

103
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:05,785
It's like we've really come to Holland.

104
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:07,786
I'd really love to go.

105
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:11,385
Now you know why me and my family

106
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,285
chose to have our wedding here, don't you?

107
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:15,185
You should have your wedding here

108
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:16,985
at Huis Ten Bosch too, Sonoko.

109
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,986
What? I'm still in high school.

110
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:23,985
But, I'll think about it when the time comes.

111
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,485
Hey, how far in the future is that?

112
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:30,586
"Hotel Europe."

113
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:41,485
Dad, I brought Sonoko and her friends along.

114
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:42,685
Hello, Miss Sonoko.

115
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:46,686
Thank you so much for coming all this way just for us.

116
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:49,685
Oh, my. How you've grown, Sonoko.

117
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:50,885
I'll bet you're tired.

118
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,185
No, not at all, Mrs. Ohga.

119
00:07:52,186 --> 00:07:55,685
I'm not at all tired, because I'm young.

120
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:56,986
Oh, my.

121
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:02,085
This is my best friend, Ran, and he is Conan.

122
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:04,485
I accepted Sonoko's kind offer and came along.

123
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:06,385
Nice to meet you.

124
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,485
"Mika Ohga (29)" -I was just thinking...

125
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:11,485
"Shinya's sister" -that it was kind of sad with so little attendance,

126
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:13,785
because it seems that nobody will be attending

127
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:15,385
from the bride's side.

128
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:19,086
Come, Mika, don't talk like that in front of our guests.

129
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:22,985
"Tae Ohga (78)" -Miss Sonoko.

130
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,785
"Shinya's grandmother" -Is Chairman Suzuki doing well?

131
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:28,285
Yes, he's just fine and playing golf every day.

132
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,785
You seem to be doing really well yourself, Grandma Tae.

133
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:32,985
Thank you.

134
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:35,285
Since I have no successor

135
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:38,885
that I can rely on and entrust the Ohga Financial Group to,

136
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:42,486
I've got to stay healthy and keep on working.

137
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:53,486
"Carillon Symphonica."

138
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:11,085
Hey, Ran! Do you think this would look nice on Mr. Kyogyoku?

139
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:13,685
They're all okay.

140
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,285
I wonder if Shinichi had one like this?

141
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:17,786
Oh, brother.

142
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,085
Here goes, Conan!

143
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,586
Okay!

144
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:39,686
"Stad Huis."

145
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:45,585
Hi, there.

146
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,085
Did you already go take a look at the Glass Museum?

147
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,286
No. I just got here, too.

148
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:59,686
Sonoko, it's Grandma Tae and Ms. Mika.

149
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:03,985
Grandma likes antique glass.

150
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:06,685
Conan, take a look at this.

151
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,685
17th Century, it says.

152
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:11,985
So glass has been around from that long ago.

153
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,185
In Egypt, they seem to have been

154
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:18,185
making glass decorations since 3000 A.D.

155
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:20,885
It's been around from that long ago.

156
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,685
During the time of the Roman Empire,

157
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:25,185
the blown glass method was invented,

158
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:27,885
and it's also said that they even had window glasses.

159
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:29,385
Really?

160
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:31,386
You're quite knowledgeable, aren't you?

161
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:37,485
Well, I'm a glass craftsman from Hotaru, Hokkaido.

162
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,985
I took time off from work,

163
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,785
and came here wanting to see the glassworks of Nagasaki.

164
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,285
I see.

165
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:45,685
My liking for glass

166
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,185
developed into my having a glass workshop in the city.

167
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:52,885
What do you say, we have dinner together tonight?

168
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:56,485
I'd like to hear about glass in Hotaru, too.

169
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,785
I would like to by all means if you don't mind.

170
00:10:58,786 --> 00:10:59,885
My name is Takahashi.

171
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:03,285
"Dom Tower."

172
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,085
How tall.

173
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:07,085
The town is like a toy!

174
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:10,285
What a nice view.

175
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,985
Aren't you afraid?

176
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:15,885
I always used to like high places.

177
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:20,585
See, the people walking below look like swarming ants.

178
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:23,086
Doesn't it just make you feel so good?

179
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:53,585
This is Mr. Takahashi, a glass craftsman from Hotaru.

180
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:57,586
I invited him over because I wanted to hear his story on glass.

181
00:11:58,586 --> 00:11:59,985
I'm Takahashi.

182
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,185
I'm Ohga.

183
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,385
My son, Shinya's wedding is tomorrow,

184
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,685
and that's why we're all spending the night here.

185
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:07,285
You're most welcome.

186
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,885
"Hideo Mochida (53)" -I never thought it'd be Shinya...

187
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:11,685
"Shinya's uncle" -that would end up marrying first.

188
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:14,685
Mika, he beat you to it, didn't he?

189
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:17,886
That's because I don't buy cheap stuff.

190
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,085
Oh, right. Mr. Takahashi,

191
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:26,185
I'd like to invite you to attend tomorrow's wedding.

192
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:28,485
But, I really shouldn't...

193
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:31,385
You're more than welcome to.

194
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:35,785
Shinya will have to shoulder the Ohga Finance Group in the future.

195
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:39,485
I'm sure that attending the wedding will not be a loss to you, too.

196
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:40,885
How can I attend the wedding?

197
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,086
I'm just a glass craftsman...

198
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,585
Yes, I'll accept your invitation and attend the wedding with honor.

199
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,286
Thank you.

200
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:55,486
Akane, wear this at your wedding tomorrow.

201
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:05,185
This is a ring that has been handed down for generations

202
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:06,785
to the wives of the Ohga family.

203
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,585
The founding president who started a shipping industry

204
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,285
at the beginning of the Meiji Era gave this to his wife

205
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,285
when he first went to Europe.

206
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:16,185
Thank you very much.

207
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,886
Thank you, mother.

208
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:21,286
Maybe it's too soon to give it to her yet.

209
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:25,185
But, I also received it from you

210
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:27,985
and wore it to the wedding.

211
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:30,985
It's because in your case, everyone had viewed you

212
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:34,786
as being the right person as the wife of the family head, to begin with.

213
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:36,985
The only time the ring is to be handed down,

214
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,085
is when the bride is approved of

215
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,685
as becoming a member of the Ohga family.

216
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:46,786
Which means you all don't approve of Akane as being my wife?

217
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:53,886
Well, she can wear it during the wedding ceremony, though.

218
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:02,886
It seems like we've been invited to a hassle wedding.

219
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,245
What the hell was that?

220
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:19,845
Is that how the family of somebody

221
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,745
who is going to have a sacred wedding tomorrow supposed to act?

222
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:24,745
What the hell's going on, Sonoko?

223
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:27,045
I told you that they went through a bit of a hassle

224
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,745
before the wedding was decided, didn't I?

225
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:32,845
Sonoko, why is that grandmother so mean to Ms. Akane?

226
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:35,545
Shinya declared that if they didn't approve

227
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:38,545
of him marrying Ms. Akane, he would leave home.

228
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,545
So, it seems the Ohga family all reluctantly approved.

229
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,745
But Ms. Akane is such a nice person.

230
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:46,946
The family of a financial group has all kinds of hassles.

231
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,245
What? You mean they don't like her family lineage?

232
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:52,545
And it seems grandma doesn't like the fact

233
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:54,545
that she's two years older than him either.

234
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:58,346
That's nonsense. There's no reason to be mean to her.

235
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:02,046
Hey, the show's started!

236
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,545
Ran, I'm going to go over that side and watch.

237
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,046
Be careful, okay?

238
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:27,945
Gosh.

239
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:31,446
It sure is inconvenient to have a small body at times like these.

240
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:40,246
That's Ms. Akane and Mr. Takahashi?

241
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:57,946
"Palace Huis Ten Bosch."

242
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:09,645
Ms. Akane, you look fantastic.

243
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:11,545
You can say that again. You look just marvelous.

244
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,345
Ms. Akane, make sure you throw me the bouquet

245
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:16,246
after the wedding ceremony, okay? Please, promise now.

246
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,745
All right, I'm not sure if I'll be able to aim right,

247
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,446
but I'll try my best.

248
00:16:26,146 --> 00:16:28,445
Only an hour more to go before the wedding.

249
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,046
Ms. Akane is so beautiful!

250
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:38,445
Hey, Shinya, how about a word to the bride?

251
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:39,646
Yes.

252
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:45,546
You look really dazzling.

253
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:49,745
Talk about hot, hot.

254
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:52,145
Come on, Sonoko.

255
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:57,045
Shinya, how unsightly of you to be entranced by your bride.

256
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:59,746
Stay in your waiting room until it's time for the wedding.

257
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:02,545
Akane.

258
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:06,745
I will take on the role of the bride's father.

259
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:08,346
Thank you so...

260
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:16,846
It's your foot, mister. I think you stepped on this.

261
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:19,145
Is that it?

262
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,646
I'm so sorry, really sorry.

263
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,345
This picture, are they your parents, Ms. Akane?

264
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:31,546
Yes.

265
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:43,546
Grandma!

266
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:48,745
-Grandma! -My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

267
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:51,245
I'll get better after a little rest.

268
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:53,545
Here. Grab my shoulder.

269
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,446
Rest a while till it's time for the ceremony.

270
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:58,345
I wonder if Grandma Tae's okay?

271
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,746
I hope it's nothing serious.

272
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:08,745
I'm fine.

273
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:09,946
But...

274
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:25,445
What's the matter, Conan?

275
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:28,346
Ms. Akane, do you have the ring?

276
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:30,946
No.

277
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,745
The ring is gone.

278
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:41,645
The ring really is...

279
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:44,046
It's gone!

280
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:47,446
What's this?

281
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,845
You're in it, Ms. Akane.

282
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:52,046
Look.

283
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:54,545
If I remember correctly,

284
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:57,745
this is a picture that Shinya took for me

285
00:18:57,746 --> 00:19:00,645
when we came to reserve this wedding hall in June.

286
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:02,245
What does this mean?

287
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:03,446
Beats me.

288
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:10,545
If I lose that ring, how am I going to take responsibility for it?

289
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:12,446
I know I can't simply apologize.

290
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:15,045
Ms. Akane, what're you talking about?

291
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:17,546
It's just a ring after all.

292
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:21,546
Let's all look for it!

293
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,746
What? The ruby ring is lost?

294
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,745
Is that true?

295
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:51,146
Yes.

296
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,946
Call the wedding off!

297
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:58,545
We're calling off this wedding.

298
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:02,745
-What? -There will be no wedding until the ring is found.

299
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:04,745
We can't do that now.

300
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,045
Come now, mother dear.

301
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:10,645
Think about it, Masayo.

302
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,645
Ever since talk of this wedding came around,

303
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,045
bad things have been happening one after the other.

304
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:18,045
And that girl's to blame for everything.

305
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:22,445
To top things off, she loses the ring, which is a family treasure.

306
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:24,946
It's not Akane's fault!

307
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:31,545
What is Akane doing right now?

308
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,245
She says she wants to be alone and is in the waiting room.

309
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,746
I see. She must be in shock.

310
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:41,245
Everyone, it's almost time for the ceremony to begin.

311
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:43,145
Is something wrong?

312
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:45,545
The ruby ring is lost.

313
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:50,445
What? You mean that ring that the founder brought back from Europe?

314
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:54,246
It was definitely there until all of you came.

315
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:58,745
Hey, Shinya, just what are you trying to say?

316
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:02,145
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

317
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:04,145
When Sonoko and her friends came,

318
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:06,845
she says she was sure the ring was there.

319
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:09,345
This means it has to be the work of somebody

320
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,846
who came into the room later, isn't it?

321
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:15,745
It could be that glass craftsman from Hotaru called Takahashi.

322
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:19,545
This picture was left behind in place of the ring.

323
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,845
Since Shinya is the one who took this picture,

324
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:24,845
anybody from the Ohga family

325
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:28,045
could've got hold of it, isn't it?

326
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:30,345
You can't really tell.

327
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:33,545
Akane had the picture too, didn't she?

328
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:37,445
She could've stolen the ring and left the picture behind

329
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:40,045
to make it look as if someone from the Ohga family took it, right?

330
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:41,945
That's nonsense.

331
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,646
Well, no big deal.

332
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:48,645
It doesn't feel good being suspected anyway

333
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:52,345
so let's have them check every nook and cranny of our rooms right away.

334
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:55,345
However, so long as the whereabouts of the ring is unknown,

335
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:58,046
this marriage will be cancelled, understand?

336
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:17,645
The ring's nowhere in sight.

337
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:21,545
It's so small that it can be hidden anywhere, too.

338
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:23,345
Right, Ran?

339
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:24,645
What's the matter, Ran?

340
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:27,745
I'm worried, so I'm going to go see how Ms. Akane is.

341
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:28,746
Ran!

342
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:32,845
What are the bad things that happened

343
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,745
that grandma was talking about?

344
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,945
Oh, that.

345
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:39,645
Recently, there were two incidents

346
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,546
where we experienced close calls.

347
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:49,446
Madam, the brakes aren't working!

348
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:01,146
Madam!

349
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:07,445
The second time was on a clear, fine morning.

350
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:10,546
When I was taking a walk with grandma along Holland Slope near our house.

351
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,046
Look out!

352
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:20,245
Well, we were saved by a hairsbreadth,

353
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:23,545
but losing the ring is the third bad thing that happened,

354
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:26,045
so Grandma Tae is probably fed up.

355
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:27,246
Goodness.

356
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:32,446
Ms. Akane, this is Ran.

357
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:37,546
Ms. Akane.

358
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,345
It's strange.

359
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:53,545
I'm sure that someone who came into the waiting room took it.

360
00:25:53,546 --> 00:25:55,246
Sonoko!

361
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:00,046
Ran.

362
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,645
Ms. Akane is not in the waiting room!

363
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,646
What?

364
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:08,445
The wedding dress was on the chair

365
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:10,445
and Ms. Akane was nowhere in sight.

366
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:15,045
Don't tell me that Ms. Akane put on an act just as Ms. Mika had said,

367
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:17,245
and actually stole the ring herself?

368
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:19,746
Akane's not that kind of person!

369
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,545
Let's go look for her.

370
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:25,345
But what about the ring?

371
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:27,546
Without it, there'll be no wedding.

372
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:33,745
I'm really bothered about the Hydrangea in the picture.

373
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:36,445
Hydrangeas signify "A change of heart".

374
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:40,246
I think we'll find the ring in a place where the Hydrangeas are.

375
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:43,746
Mr. Shinya, what's with the wedding?

376
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:48,345
Well, Ms. Akane disappeared.

377
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:51,745
What? The bride's gone?

378
00:26:51,746 --> 00:26:53,045
Yes.

379
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:56,445
We were just thinking of splitting up and looking for her.

380
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:58,545
I'll help look for her, too.

381
00:26:58,546 --> 00:26:59,645
Thank you.

382
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:01,146
I'll go look for the ring.

383
00:27:05,446 --> 00:27:09,346
Hydrangeas. Where do I look for them?

384
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:11,846
Ms. Akane!

385
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:14,846
Ms. Akane!

386
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:21,145
Hydrangea... Change of heart...

387
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:22,745
Music box?

388
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:24,045
Change of heart...

389
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:25,545
Siebold...

390
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:28,345
Wait a second. I learned of it before.

391
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:32,346
Dr. Siebold is the one who took Japanese plants back to Europe.

392
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:36,846
And, one of the main ones was the Hydrangea.

393
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:45,745
The old scientific name for this flower is Hydrangea otakusa.

394
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:50,446
The name was taken from Siebold's Japanese wife's name, Otaki.

395
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,546
So, that's the story.

396
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:56,445
Hold on.

397
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:58,645
Could it be that Ms. Akane's picture was not about

398
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,846
what the flower signified, but...

399
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:05,645
Otakusa. "Otaki-san".

400
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,245
"Taki". (Taki means waterfall in Japanese)

401
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:08,746
Right!

402
00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:58,246
I found it!

403
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:03,645
"Otaki-san". "Taki". (Taki means waterfall in Japanese)

404
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:04,646
My goodness.

405
00:29:05,546 --> 00:29:08,046
I don't know who hid it, but...

406
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,145
I get it.

407
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:15,346
This fountain is Aphrodite and Psyche.

408
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,745
Ran!

409
00:29:17,746 --> 00:29:18,945
Conan!

410
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:20,345
I found the ring!

411
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:22,145
Really?

412
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:23,945
Is something the matter?

413
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:25,646
Well...

414
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,645
This is...

415
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:32,845
Ms. Akane's high heel shoe!

416
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:36,845
It's not normal for her to go around with just one shoe.

417
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:39,745
I'm sure that she was kidnapped here.

418
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:42,345
We find the ring.

419
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:44,146
And now Ms. Akane's kidnapped?

420
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:38,546
Only one shoe was found by the windmill shed.

421
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:40,745
This is...

422
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:42,145
What's going on?

423
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:44,245
I'm just assuming from the circumstances,

424
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:48,645
but I think she was dragged away against her will.

425
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:51,045
No, do you mean she was abducted?

426
00:31:51,046 --> 00:31:52,545
Don't be ridiculous!

427
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:55,645
I'm sure she couldn't take staying here and fled.

428
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:58,345
I checked at the departure gate of Huis Ten Bosch

429
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:00,945
and found that she hasn't gone outside yet.

430
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:02,645
It seems that Akane in the past

431
00:32:02,646 --> 00:32:06,345
had a man that her parent's had decided she get married to.

432
00:32:06,346 --> 00:32:10,645
I think that she is still seeing that man.

433
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:16,745
And maybe she had planned to embarrass Shinya, to begin with.

434
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:21,045
No way! I know her best!

435
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:23,245
Grandma's right.

436
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:26,345
Shinya, you've been completely deceived.

437
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:28,645
Like they say from long ago, "Love is blind".

438
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:29,646
No!

439
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,845
You're talking about the man that was Akane's father's apprentice.

440
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:36,045
That's an old story that goes back 10 years ago.

441
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:38,045
He left 10 years ago

442
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:41,445
and hasn't contacted her even once, since!

443
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:45,245
Well, without the bride,

444
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:48,145
we can't possibly have the wedding.

445
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,945
After the engagement and all,

446
00:32:49,946 --> 00:32:52,345
if it turns out that the wedding is canceled,

447
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,346
it will be a blow

448
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,245
to the trust that people have in the Ohga Financial Group.

449
00:32:55,246 --> 00:32:58,245
If the wedding is really going to be called off,

450
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:01,145
then Shinya's promotion to Vice-President of the bank

451
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,746
will probably have to be re-considered.

452
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:08,346
Dear.

453
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:12,945
She's slim and her hair is about this long.

454
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:16,645
I think she was wearing a pink one-piece dress.

455
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:18,045
I wonder if you mean her?

456
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:19,545
Have you seen her?

457
00:33:19,546 --> 00:33:23,045
Yes, she went into the windmill shed alone.

458
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:24,745
About what time was it?

459
00:33:24,746 --> 00:33:28,245
It was just about the time I came back from lunch break.

460
00:33:28,246 --> 00:33:29,845
So, maybe around 1 pm.

461
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:31,745
About 1 pm.

462
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:36,345
If in one in a million chances, she was abducted as you say.

463
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:40,445
Are you saying that the one who took her away is here among us?

464
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:42,545
I can't say for sure,

465
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:45,345
but I think the probability is high.

466
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:49,145
How rude! Do you know what you're talking about?

467
00:33:49,146 --> 00:33:51,745
Calm down, Mochida.

468
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:54,945
And just what are you planning to do gathering us together like this?

469
00:33:54,946 --> 00:34:00,745
Ms. Akane was seen going into the windmill shed about 1 pm today

470
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:02,545
by a sales clerk at the cheese store.

471
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:07,245
So, I'd like to know where you were at around 1 pm.

472
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:10,245
Checking for the alibi.

473
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:13,345
I was here adjusting the books.

474
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:16,945
I was here with my wife all the while.

475
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:21,145
Around 1 pm, I was horseback riding in Friesian Horse Land.

476
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:25,945
Since the wedding was cancelled, I was drinking at the lounge here.

477
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:27,245
What about you, Mr. Takahashi?

478
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:29,045
1 pm?

479
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:30,845
I think that's just about the time I went to the Glass Museum again

480
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:33,846
to look at the antique glass.

481
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:35,845
Just as I thought.

482
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:39,445
-Can I borrow it? -Yes, sure.

483
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:41,045
If you want the pictures that are in it,

484
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,145
they'll print it out for you at the front desk.

485
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:45,046
Okay!

486
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:47,646
Thank you.

487
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:51,145
May I ask you something, Mr. Mochida?

488
00:34:51,146 --> 00:34:52,146
What is it?

489
00:34:52,147 --> 00:34:55,345
Is there something special about Ms. Akane's family?

490
00:34:55,346 --> 00:35:00,045
Her father used to be a renowned glass craftsman in Nagasaki,

491
00:35:00,046 --> 00:35:02,446
but passed away 10 years ago.

492
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:05,045
Anything else?

493
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:07,445
There are rumors that he committed suicide

494
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:09,545
because Ohga Bank pressured him

495
00:35:09,546 --> 00:35:11,245
to return the money that we financed him.

496
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:12,445
Suicide?

497
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:16,845
The glass workshop that grandma owns in the city used to be his.

498
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:19,245
Grandma bought the workshop

499
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:21,345
that the bank forfeited as collateral.

500
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:22,745
She wanted the workshop,

501
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,045
so she pressured him to return the money

502
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:27,245
and got a hold of the workshop.

503
00:35:27,246 --> 00:35:30,345
That is what some people say, but that's wrong.

504
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:33,246
All we did was carry out a legal transaction.

505
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:35,745
Well...

506
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:38,745
Yes. This person came.

507
00:35:38,746 --> 00:35:44,845
He was drinking beer alone right through for about an hour.

508
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:47,045
Yes, I remember her.

509
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:50,045
She seemed to have really liked it and rode twice.

510
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:52,746
Oh, I see. Thank you so much.

511
00:35:57,846 --> 00:36:00,346
This isn't the place. It's more to the back.

512
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:04,245
Here? The long hand fits.

513
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,745
So it's 3:05 pm now.

514
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:07,746
Wait a second.

515
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:11,145
Which means that this picture was taken not at 1 pm sharp,

516
00:36:11,146 --> 00:36:12,645
but rather at 2:05 pm.

517
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:13,845
Since it's a faceless clock,

518
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,545
when the long hand and the shorthand overlaps,

519
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:18,146
it looks to be 1 pm sharp.

520
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,246
I thought something was wrong.

521
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:23,445
If the abductor abducted her at the windmill shed at 1 pm,

522
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:26,345
and is here at 2:05 pm.

523
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:28,945
Akane is probably confined somewhere

524
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:33,346
that's not too far away between the windmill shed and the flower clock.

525
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:37,646
I've got to find her quick.

526
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:42,945
You mentioned that you like high places, didn't you?

527
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:44,346
Right.

528
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:47,446
-You mean I get to ride that? -Yes.

529
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:53,446
Gosh. Where is she?

530
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:04,545
The melody sounds strange.

531
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:07,546
I get it! Some bells aren't ringing.

532
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:09,946
Could it be...

533
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:14,445
Aren't you riding?

534
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:16,845
No way. I hate high places

535
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:18,745
and just thinking about it sends chills up my spine.

536
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:20,745
So go ahead and enjoy yourself.

537
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:22,046
And you're still so young.

538
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:54,246
Ms. Akane!

539
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:58,046
Mr. Takahashi's going to kill Grandma Tae.

540
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:01,545
Hello.

541
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,745
Conan.

542
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:05,645
Where's granny? Where's Grandma Tae now?

543
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:07,745
Grandma is...

544
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:10,345
She went to ride the balloon with Mr. Takahashi.

545
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:13,246
Yes, the hot air balloon. Luftballoon.

546
00:38:14,546 --> 00:38:17,046
I feel like a bird.

547
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:47,746
That's...

548
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,645
What's that?

549
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:55,146
A bomb?

550
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:00,646
There he is.

551
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:02,346
We're not going to make it.

552
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,245
What's that?

553
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,945
No! Don't touch it!

554
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:27,245
It's a triggering device that will set off the bomb set up on the balloon!

555
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:28,845
That's why don't touch it!

556
00:41:28,846 --> 00:41:30,446
What?

557
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:40,745
I guess you two saved my life.

558
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:42,846
I'm so glad, grandma.

559
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:47,745
Akane, I'm so glad you're okay.

560
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:49,445
Shinya, I'm so sorry.

561
00:41:49,446 --> 00:41:51,445
Mr. Takahashi...

562
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:53,045
Mr. Takahashi?

563
00:41:53,046 --> 00:41:55,145
Akane, did you know him?

564
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,146
Yes.

565
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,745
What is the meaning of this?

566
00:41:57,746 --> 00:42:00,846
What do you mean grandma was in danger?

567
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:09,146
Sonoko.

568
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:24,445
Sonoko!

569
00:42:24,446 --> 00:42:26,445
I'll explain.

570
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:27,745
What?

571
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:29,245
Sonoko.

572
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:32,045
This entire case to begin with,

573
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:36,445
started with two people with different ideas acting at the same time.

574
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:39,445
Therefore, it looked as if one person was scheming everything.

575
00:42:39,446 --> 00:42:44,745
Grandma Tae, one of them was you, wasn't it?

576
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:46,645
What?

577
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:50,546
Since you were against the marriage between Shinya and Akane.

578
00:42:51,646 --> 00:42:55,545
-Grandmother! -My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

579
00:42:55,546 --> 00:42:57,646
I'll get better after a little rest.

580
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:03,745
Isn't that right, Ms. Mika?

581
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:05,545
How could you do that?

582
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:07,145
Conan, please bring the thing.

583
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:08,446
Okay.

584
00:43:09,646 --> 00:43:12,046
Ms. Akane, here you go.

585
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:15,545
You found the ring!

586
00:43:15,546 --> 00:43:16,546
Thank you.

587
00:43:16,547 --> 00:43:19,145
-Conan. -I wonder where it was found?

588
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:22,045
You know the fountain by Mauritz Square, don't you?

589
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,446
He seems to have found it there.

590
00:43:26,046 --> 00:43:27,545
Leaving it too close to yourself

591
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:30,145
would increase the chances of us finding it when we go looking for it.

592
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:34,345
Since Grandma Tae said so, you hid it at the fountain.

593
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:36,145
Isn't that right, Ms. Mika?

594
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,745
Yes, that's right.

595
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:41,645
Then, what was the picture of the Hydrangea about?

596
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:44,045
I was deceived by that, too.

597
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:46,845
At first because the Hydrangea signifies a change of heart,

598
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:50,045
I thought it was criticizing Ms. Akane for her change of heart.

599
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:52,845
But there was another meaning to that picture.

600
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:54,445
Another meaning?

601
00:43:54,446 --> 00:43:58,145
The water of that fountain flows like that of a waterfall, doesn't it?

602
00:43:58,146 --> 00:43:59,245
Yes.

603
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:01,445
The scientific name that was given to the Hydrangea in the beginning

604
00:44:01,446 --> 00:44:03,845
was Hydrangea otakusa,

605
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:05,845
a name that Siebold had given it.

606
00:44:05,846 --> 00:44:10,445
He called it Otakusa after his wife's name Otaki.

607
00:44:10,446 --> 00:44:14,145
Otakusa. "Otakisan". "Taki" (waterfall), right?

608
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:16,045
-That's what it was. -Yes.

609
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:18,045
Did you know about it?

610
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:19,245
Yes.

611
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:22,645
Although that picture looked to be criticizing Ms. Akane,

612
00:44:22,646 --> 00:44:25,945
it was actually indicating where the ring was hidden.

613
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:27,645
Now you know.

614
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:30,145
The people who stole the ring are

615
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:32,446
grandma and Ms. Mika!

616
00:44:33,646 --> 00:44:38,645
But, Ms. Akane being abducted was a mere coincidence.

617
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:42,045
She felt responsible for losing the ring

618
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,245
and gave up on marrying Shinya.

619
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:47,046
Then, on her own initiative, she decided to disappear.

620
00:44:48,046 --> 00:44:51,646
What happened after that, Ms. Akane?

621
00:44:55,746 --> 00:44:58,545
I went out from the waiting room to the back yard,

622
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:01,045
I coincidentally found Mr. Takahashi

623
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:04,046
and I secretly followed him.

624
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,645
Mr. Takahashi, what are you doing?

625
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:20,545
I'm going to give it to that old lady.

626
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:22,945
Have you forgotten?

627
00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:27,245
Your father passed away all because of that old lady.

628
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:30,645
The one who stole the ring is that woman called Mika, you know.

629
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:31,646
No way.

630
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:34,245
Of course, the old lady told her to do so, though.

631
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:37,645
Please let me go through with what I've planned.

632
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:40,545
And, till Conan came to save me,

633
00:45:40,546 --> 00:45:43,445
I was locked up in Carillon Symphonica.

634
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:45,345
Then he...

635
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:47,645
Yes, he's the one who had been chosen as Ms. Akane's groom in the past

636
00:45:47,646 --> 00:45:49,345
that Grandma Teo was talking about.

637
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,645
What?

638
00:45:50,646 --> 00:45:52,745
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

639
00:45:52,746 --> 00:45:56,845
When I saw Mr. Takahashi yesterday with Sonoko and the others,

640
00:45:56,846 --> 00:45:58,845
I was really surprised

641
00:45:58,846 --> 00:46:00,545
because it's been 10 years since I last saw him.

642
00:46:00,546 --> 00:46:04,045
Ms. Akane, you saw Mr. Takahashi last night, didn't you?

643
00:46:04,046 --> 00:46:07,445
Yes, I asked him why he came.

644
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:13,445
He answered that he came to watch my wedding from afar.

645
00:46:13,446 --> 00:46:15,545
But, I was worried whether he was really telling me the truth

646
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:17,445
and if that was all there was to it.

647
00:46:17,446 --> 00:46:20,745
Mr. Takahashi, isn't it about time you got up?

648
00:46:20,746 --> 00:46:23,346
Just how long do you intend to stay sleeping there?

649
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:28,145
Since when did you realize what was going on?

650
00:46:28,146 --> 00:46:30,745
I thought something was strange to begin with,

651
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,045
because although you said you were from Hotaru,

652
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:35,445
when you saw Ms. Akane in her wedding dress,

653
00:46:35,446 --> 00:46:39,445
you spoke in the Nigasaki dialect and said she was beautiful.

654
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:41,845
You're the one who tampered with the brakes of grandma's car

655
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:44,945
as well as dropped the rock from above the stone wall, right?

656
00:46:44,946 --> 00:46:46,445
Yes, that's right.

657
00:46:46,446 --> 00:46:51,645
Ms. Akane's father was killed by this old lady!

658
00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:54,645
Mister was suddenly pressured to return the money

659
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:55,945
that Ohga Bank had loaned him,

660
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,946
and committed suicide out of desperation.

661
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:02,946
I've never forgotten the miserable sight of her father, not even once.

662
00:47:04,846 --> 00:47:06,245
Mister!

663
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:09,545
Mister, why'd you do this?

664
00:47:09,546 --> 00:47:11,846
How could you leave Akane all alone?

665
00:47:14,246 --> 00:47:15,645
This all happened just because

666
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:19,045
the old lady wanted a glass workshop for her pastime.

667
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:20,345
Just before all this happened,

668
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:23,246
we were gradually losing orders from our big dealers.

669
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:27,345
I went to ask a wholesaler in Hotaru where mister had transactions with,

670
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:29,245
if he knew what was going on.

671
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,345
He finally admitted that he was reducing order to us

672
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:34,245
because he was concerned about Ohga Bank.

673
00:47:34,246 --> 00:47:35,846
Wrong!

674
00:47:37,246 --> 00:47:39,445
Father.

675
00:47:39,446 --> 00:47:42,445
My mother liked Mr. Katori's glassworks.

676
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:45,045
So, wanting him to somehow continue,

677
00:47:45,046 --> 00:47:47,845
she even gave him advice on how to manage the workshop.

678
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:48,846
What?

679
00:47:48,847 --> 00:47:51,245
However, Mr. Katori who was a craftsman through

680
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,145
and through refused to lend an ear.

681
00:47:53,146 --> 00:47:56,545
He insisted saying, "My glasswork is only for those

682
00:47:56,546 --> 00:47:58,245
who see the value in them".

683
00:47:58,246 --> 00:48:00,545
He kept making fantastic glassworks spending time,

684
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:02,845
putting his all into them.

685
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,445
Of course his works were expensive

686
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:07,445
but they were indeed masterpieces.

687
00:48:07,446 --> 00:48:09,545
However, they didn't make out

688
00:48:09,546 --> 00:48:11,645
and he went more and more into the reds.

689
00:48:11,646 --> 00:48:13,145
As a result...

690
00:48:13,146 --> 00:48:16,245
As a result, he started delaying payments for the loan he had with us.

691
00:48:16,246 --> 00:48:17,645
First, he delayed 3 days, a week,

692
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:21,545
then two weeks and so on forth.

693
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:23,745
We're not all that big a bank either,

694
00:48:23,746 --> 00:48:24,746
so we couldn't afford this to go on forever.

695
00:48:24,747 --> 00:48:25,845
That's a lie!

696
00:48:25,846 --> 00:48:27,345
It's not a lie.

697
00:48:27,346 --> 00:48:29,045
It's a lie.

698
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:31,546
It's not a lie, Mr. Takahashi.

699
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:34,145
It's a lie!

700
00:48:34,146 --> 00:48:37,045
Mister isn't such a weak person.

701
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:39,645
He used to sweat from early morning to late at night

702
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:44,545
teaching me, who knew nothing, from A to Z.

703
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:48,445
Grandma, you were against Ms. Akane getting married

704
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:50,445
because you blamed yourself for not being thoughtful enough

705
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:53,645
and driving to Ms. Akane's father suicidal, right?

706
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:57,246
That's why it really hurt for you to look at Ms. Akane, right?

707
00:48:57,946 --> 00:48:59,446
Grandma.

708
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:02,845
So, since Ms. Akane found out

709
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:05,645
that Mr. Takahashi was attempting to kill grandma,

710
00:49:05,646 --> 00:49:08,445
she was locked up.

711
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,645
I know it's not something that can be forgiven.

712
00:49:11,646 --> 00:49:16,145
But please forgive Mr. Takahashi.

713
00:49:16,146 --> 00:49:17,346
Akane.

714
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:19,445
Grandma.

715
00:49:19,446 --> 00:49:20,945
Please, I beg you.

716
00:49:20,946 --> 00:49:22,445
-Grandma. -Chairwoman!

717
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:25,845
Mochida, about playing the role of the father of the bride,

718
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:27,145
although he's quite young yet,

719
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:30,445
why don't we have Mr. Takahashi do it?

720
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:33,445
Of course, I totally agree.

721
00:49:33,446 --> 00:49:34,845
Grandma.

722
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:38,245
Then, you're approving of them getting married?

723
00:49:38,246 --> 00:49:41,045
The ring was found, so most naturally.

724
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:42,845
Oh, I'm glad!

725
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,645
Grandma had intended things to turn out this way, to begin with.

726
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:46,646
What?

727
00:49:46,647 --> 00:49:48,145
She was intending to approve of their marriage

728
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:51,045
when the ring was found.

729
00:49:51,046 --> 00:49:53,745
How do you know?

730
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:58,145
The sculpture of that fountain is Aphrodite and Psyche.

731
00:49:58,146 --> 00:50:03,345
Aphrodite jealous of Psyche who had fallen in love with her son, Eros,

732
00:50:03,346 --> 00:50:06,245
gives Psyche many trials to accomplish.

733
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:08,545
However, she finally approves both to see through their love

734
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:12,445
after Psyche accomplishes everything that was dished out to her.

735
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:16,545
That fountain describes this final scene.

736
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,145
Grandma knew of this Greek mythology

737
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:21,945
and had the ring hidden there.

738
00:50:21,946 --> 00:50:23,845
She even deliberately left the picture of the Hydrangeas behind as a hint,

739
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:27,245
pointing to "Taki", Siebold's wife,

740
00:50:27,246 --> 00:50:29,446
isn't that right, grandma?

741
00:50:30,446 --> 00:50:34,945
It' so full of western letters that I have no idea what it's about.

742
00:50:34,946 --> 00:50:37,445
-Oh, my. -Just as expected of you, grandma.

743
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:40,046
When things get inconvenient for you, you try to brush it off.

744
00:50:59,246 --> 00:51:01,545
I do.

745
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:03,745
Do you promise

746
00:51:03,746 --> 00:51:05,545
to love him?

747
00:51:05,546 --> 00:51:07,246
I do.

748
00:52:03,446 --> 00:52:06,946
I'm supposed to get married to Mr. Kyogoku!

749
00:52:08,346 --> 00:52:10,345
Sonoko.

750
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:13,045
Ran took it!

751
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,846
Not my fault.

752
00:52:17,046 --> 00:52:18,745
"Next Episode" -It's because

753
00:52:18,746 --> 00:52:20,245
there have been

754
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:22,746
a lot of weird people around us lately.

755
00:52:23,746 --> 00:52:26,546
I have a feeling that something bad might happen soon.

756
00:52:27,546 --> 00:52:29,745
What? That brat ran away from home?

757
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,445
How sassy, the next time I see him, I'll...

758
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:33,845
No, he went to take care of Ai who's sick in bed.

759
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:34,946
What?

760
00:52:36,746 --> 00:52:38,546
Shinichi.

761
00:52:40,146 --> 00:52:41,146
Ran?

762
00:52:41,746 --> 00:52:43,045
