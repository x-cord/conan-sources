1
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:03,197
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:03,197 --> 00:00:05,497
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:07,397
The mystery of the Fuurinkazan.

4
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:09,497
Conan and Heiji come to the conclusion!

5
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:11,097
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:12,897
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:15,297
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:52,535
The feuding Torada and Tatsuo families

9
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,935
are involved in a case of serial murders.

10
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,467
The crimes are being patterned after

11
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:00,467
Takeda Shingen's military strategy, the "Fuurinkazan".

12
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:05,667
Why is this culprit so obsessed with Shingen?

13
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,467
And what is the connection

14
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:10,967
with the falling death of Police Officer Kuroto Kai six years ago?

15
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:14,367
As the mystery deepens, another victim is found.

16
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:22,967
"Fuurinkazan: The Conclusion in Lightning and Shadow"

17
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:26,467
The body is badly burnt,

18
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,667
but judging from the body shape,

19
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:30,367
I'm certain this is Shigetsugu Torada.

20
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,367
The Tatsuo family's to blame!

21
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,367
What nonsense.

22
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,567
By the way, where is the fishing pole?

23
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:38,567
Fishing pole?

24
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,067
Yes. He had it in a case.

25
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,267
But I'm sure it was a fishing pole.

26
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,567
Are you saying that...

27
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,167
That's right!

28
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:53,967
Shigetsugu touched the railway cables and got electrocuted!

29
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,367
Where did you find that?

30
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,867
Just there in the forest!

31
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:02,967
The case of the pole was near the crossing.

32
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,867
So I think he got electrocuted there,

33
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:10,267
and got hit by the train and ended up here

34
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:14,767
and there was a dead centipede near the case too.

35
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:18,067
This is another serial murder!

36
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,467
Yoshirou Torada who was killed in a tornado,

37
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,867
"wind."

38
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:25,267
Koji Tatsuo who was buried in the ground and beaten to death,

39
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,067
"mountain."

40
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,367
Ayaka Tatsuo who was hanged in the forest,

41
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:30,767
"forest"

42
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,067
And Shigetsugu Torada

43
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:36,067
who was burned completely with electrical shock,

44
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,567
"fire."

45
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:41,767
The "Fuurinkazan" message has been completed!

46
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:44,567
But why did my wife and my friends

47
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,767
have to be killed in such a way?

48
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:49,367
Mr. Yamato! I found a strange memo.

49
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:52,567
This is...

50
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:53,667
It seems like the progress they made

51
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,967
in finding the buried gold is written here.

52
00:03:55,967 --> 00:04:00,667
Isn't that the memo that Shigetsugu was looking for?

53
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:05,767
Yes and it was also used to exchange notes among themselves.

54
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,467
In short, the notebook says that...

55
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:12,767
Six years ago, they accidentally caused someone's death

56
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,767
and they were talking about whether to go to the police or not.

57
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,967
But decided not to in the end.

58
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:21,167
And they've remained silent ever since.

59
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:24,467
Mr. Akira Tatsuo, they did it for your sake.

60
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,967
-What? -Wait!

61
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,767
You mean the person who died six years ago is...

62
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:31,067
Yes.

63
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,467
It was Kai Kuroto.

64
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,667
They did it so that you could win in the preliminaries

65
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,767
and be chosen as the horseback archer.

66
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,767
They wanted Kai Kuroto to be injured.

67
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:45,667
They used fireworks to frighten his horse while he was practicing,

68
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,667
hoping he would be thrown off the horse.

69
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,467
But the horse became more frightened than they thought,

70
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,967
and it started to run.

71
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,367
It says that

72
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:56,067
they found Kai Kuroto along with his horse, under the cliff.

73
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,667
No...

74
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,167
Judging by the handwritings in this memo,

75
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,367
there were four people involved.

76
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:06,767
I believe they are Yoshiro and Shigetsugu from the Torada family.

77
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,367
And Koji and Ayaka from the Tatsuo family.

78
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:09,767
The four victims of this serial murder case.

79
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:14,167
But why would the memo end up here?

80
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:17,567
To hide the evidence they had.

81
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,367
Shigetsugu was pretending to look for this memo,

82
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,367
when he already had it.

83
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,467
And intended to burn himself

84
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:27,367
with the memo to apologize to Kai Kuroto.

85
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:30,567
Then, you're saying this string of murders was...

86
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,367
Yes. After taking care of his partners in crime

87
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,467
in the incident six years ago,

88
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:41,467
he took his life in order to conceal the truth forever.

89
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,667
Shigetsugu Torada is the serial killer!

90
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,767
And he tried to burn the memo, too,

91
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:50,367
to hide the truth from Akira Tatsuo!

92
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:54,367
Well, the memo wasn't burnt after all.

93
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:57,367
But even if it was for Akira...

94
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:01,267
I know Kai Kuroto would straightened them out on the other side.

95
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:04,067
I know he will.

96
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:07,867
Well, this case is closed!

97
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,567
I would like to tell you all to go home,

98
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:12,967
but I have to search your houses

99
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,467
to gather up some proof for this case.

100
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,667
I would have to ask you to stay here.

101
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:24,067
Hey, do you really think that Shigetsugu found the memo?

102
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:28,067
I don't know. He didn't seem like he had it.

103
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,967
But he stopped looking for it

104
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:32,167
and started to check his emails.

105
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,167
So maybe he did.

106
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,567
Email?

107
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,767
Oh, yeah.

108
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,967
Just when we were about to leave.

109
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,167
Email...

110
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,467
Heiji!

111
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,567
What's up? Did you find something?

112
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,867
Look at this.

113
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,467
A rock with a piece of string.

114
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:58,667
The memo had the same kind of string on it too.

115
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,867
Hey! We are all done here!

116
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,267
The case is closed!

117
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,967
With the "fire" that burned Shigetsugu!

118
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,367
It's "lightning".

119
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:14,667
You hear that? I think it might start to rain.

120
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,967
Lightning?

121
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,267
Lightning.

122
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:22,467
Oh my, how long do we have to wait here in the rain?

123
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:27,967
Do you remember the weather the day that Kai Kuroto died?

124
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,567
My husband had bad dreams.

125
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,067
He said "The sound. the light."

126
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,267
Do you think it's about thunder?

127
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,767
No. I think it was sunny that day.

128
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:40,167
All day long.

129
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:43,367
My poor Shigetsugu will be in the rain.

130
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,567
Heiji, can't we do anything?

131
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,967
And he's gone!

132
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,467
Conan, too!

133
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,667
There they go again.

134
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:55,267
Where Ayaka was hanged,

135
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,367
there were no footprints.

136
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:01,467
All that was left were the footprints of

137
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:06,167
police detective Yamato and the marks of his cane.

138
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,567
I wonder when they hanged Ayaka?

139
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,067
The Torada family was with us

140
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:15,467
until Ayaka disappeared from the bathroom.

141
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:19,167
The Tatsuo family was in the car,

142
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,967
with Tamefumi Tatsuo driving.

143
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,767
Hey, you two!

144
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,067
What are you doing here?

145
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,267
Oh, you're the detective we saw earlier.

146
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,667
What's going on?

147
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,367
Mr. Yamato ordered us to preserve the murder scene

148
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,467
since it might start raining soon!

149
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,367
What is that coat?

150
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,367
Oh, this?

151
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:39,367
I found it caught in the branch of a tree!

152
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,067
Is that coat...

153
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,467
Wet by any chance?

154
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:45,067
No. Mr. Yamato asked me the same thing.

155
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,367
But it's not.

156
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,767
Well, we have to move quickly!

157
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,767
Since he's back to work,

158
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,367
we have no time to rest at all!

159
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,867
Where was he until now?

160
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:01,467
He was after a man who escaped during parole

161
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,967
and got caught in an avalanche.

162
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:07,767
The man was arrested by Kai Kuroto

163
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:10,767
and disappeared six years ago,

164
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:11,767
so Mr. Yamato thought

165
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,967
he might be linked to the death of Kai Kuroto.

166
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:18,767
In the accident, he lost his left eye and left leg,

167
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,467
and was unconscious in the hospital for a long time.

168
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:26,067
So was the man connected to Kai Kuroto's death?

169
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,867
Unfortunately, he wasn't.

170
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,267
But fate is definitely cruel.

171
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:35,567
He had to meet Yui Uehara as the victim's wife,

172
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,767
when she used to work under Mr. Yamato

173
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,867
before he was hospitalized.

174
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:41,167
Yui and he were determined

175
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:45,067
to find the truth behind Kai Kuroto's death.

176
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,967
But she quit the force and got married.

177
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,967
Those two became police officers

178
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,467
to follow in the path of Kai Kuroto.

179
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:57,467
Then, six years ago when Kai Kuroto died,

180
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:59,567
-was she still in the force? -Yes, she was.

181
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,767
She had just joined the force,

182
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,867
and she was in such shock, crying a lot.

183
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:08,867
Speaking of tears, there was something odd.

184
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:09,867
What is it?

185
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,667
There should have been tear marks on Ayala Tatsuo's face

186
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,267
before she died,

187
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,267
but we couldn't find any.

188
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:19,167
How could you tell that she wiped her tears?

189
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,267
Her eye shadow had rubbed off,

190
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:24,067
and her right index finger had eye shadow on it.

191
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:26,667
She must have wiped her tears.

192
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,467
What color was it?

193
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,167
-Tell us! -Well,

194
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,067
it was ordinary blue eye shadow.

195
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:40,167
Then take that horse and go home to the Torada family!

196
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,567
I see.

197
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:42,967
It must be.

198
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,767
It seems like this battle...

199
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,967
Isn't over yet.

200
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,797
"Torada Residence" -What? The police

201
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,997
"Torada Residence" -will come to this house again?

202
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:05,297
Yes. Mr. Yamato will bring some people

203
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,297
and will search the house.

204
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,597
They plan a house search on the Tatsuo family house as well!

205
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,597
How long will it take?

206
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:14,897
He said about three to four days.

207
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,997
Three to four days?

208
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:20,497
I think the festival starts in three days.

209
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:23,197
Yeah, I know.

210
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,597
I see now.

211
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,097
The festival?

212
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:28,397
"Tatsuo Residence"

213
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:32,597
Yoshiro.

214
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:34,197
Koji.

215
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:37,197
Ayaka. Shigetsugu.

216
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,797
Why did you do such a thing to Mr. Kuroto

217
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:41,997
just because of me?

218
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,497
It was you.

219
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:53,397
Yui Torada.

220
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:57,397
So you knew that I was coming?

221
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:01,097
Yes. When Shigetsugu died, you said "lightning".

222
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:03,197
That's how I knew.

223
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:07,797
Although his body was burnt, it was from the electricity.

224
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:12,997
It was the "thunderbolt" from "Move like thunderbolt".

225
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:14,197
That's right.

226
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:17,097
There's more to the "Fuurinkazan" strategy

227
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:18,997
that Sun Tzu wrote about.

228
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:22,597
There is "Move like thunderbolt" which you just said,

229
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:26,997
and there also is "be impenetratable as shadow"

230
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,697
The "thunderbolt" suggests that

231
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:32,397
you must "appear like thunderbolt, in a surprise."

232
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:36,697
"Shadow" suggests you must "hide as still as shadow.".

233
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,097
That's right.

234
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:40,897
Just like Kai Kuroto, beneath the cliff

235
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:44,897
where the sun didn't reach and still breathing and alive.

236
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,597
To those four who caused Kuroto Kai's death six years ago,

237
00:12:48,597 --> 00:12:51,897
his blood soaked undershirt must have looked deep red.

238
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:57,297
Just like the armor of Takeda's Akazonae cavalry.

239
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:59,797
That's why this was all patterned after Shingen!

240
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:00,897
Yes.

241
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:02,597
It was to make the four who brought Kuroto Kai's death

242
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:04,597
come to the light.

243
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:07,897
Just as expected, Koji reacted to it almost instantly.

244
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:12,497
But Ayaka and Shigetsugu weren't that interested in Shingen.

245
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:15,697
So they didn't respond to the dead centipedes.

246
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:18,897
And so, it was the uproar over the Suwa Hossyo helmet

247
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:22,097
that finally got Ayaka.

248
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:24,597
And then, Ayaka was forced to reveal Shigetsugu's name!

249
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,697
Have you come to deal with me

250
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:28,997
just like you did those four?

251
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:31,497
To wipe out Kai Kuroto's enemy?

252
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:34,097
To wipe you out?

253
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:35,797
No, Akira.

254
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:38,597
I am here to protect you.

255
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:41,197
From the true killer...

256
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,197
standing right over there.

257
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:47,897
You!

258
00:13:47,897 --> 00:13:50,597
I should have expected it from a former policewoman.

259
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,697
How did you figure it out?

260
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:56,197
It was the blue eye shadow on Ayaka's hand.

261
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:59,497
"Ao" from "Aokage" meaning black horse.

262
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:00,897
In other words,

263
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:05,897
the person riding a black horse at that time, was you.

264
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:07,997
What a clever girl.

265
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:11,497
Then, you forced Shigetsugu's name out of Ayaka,

266
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,997
and dealt with him.

267
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:16,897
Yes, Shigetsugu was the child of my husband's first wife.

268
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,497
He wasn't related to me by blood.

269
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:21,997
But why, Tatsue?

270
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:26,297
It's because she is the one who really killed Kuroto Kai.

271
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,397
I told you that

272
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,097
my husband would say "the sound, the light"

273
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:31,197
in his nightmares.

274
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:33,597
That's what lead me to realize there was another person

275
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:35,697
at the crime scene six years ago.

276
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:38,797
Tatsue, it was you, wasn't it?

277
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:42,197
Yes, I wanted him injured as well.

278
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:45,797
So I fired one shot from this gun at his horse's legs.

279
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:48,997
That's when he fell off the cliff.

280
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:53,397
But, some people came and started making a big fuss.

281
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:56,997
As if they were the ones who caused his death.

282
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,997
That made me laugh.

283
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,697
It would have been best if they continued to think that

284
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:01,897
and kept their mouth shut.

285
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:04,497
But later on, Yoshiro started talking about going to the police

286
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:07,797
to tell about the gunshot he heard and the flash he's seen.

287
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:12,597
But then the Gods punished him by sending him that tornado.

288
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:16,097
And you left my injured husband there to die.

289
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:18,797
Leaving the centipeds that you had ready.

290
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:22,197
Yes, by that time I'd already come up with

291
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:25,197
the idea of patterning everything after the "Fuurinkazan-inrai".

292
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:31,197
That means one of your targets right from the start was Akira.

293
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,197
What?

294
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,197
Yes, the final element was for Akira, "fire".

295
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:37,497
Since you've come in the way of the gambling operation we run,

296
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:40,297
you'll be burned into ashes.

297
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:44,797
These flames you eat you up!

298
00:15:44,797 --> 00:15:46,197
Gambling?

299
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,797
They gamble on the festival horseback archery contest,

300
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:51,497
betting how many of misses there'll be in the ten shots.

301
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:54,697
But Kai Kuroto never missed a single one.

302
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:56,797
Until you moved one of the targets.

303
00:15:56,797 --> 00:16:00,097
There's no point in gambling if he never misses.

304
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:02,197
And since you've hit them all for five years straight as well,

305
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,997
you'll need to die too.

306
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,297
The story will be that

307
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,297
you took revenge for Kai Kuroto, whom you loved dearly.

308
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:09,097
And then to atone for those crimes,

309
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:12,897
you took your own life.

310
00:16:12,897 --> 00:16:14,697
But considering the present circumstances,

311
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:17,197
having this stupid woman,

312
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:18,897
to solve the mystery of Officer Kai Kuroto's death,

313
00:16:18,897 --> 00:16:21,897
went so far as to marry Yoshiro, a man she didn't love.

314
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,197
It might look better if we changed out story to one

315
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,897
where she kills you out of resentment.

316
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:30,297
Well, will you tell this stupid woman something?

317
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:32,597
Why were there no marks

318
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:35,797
beneath the tree where Ayaka was hanged?

319
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:38,597
There is nothing to tell to one who will die!

320
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,897
It's the horse!

321
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:46,597
Back then, you put Ayaka on your horse, didn't you?

322
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:49,697
You used a rope already attached to the branch beforehand.

323
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:51,497
Allowing you to hook it to her neck

324
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,197
from the other side of the tree.

325
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:56,697
Afterwards, you rode your horse up behind the tree.

326
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,497
So no one would know

327
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,997
when the hoof marks had gotten there.

328
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:02,897
How long have you been there?

329
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,597
"Be as swift as the wind"

330
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:09,297
I've been waiting here for two hours before you came.

331
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:12,297
Incidentally, the reason no one noticed that

332
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,497
Ayaka was on your horse was...

333
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:18,497
You had a black coat on her.

334
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,397
When Ayaka was secluded in the toilet,

335
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:21,397
you called her on her cell phone

336
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:23,497
and secretly lured her out to the stables.

337
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:25,997
After Akira and the others left on the horse...

338
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:27,697
You placed her, with that black coat on her,

339
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:30,497
on your black horse and went into the forest.

340
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:33,497
You! How did you!

341
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:36,397
"Be quiet as the forest."

342
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:38,697
I've been waiting here. Holding my breath.

343
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:41,697
Well, it looks like there was an earlier visitor here before us.

344
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:44,197
An early visitor?

345
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,497
If you know your target,

346
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:49,297
be cool and level.

347
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:54,097
Sit yourself down and observe.

348
00:17:56,697 --> 00:18:00,297
"Be immovable like the mountain"

349
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:05,197
You planned this, didn't you?

350
00:18:05,197 --> 00:18:08,697
Yeah, with the police sticking around here until the festival,

351
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:11,297
tonight was your only chance.

352
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:14,297
Compared to your plan of swiping that notebook,

353
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:17,697
hanging it from the electric wires as bait.

354
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,997
And electrocuting Shigetsugu, my plan was no big deal.

355
00:18:21,697 --> 00:18:25,097
The way you used a string to tie the notebook to a rock.

356
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:28,597
Making it easy to throw it up to get it caught on the train cable.

357
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,997
Shigetsugu learned where it was from an email you sent to him.

358
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:35,497
And when he used the pole to get it, he was electrocuted.

359
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:39,397
Well, if you want to light a fire, go ahead.

360
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:40,697
I've already called the fire department

361
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:42,697
and have them waiting on standby.

362
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:46,197
Get them!

363
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:58,797
Don't worry, I'm striking with the blunt side!

364
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:04,997
You brat!

365
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:09,197
-Kansuke! -Take this!

366
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:19,397
Saving the best for you again, huh?

367
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:21,597
And that's how the final murder

368
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:23,397
was prevented before it happened.

369
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:25,997
As for the war that had lasted for six years,

370
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:29,897
it was over at last, leaving a bruise on the eye of the enemy.

371
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,097
What?

372
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:37,597
You fought against the culprits last night?

373
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:39,797
Why didn't you ask us to help?

374
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:41,997
We could have helped!

375
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:46,197
Hey, I can't let you guys do such a dangerous thing like that!

376
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:49,697
Then, I will have you come in for an interview.

377
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:51,897
I see. Good day.

378
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:56,397
You too! You better come to the police!

379
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:57,797
Yes. I will.

380
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,597
See ya.

381
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:07,197
"Be swift as the wind."

382
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:11,897
I...

383
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:13,097
Pardon?

384
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:17,597
It was because I thought you were dead, Kansuke!

385
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:21,097
That's why I thought I had to do something.

386
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:24,597
That's why I married Yoshiro...

387
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:29,297
But, when I say that, it makes me feel sorry for my husband.

388
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:31,497
Idiot, didn't I just say it?

389
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,597
"Come to the police."

390
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:36,597
When you free yourself from your obligations,

391
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:39,897
and when you're ready. Come back.

392
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:41,897
The chief detective has been waiting, too.

393
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:45,197
For that awful coffee that you make.

394
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:54,997
Hey, those two...

395
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,797
Are getting along!

396
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:00,697
Hey, what were they saying?

397
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:02,497
You were near them, right?

398
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:06,597
She said "Be swift as the wind" or something.

399
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:08,897
This should be the strategy of love!

400
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:10,297
"Fuurinkazan"!

401
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:32,897
Heiji!

402
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:36,997
-What is it, Kazuha? -Just come with me!

403
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:38,297
What's going on?

404
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:44,397
Oh no, it's Ran.

405
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,697
Hello? Shinichi?

406
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:49,697
Oh, hey Ran, what's going on?

407
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:51,397
What is it?

408
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:54,497
Today, I am going to make myself clear!

409
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:58,197
-Couldn't we talk later? -No! It has to be now!

410
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:00,497
"Be swift as the wind."

411
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:02,897
Hey, let me go to the bathroom.

412
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:05,597
Nope! You are not going anywhere, Heiji!

413
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,797
"Attack as fiercely as the fire."

414
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:19,197
"Be as quiet as the forest."

415
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:23,197
Well... yeah, we can talk later...

416
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:28,197
Well... I'll let you go for today.

417
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:29,897
Hey, wait a second!

418
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,497
What's up with them?

419
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:37,797
I don't know.

420
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:40,397
You think they're getting irritated because they're hungry?

421
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:46,697
"Be immovable like the mountain."

422
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,897
On November 30th,

423
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,897
only then the treasure will be revealed in the sunset.

424
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:57,597
Treasure?

425
00:23:57,597 --> 00:24:01,097
Ms. Kimiko, do you know anything about this?

426
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:04,397
But what is the puzzle of the fox?

427
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:07,097
There's a picture of a fox right here.

428
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:10,197
November 30th is tomorrow!

429
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:13,097
We cannot let this chance go by!

430
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:14,697
Next Conan,

431
00:24:14,697 --> 00:24:18,697
"Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Investigation Edition"

432
00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:31,197
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:33,797
"Fox"

434
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:34,997
The location of the next episode is Yamaguchi.

435
00:24:34,997 --> 00:24:36,597
-I wanna go. -You're not needed.

436
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:38,234
On December 1st!
