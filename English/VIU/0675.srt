1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,389
"We're having barbecue today"

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:04,589
"Barbecue from afternoon"

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,989
"While we're at it, we're having barbecue for dinner too"

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:14,589
Come, come. We're only invited over for lunch, you know!

5
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,589
But, how lucky we are

6
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,589
to be invited to have barbecue together

7
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,389
from a couple we met at camp!

8
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:23,089
Yep! Since they said they forgot to bring rice,

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,289
all we did was share some of the rice that we had with them!

10
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:30,289
Well, it's also thanks to someone who got kidnapped too, though.

11
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:33,889
If the day we decided to camp wasn't shifted because of that incident,

12
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:36,189
we wouldn't have met that couple either, you see.

13
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:38,089
It couldn't be helped, could it?

14
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,489
Because on the Sunday after the incident,

15
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,589
we were interrogated for so long.

16
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:47,989
But why'd you come along with everybody back then?

17
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,289
You should've let dangerous things like that

18
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,089
up to Doc and Subaru.

19
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:55,189
Because Subaru told me to come along.

20
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,789
Besides, I couldn't stand just being there without doing anything.

21
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,989
Huh?

22
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,889
I figured that if I just stayed back home,

23
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:06,289
I would miss out at seeing the end of you.

24
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:07,589
Is that so?

25
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,989
But it sure is strange.

26
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,189
What is?

27
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:20,389
It's the first time you're calling him Subaru, isn't it?

28
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:22,489
So, you finally got used to him, eh?

29
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:26,289
Wipe that look off your face.

30
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,989
I won't let her get away.

31
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:35,489
It's not... anything like that.

32
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:41,389
Yes. Hello?

33
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,489
Yahoo! Conan, how are you?

34
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,389
Yeah, I guess so.

35
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:51,389
What's with that low reaction of yours?

36
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:54,189
I rescued you from a bad lady the other day, didn't I?

37
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,589
Yeah.

38
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:58,189
Go for it!

39
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,289
I'm glad! You're okay!

40
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:07,189
I guess so.

41
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,189
Thank you for everything back then.

42
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:10,789
Who is it, on the phone?

43
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,389
Oh, no.

44
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,989
That voice... Is it that girl named Haibara?

45
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:19,689
Conan, who are you talking with?

46
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,789
If it's from Ran, will you give me the phone when you're done?

47
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:24,089
Which voice are you talking about?

48
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:25,589
Who cares!

49
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:27,389
We finished school early

50
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,589
so we're heading over to the detective agency now.

51
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:32,289
If it's okay with you, why don't you bring her along too?

52
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:34,389
I'm going to be having barbecue from now today,

53
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,989
so I won't be there even if you come over.

54
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,489
Bye.

55
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:41,989
Hey, what's this barbecue thing about?

56
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,089
He hung up.

57
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:44,989
Come to think of it, Conan was saying that

58
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,589
he was invited over to have barbecue with the others.

59
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,289
Why didn't you say that earlier?

60
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,389
Sorry.

61
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,589
What' s this? Don't tell me you came over to Ran's

62
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:58,089
because you wanted to see that glasses brat?

63
00:02:58,089 --> 00:02:59,589
Well...

64
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:04,489
I actually wanted to see Amuro, Kogoro's disciple too.

65
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,189
I see. Back then, it was dark in the middle of the road

66
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,689
and at the police station we were interrogated in different rooms, too.

67
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,289
Maybe they have mutual feelings for each other.

68
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,689
By the way, have you guys met that girl called Haibara?

69
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,989
Yep. You mean Ai, right?

70
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,389
I don't take too well to her.

71
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:24,489
What kind of girl is she?

72
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,289
She a little different, but she's cute.

73
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:30,789
I guess you could say that a not too friendly grown up woman,

74
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:34,289
shrunk and turned into a child.

75
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,289
A grown up woman?

76
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:40,189
Yep! She sometimes says things that sound really grown up.

77
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,189
Right, right.

78
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:45,089
Sometimes, she really resembles that glasses brat.

79
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,689
But Ai doesn't seem to be a Holmes freak or anything like that.

80
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,389
Masumi, I guess you just met Conan,

81
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,989
so you don't know much about him

82
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,889
but, Conan, like Shinichi loves Holmes.

83
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,689
I know it from way long ago.

84
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:04,389
The vivid colored memories of summer

85
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,589
solve mysteries all season round.

86
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:08,389
Something only we witnessed.

87
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,289
A husband and wife fight because of a misunderstanding.

88
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:11,989
He sees through the one and only truth.

89
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,089
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

90
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,489
His name is Detective Conan!

91
00:05:56,717 --> 00:06:02,517
"Not Even a Millimeter of Forgiveness (Part 1)"

92
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:11,523
Strange.

93
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:14,223
We've come here on time, and yet...

94
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:19,223
Happy Halloween!

95
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:24,723
Halloween has long gone, already.

96
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:26,423
I mean, usually during Halloween,

97
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:29,723
the children who visit the houses are the ones who disguise themselves.

98
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,823
-Right. -Yep.

99
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:35,123
That's why I told you not to, because it won't work.

100
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:40,123
What? I thought the children would like it.

101
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:43,623
You used to always take things too far from before.

102
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:45,923
Even at last year's Christmas party,

103
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:48,223
you wore a reindeer outfit.

104
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:51,023
That's because you told me not to wear the mini-skirt Santa outfit

105
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:52,723
because it was embarrassing, right?

106
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:54,923
Think of how old you are!

107
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:56,823
Well, I'm sorry I'm a middle aged lady!

108
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,423
Come, come, you two...

109
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:03,423
This is delicious!

110
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,423
This meat is really good!

111
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:08,723
You'd better eat vegetables too,

112
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:10,723
to eat a nutritious meal!

113
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:12,923
Okay!

114
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,323
You too, Doc.

115
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:16,723
Leave me alone.

116
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:20,323
Eating together with the children is a lot of run after all.

117
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:22,523
If you will excuse me asking, do you have any children?

118
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:24,123
None.

119
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:27,123
Although it's been 10 years since we've gotten married.

120
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:29,023
Only if we had children,

121
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,223
I guess my husband would've stopped flirting.

122
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:33,923
Huh?

123
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:36,523
Well...

124
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,723
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,423
It's not something I should say in front of children.

126
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:43,723
-No. -Hey, Sumika!

127
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:45,723
Do you know where my cell phone is?

128
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:47,423
No, I don't!

129
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:50,423
Maybe you have it in the pocket of your coat?

130
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:53,223
It's not there.

131
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,023
I'm supposed to receive mail from my superior at the company.

132
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:59,723
Don't tell me you forgot it again at the cabaret.

133
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:01,923
I'm not going to go pick it up for you again!

134
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:03,823
It can't be helped, can it?

135
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:06,823
Back then, I got a call from the shop to my office

136
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:08,923
and I was working, so...

137
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:12,623
Or rather, back then, you looked at the contents of my cell phone

138
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:14,723
-and did something, right? -Yes!

139
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,923
I sent mail after mail to all the girls

140
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,723
that were sending you suspicious mails!

141
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:21,123
"Die, you thief" I wrote!

142
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:23,923
I was wondering why I suddenly stopped getting mail,

143
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,823
but it was you after all!

144
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:29,523
So what? Your flirting is to blame for everything!

145
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:30,923
What?

146
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:34,723
Thinking that a jealous monster wife like you is waiting at home

147
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,123
make me want to flirt the more!

148
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:39,423
What? You come home late recently

149
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,423
because you're meeting some woman, after all?

150
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,023
Excuse me.

151
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:52,423
I'm sorry. This is nothing unusual.

152
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:53,623
Don't let us bother you.

153
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:56,023
I've been irritated recently, you see.

154
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:59,323
At any rate, won't you help me look for my cell phone?

155
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:01,123
The Department Head gets angry

156
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,223
if I don't return his mails right away.

157
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:03,523
Are you really sure that

158
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:04,923
you're waiting for mail from the department head?

159
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:06,823
Yeah!

160
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:09,323
It's the usual mahjong game he wants me to join.

161
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:11,723
Call my cell phone from yours.

162
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,323
I'll look for it, listening to the ringtone.

163
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:17,323
But I can't find my cell phone from this morning either.

164
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,823
I'm sure it's somewhere in the living room, though.

165
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:23,223
I wonder if they'll be okay? Those two...

166
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:24,523
I guess.

167
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,423
Like they say, a spat is evidence that they get along.

168
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:29,523
Even a dog won't involve itself in an argument

169
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:32,523
between husband and wife.

170
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:34,523
Genta, you sure can eat.

171
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,223
Aye! Because I'm not a dog!

172
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:40,823
Huh? You're leaving?

173
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:41,823
Yeah.

174
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:44,923
Why don't you drop by because you came all this way?

175
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,323
I just remembered I had something to do.

176
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:51,923
Besides, it seems like Kogoro's disciple is off today, too.

177
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,923
Don't tell me that you're saying

178
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:57,523
you're going home because the glasses brat isn't here?

179
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:59,323
No, no.

180
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:02,823
I really remembered something that I have to do.

181
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:04,823
But, to make up for this, the next time I come,

182
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,323
I'll have you show me albums

183
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,223
and tell me a lot of stuff I want to know!

184
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:11,123
About your boyfriend too, okay?

185
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:12,823
What?

186
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:17,623
You're really cheerful through and through!

187
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:18,923
Really?

188
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:22,623
Well, long time ago, there was this person that never laughed,

189
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,823
and I turned out this way

190
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,423
because I kept trying to make that person laugh.

191
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:31,923
Hey!

192
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,223
What? What is it?

193
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:46,723
What's the matter? Running off all of a sudden?

194
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:48,023
An acquaintance of mine...

195
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,823
I thought I saw somebody I knew.

196
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:52,523
An acquaintance?

197
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,923
Not possible.

198
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:11,023
I sure did eat.

199
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,923
I'm really full!

200
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,623
Are you taking a picture of Genta?

201
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:17,523
Yes, I'm going to make a diary of Genta's growth!

202
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,523
To show that this is how he became like Doc.

203
00:11:20,523 --> 00:11:22,223
Hey, hey.

204
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:26,923
He's already quite close to Doc, I think.

205
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,523
A cell phone!

206
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:36,123
Isn't that the cell phone the couple was looking for a while ago?

207
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:40,723
Then, I'll go give this to them!

208
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:44,123
Yeah, I'm sure they're still in that living room.

209
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:46,023
Okay.

210
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,923
Excuse me, I found your phone...

211
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:57,723
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

212
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:59,023
I'm gonna kill you!

213
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:01,923
Hey, Sumika.

214
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:03,623
Cool it.

215
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,823
Sumika.

216
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:11,123
Die!

217
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:15,923
Bad... bad news!

218
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:18,623
Those two are at it again!

219
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:21,623
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

220
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:24,223
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

221
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,623
she's going to kill him.

222
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:27,423
-What? -What?

223
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:35,123
We've got to stop them, quick!

224
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,507
Mrs. Konno? Mrs. Konno?

225
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,107
Please open your eyes! Mrs. Konno!

226
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,907
Please get a hold of yourself!

227
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,607
She's still breathing.

228
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:59,507
Her complexion is pale and her pulse is barely detectable.

229
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:02,907
She's bleeding badly and her blood pressure's low.

230
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,407
Hey, Conan.

231
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,107
This thing that's poked inside,

232
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:08,907
isn't it better to pull it out?

233
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:10,907
-Don't touch the knife! -Huh?

234
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:13,107
If you pull that out, her wound will open

235
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:15,107
-and she'll bleed to death! -What?

236
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:17,407
Ai! Is the ambulance here yet?

237
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:19,907
They'll be here in about 10 minutes!

238
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:20,907
Okay!

239
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:24,607
Mr. Konno, do you have any cushions and blankets?

240
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,107
Hey! Cushions and blankets!

241
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,707
Gosh.

242
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,407
Doc and Ayumi, go get the cushions!

243
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:34,207
Mitsuhiko, you go look for the blanket and bring it over!

244
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,807
-Okay. -All right!

245
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:46,007
She's wearing only an apron and sweater.

246
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,907
She's dressed so lightly.

247
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:51,407
Even her pants are short Sabrina pants.

248
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:54,007
Hey, Conan. Do you need water or something?

249
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,107
No.

250
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:57,207
More than that, that's the kitchen over there, right?

251
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,707
Can you go get me a plastic bag if there are any?

252
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:03,307
-She may throw up. -Okay.

253
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:04,907
Here're the cushions!

254
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:08,407
Place it under her feet to raise them!

255
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:09,507
Yeah.

256
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:11,507
That'll decrease the blood flow to the legs

257
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:15,207
and increase the blood circulation around her heart area!

258
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:17,007
Okay!

259
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,307
What should I do with the blanket?

260
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:22,307
Cover her from her chest where the knife is stabbed to below.

261
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:25,307
That'll prevent her temperature from going down due to shock!

262
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,307
-Yes! -Now, all we need is

263
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:29,207
her blood type and history of past allergies,

264
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:33,207
while we wait for the ambulance to get here.

265
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,107
But, with her husband in that state...

266
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:41,507
You...

267
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,807
I know you're spaced out because you unfortunately,

268
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:45,307
accidentally stabbed your wife and is in shock,

269
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:48,207
at least tell us your wife's blood type and allergy history!

270
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,407
You're husband and wife

271
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:51,007
who promised eternal love to each other, right?

272
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:59,007
Sumika!

273
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:01,307
She has no allergies.

274
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:04,607
Her blood type is AB,

275
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:07,007
RH minus.

276
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,107
RH minus, blood type AB?

277
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:12,707
There are only 1 in 2000 people!

278
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:15,307
Ai! We'd better let the hospital know about this right away!

279
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:17,407
They probably won't have any blood in stock!

280
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:18,507
All right.

281
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:21,807
It's not that they don't have any at all.

282
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:27,807
I'm also RH minus, blood type AB too, you see.

283
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:35,607
Although I sort of have a rough idea,

284
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:38,307
would you give me the details

285
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:42,307
of why you stabbed your wife?

286
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:46,207
Like I told the person at the hospital a while ago,

287
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:49,607
what triggered the whole thing was my cell phone.

288
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:52,107
-What? -Well, you see, back then...

289
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:55,207
remember, I was looking for it? My cell phone.

290
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:58,807
I found it under the sofa of the living room.

291
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:01,107
And the mail from the Department Head asking me

292
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:03,007
to play mahjong with him hadn't come yet,

293
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,807
so I was going to call him

294
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,507
and ask whether the game was on for tonight,

295
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,807
but my wife took the cell phone away from me,

296
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,307
saying that she wanted to call her cell phone first,

297
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,007
so that she could ring it and look for it.

298
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,407
We found that cell phone.

299
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:18,707
-Right, Ayumi? -Yep.

300
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:22,107
So, I went to deliver it to you.

301
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,607
Is that why you got into a fight?

302
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,007
No.

303
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:30,007
The fight started after my wife rang her cell phone.

304
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:33,107
Hey, what's with this woman?

305
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:36,807
A number for a new woman's been added again!

306
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,307
Again?

307
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:39,707
Don't tell me that

308
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,507
you've been looking through my cell phone without telling me?

309
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:43,907
Of course!

310
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:46,807
It's the job of a wife to supervise her husband!

311
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:49,607
I've been checking it every night after you went to bed!

312
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:50,907
Hey, hey.

313
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:54,207
Privacy exists even between husband and wife, you know!

314
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:57,307
What a woman. I shouldn't have married you.

315
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,307
You took the words right out of my mouth!

316
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:03,107
And that's when my wife with knife in hand

317
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:06,307
said that she'd kill me and charged forward to stab me.

318
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:10,507
While I was struggling with her, I felt her go weak,

319
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:11,707
and before I knew what was happening,

320
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:14,607
I saw the knife poked into her chest.

321
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,907
Is that what happened, Ayumi?

322
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:18,007
Yep.

323
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,807
But all I saw was

324
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:25,107
Mrs. Konno holding the knife saying, "I'm not forgiving you."

325
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:26,607
I see.

326
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:29,907
Well, I guess it was in self-defense.

327
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,107
But it's amazing how you two

328
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:33,807
continued to be a couple the way you were.

329
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:39,307
She changed. My wife.

330
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,407
When I met her in front of the mobile blood donation center,

331
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:45,007
she used to be a kind woman who laughed a lot.

332
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:47,207
We sure run into each other a lot, don't we?

333
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:51,007
Really. We mutually have valuable blood types.

334
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:55,507
But recently, she's been constantly irritated.

335
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,007
Even after she comes home from work,

336
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,607
all she says is, "I'm fatigued, tired, sleepy."

337
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,307
And doesn't even make dinner.

338
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:05,507
When I decide to cook for her at times so she can take it easy,

339
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:09,207
she throws up as if to say that she can't eat the food I make.

340
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:12,607
I invited her to go camping where we used to go to a lot,

341
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,307
before we got married for a change,

342
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:15,907
but we get into a big fight

343
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:17,407
when she finds out that I forgot to bring the rice.

344
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:21,407
But, back then, thanks to all of you sharing the rice with us,

345
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:23,807
my wife became cheerful again.

346
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:27,107
But honestly, I couldn't stand it anymore.

347
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,307
But I like Mrs. Konno!

348
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:36,107
She wore the Halloween costume to entertain us,

349
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:39,207
and she was all smiles when making barbecue, too.

350
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:45,107
I don't want Mrs. Konno to die!

351
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:47,207
Wipe that look off your face.

352
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,107
I know she'll make it through.

353
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:52,407
Yep.

354
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:55,007
Wipe that look off your face.

355
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,607
I won't let her get away.

356
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,307
Wipe that look off your face.

357
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,207
I'll protect you over my dead body.

358
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:11,407
Dai Moroboshi.

359
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:15,107
My older sister's boyfriend, who betrayed the Organization.

360
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:20,407
But, if that lady makes it,

361
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:23,407
it's probably thanks to us who came here, right?

362
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:26,407
Yes, I guess so.

363
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:28,307
If back then, the cell phone wasn't found

364
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:30,707
and Ayumi didn't go to give it to him,

365
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:33,107
we wouldn't have realized that the two were fighting

366
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:35,707
and maybe it would've been too late to save her.

367
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,007
Something just doesn't seem right.

368
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:49,407
Everything's moving too smoothly.

369
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:52,707
Like something's being manipulated.

370
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:57,907
But, what on earth is it?

371
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:21,407
"Surgery in progress"

372
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,507
It's sure taking a long time.

373
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:31,307
Don't worry! I'm sure she'll be fine.

374
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:32,907
Yep.

375
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:38,107
Oh, mail.

376
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:41,707
That's Mrs. Konno's cell phone that we found a while ago, right?

377
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:44,307
-Yep. -Let me see it.

378
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:51,207
No, you shouldn't read other people's mail without permission.

379
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:52,707
About you not feeling too well

380
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:54,807
that you asked me for advice about last time...

381
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:57,907
I suggest you go to see a doctor.

382
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:01,707
A heart mark at the end of the sentence?

383
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:04,707
Why a heart mark when she's asking for advice on not feeling well?

384
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:06,107
Why?

385
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:09,907
Hey, Conan.

386
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:12,607
Are you going to check the mails she sent out too?

387
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,507
This is...

388
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:17,907
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

389
00:22:17,907 --> 00:22:21,707
The husband was saying that his wife sent mails saying, "Die, thief"

390
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:25,207
to the women that sent him suspicious mails, right?

391
00:22:25,207 --> 00:22:28,607
Yes, but there's nothing like that here.

392
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:30,507
It does seem that she was irritated

393
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:33,307
because she wasn't feeling good, though.

394
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:37,307
I see! That's why that cup was over there!

395
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:40,807
She wasn't feeling good, that is, she was feeling sick, right?

396
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:44,007
It looked like the lady was about to drink medicine.

397
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:48,007
Because I found a glass cup with water inside in the kitchen!

398
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:50,807
Glass cup with water?

399
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,407
Then, did you find medicine nearby too?

400
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:57,407
No. The only other thing there was a sugar container.

401
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:03,007
I was about to bring that water to the lady, but...

402
00:23:05,507 --> 00:23:08,507
Are you all right, Genta?

403
00:23:08,507 --> 00:23:11,207
Maybe you're the one who needs medicine, Genta.

404
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:14,607
Could it be that you have a cold?

405
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:18,707
No. My nose feels ticklish.

406
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,107
I can't stop...

407
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:24,707
Then, why don't you try holding the space below your nose

408
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:26,907
with your index finger and blocking off your nostrils?

409
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,807
Like this?

410
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:32,807
If that doesn't work, pinch your nose.

411
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:34,007
It stopped!

412
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:37,307
Well, it's something like a lucky spell.

413
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:39,007
Lucky spell...

414
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,107
Don't tell me it's...

415
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:48,507
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

416
00:23:53,907 --> 00:23:56,007
"Next Episode"

417
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:57,607
The lamp turned off!

418
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:59,607
It seems the surgery has finished!

419
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:01,507
Sumika!

420
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:06,707
Here. The lamp on Ayumi's cell phone is on, see?

421
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:09,707
Maybe it's the telephone answering service?

422
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:11,407
Just as I thought.

423
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:14,407
This isn't fighting back in self-defense.

424
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:18,407
If so, the next action that'll be taken is...

425
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:19,807
Next Conan,

426
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:23,807
"Not Even a Millimeter of Forgiveness (Part 2)"
