1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:01,644
Okay!

2
00:00:01,882 --> 00:00:03,540
It's done!

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,991
Amazing!

4
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:07,097
It looks fantastic!

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,818
Well, the design is just a duplicate of the detective badge though.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,591
Hey, kites need tails, you know.

7
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:19,797
They'll just keep spinning around in circles without tails.

8
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:22,908
As for that, I've already made them!

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,952
Moreover. It includes a message too. See!

10
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:30,939
"If you got a case on your hands,

11
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,026
contact the Detective Squad at Teitan Elementary class 1-B."

12
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:36,487
Wow.

13
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:39,830
Jobs will come pouring in.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,037
Good idea, don't you think?

15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,537
What about the other tail?

16
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:48,267
I was planning on unrolling this after arriving at the site.

17
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:51,114
"If you're looking for useful inventions,

18
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:56,004
Contact Hiroshi Agasa of 2-22 Beika City."

19
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:02,262
You've even got your website address on the back.

20
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:08,221
It's okay, isn't it? Because I helped you make the kite.

21
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:11,927
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

22
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:13,824
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

23
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:15,825
A kite flying event in a spacious lot by the river.

24
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:17,684
An ingenious trick that looks to be an accident.

25
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:21,264
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:23,684
His name is Detective Conan!

28

"Teimuzu River Kite-Flying Case (Part 1)"

29
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,870
-But I wonder if it'll be okay? -What about?

30
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:19,110
Kite tails flap a lot in the wind,

31
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,925
so the messages won't be readable.

32
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:26,399
All we need to do is win an award at the kite contest.

33
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,549
-An award? -What do you mean?

34
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,954
Kites that fly the highest

35
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:35,828
and kites with unique designs that win awards

36
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:39,033
will be decorated at the city hall for a month.

37
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,911
It'll be a super effective method of advertisement.

38
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,617
-Really? -Great!

39
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:47,171
Let's do our best, Ai!

40
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:48,955
Ai?

41
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,410
What? Oh, sorry.

42
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,836
-What is it? -Let's do our best

43
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:57,981
at the kite flying contest.

44
00:03:58,056 --> 00:03:59,317
Yes.

45
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,909
-Kites! -Oh, how magnificent.

46
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,781
Okay, I'll give it my all!

47

"Eight Teimuzu River Kite Flying Event."

48
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:19,455
What? The music Haibara's listening to?

49
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,840
She hums a tune sometimes looking happy.

50
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:30,676
I'd like to know what's making her feel that way.

51
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:33,761
Wasn't it some anime song?

52
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:38,405
It did sound like Yoko Okino's song.

53
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:41,483
It sounded like classical music to me.

54
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:44,610
Why don't you just ask her?

55
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,864
Of course, I did, but she said, "It's a secret".

56
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,122
Nothing to be concerned about.

57
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,834
It's probably some dumb song that's popular now.

58
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,828
Well, I'm sorry.

59
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:00,138
It's some dumb song that＆s popular now.

60
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:01,763
Haibara.

61
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,738
Why don't you stop keeping them in suspense and tell them already.

62
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,388
I want to know too.

63
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:15,720
No way. Absolutely not.

64
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,045
-What? -What?

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,260
Hey, Haibara!

66
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,661
If you want to know that badly

67
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,661
why don't you deduce what it is, Mr. Detective?

68
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:29,892
What?

69
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,445
Deduce?

70
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:42,413
Hey! Your turn's coming up!

71
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,346
Hey, Doc.

72
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:47,371
Do you know what song Haibara's been listening to recently?

73
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,482
What?

74
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:53,181
It could be the opening theme song of a drama she's hooked on now.

75
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:57,538
She doesn't watch many dramas,

76
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:03,061
but she watched the Big Osaka special on Higo several times.

77
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:09,153
She was watching the program when the soccer team that he captained

78
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:13,590
finished 2nd in the high school soccer tournament.

79
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,590
He's said to be considerate of his juniors

80
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,654
and still goes to watch the games held at his alma mater when he has time.

81
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:26,483
Well, the baseball team of his school seems to be more popular these days.

82
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:30,603
Higo went to a high school in Kanto?

83
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,634
Oh, that's right.

84
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:35,548
Come to think of it, on that special,

85
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:38,489
his teammate Sanada came on.

86
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:43,078
He revealed Higo's unusual hobbies and all.

87
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:45,889
-Doc, stop right there. -What?

88
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:50,469
Too bad. Go suffer forever.

89
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:55,413
That jerk.

90
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,893
I wonder if it has something to do with Higo after all.

91
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:01,239
Ai is a great fan of his too.

92
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:06,417
But Higo's favorite song isn't listed on his website.

93
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:09,175
Maybe it's just not posted yet.

94
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,965
Then we'd never find out.

95
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:15,458
No. There's still a way.

96
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:21,210
We'll just wiretap.

97
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:24,075
Wiretap?

98
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:28,464
You boot the record app of the cell phone like this

99
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,409
and darken the display.

100
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:37,302
See? Even if she were to see it, she wouldn't know.

101
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:42,368
Ayumi, put this in your pocket and approach Haibara.

102
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:46,381
While Mitsuhiko, Genta and I, are flying the kite

103
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:49,143
and when Haibara is off her guard

104
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:52,603
and starts humming the song,

105
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:58,649
the identity of the song will be made as plain as day.

106
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:04,308
Conan, your face looks kind of scary.

107
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:07,485
It's not a deduction.

108
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:10,089
It seems more like a crime.

109
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:15,484
Next up, Detective Squad Team, Cafe Renno Team.

110
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:21,127
Teams Detective Squad and Cafe Renno, please get ready.

111
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,723
-That's us. -It's finally come.

112
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:28,421
-We're counting on you, Ayumi. -Yep.

113
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,261
Okay, let's go!

114
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,413
How's this?

115
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,985
A little more behind so the wind hits in from the front!

116
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:42,089
-Okay! -Got it!

117
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,906
Don't step on the tails of the kite!

118
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,892
-The time's finally come. -You can do it!

119
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:01,050
Are you curious about this song too?

120
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,555
Yep.

121
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,923
Okay, if you promise not to tell Conan, I'll tell you.

122
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:08,797
This song is...

123
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:12,694
No! Don't tell me!

124
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:18,568
Because it's wrong to secretly record a girl's secret after all!

125
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,910
Secretly record?

126
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:24,361
-Don't tell me he... -Yep.

127
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,754
Conan told me to record your humming.

128
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:33,166
-That dirty detective. -What?

129
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,057
Okay! Now!

130
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:48,924
We did it!

131
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:57,705
-Amazing! -It's flying pretty high!

132
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,491
What?

133
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:05,239
Oh, no!

134
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,955
-The tail... -It tore off!

135
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:12,534
Darn!

136
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:31,704
It's falling!

137
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,323
-No joke? -Our kite?

138
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,330
What?

139
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,204
Hey, watch out!

140
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,855
"Ryota Renno (39)" -Gosh.

141
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,084
"Kite Flying Event Participant" -What's going on? Are you with somebody?

142
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:49,945
Brats, just brats. They dropped their kite.

143
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:54,076
I told you that I was going to a kite-flying contest this afternoon.

144
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,481
I wonder about that.

145
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:56,943
How am I supposed to trust...

146
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,195
"Takami Renno (35)" -a husband that lies to his wife...

147
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,990
"Ryoto's Wife" -and having an affair with some woman?

148
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,295
What woman are you talking about?

149
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,660
Bring her to me, will you?

150
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,102
What's with you? Venting your guilt out on me?

151
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:11,837
You couldn't even if you wanted to.

152
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:12,924
What?

153
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:16,893
Because my younger sister cut her wrist in the tub last night

154
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:21,794
and is lying unconscious in serious condition on a hospital bed right now.

155
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,824
She may be a stupid girl who believed you when you told her

156
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,770
that you'd leave your wife and marry her...

157
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:33,837
but she's still my dear younger sister.

158

"Yuitoshi Kakura (41)" -Come see me after this is over.

159
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:38,092
"Kite Flying Event Participant" -I could

160
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,960
settle things right now if you want.

161
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:46,352
Hey, Renno! What're you doing?

162
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,248
Not over there!

163
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,463
Farther back, back!

164
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:52,441
Sorry.

00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:56,078
Well, be careful.

166
00:11:57,168 --> 00:12:01,527
Your partner Yatsukoshi was also head over heels over her.

167
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:02,762
"Takeshi Yatsukoshi (34), Kite Flying Event Participant."

168
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,322
Fly your kites as high as you can!

169
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:09,762
Each team has 15 minutes!

170
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,116
No cell phone has been turned in at lost and found.

171
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:19,241
Did you really drop it in front of this make-shift restroom?

172
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,033
I think so.

173
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,863
It felt like I dropped something after I used the bathroom

174
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:25,769
and took out my handkerchief.

175
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:29,113
Why didn't you pick it up right away then?

176
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,173
Because...

177
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:34,069
I heard the announcement say

178
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,619
that it was our team's turn.

179
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:36,940
I see.

180
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,519
Then, do you remember anybody back then that was near you?

181
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,312
Somebody tripped behind me.

182
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,522
I didn't see their face, though.

183
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:55,165
They may have thought that they tripped and dropped the cell phone

184
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,146
and picked it up.

185
00:12:57,572 --> 00:13:00,619
If they tripped, they must've been in a hurry.

186
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,373
Most probably so.

187
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:06,500
If so, maybe that person flew his kite

188
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,667
at the same time as the boys.

189
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:13,415
Then, when they come back,

190
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:16,538
we can try and ring the cell phone.

191
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:19,478
No good.

192
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:22,438
The bamboo stick of the frame broke.

193
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:25,863
This won't fly even if we replace the tail.

194
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:27,323
Darn.

195
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:30,145
-Maybe... -What?

196
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:32,850
We're being punished by heaven.

197
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,716
Punished? For wiretapping?

198
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:38,367
Hey, what're you doing?

199
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:41,604
If you move back any farther...

200
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:44,851
What?

201
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:05,517
-Hey, that man... -He fell into the Teimuzu River!

202
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:08,651
-Mitsuhiko, call an ambulance! -Okay!

203
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,642
This is bad! He can't swim!

204
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:16,237
Somebody. Please help him!

205
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,211
This way. Hang on!

206
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,842
-You'll make it. -An accident?

207
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,542
Dear?

208
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,267
What's up, Dear? Dear!

209
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,111
Hey, answer me! Dear!

210
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:36,207
No, this is...

211
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:40,383
not an accident.

212
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,167
If you move back any farther...

213
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:53,879
What?

214
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,614
-Hey, that man... -He fell into the Teimuzu River!

215
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:06,384
-Mitsuhiko, call the ambulance! -Okay!

216
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:12,015
This is bad! He can't swim!

217
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:14,404
Somebody. Please help him!

218
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,357
This way. Hang on! You'll make it.

219
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,912
-An accident? -Dear?

220
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,650
What's up, Dear? Dear!

221
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:32,412
Hey, answer me! Dear!

222
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,446
No, this is...

223
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,901
not an accident.

224
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:02,026
He drank a lot of water so is unconscious and in serious condition,

225
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:05,423
Yes. So who fell in the river?

226
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:08,948
The owner of a Cafe in this neighborhood.

227
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,103
Mr. Ryota Renno, age 39.

228
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,319
According to eyewitness reports,

229
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:18,100
Mr. Renno was holding his kite like this and walking backwards.

230
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,087
Unfortunately, from between those pikes where the rope was cut,

231
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:27,987
he slipped and fell into the river.

232
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:34,870
I see.

233
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,070
The ends of the rope are pretty old and worn out.

234
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:43,694
I'm sure it was cut some time ago, but left unattended.

235
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,774
This seems to be an accident,

236
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,766
I guess we can leave the rest up to the local police.

237
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:49,951
Yes, sir.

238
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:51,983
I don't think this is an accident.

239
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:54,864
Conan?

240
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:57,234
It's not an accident?

241
00:16:57,354 --> 00:17:02,726
Officer Takagi, can you try connecting both ends of the rope?

242
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:05,281
What? Yeah.

243
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,597
What?

244
00:17:10,717 --> 00:17:12,947
See? They don't reach, right?

245
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,622
Yeah.

246
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:19,383
But if it was exposed for some time to wind and rain,

247
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:21,528
the rope would shorten.

248
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:23,531
But...

249
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:29,274
this rope below... See, it's too long.

250
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:32,599
Even if this were to be connected it would be dangling

251
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:34,591
and of no use.

252
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,845
True.

253
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:38,591
Besides, this rope...

254
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:41,376
the color's changed on one side,

255
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:44,206
but the underside isn't.

256
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:46,300
But why?

257
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,999
Maybe the rope of the post at the far end was used.

258
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:54,135
The rope of the post at the far end?

259
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:55,353
Yes.

260
00:17:55,811 --> 00:18:01,819
The rope at the far end would've been exposed to rain and totally worn out.

261
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:06,605
That rope was untied, the length was matched and tied here.

262
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:11,921
To make it look like the rope was cut from some time ago.

263
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,753
The color on one side of the rope wasn't changed

264
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:19,353
because the rope that was originally tied onto the post was used.

265
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:23,046
I see.

266
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:26,927
Mitsuhiko and Genta are confirming it now,

267
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,522
so I think we'll find out soon.

268
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:33,975
It's just like you said, Conan!

269
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:39,189
The rope of the post before the one at the farthest end...

270
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,444
was newly cut

271
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:45,762
and wasn't connected to the post at the farthest end next to it.

272
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,006
Hey!

273
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:55,062
The post at the farthest end on the other side had no rope tied onto it!

274
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,549
See?

275
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,573
But who on earth would do such a thing?

276
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:04,677
And for what?

277
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,213
Beats me, I'm just a kid.

278
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,368
-I guess so. -He's right.

279
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,821
But maybe...

280
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:25,237
it was to make the man who drowned, fall into the river.

281
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:28,243
It can't be.

282
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:31,489
That man slipped on his own and...

283
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:37,709
But that man was backing down holding the kite like this, right?

284
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:41,431
At times like this we're not careful about how things are behind us, right?

285
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:45,329
No. Because we know that the rope is there.

286
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:50,195
We may be careful not to step on the tails of the kite, though.

287
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:54,105
Then, if you can skillfully lure the man

288
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:56,005
between the posts that have no rope,

289
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,751
maybe you can make him fall.

290
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,799
True.

291
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,044
If so, the perp is...

292
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:06,045
The suspicious ones...

293
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:12,375
are that plump man who was on the same team as the man who drowned.

294
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,141
If they were on the same team,

295
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:20,967
he could've told the man who drowned where to stand, right?

296
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:25,155
Not over there! Farther back, back!

297
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:32,090
And the man next to him of sturdy built.

298
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:39,243
That man was talking to the man who drowned before he fell into the river.

299
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:42,234
Come see me after this is over.

300
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:46,568
I could settle things right now if you want.

301
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:49,795
Okay. Get details from the two.

302
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,675
And,

303
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:57,113
the man who drowned was also talking on the phone with somebody

304
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:00,098
just before falling into the river.

305
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,971
If you move back any farther...

306
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:06,401
What?

307
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:10,290
-What? -Do you know who he was talking to?

308
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:12,513
From the cell phone that was on the ground...

309
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:13,799
Dear?

310
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:17,005
What's up, Dear? Dear!

311
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,846
Hey, answer me! Dear!

312
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:22,109
Is what I heard.

313
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:25,212
I think it was the man's wife.

314
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,840
Contact his residence right away.

315
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,840
But I answered the cell phone that was on the ground

316
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:35,049
and told her that her husband fell into the river,

317
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:39,579
she rushed over here and got on the ambulance with him.

318
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:44,664
Get her back right away

319
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:48,673
as a prime suspect to an alleged murder.

320
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:50,212
Yes, sir.

321
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:57,518
This is an ingeniously planned premeditated murder.

322
00:21:57,638 --> 00:22:01,534
It's most likely that the perp is one of the three.

323
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:05,377
But...

324
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:09,707
how did the perp carry this out

325
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:12,146
at a crowded kite flying event?

326
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:16,707
And just who is the perp?

327
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:43,344
"Next Episode" -You're saying that I lured Renno to where the rope was cut

328
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:45,104
and made him fall into the river?

329
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,601
He was probably punished by heaven and fell into the river.

330
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:51,744
Why on earth do I have to be suspected?

331
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,686
There may be some other perp besides those three.

332
00:23:55,806 --> 00:24:00,202
But there's got to be a way...

333
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,050
I don't think there is.

334
00:24:04,257 --> 00:24:05,337
Next Conan,

335
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:08,892
"Teimuzu River Kite-Flying Case (Part 2)"

336
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:27,017
Next Conan's Hint:

337
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,062
"Kite string."

338
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,592
Why are kites called "Tako" (Octopus) in Japanese?

339
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:32,662
Would you have preferred to call them "Ika" (Squids)?

340
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:34,262
No, I'd prefer "Ebi" (Shrimps).
