1
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:21,196
The victim is Mr. Tatsuya Amagi who lives in a condo nearby.

2
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:23,896
And the person who was the first to discover the body

3
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:28,196
was Mr. Tameo Fukuda, who just happened to be passing by.

4
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:31,596
Yes. I was surprised and called the police.

5
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:32,996
From the looks of the corpse,

6
00:00:32,997 --> 00:00:35,896
he was killed last night at around 9pm.

7
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,596
It seems he was stabbed in the torso several times

8
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:41,696
with an awl or something that has a sharp tip.

9
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:44,196
The great sum of money in his pocket was left untouched

10
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:47,296
and from the ruthless way that he was murdered...

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,696
A murder motivated by hatred.

12
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:50,996
-Conan! -Conan!

13
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:54,496
Oh, I saw the police and came running after it.

14
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:57,996
Who in the world could've done something like this?

15
00:00:57,997 --> 00:00:59,196
Mr. Mouri.

16
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:01,896
Well, I happened to see the police, you see.

17
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:03,596
I tell you, both of you...

18
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:04,697
But...

19
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:09,596
Inspector.

20
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:11,196
It seems that the victim Mr. Amagi

21
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,596
was hated by everyone in the neighborhood.

22
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:15,597
It seems to be so.

23
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:18,596
He asked for it.

24
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:20,197
Good riddance!

25
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:44,196
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

26
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:46,596
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

27
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:48,896
The rubberneckers respond in a curious way.

28
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:51,096
A chain reaction of cases starts in the neighborhood.

29
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:52,796
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:55,096
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:57,697
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:31,611
"The Shifting Mystery of Beika City (Part 1)"

33
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,316
It seems that Mr. Tatsuya Amagi who was living off his parent's inheritance

34
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:42,517
came to this town about three months ago.

35
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,816
He used to ride his large motorbike be it day or night

36
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:11,116
and the boisterous sound of his motorbike

37
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,916
seems to have annoyed the residents

38
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:16,816
of this quiet residential district to no end.

39
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:20,416
If so, all they had to do was tell him to quiet down.

40
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,416
We tried...

41
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,517
But...

42
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:26,516
Excuse me.

43
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:30,616
What? What do you want with me?

44
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,417
Well...

45
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:42,116
What is it all of you ganging up on me like that?

46
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:43,516
It hurts.

47
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,016
Talk about lame!

48
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:47,817
What the heck did you come here for?

49
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:53,416
He was dreadfully obnoxious.

50
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,816
In other words, the victim Mr. Tatsuya Amagi

51
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,416
was an unthinkably annoying person

52
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,916
who was not like by everybody including you, Mr. Tameo Fukuda,

53
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,016
who was the first to discover him.

54
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:07,017
And everyone in the neighborhood had a motive to want to kill him too.

55
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:11,016
What do we have to be suspect for a guy like him?

56
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:12,216
He got what he deserved.

57
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:15,217
-The heavens punished him. -We're the victims.

58
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,616
We wouldn't kill him just because of something like that!

59
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:23,516
After all, we had already asked the community head Mr. Bando

60
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,116
to take care of the situation!

61
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,316
Are you referring to Mr. Hikoichi Bando?

62
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,616
Yes.

63
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:30,816
Do you know him?

64
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:34,116
Yeah, I found this beside the corpse.

65
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:37,416
His hospital card.

66
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:41,516
Could it be that Mr. Bando the community head

67
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:45,016
called Mr. Tatsuya Amagi out to give him a piece of his mind...

68
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:47,216
But, Mr. Amagi wouldn't lend a ear

69
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:50,617
so he stabbed him multiple times to death out of rage?

70
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,016
Let's go see Mr. Bando next then.

71
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:55,416
We'll leave this scene to the local authorities.

72
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,616
Yes, sir, we'll handle it!

73
00:05:57,617 --> 00:06:00,216
Pops, to drop something that would give away his identity immediately

74
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:03,516
at a murder site is a bit too careless, don't you think?

75
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:06,616
Let's go take a look at that careless fellow.

76
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,917
He was punished.

77
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:12,817
Amagi got what he deserved.

78
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:18,216
"Hikoichi Bando (35), Community Head"

79
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:19,817
"Hikoichi Bando (35), Community Head" -Mr. Bando!

80
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,616
Mr. Bando!

81
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,616
Are you all right?

82
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,917
Mr. Bando!

83
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,516
No good. He's dead.

84
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:32,416
From the looks of it, I think last night he was already...

85
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:35,016
He drank pesticide mixed in his liquor

86
00:06:35,017 --> 00:06:36,716
and was poisoned to death.

87
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:40,016
Hey, this is blood, isn't it?

88
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:43,416
I guess it's the weapon that was used to kill Mr. Tatsuya Amagi.

89
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,716
I guess the perp committed suicide and this concludes the case.

90
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:48,716
Does it mean that the murderer is dead?

91
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,116
No.

92
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,616
But...

93
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,516
At any rate, get forensics.

94
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:54,517
Yes, sir.

95
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:02,416
Mr. Hikoichi Bando.

96
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:06,216
It seems he had a nice personality but it was not that dependable.

97
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:10,016
It seems that he was forced to become the community head too...

98
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,716
Only because the Bando family

99
00:07:11,717 --> 00:07:14,516
owned more than half of all the land in this district.

100
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,816
So he couldn't refuse and took the job on reluctantly.

101
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,716
Even so, if the residents pushes him to do something,

102
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:22,016
he couldn't have avoided talking to Mr. Amagi...

103
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:24,316
Of course.

104
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:27,217
We're all paying community fees after all, you know.

105
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:33,616
Apparently that woman, Ms. Hiro Ezaki, was pestering him the most.

106
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,516
She does look like a strong woman.

107
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,516
It seems that he was not all that dependent,

108
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:40,916
so he carried that awl to protect himself.

109
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:44,616
What do you want, asking me to come to a place like this?

110
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:45,716
That...

111
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:47,016
What?

112
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,816
Come on, say it!

113
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,416
Just what do you want?

114
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:54,116
So, Mr. Bando who panicked,

115
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:56,017
probably in advertently...

116
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:10,817
But since Mr. Bando figured he couldn't get away with it...

117
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,216
Gave up and committed suicide.

118
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:17,617
I guess you could say this is a bitter type of case closed.

119
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:20,517
Don't rush to conclusions.

120
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:24,516
Well, then I guess everything worked out right.

121
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,616
That unreliable useless guy

122
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:30,316
finally was of some use to the community.

123
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:33,616
To stab a nuisance who was hated by everyone,

124
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:36,017
how convenient can things get.

125
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:43,616
But I don't think so.

126
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:47,916
Mr. Bando would never be able to cause such an incident.

127
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,216
Really?

128
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:51,416
If it wasn't inadvertently...

129
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,016
To begin, Mr. Bando was not all that concerned

130
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,516
about Mr. Amagi being a problem.

131
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:59,416
Even yesterday, he was laughing about it.

132
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,816
I'd like you to give me more in detail.

133
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,016
You are...

134
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:05,516
I'm Toyoko Kanemitsu.

135
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:09,116
Oh, you can't cross that line.

136
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:13,316
Then why don't we go to my place to talk?

137
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:15,916
No, we don't need to go out of our way to move places.

138
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,016
Right.

139
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:20,516
Oh my god, you're the famed Detective Mouri, aren't you?

140
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,016
Please do come over too, Mr. Mouri.

141
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:25,016
I run a small coffee right nearby.

142
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:26,916
Really?

143
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,016
Okay, then.

144
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:29,317
Hey...

145
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,816
Here you are.

146
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:42,517
Thank you.

147
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,116
Here you go.

148
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:49,716
Thank you.

149
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:52,616
When did Mr. Bando came yesterday?

150
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,016
"Koyuki Gamo (23), Waitress" -Oh...

151
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,716
I think it was a little past noon.

152
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:57,916
That's right.

153
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:01,716
He was together with his friend Mr. Yosuke Chino,

154
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:04,917
who teaches Japanese History at Haido University.

155
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,216
I had this assessed

156
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:09,616
and found out that it wasn't worth much either.

157
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:12,816
Too bad, Mr. Bando.

158
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:15,016
I wasn't expecting anything so...

159
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:17,816
You spent days assessing the things in the storeroom,

160
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,116
didn't you, Mr. Chino?

161
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:23,616
Yes. Hoping to find some sort of treasure...

162
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:26,716
But, all there was were outdated worthless things

163
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:27,916
in the storeroom.

164
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,016
But, it's a historical residence and yet,

165
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:33,616
I wonder if there's such a thing as no treasure whatsoever.

166
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,116
True.

167
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:37,917
But Chino, who's a professional said so, so...

168
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:43,416
Right, there were no treasures whatsoever.

169
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,516
I shouldn't be laughing.

170
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,216
Because the residence are pushing me to do something

171
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:49,416
about that nuisance of a guy.

172
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,516
You haven't gone to talk to him yet?

173
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,516
I'm not at home with things like that.

174
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:55,617
I'll do something about it in time.

175
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,116
That was yesterday afternoon, correct?

176
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:09,016
So Mr. Bando would never have gone to talk to Mr. Amagi that night.

177
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,817
Right, it's unthinkable.

178
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:13,816
-But... -But...

179
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,816
Beside, Mr. Hikoichi Bando,

180
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:17,916
I wonder if he really committed suicide.

181
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,416
What bothers me is the lock of the front door.

182
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,316
The door was unlocked when we arrived.

183
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:26,316
If he were going to commit suicide, he would've locked the door, right?

184
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:28,816
So that nobody would interfere.

185
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:29,817
What...

186
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:32,516
-It's starting to get tough... -This is Megure.

187
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,517
Yeah.

188
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:35,616
I got it.

189
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:37,116
It's from forensics.

190
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:40,116
It seems that the poison was that pesticide

191
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:43,617
and it seemed to have been mixed inside the bottle.

192
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:45,417
If he were going to commit suicide,

193
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,016
he would put the poison in the glass cup, right?

194
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:49,316
If put in the bottle, the poison would be diluted, right?

195
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,916
This is a murder made to look like suicide.

196
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,816
But if so...

197
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:57,716
If so, this perp is careless, right?

198
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,416
Because his method would be exposed right away

199
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,316
and he even forgot to lock the front door.

200
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:04,516
If Mr. Bando didn't commit suicide,

201
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,916
what about Mr. Amagi's murder?

202
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:10,016
So, I don't think Mr. Bando is the perp.

203
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:13,916
Because Mr. Amagi was stabbed by an awl, right?

204
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,216
What? It's wasn't him for sure!

205
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:20,116
-Because... -Mr. Bando had a fear of needles.

206
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:21,216
What?

207
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:24,116
He couldn't tolerate anything sharp,

208
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:26,716
and just looking at things like that would make him shiver.

209
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:30,216
Are you saying that he could've never used an awl, then?

210
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:33,616
The real perp X did everything.

211
00:12:33,617 --> 00:12:35,816
Right, that would be it.

212
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:39,516
That X murdered Mr. Tatsuya Amagi.

213
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:43,016
In order to make it look like Mr. Hikoichi Bando did it,

214
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:45,916
he murdered Mr. Bando and made it look like a suicide.

215
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,516
That was most probably what happened.

216
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,916
-Yes. -Yes.

217
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:52,616
Things like that actually happened, don't they?

218
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:55,217
Although there were many like that in there.

219
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,316
You like mysteries, don't you?

220
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,816
Mrs. Kanemitsu.

221
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:03,216
You also have a lot of specialized magazines too.

222
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:06,516
But, they're not the latest and you have only one each.

223
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:10,116
She's probably only buying them when her favorite writer is featured.

224
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:14,817
At any rate, the problem is who is the real perp X.

225
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,917
Boss told me to deliver this to you, Inspector.

226
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:25,316
It was found under the sofa of the scene of the crime.

227
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:29,716
Since the housekeeper happened to come by, I confirmed and...

228
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:32,016
"Eiko Hayama (55)" -It's not Mr. Bando's.

229
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:34,316
Because he doesn't smoke.

230
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:37,916
Besides, yesterday evening when I left,

231
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,116
there was no such thing under the sofa.

232
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:44,016
If it's as the housekeeper says,

233
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:47,616
somebody who came over after evening dropped it.

234
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:50,616
So, it could belong to the perp.

235
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,216
That lighter...

236
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:55,717
-Remember? -Oh! It's Mr. Chino's!

237
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:10,371
Mr. Chino and Mr. Bando met at this shop, didn't they?

238
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:13,971
Yes, I saw him use it back then too.

239
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:17,671
It sounds a bit odd, though, Inspector.

240
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:18,971
They met in the afternoon

241
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:22,372
and yet they met again after evening too.

242
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:25,671
What about that housekeeper?

243
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,871
We're having her stay at the house.

244
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,372
Excuse us.

245
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:39,571
Is the police suspecting Mr. Chino?

246
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,472
No, it can't be.

247
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,071
This lighter wasn't there, was it?

248
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:47,171
No.

249
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:51,071
On my way home yesterday, I dropped some coins.

250
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:54,171
Gosh, this far inside...

251
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:56,671
Great, I found them all.

252
00:14:56,672 --> 00:15:00,471
Back then, if it were there I would've noticed.

253
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:03,171
So it was dropped after evening.

254
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,971
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

255
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,272
Not at all.

256
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:13,971
Are you seriously saying that Mr. Chino is the perp?

257
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:16,371
Since his thing was found at the site,

258
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:18,171
he would become one of the suspects.

259
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:21,571
If he were a friend, it's natural for him to bring a gift along too.

260
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,571
He could slyly promote Mr. Bando to drink too.

261
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:25,571
What a disgusting off the point pair.

262
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:27,171
-What? -What?

263
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:29,171
Off the point?

264
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,871
The perp killed Mr. Amagi

265
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:35,271
and tried to make it look as if Mr. Bando had done it, correct?

266
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:38,571
But, Mr. Chino is not a resident of this town.

267
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:42,471
So it wasn't as though Mr. Amagi was bothering him.

268
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:47,372
In other words, Mr. Chino has no motive to kill Mr. Amagi!

269
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:50,271
At this point, not yet...

270
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:52,771
Mr. Yosuke Chino has no motive.

271
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:55,571
He has no motive to kill Mr. Tatsuya Amagi.

272
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:58,571
Without a motive, he couldn't be the perp, could he?

273
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:01,871
-I got it! -It's the opposite!

274
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:03,271
The opposite?

275
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,871
The one that Mr. Chino wanted to erase

276
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:08,371
from the face of this earth was Mr. Hikoichi Bando.

277
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:09,372
What?

278
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:11,171
He tried to make it look like suicide

279
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:14,071
so that the police wouldn't suspect him.

280
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,971
But, you need a motive to commit suicide.

281
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:19,171
So, Mr. Chino took advantage of the fact that

282
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:22,272
Mr. Bando was being pressed to do something about Mr. Amagi.

283
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:31,072
After murdering Mr. Amagi...

284
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,571
By making it look as if Mr. Bando had killed him,

285
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:43,371
he created a motive for suicide.

286
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:46,271
If we consider that Mr. Amagi was killed

287
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,371
only to make Mr. Bando's death look like suicide...

288
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:52,571
It's only natural that we can find no motive.

289
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:57,271
If so, why would Mr. Chino think of killing Mr. Bando in the first place?

290
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:58,371
-That's... -That's...

291
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,572
-That's the point. -That's the fundamental part.

292
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,471
We're back to where we started.

293
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:06,271
That's why I'm saying that you're off the point.

294
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:08,671
What did he stand to gain from killing his friend?

295
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:11,271
If there's some treasure involved, it would be a different story.

296
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:12,272
Treasure?

297
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:13,871
That's it!

298
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,471
That's what it was!

299
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:16,571
When he checked the place out,

300
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:19,771
Mr. Chino probably found an extraordinarily precious treasure.

301
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,071
He figured he'd get a hold of it by getting Mr. Bando out of the way.

302
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:25,371
But, I hear no treasure was found.

303
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:26,771
Mr. Chino was lying.

304
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:28,771
But, even you, Mrs. Kanemitsu said so yourself.

305
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:30,671
But, it's a historical residence and yet,

306
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:35,871
I wonder if there's such a thing as no treasure whatsoever.

307
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:38,371
If we think on that line, everything falls into place.

308
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:39,771
It's not impossible.

309
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:42,071
If Mr. Bando had any treasure...

310
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:44,772
So, this time for sure the case is closed.

311
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:50,572
This was a kind of ABC Murder Case too, wasn't it?

312
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,372
Although just a coincidence, the names of the three...

313
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:59,571
Their initials are A, B and C.

314
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:03,171
Was the ABC Murder Case written by Agatha Christie?

315
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,471
The people are murdered in chronological order.

316
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:07,471
Don't tell me that Yosuke Chino, whose initial is C

317
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:09,371
is also already gotten rid of?

318
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:11,072
Don't be kidding!

319
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,071
That can't be...

320
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:15,571
Can it?

321
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,872
But it's a bit concerning, isn't it?

322
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:22,772
I guess I was the one who was off the point.

323
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,771
I'm Chino.

324
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:29,971
He's okay.

325
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:31,171
Yeah.

326
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,871
Don't tell me, Conan, not again?

327
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:35,871
Pops asked me to go check.

328
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,871
I'd like to talk to you a bit.

329
00:18:37,872 --> 00:18:41,471
About the murder of Mr. Amagi as well as Mr. Bando.

330
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:44,871
What? Mr. Bando's been killed?

331
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:46,271
Your suspicions are groundless.

332
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,771
I've never met a person named Amagi.

333
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:51,771
The last I met Bando was at a coffee shop in the afternoon

334
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:52,971
and I never went to his residence.

335
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:55,071
But, we found this.

336
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:58,971
It's mine, but I lost it somewhere.

337
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,171
Take anything from him or not,

338
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,671
there was not a thing that could be called a treasure

339
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:04,171
in that storeroom to begin with.

340
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:05,771
You'll see if you investigate.

341
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:07,171
Telling us to investigate,

342
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:09,971
it could mean that you already stole it when you were assessing.

343
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:12,971
You didn't want it to be exposed so you killed Mr. Bando.

344
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:14,571
No.

345
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:17,571
It seems you're insisting on making me the perp.

346
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:20,371
I was home all day yesterday!

347
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:22,071
Was someone with you?

348
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:23,771
I was alone!

349
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,171
I was judging some application papers!

350
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,071
Application papers?

351
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:30,071
For the new writer's award.

352
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:32,571
I'm sometimes asked to judge for the preliminary contest

353
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,671
hosted by mystery magazines,

354
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:36,571
because I used to be the head of the mystery club

355
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:38,271
during my university days.

356
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,271
That's why I get asked by mystery clubs here and there.

357
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,171
You're an expert on mysteries.

358
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:46,371
In other words, you have no one to verify your alibi!

359
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:48,471
I'm not in need for money.

360
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:50,171
I have no reason to steal.

361
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:53,371
We'll hear you out at the station in detail.

362
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:54,671
Hold it!

363
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:56,171
Hear me out!

364
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:58,771
Hey, wait!

365
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:01,071
Inspector, it bothered you too, didn't it?

366
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:02,571
That a mystery expert

367
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:04,871
would put poison inside the bottle instead of the cup

368
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,971
or make such careless mistakes

369
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,971
like keeping the door unlocked, right?

370
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:11,671
He should also know all about

371
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:13,371
how to provide an alibi for himself and yet,

372
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:15,371
to have nothing prepared is unbelievable.

373
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:18,771
Which means that Mr. Chino is not the real perp X.

374
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:21,071
But, there's a possibility that he was just framed.

375
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:22,971
That's impossible.

376
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,271
-Pops. -Mr. Mouri.

377
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:27,371
I came to take a look at the face of Mr. Yosuke Chino too.

378
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,371
What do you mean by it's impossible?

379
00:20:29,372 --> 00:20:32,871
If there was another real perp who killed Mr. Tatsuya Amagi

380
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:34,571
and Mr. Hikoichi Bando

381
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,971
and wanted to frame Mr. Chino for both murders,

382
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,571
the perp would've also gotten rid of Mr. Chino.

383
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,971
Then he would've indeed have to make it look like suicide.

384
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:45,171
That way, the case would be closed.

385
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:48,371
True, the perp who killed both men,

386
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,871
wouldn't kill Mr. Chino too.

387
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:52,571
Now that he mentioned it, it's true.

388
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:56,771
The fact that he is still alive is evidence above all

389
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,271
that he is the real perp.

390
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:01,571
It makes sense.

391
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:03,771
That's true, but...

392
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,871
I think we were over thinking.

393
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:06,872
We're going home.

394
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:09,772
The police will take care of things from here and make him confess.

395
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,172
Maybe...

396
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:21,971
Did I keep you waiting?

397
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:24,071
Oh, no...

398
00:21:24,072 --> 00:21:25,971
Are you sure nobody saw you?

399
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:28,571
Of course no one did. Let's go.

400
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:29,572
Okay.

401
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:41,972
Good for him.

402
00:21:42,772 --> 00:21:46,371
I'm sure the perp deliberately didn't kill Mr. Chino.

403
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,372
The real perp X!

404
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,271
What? Back then...

405
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,671
The customers here were...

406
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,072
If I remember correctly...

407
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:05,271
Oh, Mr. Fukuda and his family

408
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:07,471
and Ms. Hiro Ezaki were here with her friends.

409
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:08,971
What?

410
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:11,771
The one who first discovered Mr. Amagi's corpse

411
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:15,771
and the lady who was pushing Mr. Bando to do his thing were also here.

412
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:19,672
If so, the real perp X is...

413
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:45,271
The fact that Bando had a fear of needles

414
00:23:45,272 --> 00:23:49,771
and couldn't use an awl is something I knew.

415
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:53,272
Does Mr. Fukuda only work night shifts?

416
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,071
It would be difficult for him to commit the crime.

417
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:59,771
What are you snooping around me for?

418
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,171
See you then.

419
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:02,271
Oh, hey!

420
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:03,871
Wait up! You brat!

421
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:06,872
Does the name Yamiyo Dorosue sound familiar?

422
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:08,871
