1
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:06,390
Are you sure?

2
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:10,690
Yes. There was a camera in the lowest basement floor.

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,490
Ordinary people don't use cameras with lenses like that.

4
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:17,390
Which means, it was Kaneko after all?

5
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:19,690
We're checking on it now.

6
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:23,690
I'm sorry if we find him there.

7
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,490
We checked all the keys of the basement.

8
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,390
It's not your fault.

9
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:32,090
You're victims too.

10
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,491
Of the ruthless perp.

11
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:38,290
Sonoko and the others just left.

12
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,290
Didn't you give them a lift back?

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,490
They wanted to ride home with the car that came to pick Sonoko up.

14
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,190
Right.

15
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:46,390
We found it!

16
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:48,290
The corpse of Eiji Kaneko.

17
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,591
And...

18
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,590
My god.

19
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,090
Can you fix it?

20
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,990
Even if it were to be fixed...

21
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:59,190
It was found in Kaneko's camera bag?

22
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,890
Yes, near the corpse.

23
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,290
After stealing the mask,

24
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,990
he tried to get rid of the kid that got close to him

25
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:09,491
and got messed up in this.

26
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:13,090
Things don't go that well.

27
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:17,091
I guess that's the way the perp wants us to see it.

28
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,690
Didn't you go home with them?

29
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:26,690
It's bedtime for children,

30
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:29,091
but adults have a lot of things to do yet.

31
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,790
-Here. -Thanks!

32
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:35,990
If you had your glasses,

33
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:38,690
you would've found the exit sooner, right?

34
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:42,190
Yeah. I wasn't wearing my suspenders either,

35
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:44,290
so I really panicked.

36
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,290
To be lured out by someone who might've been the perp.

37
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,890
It's not like you.

38
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:52,190
That's because I was confident he wasn't the perp.

39
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:54,690
Huh? Ai, why are you here?

40
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:56,490
Weren't you with Sonoko and the others?

41
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,990
I was left behind.

42
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,090
No!

43
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:00,390
No, I lied.

44
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,590
Come on down.

45
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:03,990
Officer Chiba says he'll give us a lift.

46
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,890
What about Pops and the others?

47
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:07,891
They're going back to the practice hall

48
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:09,991
with Inspector Megure and the others.

49
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,290
You're going to have to take a bath when we get home, Conan.

50
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,590
Okay.

51
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,690
It must've been tough being trapped in there for so many hours, didn't you?

52
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,190
Yes.

53
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,090
Why don't you have her wash you down while you're at it?

54
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,691
Shut up!

55
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:28,090
I wonder what Pops and the others were talking about.

56
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,590
I didn't have time to wiretap them.

57
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:32,591
-Here. -Huh?

58
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,790
And when did you last see Mr. Kaneko?

59
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,990
In the afternoon. In my hospital room.

60
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,690
After Ebizo and Conan came to visit me.

61
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:46,591
What did Kaneko want to talk to you about?

62
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,990
Be honest about it!

63
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,890
Yes, sir.

64
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:54,991
You came to Kabukiza at midnight, didn't you?

65
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,490
What...

66
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:59,590
You don't have to hide it.

67
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,291
So, did you steal the mask?

68
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:08,090
So you didn't steal the two-faced mask?

69
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:10,390
I... I swear I didn't steal it.

70
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,790
If I did, I wouldn't... No way.

71
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,791
Did you really come here at midnight?

72
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:22,790
I couldn't stand staying in the hospital alone.

73
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,290
So I snuck out.

74
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,990
But I had no place to go.

75
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:28,591
And when I noticed I was...

76
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,290
But I lost the memo

77
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,990
that had the PIN for the front door written on it.

78
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,890
So I went back to the hospital.

79
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:40,390
You couldn't tell unless you had the memo?

80
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:44,490
Because I never came at a time like that.

81
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,590
Excuse me.

82
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:50,390
I'm the one who gave Mr. Iwami the PIN.

83
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:54,890
In that case, I will be arrested as an accomplice too.

84
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:56,990
So, like I said, I didn't take it.

85
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,990
-Mr. Minowa. -Yes, sir!

86
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:01,891
-Please sit down. -Yes, sir.

87
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:06,091
Mr. Kaneko took a picture of you back then.

88
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:11,890
Aren't you amazed at how good I got a shot of you coming in?

89
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:12,990
You're the kind of guy who ends up being hospitalized

90
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:15,890
just because you can't write the script.

91
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:16,990
As long as the mask goes missing,

92
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,391
I'll bet you thought that the performance would be canceled, right?

93
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:26,890
Iwami, you really didn't go to the room where the lockers are?

94
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,790
No, I didn't go.

95
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,290
The memo with the number on it

96
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,890
was found on the floor of that room.

97
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:37,590
That memo... Mr. Mouri, you got it from that boy, didn't you?

98
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:40,490
No, I know of no such memo.

99
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:42,190
That's awful!

100
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,890
Darn.

101
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,690
Excuse me.

102
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:50,590
I just found the call history left on Mr. Kaneko's cell phone.

103
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,990
Mr. Hosoo.

104
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:56,390
Didn't you receive a call at 15:05 today from Mr. Kaneko?

105
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:58,490
At around 15:00?

106
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:01,990
Weren't you having negotiations at Beika Hotel at that time?

107
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,590
Right.

108
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,591
I was having a business meeting,

109
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:06,790
so I had the phone on manner mode.

110
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,290
I had an incoming call from a number that I'm not familiar with.

111
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,290
That's the incoming call from Mr. Kaneko.

112
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,790
Did you ever receive a call from him before?

113
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,290
Never.

114
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,890
"I got the mask. How much will you pay me?"

115
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:21,190
Isn't that what he said?

116
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,590
I see.

117
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,090
Then, it was Kaneko after all?

118
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,390
No, Mr. Kaneko was just a pawn.

119
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:31,190
Somebody else was manipulating him.

120
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:34,190
It started with the attempted murder against Mr. Hosoo.

121
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,590
Then the theft of the two-faced mask,

122
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:39,090
onto the murder of secretary Mr. Takahashi.

123
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:44,290
Then finally to the abduction of Conan and the death of Mr. Kaneko!

124
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,990
Everything has fallen into line.

125
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:50,190
There is no case that I cannot solve!

126
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,690
Please gather all those involved here.

127
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:54,990
I will tell you what the truth of the case is.

128
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:55,991
What?

129
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:58,290
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri?

130
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,790
Isn't it a bit too early for that?

131
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,790
Thanks to my great deduction will be able to save time and money,

132
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,290
isn't that correct, Inspector?

133
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,890
So, you're that confident.

134
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:10,290
Gather everyone at this time of day?

135
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,790
President, tomorrow afternoon will do,

136
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,090
so let's rehearse on the main stage.

137
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,990
At this stage in the performance?

138
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,190
But the stage is not set yet.

139
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,191
No problem.

140
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,090
Please get everyone to come.

141
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,390
I understand.

142
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,890
I'll contact everyone right away.

143
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:28,390
What about the two-faced mask?

144
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:32,090
Even if it's cracked, I'll use it.

145
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,690
But it's really exciting that I get to see

146
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:36,090
the great deductive skills of the Sleeping Kogoro

147
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,590
right before my eyes.

148
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,290
Oh, boy. Talk about speed racing, Pops.

149
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,291
I've got to find back up evidence by tomorrow now.

150
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,790
But fine, I'll do it.

151
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,890
Where's my "thank you"?

152
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:54,090
When did you to it?

153
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:56,890
I used to be able to remember all the numbers before, but now...

154
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:59,390
I'll enter the number.

155
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,991
Then, push here last.

156
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,990
You put it on Ebizo?

157
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,290
Don't worry.

158
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,690
I'll take it off tomorrow.

159
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:12,191
I hope he wears the same jacket tomorrow.

160
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,791
I see. So that's why...

161
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,890
I got it.

162
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:24,491
He's the perp!

163
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,020
Please check on this for me.

164
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,820
What's this chip?

165
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,320
It was in Mr. Kaneko's camera.

166
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,021
What?

167
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:43,520
Sorry, I'm late.

168
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:46,720
How long did you intend to leave a helpless little girl all by herself?

169
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:49,520
Sorry. A helpless little girl.

170
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:51,320
And, what was inside it?

171
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:54,020
It's almost done.

172
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,420
Okay, done.

173
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,820
You go ahead and take it out of the camera without even telling me,

174
00:07:57,821 --> 00:07:59,920
and it's surprising how you can nag me that way.

175
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,320
Yeah, yeah. Sorry for the trouble.

176
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:05,220
Maybe I'll develop a new drug.

177
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,420
It's so heavy.

178
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:07,820
How many did he take anyway?

179
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,720
He is after all a cameraman.

180
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,320
So, what part concerns you?

181
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,020
All of them concern me but...

182
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:17,120
First of all, Mr. Takahashi's...

183
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,520
-Who is it? -Who is it?

184
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:19,820
Does he look familiar?

185
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,620
Nope. Not at all.

186
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:22,720
Let me check on it.

187
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,920
Thanks.

188
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,220
There's no time.

189
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,920
Since I was trapped for half a day,

190
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:28,821
I really got a late start.

191
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,920
Can you zoom that?

192
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:33,220
What's this?

193
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,820
Not the center, but to the left below.

194
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:38,121
Left below?

195
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,520
It's the same.

196
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,720
Is this the perp's stuff?

197
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:46,120
Yeah, it's his.

198
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,320
Then, he's there.

199
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,021
Hey, wait!

200
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:53,720
We're going back to the crime scene again?

201
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,820
Wasn't it a little farther down?

202
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:57,921
The place that I started the chase was.

203
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,620
Once daylight sets in, everything will come to light.

204
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,421
Let's go down to the railroad crossing.

205
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,120
If you didn't stop him,

206
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,820
he would've run right into the railroad crossing.

207
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,821
True, he wouldn't have been able to stop.

208
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,221
Haibara.

209
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,321
I found it.

210
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,920
I see.

211
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:36,420
Let's ask Officer Takagi and the others for help

212
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:39,121
and solve the mystery of the seven masks.

213
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,921
Yes!

214
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:44,720
Conan, you're still awake?

215
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:46,120
Mr. Mouri?

216
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,320
Yes...

217
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,520
You want me to check on it, right?

218
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:52,120
Easily done.

219
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,821
Bye then.

220
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:03,020
What's up, Conan? Are you still awake?

221
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,820
Yes, Mr. Mouri?

222
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:06,920
The convenience store?

223
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:12,820
Yes. Pops Kogoro asked me to ask you to check on this.

224
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,821
And...

225
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,020
You shouldn't be walking around at night.

226
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,420
Will you come pick us up without telling anybody?

227
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:19,021
We're first year grade school students.

228
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:57,020
Times may change,

229
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:04,820
but humans shall never

230
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:11,121
let go of their emotions!

231
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,821
Fantastic!

232
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:27,721
You can show your performance starting tomorrow already!

233
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:33,920
You're talented enough to put on such a performance

234
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:36,620
and yet, too bad, Ebizo.

235
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:40,121
However, you brought it upon yourself.

236
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:42,620
I'll go get ready.

237
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:44,120
Thanks.

238
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,220
Why don't you just put him to sleep already?

239
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:50,720
Pops sometimes gets in right, you see.

240
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:54,920
Mr. Mouri, I did my part.

241
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:58,921
I wonder if I served sufficient as your curtain-raiser.

242
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:01,920
Then!

243
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:06,121
Here goes the deduction of the great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

244
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:10,520
-Is this okay? -I guess so.

245
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,220
She's enjoying herself.

246
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:15,020
In this case,

247
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,920
let's start with cameraman, Mr. Eiji Kaneko.

248
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:21,020
He was used as a pawn for the perp

249
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:23,820
and killed in that basement!

250
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:27,120
He was probably struck with the block that was on the ground.

251
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,320
Wow, Pops' got it right.

252
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:33,220
Kaneko who stole the two-faced mask from Mr. Takahashi...

253
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,620
Okay, time to switch!

254
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,120
The perp who was dying to get a hold of

255
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,720
the two-faced mask more than anyone else!

256
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:40,721
Right!

257
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:43,720
You, Ichikawa...

258
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,721
Ebiya!

259
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,921
-Okay, turn it on. -Okay!

260
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:50,121
Was that my name...

261
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:55,620
The Sleeping Kogoro!

262
00:12:55,621 --> 00:13:00,220
Let's talk about the Ebi of Ichikawa some other time.

263
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,120
Nobody's asking him about it.

264
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:04,420
He must really like the place.

265
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,820
I'm getting hungry.

266
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:08,520
The deduction I just mentioned

267
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:13,920
about Mr. Takahashi stealing the mask doesn't apply.

268
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,520
Then, who?

269
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,620
Mr. Iwami!

270
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:22,020
You withdrawing cash from the ATM at the hospital,

271
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:25,820
and handing it over to Mr. Kaneko

272
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:29,820
was found on the security camera of the ATM.

273
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:31,520
You gave him money?

274
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:32,720
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:35,120
But he took a picture of me entering at midnight, so...

276
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:40,120
Mr. Kaneko knew that you weren't the one who stole the mask.

277
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:41,121
What?

278
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:42,920
He knew and yet blackmailed?

279
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:46,420
He figured you'd pay him if he threatened you.

280
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:48,321
Mr. Yabusaki and Mr. Minowa!

281
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:50,920
Please rest at ease.

282
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:54,520
Both of you weren't blackmailed by Mr. Kaneko.

283
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,720
Are you saying that if they weren't threatened by Kaneko,

284
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:58,721
they're not the perp?

285
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:05,120
This is where Mr. Iwami enters Kabukiza.

286
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:07,020
Mr. Iwami who was shown this footage,

287
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:10,620
did what he was told to, and paid.

288
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:12,920
However, there was a continuation

289
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:15,120
to what was taken on Mr. Kaneko's camera.

290
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,020
This.

291
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,820
Please look closely.

292
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:21,920
Mr. Iwami is not holding a case or anything.

293
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:26,520
Mr. Kaneko showed you only what he wanted you to see.

294
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:30,520
Mr. Kaneko's camera showed me everything I needed to know this time.

295
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,421
Then, the only person left is...

296
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,520
Hey, wait a minute.

297
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:41,120
Mr. Mouri mentioned just now that

298
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:43,520
anybody that was not shown in Mr. Kaneko's camera

299
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:45,720
isn't the perp.

300
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:50,220
Mr. Hosoo. How do you know that your picture wasn't taken?

301
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,120
Did I say that?

302
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:56,120
My picture would never be in his camera.

303
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,620
Your picture would never be

304
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:02,020
because you dished out a lot of cash and bought up the chips.

305
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,220
Let's cut out the joke.

306
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,620
Did you forget

307
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:09,720
that my car was tampered with and that my life was endangered?

308
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:12,420
Kogoro Mouri's Seven Masks!

309
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:13,421
Mask One!

310
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:15,320
"Wataru Takagi, First Investigation Division Sergeant"

311
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:18,420
I checked that slope once again this morning,

312
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:21,820
and found out that the residue of brake oil was found

313
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,120
only on the very top of the slope,

314
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:27,120
and there were no traces of it anywhere else.

315
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:30,121
Why did you take that road?

316
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:33,720
The most direct and shortest path from your residence to Kabukiza

317
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:36,820
is an almost straight flat road.

318
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:42,520
What was your reason for going all the way up the slope?

319
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,820
Moreover, near there,

320
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:47,920
a vinyl tape with oil on it was found.

321
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:50,120
A tape with oil?

322
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,520
I get it!

323
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:55,720
I guess you got it, Ebizo. Because you like cars.

324
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,620
Since it's not that easy to open a hole in the brake hose,

325
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:02,720
you wrapped tape around the hose that you opened a hole in

326
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,320
at the garage of your residence.

327
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,420
Please hold it.

328
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:09,220
You all saw, didn't you?

329
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:12,720
The footage of the security camera at my residence.

330
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,720
I didn't go to the garage.

331
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,320
I see.

332
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:19,321
Mask two!

333
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:21,620
"Ninzaburo Shiratori, First Investigation Division Inspector"

334
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:24,920
There's a convenience store in front of your house, isn't there?

335
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,820
I compared the footage of their security camera

336
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,220
with the one at your house.

337
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,420
-Okay, cue! -Okay!

338
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:33,420
The time is adjusted.

339
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:37,420
The one on the left is the one I received from Mr. Hosoo of images outside.

340
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:40,920
The one to the right is the convenience store's.

341
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,720
As you can see,

342
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,220
although it's the same road, at the same time,

343
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:48,320
cars are seen only on one side of the road.

344
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,620
An individual who is capable of tampering

345
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,920
with the hard disk of your residence...

346
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,620
Do you have any idea who it is?

347
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,620
Who'd do something like that?

348
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:56,720
Mask three!

349
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,820
"Kazunobu Chiba, First Investigation Division Sergeant"

350
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:02,820
We secured the two-faced mask at Haneda Airport!

351
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,621
We got the story from the buyer Richard too.

352
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:11,320
It seems he bought the mask at an exorbitant price.

353
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,220
Mr. Hosoo. You were saying, weren't you?

354
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:19,220
Japanese cultural assets going overseas is a problem.

355
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:22,020
What did you mean when you said that?

356
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:24,320
It's not anyone's business what I do with my stuff, is it?

357
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:27,920
Stop accusing me of being a killer just for something like that!

358
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,120
-Okay, here! -Roger!

359
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:31,121
Mask four!

360
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:33,020
"Juzo Megure, First Investigation Division Inspector"

361
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:36,220
Ms. Shioji told us everything.

362
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,920
Shioji...

363
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:41,520
That mask is a fake that I had made.

364
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:44,020
The president told me to keep the genuine mask safely stored

365
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,520
until the day of the actual performance.

366
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:50,720
Didn't you already know about this, Ebizo?

367
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:51,920
Yes.

368
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:53,120
I tried to convince myself that it was

369
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:56,720
because the mask was cracked, but...

370
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:59,020
Shioji!

371
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:01,320
You killed them, didn't you?

372
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,420
I see. I got it.

373
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:06,120
Money, you wanted money!

374
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,620
I was going with Mr. Takahashi!

375
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,120
But the president...

376
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,520
Mr. Hosoo.

377
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:16,720
We've already checked and found that your company hasn't been doing well.

378
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,420
The money that you sold the mask for

379
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:22,920
and the money from Mr. Takahashi's life insurance policy.

380
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:26,020
Mr. Takahashi's insurance policy?

381
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,320
Right.

382
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:29,720
It's sometimes payable even if suicide is the cause of death.

383
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:32,020
But to further ensure getting hold of the money even soon

384
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:34,920
after being covered...

385
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,921
Being murdered is even better.

386
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:43,621
Where? Just where do you have proof that I did it?

387
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:48,720
This is your button, isn't it?

388
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:52,720
I've been telling these guys repeatedly,

389
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:56,620
that if they should ever be abducted or suddenly attacked,

390
00:18:56,621 --> 00:19:00,820
leave a trace of anything on the perp.

391
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:04,320
It's okay to bite on something that you were covered with too, right?

392
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:07,820
Yeah, because the teeth marks or saliva

393
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:10,320
can later be used as evidence.

394
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,721
Why's he acting so sophisticated?

395
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:21,020
What's come over you, Mr. Mouri?

396
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:23,020
You of all people should know better.

397
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:28,021
Shioji, why don't you tell him when I changed my jacket?

398
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:33,520
It's time we get going.

399
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:36,121
President. The button of your sleeve...

400
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,720
I wonder when it came off.

401
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,620
When I went to the hotel with you,

402
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:43,820
I was wearing a new jacket, no?

403
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:47,020
Sonny! When did you get that button?

404
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,221
Tell me, won't you?

405
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,720
You want to pin the murder of Kaneko on me too,

406
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:56,120
despite going as far as using a kid to do so!

407
00:19:56,121 --> 00:20:00,020
Pops Kogoro, when did I say jacket?

408
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,020
He's so mean.

409
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:07,020
Mr. Hosoo, all Conan said was what he was covered with.

410
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:08,420
Finish him!

411
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:10,921
Okay. I'll show everything in rapid succession!

412
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:14,120
This button of yours was found

413
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:17,521
in the engine room of the car that Mr. Takahashi was found dead in.

414
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,720
These water cushions beside the railroad crossing.

415
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,821
This is where you were planning to crash into.

416
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:28,520
This is in your garage.

417
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:30,320
You used vinyl gloves

418
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:32,921
to keep your hands from being soiled by brake oil.

419
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,220
This is the building that your office was previously in

420
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:40,420
that is now being demolished.

421
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:43,020
The basement floor used to be the staff room.

422
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:44,721
No wonder you knew so much about it.

423
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:47,120
What's this?

424
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,820
It's Mr. Hosoo picking up Mr. Iwami's memo.

425
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,120
Why?

426
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:52,520
Why do you have all these pictures?

427
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:56,120
Mr. Kaneko had all the pictures he sold to you

428
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,920
saved in his computer.

429
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,321
So that he could suck you dry of more cash.

430
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:10,020
My company's going to go bankrupt.

431
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:17,020
No company is worth saving if you have to kill to do so!

432
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:19,920
The place you are standing in now

433
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:22,020
is where people hone their skills on a daily basis

434
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:24,520
and hold themselves on high standards.

435
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,020
This stage belongs to them.

436
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:30,321
A person like you doesn't belong here!

437
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:06,421
Mr. Mouri!

438
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:08,421
The perp!

439
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:11,620
You were fantastic. Just as expected, Kogoro Mouri!

440
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:14,620
Dad, you were quite attractive a while ago.

441
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:16,520
Remember, she said "quite".

442
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,120
What're you guys talking about?

443
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:19,520
I've got to nab him.

444
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:20,820
Please,

445
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:24,720
let me include the Sleeping Kogoro in my next performance!

446
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm definitely confident that it'll turn out to be a great performance.

447
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:32,320
Let me go!

448
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:35,321
Then, who's going to act my part?

449
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:44,221
"Next Episode" -Now all that is yours is mine.

450
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:50,520
No, I can't take it anymore!

451
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:52,321
Please get a hold of yourself.

452
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:58,721
Psychiatric tests aren't 100 percent accurate.

453
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:03,220
I...

454
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:05,320
I didn't do it!

455
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:06,920
Next Conan,
