1
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,941 --> 00:00:06,840
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,740
An unsolved case of a large house.

4
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:10,940
A spicy deduction does the work.

5
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:12,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,241
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:58,822
Ran, Pops and I are invited by Sonoko

9
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:02,122
and head for her villa in Karuizawa.

10
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,022
On our way, our things together with the car

11
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,722
sink into the river when the water level rises.

12
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:09,022
We end up spending the night at a house in the remote mountains

13
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:10,723
that we found by chance while walking.

14
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,622
However, that night,

15
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:16,122
in his room at the second floor,

16
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:19,422
the owner of that house, Mr. Iwao Akashi,

17
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:20,923
were found dead!

18
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:31,223
"The Suspicious Spicy Curry (Part 2)"

19
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,722
This is Yamamura from the Gunma Prefectural Police Station.

20
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:43,222
Excuse me. I'd like to ask you a question.

21
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:44,722
"Hiroto Akashi (32)" -Yes.

22
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:46,922
What can I do for you?

23
00:02:46,923 --> 00:02:49,822
There are traces of something having been wrapped

24
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:52,122
around your father's wrists.

25
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:55,622
Do you have any idea what it could be?

26
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:58,022
Hey. Is that true?

27
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:01,923
Yes, sir! It looks as if he had been tied up by someone!

28
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:08,422
I think those are traces of rubber bands.

29
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:10,222
Father had a habit of bunching everything and anything up

30
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,522
with rubber bands,

31
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:15,822
and always had rubber bands around both his wrists.

32
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:17,722
Oh, just as I thought.

33
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:19,222
Just as you thought?

34
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:20,622
Yes.

35
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:23,722
We found a lot of rubber bands under his pillow,

36
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:26,722
so I thought maybe.

37
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:31,422
Is there anything else that you recall?

38
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:34,822
Like having seen someone suspicious around your house,

39
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:37,322
or having heard strange sounds or voices?

40
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:39,322
Come to think of it.

41
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,922
What do you mean "come to think of it"?

42
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:42,122
It's nothing.

43
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:45,822
But when I went in front of that room the first time,

44
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:49,123
I heard the man was crying.

45
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:51,522
What?

46
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,222
You heard him crying?

47
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:56,122
That was probably after deciding to commit suicide.

48
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:59,523
Didn't you see anything else in that room?

49
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,422
Conan!

50
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:04,722
You shouldn't be talking!

51
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:07,922
Yeah. There was a handkerchief on the floor.

52
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,922
I think he probably wiped his mouth

53
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:11,922
with it while eating curry,

54
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:15,022
because there was a little curry on it.

55
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:16,723
Don't tell me that...

56
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:20,422
If my deduction is correct.

57
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:23,822
Mr. Iwao didn't go to the dentist.

58
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:27,422
The reason why he was bleeding from his mouth

59
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:28,723
was probably because...

60
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:32,622
Hey, sonny, what's up?

61
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:33,922
Oh! Hey!

62
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:36,022
Don't touch!

63
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,023
This is...

64
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:38,622
Hey!

65
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:41,422
I see. So, it's just as I thought.

66
00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:43,322
Geez.

67
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,822
If he had his tooth pulled out two or three days ago,

68
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:50,122
his gums should have healed a little and a little closed.

69
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,922
But his gums are still opened

70
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:53,722
with no signs of closing up.

71
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:57,722
Neither are there signs of blood have dried up or anything!

72
00:04:57,723 --> 00:05:01,422
In other words, this is proof that he just got his tooth pulled out.

73
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:05,322
Moreover, the other teeth around it are also shaky.

74
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:07,622
This means that whatever he was clenching with all his might

75
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:09,623
between his teeth was pulled out with great force.

76
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:13,422
I get the picture of this trick!

77
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,622
But, why?

78
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,422
If this trick is what I think it is,

79
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:21,122
it should be somewhere in this room.

80
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:23,322
How come it's nowhere in sight.

81
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,822
Hey, what do we do?

82
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:29,922
This half-eaten curry over rice?

83
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:33,122
Oh, yeah. Well, there wasn't any poison in it

84
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:35,222
so shall we have them put it away?

85
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:36,722
Oh, that.

86
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:39,222
What is it?

87
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:42,423
Don't tell me you want to eat it?

88
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:46,922
Hey, stop it!

89
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:49,223
You gotta be kidding? Hey, kid?

90
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:52,222
Found it!

91
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:54,022
This is it!

92
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:56,222
No doubt about it.

93
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,122
Hey, isn't that a tooth?

94
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:00,422
What?

95
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:01,922
What're you talking about?

96
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:04,722
What? A human's tooth?

97
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:06,122
Looks like it.

98
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:08,022
No doubt about it.

99
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:10,222
The one who killed Mr. Iwao

100
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:12,622
created his own alibi through his trick,

101
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,122
and that person is Mr. Hiroto Akashi!

102
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:18,722
Okay then, now that I know.

103
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,222
I've got to get everyone to come here

104
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:24,123
and start the usual Sleeping Kogoro deduction show!

105
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:27,022
Excuse me.

106
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,522
What shall we do with this tooth?

107
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:29,822
-Excuse me. -I know, right?

108
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:33,022
-Please listen... -I guess we better report this to Officer Yamamura.

109
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:34,223
Right.

110
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:39,222
This is bad!

111
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,822
I lost my voice!

112
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:44,922
Darn it! What do I do now?

113
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:48,322
After I figured out the case and all.

114
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:50,922
I can't use the voice changer

115
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:55,122
to reveal the truth of the case to anyone in this situation.

116
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,622
I would write

117
00:06:56,623 --> 00:07:00,422
but with this sprained wrist, I can't.

118
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:03,922
Only if they'd solve it themselves somehow.

119
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,922
My only hope is that the detectives will catch on.

120
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:08,322
So what I think is...

121
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:11,822
But, with the members here.

122
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:13,222
Hey, Conan!

123
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:14,523
Just where were you?

124
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:21,723
No way! You mean you lost your voice?

125
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,522
See. You were told not to talk

126
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:27,223
because you'd lose your voice, weren't you?

127
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:32,523
This case is plain to see!

128
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:37,522
Around 7:30 pm when Mr. Iwao Akashi passed away in his bedroom,

129
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,322
Ran, Conan, Sonoko and Mr. Hiroto, who were in this house,

130
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:43,722
were all in the living room so we all have an alibi.

131
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:45,922
I was taking a bath,

132
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,722
but have no motive

133
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:50,923
and had no way of getting the rope ready either.

134
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:56,822
Moreover an hour before we discovered the corpse,

135
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:58,922
the light of the bedroom was on,

136
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:01,522
but when we discovered the body, it was turned off.

137
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,322
No matter how you look at it this is suicide!

138
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,722
Mr. Iwao turned off the light of the room

139
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:10,322
and then committed suicide!

140
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,722
So, I'd advise you to stop investigating right now

141
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,222
and go on back to the station!

142
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:16,122
I guess so.

143
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:17,822
No, wrong.

144
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:19,722
This is homicide.

145
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,922
He used a trick to make it look like suicide

146
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:24,322
and killed the victim.

147
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:26,022
The killer is Mr. Iwao's adopted son,

148
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,322
Mr. Hiroto.

149
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:30,122
But, what can I do?

150
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,822
Without a voice,

151
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:36,123
how should I accuse him?

152
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,973
Okay, although this is going to be a bit bothersome.

153
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,773
What?

154
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,072
What?

155
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:08,472
Hey, Conan, just what're you doing?

156
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:10,873
Isn't he gesturing?

157
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:14,373
Rice crackers.

158
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:20,972
You want to eat 14 pieces of rice crackers?

159
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:23,272
No...

160
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:26,472
Crack. One. Four?

161
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:27,972
Close...

162
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:30,872
Okay, could it be...

163
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:33,172
crack code one?

164
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,372
Almost.

165
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,872
Oh, I got it!

166
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:39,773
Crack this code for once and for all. Right?

167
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,573
But, what is there to crack?

168
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,172
That curry?

169
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,472
Is something wrong with the curry?

170
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:54,172
It was spicy but good.

171
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:55,273
Right.

172
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,272
No...

173
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,872
That's not it? Then, what is it?

174
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,372
Me.

175
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:03,772
Sonoko.

176
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,772
Mr. Hiroto.

177
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,572
What? The old man upstairs?

178
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,872
A circle?

179
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:12,872
One?

180
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,472
What? I'm... three?

181
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,672
Are you talking about my age?

182
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:20,172
I'm a little over 33 already.

183
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:22,072
Ran was born when I was...

184
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:25,072
Are you talking about the amount of curry we all ate?

185
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:28,372
Mr. Hiroto, his father, Sonoko and I had one serving each,

186
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:31,172
but dad ate 3 servings!

187
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,872
Right...

188
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:35,372
So, what's wrong with that?

189
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,472
It sure is strange!

190
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,472
Because you and your group just happened

191
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,872
to come by this house tonight, right?

192
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:45,072
Moreover, Mr. Hiroto usually lives here only with his father.

193
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:47,172
There are just the two of you here, is that right?

194
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,872
Yes.

195
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:52,772
Then, curry enough for seven people is a bit too much

196
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,572
for just two people living together, don't you think?

197
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,872
It would surprise the Indians in India too!

198
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,872
Now that you mentioned it.

199
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:00,573
Don't tell me that you...

200
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:03,773
You must like curry?

201
00:11:05,973 --> 00:11:08,472
I actually love curry too.

202
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,172
Well...

203
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:13,872
I made quite a lot because I usually invite the students

204
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,172
that I've become friends over.

205
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:20,772
They really seem to like the curry I make.

206
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,272
I would think so.

207
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:24,272
Too bad there was nobody at the tennis court today

208
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:27,473
because it rained.

209
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:37,773
Tooth.

210
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:38,773
Curry.

211
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:39,773
No good.

212
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:42,372
For the tooth. Curry. No good?

213
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:43,472
Bull's eye!

214
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:45,672
Oh, could it mean...

215
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:46,972
That after a tooth is pulled out,

216
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,372
eating something too spicy is not good?

217
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:52,872
Remember when you had your decayed tooth pulled out,

218
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:55,472
the dentist told you so, right?

219
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:56,772
Yeah.

220
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:59,672
But, then it's strange.

221
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:01,872
You knew that your father had his tooth pulled out

222
00:12:01,873 --> 00:12:05,972
two or three days ago, didn't you, Mr. Hiroto?

223
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:07,372
Yes.

224
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:11,273
But, I had no idea that he had his tooth pulled out.

225
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,673
Officer Yamamura, could I speak to you for a moment.

226
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,072
Is that true?

227
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,572
Is something the matter?

228
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:29,372
Well, the coroner is here checking on the corpse

229
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,572
and he says that Mr. Iwao's tooth

230
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:32,272
seems to have been pulled out

231
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:35,172
just a while ago, not two or three days ago.

232
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:36,372
And the tooth that was pulled out

233
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,572
seems to have been found in the bedroom.

234
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:42,672
It seems to have been found in the half-eaten curry dish.

235
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:47,072
There must've been very tough meat in the curry,

236
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,472
because the teeth near the tooth that had come off

237
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:50,472
all seemed to be shaky too.

238
00:12:50,473 --> 00:12:54,273
I don't think such tough meat was in it.

239
00:12:56,273 --> 00:13:01,672
He.

240
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:03,172
Bit.

241
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,772
Something.

242
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:06,672
You mean that old man?

243
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,672
I'm sure he was.

244
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,573
He was eating curry, you know.

245
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:13,772
You want me to sit?

246
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:17,972
Bring the tied part of the necktie around behind

247
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:20,572
then bring the end of the necktie to the front

248
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:22,172
and bite?

249
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:23,972
I got it!

250
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:25,572
That old man

251
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:28,572
was suspended in air while biting on the rope!

252
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:30,572
Bingo!

253
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:32,472
If so, he would eventually get tired

254
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,672
and stop biting on the rope,

255
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,872
then he'd be strangled!

256
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:39,072
His tooth probably flew into the curry dish at that time

257
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:41,173
because of the impact!

258
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:44,972
Since his mouth is blocked with the rope,

259
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,072
he probably couldn't yell out either!

260
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:49,672
You mean that voice that I heard back then was

261
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:52,872
not him crying, but him groaning.

262
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,672
But there were no traces of the rope by his mouth.

263
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:58,773
That's probably because...

264
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,372
The handkerchief!

265
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,472
Remember, the handkerchief with the curry on it

266
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:07,672
was near the corpse, wasn't it?

267
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:11,272
He was made to bite the handkerchief together with the rope!

268
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:12,672
If so,

269
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:16,272
then traces of the rope wouldn't be left around his mouth.

270
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:20,972
But, his hands weren't tied when he was found.

271
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,872
If he grabs the rope with both hands,

272
00:14:22,873 --> 00:14:25,972
he can free his mouth so he could've shouted,

273
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:28,773
"Somebody help!"

274
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:32,172
Besides,

275
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:35,472
the bedroom light that was on an hour and a half ago,

276
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:38,672
was turned off when the corpse was found, wasn't it?

277
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:39,772
All during that time,

278
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,472
nobody went to that room,

279
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,773
so how could the light have been turned off?

280
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:46,173
Hey.

281
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:50,773
Conan?

282
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:58,772
Hey! Don't play around with it!

283
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,072
I see.

284
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:02,772
Both his wrists were tied with the electric cable in a bow tie

285
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,472
and the edge of the cable

286
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:08,372
was connected to the electric cable!

287
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,472
Then when he becomes exhausted

288
00:15:10,473 --> 00:15:12,772
the rope will pull away from his mouth,

289
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:15,672
his body will slide down choking his neck, and at the same time

290
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:18,672
the electric cable will be pulled and the light will go out.

291
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:21,672
The cable that is tied to his wrists will untie

292
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:27,072
and the body will be in the exact position as we found it!

293
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,972
Which means that the narrow lines that were found

294
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,172
on Mr. Iwao Akashi's wrists

295
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:33,672
were marks that were left from his wrists being tied!

296
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:37,472
But these light fixtures have three levels

297
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:40,972
and unless you pull the cable three times like Conan just did

298
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,772
it won't get dark, right?

299
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:46,872
Pulling just once would only turn off the light on the outer part,

300
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:51,472
and pulling the cable twice will leave the miniature light on.

301
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:53,572
If the brightness is adjusted to the second level

302
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:55,072
and the miniature light is loosened,

303
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:58,172
then pulling on the cable just once will turn the lights off!

304
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,672
I see.

305
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,973
But, is it possible to untie it?

306
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:08,572
See, this part that is tied to make the cable longer.

307
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:10,872
In order to tie the hands of someone who is struggling,

308
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:12,372
it would be impossible to do so

309
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:13,872
while the electric cable is connected to the light fixture!

310
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:17,672
Then, this knot would have to be untied once.

311
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:21,373
But, this looks to be a complicated knot.

312
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:26,172
This is called the fishing knot!

313
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,772
What's that?

314
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:30,172
The way a fishing line is tied!

315
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:34,572
A slippery line has to be tied like this or it'll get untied!

316
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,072
I see! That's why Mr. Hiroto's wife

317
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:39,072
went to buy this book on fishing!

318
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:41,972
She wanted to learn how to tie the electric cable firmly in place.

319
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:46,173
But, why was the cable in the bedroom is different then?

320
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,972
The cable in the bedroom was tied into a regular knot!

321
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:53,472
I see.

322
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:57,472
That's why the electric cable in the bedroom was shorter.

323
00:16:57,473 --> 00:17:00,072
He was unable to untie the knot,

324
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:03,272
so he had to cut it using scissors.

325
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,372
And the cable was tied into a regular knot

326
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:09,072
because the killer didn't know

327
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:12,072
how to tie it fishing line style!

328
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,172
Isn't that right...

329
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:15,173
Mr. Hiroto Akashi?

330
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,972
The trick you used goes like this.

331
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:28,472
You took the curry to Mr. Iwao's bedroom upstairs.

332
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:31,972
While he was eating the curry, you probably covered his mouth

333
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:34,472
with the handkerchief from behind,

334
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:38,472
and tied him up with the electric cable that you've cut.

335
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:41,972
After putting the loop of the rope around his neck,

336
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,672
you made him bite the rope with the handkerchief,

337
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:46,472
and left him suspended.

338
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:49,172
Of course, you threatened him saying

339
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:51,272
that if he lets go of the rope from his mouth,

340
00:17:51,273 --> 00:17:53,072
he would choke to death!

341
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,273
Finally you tied both of his hands with the electric cable

342
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:02,872
and make somebody go to the bedroom

343
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,172
to pick up his curry dish.

344
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:05,672
You warn that person saying,

345
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:07,972
"If the light is on, he's still eating"

346
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:09,872
"so don't go into the room."

347
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:12,872
You first ask the person to go get the plate around 10 minutes

348
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:15,472
after you came down because he most likely

349
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:17,072
still holding the rope in his mouth.

350
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:20,872
Then you ask that person to go again after a while.

351
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:24,172
The person will go in and find the dead body after the light is off.

352
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:27,172
Since you were with us right through in the living room,

353
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,472
you most definitely have an alibi!

354
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:34,072
Then, are you saying that Mr. Hiroto was at the tennis court in the rain

355
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:37,672
just to invite someone to witness his alibi?

356
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:38,772
Yeah.

357
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:42,672
He deliberately made curry for a lot of people.

358
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,572
No way.

359
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:47,072
Which means if we didn't come here,

360
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:48,772
this wouldn't have happened.

361
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:49,872
No.

362
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:51,172
Even if you all didn't come here today,

363
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,973
I was going to kill him tonight.

364
00:18:56,173 --> 00:19:00,573
It's true that today is the anniversary of my wife's death.

365
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:06,972
My wife was found lying on the ground

366
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,772
in this forest drenched in rain.

367
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,772
Lying on the ground?

368
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:12,773
Yes.

369
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:17,772
It was when I went out to work at a court in Tokyo on a rainy day.

370
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:20,972
My father suddenly woke my wife, who was asleep with a cold,

371
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,072
and made her go shopping.

372
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:26,672
He told her that he wanted to eat mushroom rice.

373
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:28,172
She should've refused, but she didn't.

374
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:31,772
She walked with unsteady steps over to a supermarket about 3km away

375
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:36,772
and on the way back, just as expected, fell to the ground and...

376
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:39,972
But that's no reason for you to kill him.

377
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,572
No. I decided to kill him

378
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:45,172
the day after my wife's funeral.

379
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:47,572
Unaware that I was behind him,

380
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:51,372
father was mumbling the following words towards the altar of my mother.

381
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:55,672
Dear. She finally broke down.

382
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:59,572
Next time I wish he'd get himself a healthier wife.

383
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,873
A toy that is more durable like Hiroto.

384
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:07,372
It can't be...

385
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,172
You mentioned that you were adopted.

386
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:14,972
Yes, until I heard him say that, I believed him.

387
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:18,472
I believed him being selfish

388
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:22,372
was because he already considered me as his son

389
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:26,372
Yes. We, My father, wife and I, built a house in the forest

390
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:29,172
and began living here because of my father's selfishness

391
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,572
saying that he wanted to live apart

392
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:33,472
from the rest of the world.

393
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:36,972
Of course the same goes for the electric cable.

394
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:40,772
He suddenly lengthened the electric cable of his room

395
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,872
and ordered all the electric cable in the other rooms to be the same way.

396
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:47,972
What? So, the electric cable in that room...

397
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:49,072
Yes.

398
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:52,172
Father tied the cable in his room himself.

399
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:55,372
Talk about not knowing how to tie knots.

400
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:59,472
If that was a knot that my wife had tied,

401
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:00,872
I...

402
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:04,572
I couldn't have cut it

403
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:05,772
and maybe would've had second thoughts

404
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:08,573
about carrying out this murder.

405
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:46,972
It sure was an uncomfortable case.

406
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:49,372
Well, after all, a person passed away so...

407
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:51,272
The combination of Sleeping Kogoro

408
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,472
and deduction queen Sonoko,

409
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:56,772
sure can close a case in a jiffy!

410
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:59,972
I forgot to videotape the deduction show,

411
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:01,772
because you started it without going to sleep!

412
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:04,172
It's not my problem!

413
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:07,472
I got twice as tired this time.

414
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:09,972
What's the matter, Ran?

415
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:13,272
It seems that I received a call last night,

416
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:16,172
but the number has no caller I.D.

417
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:17,472
If you're talking about the call that came in

418
00:23:17,473 --> 00:23:18,772
when you were using the restroom,

419
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,372
he took it.

420
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:21,373
What?

421
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:23,672
It was a wrong number call.

422
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,972
Shinichi?

423
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:28,472
Wasn't that call from Shinichi?

424
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,172
That look on your face, it must've been!

425
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:32,572
What?

426
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:34,372
What did he say?

427
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:35,972
Geez.

428
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:40,073
I'm sorry to have worried you.

429
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:44,272
No more X-sized cups for bras?

430
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:46,272
X-sized cups means the difference in size

431
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:49,072
with the under-bust is about 70cm.

432
00:23:49,073 --> 00:23:51,172
Were your breasts that big?

433
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:52,572
Of course not!

434
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:54,273
I'm not a cow, you know.

435
00:23:56,773 --> 00:23:58,973
I guess I'll mail her later.

436
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,772
"Next Episode" -10 million yen?

437
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:05,772
Something about there is someone

438
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:08,772
who is after the life of her husband

439
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:10,072
and she says if we can nail that person,

440
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,672
she'll pay us 10 million yen!

441
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:15,072
This case would be closed in no time

442
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:17,473
if we use our heads just a little bit!

443
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:21,173
Mom?

444
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:26,173
Hey, both of you!

445
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:28,272
Next Conan,

446
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:31,873
"Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 1)"
