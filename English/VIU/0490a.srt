1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:06,803
So, that's the story. It's 4, 5, 6...

2
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:09,603
It's my 6th this month! 6 cases!

3
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,903
How about you, Shinichi?

4
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:15,003
Me? I solved 7 cases.

5
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,803
Oh boy, I lost again.

6
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:21,803
But, Shinichi. Aren't there a bit too many cases around you?

7
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:23,603
Well, if you want to do something about your successive losses,

8
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:26,003
maybe you should change your name?

9
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:29,703
After all, my name's Shin-ichi, like in "ichiban"

10
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:32,403
Idiot. You're number 2.

11
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:34,703
-Number 2? -Yeah.

12
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:37,203
There was one guy in the past.

13
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,603
A guy who was really intelligent.

14
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:42,603
A detective.

15
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:47,103
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

16
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:49,103
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

17
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:51,103
Intermediate school detectives, Heiji and Shinichi.

18
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:52,603
A deduction battle is launched at the ski slope.

19
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:54,103
Solve the mystery that is on the lift!

20
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:55,503
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,203
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:00:57,203 --> 00:00:59,203
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,996
"Heiji Hattori vs. Shinichi Kudo!"

24
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,396
"Deduction Confrontation at the Ski Slope!"

25
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,890
Kazuha, are you okay?

26
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,790
If your sprained ankle is hurting,

27
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,290
maybe you should go back to the hotel?

28
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,990
I'm fine! Just fine!

29
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,290
It's no fun staying back at the hotel alone

30
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,590
and besides, it's fun watching all of you ski.

31
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,990
Moreover...

32
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,990
Sorry! Sorry!

33
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,990
I thought that an unattractive statue was sitting in the snow,

34
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,890
but it turns out to be a person.

35
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,890
What's with you? This is the fifth time!

36
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,590
Apologize nicely to Kazuha!

37
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,590
Why should I apologize?

38
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,090
I splattered snow on her to cool her sprained ankle

39
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,190
so that it would heal faster.

40
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,990
Teacher, Heiji is being nasty to girls again!

41
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,490
Just what do you think you're saying?

42
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,290
-Don't pick on us! -Don't pick on us!

43
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,090
The old ladies are angry!

44
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,990
-Old ladies, how dare? -Old ladies, how dare?

45
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,190
Hey.

46
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,090
Kazuha.

47
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,490
Don't push yourself and go back to the hotel.

48
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,590
You'll catch cold.

49
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,990
Yeah.

50
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,690
Why are boys all that way?

51
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,390
I wish the Snow Woman in these mountains eat you up!

52
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,590
Snow Woman?

53
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,790
Teacher said that there's a folk tale in these mountains

54
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,290
called "Legend of Snow Woman's Silver Clothing."

55
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,790
Long ago, in these mountains...

56
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,190
There was a super beautiful woman

57
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,890
wearing silver clothing of dazzling white.

58
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,590
She used to lay her eyes on handsome men that set foot in the mountains

59
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,190
and call out in a blizzardlike voice, and enchant them.

60
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,990
She would say, "Please exchange my clothing

61
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,490
for something that is precious to you."

62
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,290
Foolish men are taken in by her beautiful white skin under her clothes

63
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,690
and listen to her!

64
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,090
And then?

65
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,490
The man wraps the clothes he gets from her in a cloth wrapper and asks...

66
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,790
"The only thing precious that I have on me is this rifle."

67
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,590
"But is this what you want?"

68
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,490
The woman answers from behind the man, "No."

69
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,890
"Then, is it money?"

70
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,390
"No."

71
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,690
"Is it this hat?"

72
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,290
"No."

73
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,390
The man's asks the woman, "Then what is it?"

74
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,490
She then, stark naked clings on to the man from behind.

75
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,490
"It's not something cold that I want."

76
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,490
"What I want really badly is...

77
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,590
your warm, very warm...

78
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,790
blood dripping...

79
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,890
heart!"

80
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,390
See.

81
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,690
After that, the man is found dead.

82
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,690
And inside the cloth wrapper, there is no silver clothing,

83
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,490
but rather... a lot of snow. That's the story.

84
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,090
They say that when a blizzard hits these mountains,

85
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,590
many fall victim.

86
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,690
And even 4 years ago,

87
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,090
there seemed to have been a case very similar to this one.

88
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,190
Hey, students of Kaiho Academy intermediate class!

89
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,490
It's lunchtime!

90
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,090
It's already past two o'clock!

91
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,590
Huh? Really?

92
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,690
No wonder I'm hungry.

93
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,290
It seems that there are students from other schools staying here too.

94
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,590
That's why they seem to have shifted lunchtime

95
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,490
to prevent the dining room from becoming crowded.

96
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,890
Isn't that the actor...

97
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,690
"Shohei Minowa (32), actor" -called Shohei Minowa?

98
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,290
What's he doing?

99
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:11,190
That's right! I saw on TV that they're shooting a movie

100
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,990
after a real case that happened in a snowy mountain.

101
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,190
Huh? I heard that it was a thriller having to do with Snow Woman.

102
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,190
Nonsense.

103
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,990
Well, at any rate, Shohei Minowa's the star of the show

104
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,690
and the fact that he's a detective pursuing some mysterious case

105
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,290
is no mistake.

106
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,290
A detective.

107
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,490
Is it true that this series will be a three-part completed series?

108
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,490
Yeah.

109
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,190
Is it also true that this movie is made

110
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,090
after a case that really happened?

111
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,290
That's true, too.

112
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,390
The guy who died was a friend stuntman of mine.

113
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,890
I was at the scene of the crime, too.

114
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,590
Hey, Mr. Minowa.

115
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,790
I don't want you saying too much about the late Mr. Jiro.

116
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,990
Just what're you talking about?

117
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,290
You're the one who's shooting a movie

118
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,090
using your dead friend as bait.

119
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,490
"Morizo Oyama (56), movie director" -Hey, hey.

120
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,290
This is a movie that was made as a tribute to him.

121
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,590
Well, all is well.

122
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,090
Nothing will bring a dead person back to life.

123
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,090
We can insert something like "A Tribute to Jiro Mikami"

124
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,490
at the end of the movie or something,

125
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,190
"Kosuke Mimata (27), stuntman" -to bring tears to the eyes of the viewers.

126
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,790
And if the movie is a hit, nothing could be better!

127
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,690
Let's be thankful for Mr. Mikami's death

128
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,490
and make a good movie.

129
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,290
Thanks to his death,

130
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,190
you too got to succeed the position you have now.

131
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,990
Well, I warn you, be careful.

132
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,590
You're going to have to do the stunt

133
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,390
"Shizuku Tateishi (31)" -that the late Mikami was supposed to do.

134
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,990
"Special make-up artist" -Let's hope that Snow Woman doesn't seduce you.

135
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,190
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,590
But I still don't understand

137
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,190
why Mizukami would leave a fiance like you behind

138
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,490
and take his own life.

139
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,290
Who knows?

140
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,590
He didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.

141
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,990
I'm sure one of you killed him.

142
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,090
What?

143
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,490
You again, Officer.

144
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,690
No. I heard that you already quit your job as an officer.

145
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,190
Yeah. I was fired working on this case

146
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,990
that was under the jurisdiction of another prefecture.

147
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,890
"Rikuto Katashima (35), detective" -I work as a measly detective now.

148
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,090
I mean, no matter how you look at it, he committed suicide.

149
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,690
True.

150
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,390
4 years ago, a man who rides the lift of this skiing ground alone

151
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,390
had a bullet shot through his head

152
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,290
and was dead when he came down.

153
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,690
He was holding a gun in his right hand,

154
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,390
and on his sleeve there were traces of gunpowder.

155
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,390
Normally, it would look like nothing

156
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,090
more than suicide by shooting oneself,

157
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,590
but something bothers me.

158
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,290
Why was there a load of snow packed

159
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,990
inside the bag that was beside him?

160
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,190
That's because he killed himself

161
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,490
according to the legend of the Snow Woman.

162
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,290
Absurd. I know that guy since childhood,

163
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,490
but he had no interest whatsoever in spook stories.

164
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,590
Besides, even if it were to be so,

165
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,690
I don't understand why he would do something like that.

166
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,390
Who knows?

167
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,590
We'll never know unless we ask the dead man himself.

168
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,790
But this, we know for sure...

169
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,890
if it were a murder case,

170
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,290
it is a case that was impossible for any human to carry out.

171
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,390
Yes, if anyone were to be able to do it,

172
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,790
only the beautiful evil spirit of the mountains,

173
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,790
Snow Woman could've done it.

174
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,790
Idiot.

175
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,090
It's called homicide because some human did it.

176
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,290
Besides, nothing is impossible!

177
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,990
You idiot!

178
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,190
We met a young man like you just a while ago too.

179
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,090
Who said what you just said about this story.

180
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,590
He looked to be your age, an intermediate school student like you.

181
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,790
An intermediate school student?

182
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,490
Heiji!

183
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,690
Maybe somebody's talking about me.

184
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,190
Right.

185
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,690
I mean, you really put on a grand front in the dining room,

186
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,090
so I'm sure somebody's making fun of you now.

187
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,490
Idiot!

188
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,390
I was just trying to wake you up

189
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,890
from that Snow Woman story you were so panicked out about.

190
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,390
I... I wasn't panicked out or anything.

191
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,390
I just thought that maybe it could be true!

192
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,390
That Snow Woman story...

193
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,090
It's sad and there are many similar stories like it.

194
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,790
Yeah. It's true that it's mysterious.

195
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,690
In Japan, they call the monster

196
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,490
that appears in the most famous Snow Woman story is called...

197
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,990
"Woman of the Snow".

198
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,690
English? I thought that Snow Woman was a Japanese story.

199
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,290
Yeah, it's a Japanese folk tale.

200
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,690
But a man called Lafacadio Hern

201
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,590
who was working as an English teacher in Japan heard about it,

202
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,390
and published it in English.

203
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,790
You know him, don't you, Yagumo Koizumi?

204
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,190
That's his pen name!

205
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,890
Yes, yes. You are so knowledgeable, Shinichi.

206
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,490
But thank you anyway.

207
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,490
You said what you did to put me at ease, right?

208
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,090
That's not all I did it for.

209
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,190
I thought I had to say so, to keep out of hot water.

210
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,690
I didn't want a storm to start.

211
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,690
I have this ominous premonition.

212
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,793
Hey, Heiji!

213
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,893
What're you going to do if Snow Woman really appears?

214
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:22,193
Idiot! If such a woman exists,

215
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:23,793
I sure would like to meet her.

216
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,493
Heiji.

217
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:27,193
In order to solve the case of 4 years ago,

218
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:30,193
first I've to check the lift in question!

219
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:31,293
And I've got to do it,

220
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:33,293
before some intermediate school brat beats me to it!

221
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,593
What's the big deal?

222
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:38,893
It's just that somebody else thinks like you.

223
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,793
That's why I don't want to lose!

224
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,193
I've got to win,

225
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:44,793
or people will think that I'm only intermediate level too.

226
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,493
I mean, you're only in intermediate school too, after all.

227
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:49,593
Ugh, really! Always so lovey-dovey.

228
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:51,993
You idiot! Don't get us wrong.

229
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:56,393
The snow's going to melt with the spur that you guys make!

230
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:58,793
She's talking about somebody else.

231
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,493
Well, you still have time

232
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:03,393
to check the lift after this blizzard subsides.

233
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:06,393
Well, I guess so. But before that...

234
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:10,193
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:12,093
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

236
00:12:14,393 --> 00:12:16,093
Heiji?

237
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:18,693
Hey! Will you cut it out?

238
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:20,693
Taking pictures left and right from some time ago.

239
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,493
Heiji! What's the problem?

240
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,693
She could just be taking pictures of this snowy scenery.

241
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:29,993
No! No! This lady is taking pictures of me!

242
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:31,893
She's my mom!

243
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:33,593
What?

244
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:37,593
Just as would be expected of you, Heiji!

245
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:40,693
You've got keen senses just like your dad, Heizo!

246
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,293
What brings you here?

247
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:46,093
I was worried sick over Heiji

248
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,893
because he's rarely come to the Tohoku district.

249
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,293
Oh, give me a break!

250
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:51,093
All you want to do is make additions to the growth video

251
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:54,993
that you've been taking of me since I was born!

252
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,793
I'd like to see it.

253
00:12:56,793 --> 00:13:00,193
It was a bad blizzard back then, too.

254
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:04,093
4 years ago, the day Mizukami died.

255
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:05,393
On that day, just like now,

256
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:07,793
while we were waiting to shoot the film,

257
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:10,393
Minowa was surrounded by his fans.

258
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:14,793
It seems the blizzard is subsiding!

259
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,093
Is that right?

260
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:19,193
Please show us your skiing then!

261
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:20,993
The awesome ski techniques that you used in

262
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:22,793
"Love of Snow Woman" and "Mystery!"

263
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:24,093
Please!

264
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:27,893
Oh boy. I've got to shoot a film from now, you see.

265
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:29,393
No! No!

266
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,593
Ever since we've got here,

267
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:32,493
fans like you have asked him to ski

268
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,793
and he's already skied three times!

269
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:38,893
If you want to see him ski, please watch his movie!

270
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:40,493
What shall I do?

271
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:41,993
Well, we do have a tight schedule,

272
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:44,793
but we've got to treat the fans nicely, too.

273
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:47,393
I think this is what Mizukami would've said.

274
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,993
"It'll work out somehow!"

275
00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:52,693
Oh goodness, he's not here anymore!

276
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:54,193
Will you please cut it out already?

277
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:55,593
I'm sorry

278
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:59,693
that I got you involved in making a movie based on the late Mr. Mizukami

279
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,993
who was supposed to have become your husband.

280
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:04,193
Don't be. After all,

281
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:05,893
I'm the one who asked you to let me participate.

282
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:10,493
I sort of felt that if this movie is completed,

283
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,393
the truth of his death would be revealed.

284
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:20,393
Two places...

285
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,493
I looked from below

286
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:26,093
there are two places where this lift and ski slope come close together.

287
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:28,693
You mean you can jump onto the lift from below?

288
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:30,493
No. They come close,

289
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,293
but there's a space of more than 3 meters.

290
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:33,493
It'd would be impossible to jump on

291
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:34,793
unless you use a trampoline or something.

292
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:42,293
Isn't that Shoehei Minowa that was at the hotel?

293
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:44,193
He's good!

294
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:57,793
Encore...

295
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:00,993
No, no! Just this once for today!

296
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:04,193
Watch the movie if you want to see more skiing!

297
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:05,993
It's already 4:00!

298
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:08,693
We've got to shoot the ski slope above quickly.

299
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:11,893
Okay, I'll get myself on the lift first!

300
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:13,893
Because it'll get pitch dark after 5:00.

301
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,793
Hey, Director.

302
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:17,593
The special make-up artist woman

303
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:21,293
and the stuntman is nowhere in sight.

304
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:24,093
They both said that they'd go up before everyone.

305
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,393
Something's fishy.

306
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:31,093
There sure is something fishy about this lift.

307
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:34,093
Heiji, this lift is scary.

308
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:35,993
Kazuha.

309
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:37,493
You belong to the advance group,

310
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:39,793
and yet you've never rode a lift?

311
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:42,993
I have. But it was a different kind.

312
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,293
Gosh. It starting to get windy again.

313
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:50,393
I can't see the figure of the detective's

314
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:51,893
who's riding the lift up ahead too clearly.

315
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:53,893
Hey, Ms. Tateishi!

316
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,693
Oh, Mr. Mimata.

317
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:58,793
What're you doing? That lift's going down.

318
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,093
I missed the lift.

319
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,293
I'm not good at things like this.

320
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:13,693
Shinichi!

321
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,493
What was that sound just now?

322
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:16,993
The sound of a gunshot.

323
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,793
The ones on the lift were...

324
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:20,493
Director Oyama,

325
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:22,493
the actor, Minowa,

326
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:25,093
the detective, in that order if I remember correctly.

327
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:28,893
Did something happen?

328
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,293
It's you.

329
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:34,293
Beats me. I just got off now.

330
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,584
Stop the lift!

331
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:10,084
Can't you tell?

332
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:12,484
Look at that!

333
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:14,184
Just stop the lift right this minute, will you?

334
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:15,584
Then call the police and paramedics!

335
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:18,884
What? What? Shinichi? Is something wrong?

336
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:20,384
Don't look, Ran!

337
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:25,184
The lift stopped.

338
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:26,284
What's going on?

339
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:27,784
The thing that sounded like gunfire just a while ago,

340
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,584
and now that scream.

341
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:32,084
The lift, gun fire...

342
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,084
Don't tell me that

343
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:36,684
the same thing as the case 4 years ago has happened again.

344
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:39,484
We are sorry for the inconvenience!

345
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:42,384
Please allow a little more time for the lift to resume operation!

346
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:44,584
What is the meaning of this?

347
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,684
It's almost like what happened back then.

348
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:47,384
You can say that again.

349
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:51,684
Just like the time when Mr. Mizukami shot himself to death.

350
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,884
Mizukami.

351
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,984
The gun right as his temple and bang!

352
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:57,984
This is suicide.

353
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:01,084
Yes. He is after all holding the gun in his right hand.

354
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:05,084
The problem is this bag that's beside the victim.

355
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,584
If it's just as my ominous premonition tells me,

356
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:08,784
I'm sure that the contents of the bag is...

357
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:10,884
Snow, just as I thought.

358
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:13,984
God. It's the same as 4 years ago.

359
00:18:15,984 --> 00:18:19,484
I think I heard that they were shooting a such a movie here.

360
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:20,484
Yes.

361
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,084
We were shooting a movie having to do with that legend

362
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,284
and what happened here 4 years ago,

363
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:27,384
but now after what happened to Mr. Minowa, the star of the show...

364
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:29,384
Huh? Is Minowa an actor?

365
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:31,084
If I remember correctly, you were here

366
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,684
when that incident happened 4 years ago too, weren't you?

367
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:35,084
I am the director of the movie, Oyama.

368
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:37,484
I was on the left one ahead of him.

369
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,584
Then, I heard a gunshot.

370
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,784
That young man who came along when I got off the lift,

371
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:44,584
noticed that something was wrong with Mr. Minowa.

372
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,084
Hey, kid! Just what do you think you're doing?

373
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:50,784
We're going to have to get the lift moving soon

374
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,184
-or the skiers will... -Okay.

375
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:53,984
After the corpse and his belongings are carried off the lift,

376
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:56,384
you may move it!

377
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:59,684
-Do you need help? -No, it's pretty light.

378
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:01,884
He was slimmer than he looked.

379
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:03,784
He didn't even weigh 60 kilograms.

380
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:06,984
That's why he used to only appear in winter dramas and movies.

381
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:09,884
He didn't want anybody to see how thin he was.

382
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,184
I wonder why he out his skis in the back

383
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,084
instead of wearing them?

384
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,684
Why not?

385
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:21,684
He was holding a bag filled with snow, you know.

386
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,584
It may have been packed with snow,

387
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:26,884
but it's just big enough to fit a child inside.

388
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:29,684
Okay! You can go ahead and move the lift!

389
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:31,784
Oh, officer.

390
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:34,084
There are three things that are bothering me.

391
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:40,584
It finally moved.

392
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:43,084
Look at the crowd.

393
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:44,484
It's frightening.

394
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,384
Idiot! My blood's starting to boil!

395
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:50,284
Unauthorized personnel stand back! Stand back!

396
00:19:50,284 --> 00:19:52,984
What is it? What on earth happened?

397
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,284
It's you.

398
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:56,184
It's something just I heard briefly,

399
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:57,884
but it seems to be exactly the same

400
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,584
as the incident that happened 4 years ago.

401
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,684
It seems that a man who was riding the lift alone

402
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:03,984
had a bag filled with snow beside him

403
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:06,784
and killed himself with a gun.

404
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:09,784
It's as if he were possessed by the Snow Woman!

405
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:11,684
Hey, not you again.

406
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:13,884
This isn't your jurisdiction, is it?

407
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:17,884
No. I'm not an officer anymore, but a detective.

408
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:22,184
Besides, I was riding the lift right behind this victim, you know.

409
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:25,484
Don't you want to ask me questions, officer?

410
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:27,884
Victim? He committed suicide!

411
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:30,284
No. I think it's too soon to conclude so yet.

412
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:33,184
Hey, Heiji! Help!

413
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:35,484
Just what're you doing? Hurry and get off!

414
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,584
Yeah, but I don't know how to get off.

415
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,384
Okay then, when you reach the bottom,

416
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:42,084
I'll have them stop the lift, so make sure you get off!

417
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:43,484
Okay.

418
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:44,784
That idiot.

419
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,884
That's why I told her not to come along.

420
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:47,884
Come to think of it,

421
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:50,384
there was another person who couldn't get off a while ago.

422
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,584
-Really? -Yes.

423
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,884
She was a pretty lady who had her hair all tied in the back.

424
00:20:57,084 --> 00:21:00,184
No. Mr. Minowa committed suicide?

425
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:01,384
Why?

426
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:04,884
Before asking why, will you answer my question?

427
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:08,084
Why did you want to get off the lift here a while ago?

428
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:09,784
I couldn't get off!

429
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:11,384
I'm not at home with these things.

430
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:13,384
That's strange.

431
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:17,084
You came here 4 years ago too, to shoot a movie, right?

432
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,484
Back then, I had Mr. Mizukami ride with me.

433
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:21,884
This time I had Mr. Mimata ride with me.

434
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,584
She's not very physically inclined, you see.

435
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,684
Huh? The director told me that you would be going up ahead.

436
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:31,284
Why are you riding the lift with her?

437
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:33,984
Standby for the shooting is was all set,

438
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:36,984
but the director and main star didn't come up the slope

439
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,384
so I skied down here to come get them!

440
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:43,384
Then, I saw her coming down on the lift,

441
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:45,784
so I called out to her, and that's when I heard the gun shot.

442
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:47,884
I had this bad feeling

443
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:52,484
so had him ride the lift with me and went back up again!

444
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:54,984
I mean, the thing about 4 years ago was bothering me, too.

445
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,584
Then, the lift stopped

446
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:58,684
and I finally got to come down a while ago!

447
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,784
I see. In other words...

448
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:04,684
Director Oyama, who was riding the lift in front of Mr. Minowa,

449
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:07,984
Mr. Katashina, the detective who was behind,

450
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:11,284
Ms. Tateishi, who passed him on the lift going down

451
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:14,184
and Mr. Mimata who was on the ski slope...

452
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:18,084
All could've shot at Mr. Minowa.

453
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:19,884
-Hey. -Hey, now.

454
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:21,884
Weren't you listening to what we were just saying?

455
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:24,984
I was with Mr. Mimata when the gunshot was heard.

456
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:26,984
If that gunshot was fake,

457
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:28,684
the murder would've been possible.

458
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:30,984
Is this what you want to say, sonny?

459
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:32,984
Yeah, right!

460
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,484
But Mr. Minowa was holding the gun in his hand, you know.

461
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:37,784
It would be impossible to make him to that

462
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:39,084
if you're some distance away, right?

463
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:41,284
You can't tell him to hold the gun

464
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:44,084
because you're going to be shooting him, can you?

465
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:47,184
Besides, the blizzard was pretty bad back then.

466
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:48,484
You'd have to be a darn good shooter

467
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,684
to shoot down the target at that time.

468
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:52,484
Well, I'm not too sure of this yet,

469
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:54,984
but there's something I realized.

470
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:57,484
First, the ski poles that Mr. Minowa

471
00:22:57,484 --> 00:22:58,784
is said to have put on the lift!

472
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:03,084
The loops on both tips of the poles are both upside down.

473
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:06,884
It's proof that the poles were used for something!

474
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:10,184
Next is the lift that Mr. Minowa was on.

475
00:23:10,184 --> 00:23:15,084
There is what looks to be a crack on the left edge of the plastic seat.

476
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:17,884
I'm sure that this is the result of some trick that was used, too.

477
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:19,384
And last,

478
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:21,184
is this cloth bag filled with snow

479
00:23:21,184 --> 00:23:24,584
that Mr. Minowa had placed beside himself.

480
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:27,684
I don't know why but it's frozen stiff.

481
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:30,084
No, no, don't touch his belongings.

482
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:35,584
But you intermediate school kids nowadays sure are full of curiosity.

483
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:38,584
There was another one just like you, an intermediate school student,

484
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,484
who boastfully told we the police

485
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:42,484
the three points you just mentioned, too.

486
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,084
What?

487
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:46,184
He was here until just before you got here.

488
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:49,284
I've finally made it down.

489
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:52,084
I'll never ride a lift ever again.

490
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:53,884
-Kazuha. -Kazuha.

491
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:57,184
You're not supposed to be in advance ski class, are you?

492
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,184
You don't even know how to get off a lift!

493
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:00,784
Be honest!

494
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,284
You just wanted to be in the advance class

495
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:04,084
because Heiji was there, right?

496
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,984
I'll bet your sprained leg is fake, too.

497
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:08,384
Oh, no.

498
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:09,784
Don't worry.

499
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:11,584
-We won't tell Heiji about it. -Excuse me!

500
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,784
-I'm really sorry. -Is there anyone here

501
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:16,084
who took a video Mr. Minowa riding the lift a while ago?

502
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:18,684
If you don't mind, I've taken him with mine.

503
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,284
Thank you so much!

504
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:24,584
You sure took nice pictures.

505
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:25,684
If you're Mr. Minowa's fan,

506
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:27,384
you could've just kept to shooting videos of him only and yet.

507
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,684
Well, my son asked me to.

508
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:31,884
He told me to take pictures of the boarding gate of the lift

509
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:32,884
because he wanted to use it as reference

510
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:34,384
for the incident that happened 4 years ago.

511
00:24:34,384 --> 00:24:36,384
Is your son a police officer or something?

512
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:38,684
He's a mere intermediate school student.

513
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:41,984
Although he thinks he's a detective.

514
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,684
A detective? Just like me.

515
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:48,384
My, Shinichi is chatting with a beautiful madam.

516
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,684
Really, I wonder who he took after.

517
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:53,984
No, he's wearing the facial expression of a detective.

518
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:55,784
He's still green.

519
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:59,484
And? Has the self-proclaimed world renown mystery novel writer

520
00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:01,684
solved this case?

521
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:04,184
Yukiko. What a silly question.

522
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:06,784
What? Have you figured it out, Yusaku?

523
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:10,184
I came all the way here because I wanted to write a novel

524
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,984
based on what happened 4 years ago,

525
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:14,484
but to think that a movie based on it was already being made,

526
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:17,684
and that a similar incident is happening right now...

527
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,584
If you've figured out who the culprit is,

528
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,784
why don't you contact the police right away?

529
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:23,284
No. Let's leave things to the young ones for a while

530
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:24,884
and watch how things turn out.

531
00:25:24,884 --> 00:25:27,984
Well, at least give me a hint then.

532
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,484
Do you know?

533
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,284
That there is another Snow Woman silver clothing legend

534
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:34,584
that exists in these mountains.

535
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:37,984
It is a heartbreaking and sad story.
