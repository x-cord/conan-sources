You're lucky it was just a scratch.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,229
We were worried, you know.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,629
We heard you were taken to the hospital.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,229
Sorry, sorry.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,829
That Kagura guy protected me.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,629
It was unfortunate for the both of us.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,229
But because of me, your arm...

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,229
It's not your fault.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,129
Don't worry about it.

"Sumito Kagura (26)" -Besides, I might be able to use this.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,430
Use this?

13
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,329
So, did they catch the culprit?

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,129
No, not yet.

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,530
Darn it. Who would do something like that?

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,629
Either way, they sure did cause a lot of trouble.

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,329
All the patients here were collateral damage, right?

18
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,929
Yeah.

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,529

00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,429
I happened to come to Beika City,

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,829
and look what happened to me.

23
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,129
I'm so unlucky.

24
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,429
How truly unfortunate for you.

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,529
Hey, Kagura.

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,830
Are you okay?

27
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,929
Kochiyama, Haruka. You guys came.

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,929
Who called us to come visit him?

I broke my arm. Look.

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,429
You're really unlucky.

33
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,429
But I'm going to be compensated again.

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,529
Again? In that case...

35
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,029
Smile, Kagura.

36
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,829
Look happy.

37
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,629
I'll earn more likes for you.

38
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,229
There you go again.

39
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,230
You guys are hopeless, Kagura and Kochiyama.

Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

44
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,429
Injured as part of collateral damage

45
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,629
for a hilariously strange reason.

"Yotsubishi Bank."

51
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:06,608
It started with a phone call made to this bank.

52
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:11,608
Hello, this is the Yotsubishi Bank Beika branch.

53
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:16,307
Several bombs have been placed around your bank.

54
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:19,708
They'll all explode in one minute.

55
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,007
Evacuate the building!

56
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:23,907
Shocked by the threat,

57
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,508
the bank told all customers and employees to evacuate.

58
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:33,307
However, the panicked customers caused collateral damage

59
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:37,107
to the people who happened to be passing by in front of the bank.

60
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:40,107
Pushed to the ground by the people rushing out of the bank,

61
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:45,108
Genta and several others were injured and taken to the hospital.

62
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:51,207
The phone used to place the call

63
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,007
was determined to be a public phone near the bank.

64
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:55,607
Because there was no explosion

65
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:59,607
and not a single explosive was found,

66
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:01,908
it was thought to be a prank.

67
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:06,707
Though the bank promised to cover their medical expenses

68
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,907
and compensate the victims,

69
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:13,908
it was an unfortunate incident for everyone involved nonetheless.

70
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:16,208
However...

71
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:21,108
You three seem unusually happy.

72
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:23,407
But I mean...

73
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:24,507
Right?

74
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:25,807
Yeah.

75
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:30,708
Kagura suffered collateral damage about half a month ago.

76
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:35,208
I was out hiking alone.

77
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:57,408
I suffered collateral damage from an unexploded bomb.

78
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:01,107
I remember that.

79
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,807
So you were the victim who suffered collateral damage.

80
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,807
Unlucky, right?

81
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:12,007
But because of all the money he received from the construction company,

82
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:15,607
he was able to pay off all his debts at once.

83
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,308
The nerve of this guy.

84
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:21,907
Kochiyama's pretty cheeky, too.

85
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:24,608
The next day, he took me back to the construction site.

86
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:30,007
Is here good?

87
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:32,407
No. Go farther back.

88
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,007
Okay.

89
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:35,707
Smile more.

90
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,108
Look happy!

91
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:44,708
He used me to get likes.

92
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:48,207
This is it.

00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:55,407
He's an unlucky man.

97
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,507
But look at him smiling after he received compensation.

98
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:00,507
Shameless, right?"

99
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:01,508
Indeed.

100
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:05,107
They say a wise man profits by his mistakes.

101
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:08,807
"Tanuki Ponkichi" -So this Tanuki Ponkichi name...

102

That's me.

103
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,008
Sorry.

104
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:19,507
So since something similar happened today,

105
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,207
Kagura will be compensated,

106
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:27,308
and Kochiyama plans to get more likes out of him.

107
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,408
That's why you seem happy.

108
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:34,808
What a despicable pair.

109
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,807
It's a good thing

110
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:47,308
you were injured when you don't have any performances.

111
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:50,007
Performances?

112
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:53,608
He's an actor in some acting company.

113
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,307
As a token of friendship...

114
00:07:57,308 --> 00:08:00,907
"Chonenten" -We're the Chonenten Acting Company.

115
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:03,007
Chonenten Acting Company?

116
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,008
Come to think of it,

117
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,607
isn't there a cafe with this name behind the station?

118
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:12,407
The chairman of our company runs that place.

119
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,408
I see.

120
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,107
There are photos of Kagura and you.

121
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:22,307
Huh? Kochiyama isn't on there.

122
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,907
Kochiyama is unrelated to the company.

123
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:27,607
He's an old friend.

124
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:32,507
But whenever we get together, we have a fun time.

125
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:35,207
They're three best friends.

126
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,208
Sounds like it.

127
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:41,907
Anyway, whoever called the bank...

128
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,307
I'm sure they only meant to prank them,

129
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:47,107
but they injured people totally unconnected to the bank.

130
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:52,907
They must be feeling really bad about the stupid thing they did.

131
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,507
They'd better.

132
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:56,508
Right?

133
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,207
Yeah.

134
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:02,207
Let's have a drink tonight to cleanse you of this evil.

135
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,407
You'll be at your apartment, right?

136
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,507
Yeah.

137
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,908
I can't work like this.

138
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,207
"Nurse's Station" -Excuse me.

139
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:20,507
Could you give me the address of the Otsubo staying in that room?

140
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:21,508
What?

141
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:25,107
Genta Kojima who's also in that room is very grateful to him,

142
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:28,208
and wanted to surprise him with a thank you letter.

143
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,408
One moment.

144
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:33,507
Let's see...

145
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:35,107
Here it is.

146
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,307
This is a one-time thing.

147
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,907
Kikuhide Otsubo...

148
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:43,407
"How can this be a coincidence?"

149
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,707
You already uploaded the photo.

150
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,907
Good deeds should be done quickly.

151
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:48,108
Good?

152
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,607
Huh? You're leaving already?

153
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:55,807
Yeah. Everyone's been cleared to leave.

154
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:58,107
Genta should be coming soon, too.

155
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:04,108
Do you guys know Otsubo who was staying in the same room as you?

156
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,307
-No. -We don't know him. Why?

157
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,307
No reason. I just thought you might.

158
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,807
Bye!

159
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:13,907
Yeah.

160
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:15,807
Bye.

161
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:18,407
Where have you been, Conan?

162
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,907
Sorry, sorry. I had to go to the bathroom.

163
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,707
Let's get started.

164
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,107
What? Started on what?

165
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,807
On finding the culprit, of course.

166
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:31,407
Genta was injured. We can't just ignore it.

167
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,807
Not just me.

168
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:37,207
That Kagura guy and all the others suffered a horrible fate.

169
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,808
We gotta catch the culprit.

170
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:44,507
Let's start by asking the police if they've found anything.

171
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:46,308
-Yeah! -Yeah!

172
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:49,507
Look at them. They're so excited.

173
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:50,908
What will you do?

174
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:59,407
Looks like they don't have any clues yet.

175
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:04,208
They're just starting to think about how to determine the culprit.

176
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,208
Hey, isn't that...

177
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,607
Tanuki Ponkichi. That's Kochiyama's new post.

178
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:15,807
"The man I introduced as my unlucky but shameless friend half a month ago

179
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,807
suffered more collateral damage!

180
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,807
Unbelievable, right?"

181
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:24,807
Two incidents in half a month?

182
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:28,707
Kagura really is unlucky.

183
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,107
-Yeah. -Yeah.

184
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:32,907
Unbelievable?

185
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:34,607
It really is.

186
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:35,807
What?

187
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:37,207
Could it be...

188
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,107
I'm not trying to sound like Kochiyama,

189
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:41,008
but this can't be a coincidence.

190
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:44,107
Conan, could it be...

191
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:47,107
The collateral damage from the bomb half a month ago

192
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:49,407
probably was a coincidence.

193
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:53,807
But it's possible he got a taste for the money he received then,

194
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:56,807
and tried to get some more.

195
00:11:56,808 --> 00:12:00,208
Several bombs have been placed around your bank.

196
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,207
He called the bank and caused a panic,

197
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,108
making it look like he suffered collateral damage.

198
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:12,907
It's not impossible.

199
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:16,307
He doesn't have any performances right now, right?

200
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:20,107
He was waiting for a time he could afford to be injured?

201
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:22,707
So, the culprit is Kagura?

202
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:27,407
Then, Kochiyama and Haruka...

203
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:30,607
He fooled them, too.

204
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,107
That is what it means.

205
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,707
But they're three best friends.

206
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,707
Let's investigate Kagura.

207
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,107
Let's ask around.

208
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,107
We could also follow him.

209
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:43,507
We might discover something.

210
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:47,207
Do it. I'm going to look into Otsubo.

211
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,407
Is he involved, too?

212
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:51,407
No,

213
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:54,107
but there's something about him that's bothering me.

214
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:57,407
Got it. Let's split up.

215
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:58,408
-Yeah! -Yeah!

216
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:11,516
"Izakaya Sasai" -Sorry, boss.

217
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:14,517
As you can see, I won't be able to work for a while.

218
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,284
Sorry.

219
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,984
It's fine.

220
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:20,284
Anyway, you really are unlucky.

221
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:21,984
I know.

222
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,385
I have no idea why I'm so unlucky.

223
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,984
Anyway, I'll call you later.

224
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:30,685
Sure. Take care.

225
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:44,284
Long time no see.

226
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:47,484
Look. Something crazy happened to me again.

227
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:51,084
-I saw the news. -It's like he's telling everyone.

228
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:55,384
"I'm simply a victim of collateral damage."

229
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,785
That could be his strategy to convince everyone that's what happened.

230
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,184
Huh? Our Kagura?

231
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:06,984
Yes. As the company chairman,

232
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:08,584
what kind of person do you think he is?

233
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:11,784
"Chiichiro Dewa (30)" -What kind of person is he?

234
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,584
He's a good-natured guy, right?

235
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:14,784
Yeah.

236
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:15,884
Right.

237
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:18,384
Are these guys in the company, too?

238
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:21,584
This is where we hang out.

239
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:23,584
Half a month ago,

240
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:26,684
Kagura suffered collateral damage from an unexploded bomb.

241
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:28,785
Do you know anything about that?

242
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,884
He didn't learn his lesson.

243
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:32,984
Afterwards he was saying,

244
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:37,684
"Maybe I'll suffer some more tasty collateral damage."

245
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,184
He did say that.

246
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:42,784
Like he was hoping he'd receive more money, right?

247
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,484
Even though that never happens.

248
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,184
I know.

249
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,784
This sounds like what Conan said.

250
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:52,785
Yes. He did it for the money.

251
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:55,984
Oh, Otsubo?

252
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,584
We're pretty close.

253
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:01,584
We're neighbors and have a lot of free time.

254
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:04,784
"I am a poet." -His life's purpose is finding odd and interesting things

255
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:10,484
to upload to social media for likes.

256
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:15,084
"Shiro Yasukawa (35)" -But he has a tough rival on social media.

257
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:16,484
A rival?

258
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:17,485
"Unexploded Bomb Explodes!"

259
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:20,284
He got a bunch of likes again.

260
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:26,284
Who is this Tanuki Ponkichi who keeps making interesting posts?

261
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,685
That's what he told me.

262
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,384
That's why he reacted like that upon learning

263
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:36,384
that Kochiyama is Tanuki Ponkichi, his rival.

264
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:40,384
But Otsubo said he wouldn't be beat.

265
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:41,985
I think it was two days ago...

266
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,284
I thought of a good idea.

267
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:49,284
I'm going to find this unlucky man and follow him.

268
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:52,984
He is sure to suffer some misfortune again,

269
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,985
so I'll post about it first.

270
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,785
Stupid, right?

271
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:04,984
Otsubo came to Beika City

272
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:08,484
and suffered collateral damage not by coincidence,

273
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:10,585
but because he was following Kagura.

274
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:13,484
Which means...

275
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:14,785
Could it be...

276
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:21,284
Apparently, Kagura said he hoped to suffer

277
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:24,084
some more tasty collateral damage.

278
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:27,284
Since he couldn't just wait around for it to happen,

279
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:30,585
he made the bomb threat and caused a panic.

280
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:36,385
Is Kagura really such a bad person?

281
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:40,784
While following him,

282
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:43,184
he seemed like a very cheerful and sociable person.

283
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:46,884
Even though he'd just been injured, he never stopped smiling.

284
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:50,384
The people he was talking to were smiling, too.

285
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,384
That's because he's going to be compensated.

286
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:58,384
But he didn't seem like a bad person who would trick his friends.

287
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,984
But he's an actor.

288
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:05,184
It's possible it was all an act.

289
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:07,184
You think so?

290
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:08,984
He told his actor friends

291
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:13,284
that he hoped to suffer more collateral damage

292
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:15,084
so he'd receive more money.

293
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:17,584
That could be his true nature.

294
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,084
Then it's decided.

295
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:21,284
The culprit is Kagura.

296
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:24,884
But the implausibility of the coincidence

297
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,884
isn't a strong enough basis for anything.

298
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:28,684
We need evidence.

299
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:32,784
That's where Kikuhide Otsubo comes in.

300
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,184
If he was following Kagura,

301
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:40,185
then it's possible he saw Kagura make the call.

302
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:45,084
I was waiting to confirm that,

303
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:47,684
but Otsubo hasn't come home.

304
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:50,284
We'll do all of it tomorrow.

305
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:51,384
Yeah.

306
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,484
We'll check in with Otsubo,

307
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:56,384
and do whatever it takes to find conclusive evidence.

308
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:58,085
Yeah...

309
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:06,384
I see.

310
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,285
So that's what happened.

311
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:13,585
I'll expose everything!

312
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:24,684
All right! Let's resume the investigation!

313
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:27,884
I'm going to check with Otsubo.

314
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:29,385
Then I'll...

315
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,285
Did something happen?

316
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,484
Otsubo?

317
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:43,485
No way!

318
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:45,884
Why him?

319
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,884
Kids, don't enter the crime scene.

320
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:50,084
Do you know him?

321
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,684
Yeah. Was he murdered?

322
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:53,784
Yeah.

323
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:56,284
We don't know the details yet,

324
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:59,384
but he was probably struck with a rock.

325
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:02,784
We think it happened around eight last night.

326
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:06,384
-Wait a minute. -You kids knew the victim?

327
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:12,384
You know the bomb threat made to that bank yesterday afternoon?

328
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:16,184
Yes. Though it turned out to be nonsense.

329
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:18,884
Because it was a Friday at the end of the month,

330
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:20,784
it caused a huge panic.

331
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,084
Genta got caught up in it.

332
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:27,285
Otsubo was another one of the victims.

333
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:30,884
And the night of the incident,

334
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:35,584
the victim, Otsubo was murdered.

335
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:36,585
Inspector.

336
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:40,084
We'll have to investigate to see

337
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:45,184
if yesterday's bomb scare and this case are related.

338
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,185
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

339
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:52,484
Like Inspector Megure said,

340
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:55,784
I wonder if this is related to yesterday's incident.

341
00:19:55,785 --> 00:20:00,484
Let's do whatever it takes to find our culprit ourselves, too.

342
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:02,184
-Yeah. -Let's do it.

343
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:07,784
It's possible Edogawa is right,

344
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:11,484
and Otsubo learned a grave secret about yesterday's incident

345
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:14,384
and was killed for it.

346
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:17,084
What? Wouldn't that mean

347
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:20,184
that Otsubo was killed by Kagura?

348
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,485
-Huh? -What?

349
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:29,184
Otsubo must've seen him yesterday

350
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,285
while following Kagura for social media fodder.

351
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:36,384
He saw Kagura calling the bank.

352
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:40,784
At the time, he probably didn't know he was making a bomb threat.

353
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,684
After leaving the hospital,

354
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:48,584
Otsubo followed unlucky man, Kagura for social media fodder.

355
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:53,584
Something made him realize Kagura caused the bomb scare

356
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,485
and questioned him.

357
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:58,985
So that's what happened.

358
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:04,185
I'll expose everything!

359
00:21:06,785 --> 00:21:09,784
Knowing that would only end poorly for him,

360
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:13,085
Kagura acted to silence him!

361
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:20,084
It's not impossible. It makes sense.

362
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,884
Right?

363
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:23,785
It makes sense, but...

364
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,584
There's something...

365
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:30,884
Let's tell Inspector Megure our reasoning.

366
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:33,884
Even if he killed him to silence him,

367
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:38,784
that reasoning assumes Kagura made the bomb threat.

368
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:40,084
Oh, right.

369
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:42,684
Since we don't have any proof of that,

370
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:46,984
the reasoning for Otsubo's murder is just speculation.

371
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:49,584
You guys keep talking about evidence,

372
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:53,784
but even without it, I'll put the screws on him until he confesses!

373
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:55,385
-Genta! -Hey!

374
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:58,284
What should we do, Conan?

375
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,084
That might work.

376
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,085
What?

377
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,084
We won't give him a hard time,

378
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:07,384
but we might be able to pick something up by going directly to Kagura.

379
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:11,284
He might reveal something about himself.

380
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:15,285
Yeah. Let's go talk to Kagura.

381
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:45,285
"Next Episode" -Otsubo was?

382
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:48,784
So apparently, you heard it, too.

383
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,685
It's all starting to sound suspicious.

384
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:52,685
Conan...

385
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:55,585
A love triangle?

386
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:00,984
I don't understand!

387
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:03,585
I thought Kagura was just drinking a beer, but then...

388
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:13,185
Next Conan, "The Cost of Likes (Part 2)"
