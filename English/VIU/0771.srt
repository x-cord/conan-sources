1
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:03,816
Pops Kogoro who came back from the Pachinko Parlor,

2
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:07,116
learns that Attorney Kisaki had a surgery because of an acute illness.

3
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:10,116
He rushes over immediately to the Haido Central Hospital.

4
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:13,516
However, it turns out that Attorney Kisaki just had mere appendicitis.

5
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:18,316
Therefore, Pops and I leave the room and...

6
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:23,916
Aren't you Mr. Mouri?

7
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:26,816
What are you doing in a place like this?

8
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:28,416
Bourbon?

9
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,516
Are you ill?

10
00:00:30,517 --> 00:00:34,016
Well... My wife, you see...

11
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:35,116
Why?

12
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:39,217
Why is a member of the Black Organization here at Haido Central Hospital?

13
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:42,616
Don't tell me that... It can't be...

14
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:44,116
Don't tell me that...

15
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:46,016
What brings you here?

16
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:50,816
I heard that an acquaintance of mine was hospitalized so I came to visit

17
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,016
but I guess I didn't make it in time.

18
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:59,116
The nurses mentioned that you've been here before, Conan.

19
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,516
Do you happen to know?

20
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:04,616
A man called Rikumichi Kusuda?

21
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,116
Who's that?

22
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:08,716
No.

23
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:10,617
You're really something.

24
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:16,316
Most people are not really sure whether they remember something correctly.

25
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:18,616
That's why before they say no,

26
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:19,816
they want to know other information

27
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:23,216
besides the name of the person that is being sought.

28
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,816
That's why you're really something, Conan!

29
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:31,017
You were confident you didn't know that person just by hearing his name.

30
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:35,516
Don't take what a kid says seriously.

31
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:36,816
There are millions of people you've met

32
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:39,316
but don't know their names.

33
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:40,616
There are also those that you only know

34
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:44,016
-by their nicknames too. -Three! Two! One!

35
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:45,517
Zero!

36
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,316
What's wrong?

37
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,916
Oh, no.

38
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,916
My nickname's also Zero,

39
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,316
so I thought somebody called me.

40
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:06,016
Why Zero? Your name's Tohru, right?

41
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:09,116
Tohru in Japanese means transparent, in other words, nil.

42
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:10,716
Therefore, Zero.

43
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:15,017
That's how children tend to make nicknames after all.

44
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,416
This picture's so nostalgic.

45
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,316
It was taken during the school festival.

46
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:28,916
Do you keep all your old photos in your cell phone?

47
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:31,516
Only the ones that I like.

48
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:34,716
Wasn't it during this school festival?

49
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:38,116
That you got it made with Sosaki, Reina?

50
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:41,716
You're really a lucky person, Reina.

51
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:44,616
I don't think so!

52
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:47,016
"Reina Sato (42)" -The other day I was almost about to lose

53
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:49,416
a large sum of stocks!

54
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:53,816
My hubby's a mere nouveau riche!

55
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,516
When my son had to take an exam,

56
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:57,916
I thought he had a cold but he ended up with influenza.

57
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:01,517
If I didn't realize soon enough, it could've been a tragedy!

58
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:04,616
My life's like walking on tight rope.

59
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,317
One mistake and I would've been in the pits.

60
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:24,316
The scream came from this room, right?

61
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,616
Yes.

62
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,117
Is something wrong?

63
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,917
-Reina? -Reina!

64
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,416
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

65
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,416
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

66
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,216
Herb tea smeared with revenge!

67
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:45,416
Solving the case with Amuro from zero.

68
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,016
He sees through the one and only truth.

69
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,816
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

70
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:50,917
His name is Detective Conan!

71
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:36,945
"An Awkward Tea Party (Part 2)"

72
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,845
"Haido Central Hospital."

73
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:41,046
Inspector Megure!

74
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:46,245
We've finished investigating the hospital room

75
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:50,645
but we couldn't find any bag or container with poison inside.

76
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,145
I see.

77
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:56,645
So it's likely that the perpetrator took it out and disposed it.

78
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:59,445
And no poison was detected from the herb tea

79
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,845
that was spilled on the floor.

80
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:02,846
What?

81
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:05,145
Then, how was the poison inserted?

82
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:08,545
Well... The poison was actually laced...

83
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,845
Are you talking about the teacup?

84
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,145
Hey!

85
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:14,245
Just what do you think you're doing?

86
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:16,945
I looked all over the hospital for you!

87
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:19,045
Ran...

88
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,445
I told you not go wandering off by yourself, didn't I?

89
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:24,245
But...

90
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:26,346
I told you not to, didn't I?

91
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:32,845
I told you not to fight anymore, didn't I?

92
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,645
But...

93
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:38,345
I can't treat you next time even if you get hurt, you know.

94
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:42,445
Because I'll have to move far away.

95
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:48,945
It's bye-bye time, Rei...

96
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:52,645
Hey... Are you all right?

97
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,945
Hey!

98
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,645
What's up?

99
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:58,145
Mr. Mouri...

100
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:02,445
Even one as great as you cannot solve this murder by poison case?

101
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:05,045
You haven't solved it either, have you, Mr. Mouri?

102
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:07,745
If so, I wouldn't be able to solve it either!

103
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:09,546
I guess so.

104
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:13,445
Come on! We're going home!

105
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:16,745
But the case hasn't been...

106
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:18,545
The case...

107
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:22,245
I heard the siren of a police car a while ago...

108
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:25,145
Don't tell me that something happened at this hospital?

109
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:29,345
Yes. A woman drank poison and died.

110
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:32,145
So Inspector Megure, Officer Takagi and even Pops Kogoro

111
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,945
are all racking their brains trying to figure it out!

112
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:37,045
But, Conan.

113
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,945
Look out the window.

114
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:42,145
The blue sky's turned crimson red, right?

115
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:44,446
So, it's time for children to go home.

116
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:49,345
The blue sky...

117
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:52,246
turned red?

118
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:54,846
Red...

119
00:07:57,446 --> 00:08:00,345
I see. That's what it was!

120
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:05,545
So, leave the case up to Dad and the police...

121
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:07,445
Hey...

122
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,846
Conan?

123
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:12,345
The mystery's been solved!

124
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:15,145
The perpetrator is her after all.

125
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:17,246
And the way she did it was...

126
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:22,646
You've of course got it solved too, right?

127
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:28,746
Zero!

128
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:33,245
The rim of the teacup?

129
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,745
Poison was laced there?

130
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:40,245
Yes, just where there was lipstick on.

131
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:43,545
It was rigged so that the victim Ms. Reina Suto

132
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:47,245
would bring her mouth to it and drink the poison in.

133
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:52,345
No poison was detected from the herb tea inside the cup.

134
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:54,545
"Kazuki Beppu (41)" -So, are you saying that one of us

135
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:58,145
laced the cup with poison just before she drank from it?

136
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,445
"Tokie Happo (42)" -I'm sure someone would've noticed

137
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,845
if something like that were done.

138
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:04,845
"Juri Kosaka (42)" -There was no one like that.

139
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:08,245
Amuro said just a while ago, didn't he?

140
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,245
The poison wasn't laced directly on the cup

141
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:12,245
but rather, the poison was laced on the perpetrator's cup

142
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:13,845
and then switched it.

143
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,645
I'm saying that's not possible, aren't I?

144
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:20,345
I was drinking yellow Chamomile.

145
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:25,945
Mine was a herb tea called Peppermint of brown color.

146
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:31,445
Mine was a blue herb tea called Butterfly Pea.

147
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,145
If I were to switch my cup with Ms. Suto's

148
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:37,045
who was drinking a red colored Hibiscus tea,

149
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,645
I think everyone would've noticed right away.

150
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,945
But, only the victim used lemon in her tea, right?

151
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:45,645
If vision was limited,

152
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:47,445
even if the color were to be a bit different.

153
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:49,445
You're absolutely wrong!

154
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:51,145
I guess that a middle aged man

155
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,446
who knows nothing about herb tea like you wouldn't know!

156
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:56,545
Well...

157
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:59,945
At any rate, it's a clear fact that the perpetrator laced the cup

158
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:03,645
with poison and killed Ms. Suto!

159
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,345
However, the fact that no bag

160
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:08,645
or container with the poison inside was found anywhere

161
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:11,345
in this hospital room means...

162
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:14,845
either one of you Ms. Beppu or Ms. Happo,

163
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,945
who left this room alternately,

164
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:22,845
is most probably the perpetrator.

165
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:24,145
I see...

166
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:26,145
After lacing the cup with poison,

167
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:28,845
they got rid of the container with the poison inside

168
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:30,945
by taking it out of the room.

169
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,145
Yeah...

170
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:35,645
Wait a minute! I just went to the restroom!

171
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:39,145
I went to the convenience store to buy sweets to go with the tea.

172
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:41,445
I have the receipt too.

173
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:44,045
Well, if we check the pipe of the toilet

174
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:46,345
or the road to the convenience store,

175
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,845
I'm sure we'll find something.

176
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:51,646
But, the perpetrator sure has guts. Don't you think so?

177
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:54,545
Hey, Conan.

178
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:57,245
Because if I were to lace the cup with poison,

179
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,245
I would never leave the room!

180
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:00,645
Because somebody may wipe my cup

181
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:03,045
while I'm gone or the position of the cups,

182
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:06,445
or the type of tea I wanted to drink may be changed.

183
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,845
Making it impossible to figure out which cup the poison is laced on,

184
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:11,045
bringing upon a conclusion that's not called for!

185
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,245
True.

186
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:15,645
Then, when and how did the perpetrator lace the poison?

187
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:20,246
And where is the container that the poison was in?

188
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:25,445
We've got no choice but to thoroughly check this hospital room again.

189
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:28,345
There's no need to do that!

190
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:30,545
Because there's one person left!

191
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:33,245
Who could've laced the poison onto the cup openly

192
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:36,245
without pulling away from the cup at all.

193
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,845
Right?

194
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:39,246
Zero?

195
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:41,345
Zero?

196
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:47,545
Amuro says that he was called Zero when he was a child.

197
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:50,045
And? How about it?

198
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,045
Do you follow?

199
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,545
Yes...

200
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,345
Thanks to Conan's hint just now.

201
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,845
Somewhat...

202
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:59,945
That person could lace the poison

203
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:02,345
as well as dispose of the container of the poison beforehand,

204
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:07,045
without leaving this hospital room at all during the time of the crime,

205
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:09,245
and wait scrupulously for a chance

206
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:15,245
to switch her cup with that of the victim's.

207
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:18,646
The only one who could've done this is you.

208
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:27,573
That person could lace the poison

209
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:31,873
as well as dispose of the container of the poison beforehand,

210
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:36,573
without leaving this hospital room at all during the time of the crime,

211
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:38,673
and wait scrupulously for a chance

212
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:44,573
to switch her cup with that of the victim's.

213
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:48,074
The only one who could've done this is you.

214
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:51,574
Mrs. Juri Kosaka!

215
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,073
Wait up, will you!

216
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:02,373
You say she laced her own cup with poison to begin with?

217
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:06,273
Juri was drinking herb tea with that cup right through, you know?

218
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:08,273
Did you forget?

219
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:09,773
The poison was laced on the side

220
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:12,873
when she drank holding the cup in her left hand.

221
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:16,673
If she were careful not to pick the cup up with her left hand,

222
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:19,374
she would never drink the poison that was laced.

223
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,173
Then since when was the poison there?

224
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:25,073
She probably brought the poison with her

225
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,673
even before she was hospitalized.

226
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,873
Today, before the victim came to visit her here,

227
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:32,473
she probably laced the cup with poison

228
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:36,173
and disposed of the container somewhere outside the room.

229
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:37,274
Isn't that right?

230
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:41,173
Aren't you the one who'd forgotten?

231
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:43,773
Juri was drinking blue herb tea

232
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:47,473
and Reina was drinking red herb tea.

233
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:49,473
No matter if the lemon was afloat in her tea,

234
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,573
she would never have picked up the wrong cup!

235
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:52,574
Right.

236
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:56,274
That lemon is the key to this trick.

237
00:13:57,374 --> 00:13:58,473
The key?

238
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:00,173
Yes. The fact is...

239
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,573
What? It's really blue!

240
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:05,874
This Butterfly Pea is a strange tea.

241
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:08,373
Hey!

242
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:11,473
Don't go touching the personal effects at the crime site on your own again!

243
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:14,273
This is hot water that I got from the hospital a while ago!

244
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:15,973
This lemon too!

245
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:18,673
You brat! That's enough!

246
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:21,674
It's strange!

247
00:14:24,374 --> 00:14:27,473
This tea was blue and yet after I put the lemon inside,

248
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:29,674
it's starting to get redder and redder!

249
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:34,273
-Are you serious? -This is something.

250
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,973
It's like a science experiment!

251
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:41,273
The color changed because the tea reacted to the acid of the lemon.

252
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:45,473
There are other herb teas that react likewise.

253
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:47,973
Are you referring to Blue Mallow?

254
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,773
If I remember correctly, if you put lemon inside,

255
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:52,373
it changes from light blue to pink.

256
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:53,873
Yes.

257
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:56,673
Naturally, if it gets red with acidity.

258
00:14:56,674 --> 00:15:00,373
The thing that Ms. Kosaka used to polish the cups...

259
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:04,473
If this alkaline baking soda...

260
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:07,773
were added.

261
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,874
The color would return back to blue again!

262
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:17,473
In other words, this is how Ms. Kosaka committed the crime.

263
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:19,173
First, after finding out that Ms. Suto and the others

264
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:21,273
were coming to visit you,

265
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:23,473
you asked only Ms. Suto to come a bit earlier than the others.

266
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:26,973
You asked her to go get hot water for the tea party,

267
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:28,073
and while she was doing so,

268
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:30,573
you laced the poison, that you brought when you were hospitalized,

269
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:33,673
on the opposite side of the rim of the cup that you'd be drinking from

270
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:37,573
and disposed of the container somewhere outside your room.

271
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:40,273
After all three woman arrived,

272
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:44,273
you suggested to compare drinking various kinds of teas,

273
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:48,173
and waited for Ms. Suto to select Hibiscus tea.

274
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:49,273
Why?

275
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:53,573
Because the color of Hibiscus tea is a red with a tinge of purple.

276
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:56,273
It looks a lot like the color of Butterfly Pea

277
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:59,873
after lemon is inserted into it.

278
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:00,874
Just as you wished,

279
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,973
Ms. Suto selected the tea you wanted her to select.

280
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,173
Therefore, you put a Hibiscus teabag,

281
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,273
which contents had been switched beforehand to Butterfly Pea,

282
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:12,773
then put lemon on top of it and poured hot water into the cup.

283
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:16,973
As a result you got to serve Ms. Suto red Butterfly Pea

284
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,473
that looked exactly like Hibiscus tea.

285
00:16:19,474 --> 00:16:21,273
I see.

286
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:24,573
So, how did she switch it?

287
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,573
She did it when Ms. Suto and the others were absorbed

288
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:30,073
at looking at the pictures in her cell phone.

289
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:33,273
First of all, into her cup laced with poison,

290
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:35,073
she put lemon into her blue Butterfly Pea

291
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:37,073
to change the color to red.

292
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:39,773
Then she placed Ms. Suto's cup down pushing it forward.

293
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:42,173
She makes it look as if she was picking up her own cup

294
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:43,973
when she was actually picking up Ms. Suto's,

295
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:47,573
then took the lemon out of that cup and put baking soda into it,

296
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,773
returning it to blue.

297
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:51,973
After that, you pushed the cup that was laced with poison down

298
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:54,973
and pushed it a bit forward in the same way,

299
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,073
and the handle of the poison laced cup

300
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:59,273
was on the left side when viewed from Ms. Suto.

301
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:02,173
You did this to lure her to pick up the poison laced cup

302
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:06,674
while she was absorbed in looking at the pictures.

303
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:11,274
Am I wrong somewhere?

304
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:15,173
You talk like you've been watching or something,

305
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,174
but where on earth do you have such proof?

306
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:23,974
The ring on your left hand is red, Miss!

307
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:28,273
Did you get hurt or something?

308
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:30,373
Oh, no. This is...

309
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:33,773
There was one other thing the perpetrator

310
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:35,673
had to erase from the scene of the crime.

311
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:38,073
That is the lipstick that got on the cup

312
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:40,673
when Ms. Suto first drank her tea.

313
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:44,773
Because it would be unnatural if lipstick were to be found on Ms. Kosaka

314
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:47,173
who is a patient in the hospital.

315
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:50,573
You probably tried to wipe it off impulsively with your fingers

316
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:56,273
but lipstick is hard to remove unless you use soap or something.

317
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:57,873
In other words...

318
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:01,973
If the red color matches that of Ms. Suto's lipstick,

319
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:04,173
it would serve as evidence.

320
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:08,073
Well, if Ms. Suto's cup that was switched is checked,

321
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,573
that would serve as proof too.

322
00:18:10,574 --> 00:18:14,273
Because there should be a lot of baking soda inside it.

323
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:18,273
Then how did she put in the baking soda?

324
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:19,973
She probably laced the cubes of sugar

325
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,273
that were on the table with baking soda

326
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:24,073
and hid them at the bottom of the container.

327
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:27,973
Putting sugar cubes inside herb tea doesn't call for suspicion.

328
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,373
But...

329
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:33,573
I don't think Juri has any motive to kill Reina, though?

330
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:35,873
If Juri were to have a grudge against Reina,

331
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:38,573
it would only be about her son failing to take the entrance test.

332
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:41,273
That's not something to kill a person over.

333
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:43,273
It's not only my son

334
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:47,674
who fell ill from catching her son's influenza back then.

335
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:50,373
You did too?

336
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:51,773
Yes.

337
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:54,973
Back then...

338
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,774
I was pregnant.

339
00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:01,373
I was told by the doctor that catching influenza

340
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:05,773
may have bad affects on the fetus.

341
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:09,573
I had a nervous breakdown

342
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,073
and as a result...

343
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:12,274
I had a miscarriage.

344
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:19,073
Of course at first I thought I was just a bit careless,

345
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,273
or unlucky but...

346
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:25,973
After I heard what Mrs. Suto's son said

347
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:28,473
on the day that he came to visit later.

348
00:19:28,474 --> 00:19:30,673
What's the matter, Tsuneo?

349
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:33,173
Please give Toji my apologies.

350
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,173
Don't worry about it.

351
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,473
You thought it was just a cold too, didn't you?

352
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:42,973
No. I knew it was influenza.

353
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,973
I was already getting better, but...

354
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:48,673
Mom told me to go over and study,

355
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:50,673
because it's the last day to study,

356
00:19:50,674 --> 00:19:52,973
and by doing so I can get rid of one of my rivals,

357
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:55,374
it would really be a lucky thing.

358
00:19:57,274 --> 00:20:01,274
Please don't tell Mom that I told you this!

359
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:07,673
Horrible.

360
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:11,273
But that's something Reina would do.

361
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:14,473
I'm just as horrible.

362
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,873
I tried to get you all suspected

363
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:19,674
and frame you up as being the perpetrator.

364
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:25,473
But, too bad.

365
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,273
Butterfly Pea also had detoxification properties.

366
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:29,873
That's why I chose it.

367
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:33,573
I thought that maybe it would help me digest

368
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,873
the black murderous fury that existed in me

369
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:40,474
before I committed the crime, but...

370
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:08,274
But poisoning someone who comes to visit you in the hospital.

371
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:13,374
To be honest, maybe this hospital is cursed.

372
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:17,673
Many things seem to have happened in the past too, you see.

373
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:18,873
Many things?

374
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:21,873
There was rumor going round that an announcer named Rena Mizunashi

375
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,373
was hospitalized here.

376
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:26,473
Then wounded people avalanched in causing chaos.

377
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:29,573
I also heard that there was a bombing commotion here too.

378
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:31,273
Officer Takagi!

379
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:35,373
Don't you have to return to MPD already?

380
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:38,973
Oh, no! I wasn't supposed to be wasting my time here!

381
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:43,773
Then, you don't know of a man called Rikumichi Kusuda, do you?

382
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:45,773
Rikumichi Kusuda?

383
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:47,673
Now that you mentioned it,

384
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:50,373
a few days before the bombing incident that I just mentioned,

385
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:53,273
a damaged vehicle was found near here,

386
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:58,074
and the owner of that vehicle was a man called Rikumichi Kusuda!

387
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:02,873
It seems that he was a patient of this hospital

388
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,973
but he suddenly vanished.

389
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:08,073
It was a case full of mysteries.

390
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:10,173
Inside that damaged vehicle

391
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:12,973
a great amount of splattered blood was found all over the vehicle.

392
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,473
Some of the blood stains were less than a millimeter across.

393
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:17,373
-According to forensics... -Blood stains less than a millimeter across

394
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,374
from high speed shooting.

395
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:24,974
A pistol?

396
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,174
See you!

397
00:23:42,974 --> 00:23:45,473
"Next Episode."

398
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:48,973
You ended up suddenly coming today, didn't you, Ran?

399
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,873
Oh, I got it!

400
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:53,373
You're on a date with your boyfriend!

401
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:55,673
It's nothing like that.

402
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:59,273
Come to think of it, she was waiting here back then too.

403
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,673
You're late.

404
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:01,873
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

405
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,573
A lot of things came up, you see!

406
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:05,573
So, it was you after all.

407
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:07,573
Shinichi Kudo.

408
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:12,974
Next Conan, "Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 1)"

409
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:30,573
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:32,973
"Cell phone."

411
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,473
Ran, the next episode is something to look forward to, no?

412
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,173
But, it's just a memory though.

413
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,874
I'm happy about it.
