1
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:03,854
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:05,854
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:07,654
There's a strange mark on Ayumi and Genta.

4
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:09,554
The key to the case is in the car.

5
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:11,154
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:13,054
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,255
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,299
On the way back from school in the rain,

9
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,000
Ayumi bumps into a serial killer on the run.

10
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,299
She didn't get to see his face

11
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,299
but the mark of, probably, the belongings of the culprit

12
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,999
that resembled the number "5"

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,099
was left on the palm of her hand.

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,000
And the same mark was also found on Genta's buttocks!

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,100
Don't tell me that...

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,999
This! It's this mark!

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,899
The key-shaped bloodstain

18
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,099
was on the sleeve of Ayumi's clothes.

19
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,299
This serves as proof that the culprit grabbed the key

20
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,299
with hands soiled with the blood of the victim and fled!

21
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,099
This means that the culprit will not show the police the key,

22
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,200
which he knows will display haematological response!

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,999
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 2)"

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,599
"The Metropolitan Police Department, Beika Police Station."

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,099
Only three?

26
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,199
Are you serious, Inspector Megure?

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,299
Yes.

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,299
One that was stopped at the checkpoint

29
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,499
and two others that were driving around in the vicinity!

30
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,799
They're car owners who are nearby residents that have no alibi

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,199
and who are saying that they've lost their master keys.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,299
At any rate,

33
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,699
I'm going to have the three people go over to you right now.

34
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,299
If you got a glimpse of the serial killer,

35
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,599
I'd like you to make a confirmation too!

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Yes, sir! I understand!

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,499
The three suspects are on their way here right now!

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Good!

39
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:26,899
It's as if we've already arrested the culprit!

40
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,999
Ayumi heard the culprit's voice.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,099
So, he'll probably go pale when he sees her!

42
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,899
Yes, I'm sure!

43
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,499
I'll do my best!

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm against it.

45
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,199
It the culprit is really among the three,

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,299
you meet him and he gets arrested, that's fine.

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,099
But what if he's acquitted because of lack of evidence?

48
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,099
The culprit's going to hold a grudge on you for putting him in a fix,

49
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,599
come after you and may take revenge on you one day!

50
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,999
Even more so if he's a serial killer who's killing people at random,

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,799
don't you think so?

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,399
You're taking your imagination too far, Haibara.

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,999
I'm trying to say don't go taking a reckless risk

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
when there isn't sufficient evidence yet!

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,599
But I'm the one who saw the culprit at the closest range,

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,599
so I may be able to tell who the culprit is

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,599
if you make them wear raincoats, right?

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,499
You can confirm that just looking at pictures too, right?

59
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,499
As for the voice, you can listen to the recorded voice.

60
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,499
There's no need to go any further

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,799
and leave a stronger impression on the culprit

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,799
than you already have.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,899
Just as Haibara's pointing out,

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,799
it's too risky to meet the culprit directly.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,499
But it's vexing to let the three suspects go off just like that

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,599
after questioning them too.

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,499
There's no guarantee that they'll be no more victims either.

68
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,899
Maybe it's better to just keep a distance

69
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,399
and peek in secretly for now, right?

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
Okay! This way...

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,900
Stop!

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,999
Please get out of the car one by one,

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,499
tell me your name and what you do.

74
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,099
Please also tell me where and what you

75
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,399
were doing at the time of the crime, around 14:00.

76
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,199
First, from you at the far left.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,399
Geez.

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,999
I came here voluntarily

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,099
and you treat me like I'm the culprit.

80
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,599
"Hiroshi Enomoto (21)" -I'm Hiroshi Enomoto.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,699
I'm a university student working part-time

82
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,899
at a sushi shop at Sanchome!

83
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,299
Did you buy this car with the money you made

84
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,499
from working part-time?

85
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,199
No. I leeched off my parents.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,199
Is there a problem with that?

87
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,699
I see.

88
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,199
If through smoked glass,

89
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,799
they can't see us from their side.

90
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,500
And does the voice of that man sound familiar?

91
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,799
It sounds familiar and yet doesn't.

92
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,599
It's my day off today.

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,299
Last night my boss scolded me

94
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,299
so I was feeling bummed out

95
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,099
and decided to get it off my chest by going to the mountains,

96
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,899
when I was nabbed at the checkpoint.

97
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,499
You were going to the mountains to get it off your chest?

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,299
Well, the scenery in that area is nice

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,999
so I feel refreshed.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,099
No wonder the body of the car is soiled and full of scratches.

101
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,599
Next! You, in the middle!

102
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,999
Oh, yes.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,699
Hey! Don't you go banging my car around!

104
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,999
I'm not really good at driving

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,999
but I'm good at repairing.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,099
Which means you work as...

108
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,399
Oh, yes.

109
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,699
"Naokazu Fukuchi (36)" -I work at an automobile repair factory.

110
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,999
My name is Naokazu Fukuchi.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,699
The factory is closed today

112
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,299
but my car was not in the best condition,

113
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,899
so I was confined in the factory since morning repairing it.

114
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,799
But there are reports of you being seen driving around town.

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,599
I was just driving around the shopping arcade to check

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,899
if the car was totally repaired!

117
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,299
Is anything wrong with that?

118
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,700
No.

119
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Next.

120
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:53,100
Yeah.

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,799
"Toshiaki Degawa (43)" -My name's Toshiaki Degawa.

122
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,199
I'm a locksmith and my shop's located on Ichome.

123
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,999
How wretched of me despite being a locksmith,

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,299
to lose the master key.

125
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,299
Your car, unlike the other two, is sure nice and shiny.

126
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,499
Yeah, I go get a car wash each time I go out.

127
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,699
This car is my heart and soul, you know?

128
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,399
Which means you went out this afternoon too?

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,599
I got a call saying that the client lost her house key

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,399
and wanted me to unlock the door.

131
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,499
But since she didn't explain her address very well,

132
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,299
I was going around in circles looking for the house.

133
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,199
However, I didn't get to see her at all.

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,899
She called again and say that her boyfriend who had a spare key came,

135
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,699
so that I didn't have to go.

136
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,999
Has anything dawned on you so far?

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,199
Nothing at all.

138
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,299
Besides, they're not shouting.

139
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,299
All three of them are about the same height and physique.

140
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,699
Hey, over there!

141
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,199
What're you whispering about?

142
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,499
Oh, well...

143
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,599
Hey.

144
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,999
Officer Takagi

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,200
I've got a little favor to ask you.

146
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
What is it?

147
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,700
What could it be?

148
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,600
You see...

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,699
I'll go see him, after all.

150
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,899
What?

151
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,999
If I go closer and take a look,

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,099
I may be able to figure out the culprit.

153
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,699
No! Didn't I just tell you that

154
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,599
if the culprit doesn't get arrested,

155
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,499
something terrible may happen to you.

156
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,699
But...

157
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,599
Not only you.

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,999
There's a possibility that the culprit would come

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,600
to take revenge on anyone who was involved with you too.

160
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,999
Although I know how you feel about wanting to punish the bad guy,

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,799
but to hold back your feelings no matter how strong

162
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,799
and keeping out of the picture also requires a lot of courage too.

163
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,599
Yes. This is the right thing to do

164
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,699
for yourself as well as for all the others.

165
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,799
That's the story.

166
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,899
What? You want me to call the forensic officer

167
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,099
and get a minus screwdriver?

168
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,199
Yup.

169
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,999
I think everything will clear up.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,099
And we'll all find out who the big fat liar serial killer

171
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,899
that is resorting to cheap tricks to hide his crime is.

172
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,199
Yes, it's him.

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,699
Well, at any rate,

174
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,299
you're going to have to leave your cars

175
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,499
at the police station for a while.

176
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,499
There are a lot more things we'd like to check on.

177
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,599
Hey...

178
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,899
You got to be kidding.

179
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,999
I came here to Beika Police Station voluntarily.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,999
Why are you taking things so far as to keep my car in police custody?

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,799
Please give us a convincing explanation too.

182
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,299
Why were we summoned here as suspects of a serial killer case?

183
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,599
If you called us in just because we don't have an alibi

184
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
during the time of the crime,

185
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:37,699
I'm sure there are a lot of other people too.

186
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,099
First of all, it's your car!

187
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,499
All of them are from the same brand and model.

188
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,699
Yeah.

189
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,799
Moreover, all three of you say you've lost your master key.

190
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,699
When the serial killer fled,

191
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,599
he dropped the car key of this car with the emblem of the brand on it.

192
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,999
We already have reports that the culprit picked the key up

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,499
with hands smeared with the blood of the victim.

194
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,799
We also know that he came back to the site of the crime to confirm

195
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,599
whether the police had a lead on him.

196
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,599
We also know based on the testimony of a witness

197
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,799
that the culprit is very likely a resident of this vicinity

198
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,499
who knows he'll be in hot water

199
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,799
once the police start checking on him.

200
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,499
The person who own this car model

201
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,999
have no alibi,

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,699
live nearby

203
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,999
and cannot show us your master key

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
because it is smeared with blood

205
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,999
are only three of you.

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,899
I told you I really just lost my key.

207
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,699
Well, a simple check by those forensic officers

208
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,599
will clear all of that in no time at all.

209
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,999
-Check? -What?

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,499
We're just going to check for luminol reactions.

211
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,199
Officer Takagi, please have them begin.

212
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,999
Yeah.

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,799
Please do as I told you over the phone then.

214
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,399
Yes, sir.

215
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,199
First, start from Mr. Enomoto's car on the far left.

216
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,299
Hey...

217
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,599
Don't tell me that you're going to search the inside of the car

218
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,399
for the master key?

219
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,599
Even if you're the police,

220
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,699
you couldn't possibly do something outrageous like that!

221
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,899
Don't worry. We won't check inside your car.

222
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,699
Hey, Conan?

223
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,099
What on earth are you going to check?

224
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,099
If I were the culprit,

225
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,699
I would've thrown the blood stained key away long time ago!

226
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,600
Silly. It's not the key that's being checked.

227
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,699
We're checking the keyhole of the door of the driver's seat side

228
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,399
that the culprit stuck the key in when he fled.

229
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,699
I see! Blood should be there too, right?

230
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,999
But even if blood were found there,

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,299
it would be a very small amount.

232
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,199
Will you really be able to make it out?

233
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,399
Of course.

234
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,999
Luminol reaction is very sensitive

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,199
and can detect the slightest amount of blood.

236
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,299
Yeah. The culprit went out all out as to think up a cheap trick

237
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,699
and lie in order to hide the fact.

238
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,499
A lie? Cheap trick?

239
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,399
Try and remember

240
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,099
what the three said about

241
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,299
what they were doing at the time of the crime.

242
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,699
Let's see.

243
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,499
Mr. Enomoto was headed for the mountains to take a drive.

244
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,399
Mr. Fukuchi drove around the shopping arcade

245
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,399
to check if his car was repaired.

246
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,999
And Mr. Degawa was going around looking for the house of the person

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,199
who said she lost the house keys.

248
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,599
Why does that make them liars?

249
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,399
Then, take a look!

250
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,599
The car of Mr. Degawa who says his car is his heart and soul

251
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,999
is sparkling clean.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,499
Mr. Fukuchi who says he's a lousy driver

253
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,699
has his car parked really near the next car.

254
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,099
And the speed racer Mr. Enomoto's car

255
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,499
is full of scratches and soiled.

256
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,900
You understand, now, don't you?

257
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,499
Not at all!

258
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,699
Genta, how did you practice riding the bicycle?

259
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,499
I practiced together with mom

260
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,099
at a back road where not too many people were.

261
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,399
Because it'd be dangerous bumping into people.

262
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,899
Oh! I see!

263
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,799
Mr. Fukuchi is lying!

264
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,599
If he's not good at driving

265
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,499
he wouldn't even try driving through a shopping arcade

266
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,299
where there are a lot of people!

267
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,999
Besides at the time of the crime,

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,499
it was raining and his vision would be poorer than usual.

269
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,199
It's the worse course to try out a car

270
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,099
that you're not even sure is working right.

271
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,499
Moreover, Mr. Fukuchi parked his car completely parallel

272
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,399
to the car next to his.

273
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,099
That's only proof that he's an extremely good driver!

274
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,799
If he's not good, he's car would be a bit crooked.

275
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,099
Then, the culprit is Mr. Fukuchi and he's the liar?

276
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,299
Yes, he parked his car very close to the next car

277
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,199
to make checking the keyhole of the door difficult.

278
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,399
But, it's all over now.

279
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,399
Look, the car next to his was moved,

280
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,599
so the keyhole on the driver's seat side is in clear view.

281
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,499
I'm sure there'll be a response

282
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,999
if luminol is sprayed onto the keyhole.

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,499
A bluish-purple color should be emitted

284
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,700
when it chemically reacts to blood.

285
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,000
No reaction.

286
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,700
No way.

287
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:08,339
Really?

288
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,538
Hey.

289
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,738
Just what does this mean, Officer Takagi?

290
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:15,138
You said so confidently that this would specify the culprit.

291
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:19,239
Well, it was supposed to work out that way.

292
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:42,538
Excuse me, could you lend me a minus screwdriver?

293
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:45,238
A minus screwdriver?

294
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,038
Here you go.

295
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,038
Thank you.

296
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,938
So, are you satisfied now?

297
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:54,438
Since all three cars showed no reaction,

298
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,438
can we go now?

299
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,438
Now you know that we're not the serial killer, right?

300
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,539
Please calm down.

301
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,138
What's going on, Conan?

302
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,338
It's not like you said at all.

303
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:11,838
Where's Conan?

304
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,938
He went that way just now,

305
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:16,838
after taking a minus screwdriver from the forensic officer.

306
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:17,939
What?

307
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,038
This keyhole moves like a slime

308
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,638
when pushed from outside?

309
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,739
What?

310
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,839
I wonder what it is?

311
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:35,439
Oh, hey!

312
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,239
Hey, sonny!

313
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:56,538
The key cylinder is fixed in place with vinyl tape!

314
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,138
I see.

315
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,438
He changed it on the spur of the moment

316
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,538
with the cylinder of another car,

317
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:04,038
thinking that the police would check it out.

318
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:06,038
Which means that the real reason

319
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,638
why he parked his car really close to the next car is...

320
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,638
To hide this.

321
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,738
Unless you open the door this way and remove the cover,

322
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,838
you can't check how the key cylinder is on the inside.

323
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,538
Then, don't tell me that...

324
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:23,439
Conan had foreseen all this to begin with.

325
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:30,038
No. This key cylinder is really the one for this car!

326
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,038
I goofed when trying to set it up and broke it.

327
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,738
It's just a temporary measure until a replacement arrives.

328
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:40,338
Will you show us the key to this car, then?

329
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:43,538
As well as the car number that is carved into it!

330
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,538
You should know since you're an auto mechanic.

331
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,638
That there are numbers on the key cylinder

332
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,638
of the driver's seat side of the car.

333
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,838
If we compare the two,

334
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,438
we can tell whether it's the same key.

335
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:59,238
Or would you like us to spray luminol onto the key cylinder

336
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,638
of the ignition beside the steering wheel?

337
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,538
I'm sure blood reaction will be displayed,

338
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,538
because the key cylinder of the ignition is sealed

339
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:10,339
and cannot be changed in a short period of time.

340
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,738
Okay!

341
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:17,339
I'll show you the key number!

342
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:27,039
I'm sure the key is in the dashboard compartment.

343
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,438
Oh, hey!

344
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,339
Open the door, will you?

345
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,438
This guy confessed later that he did what he did

346
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:02,738
because he wanted public attention.

347
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:06,638
It seems he was just seeking stimulation in his mundane life.

348
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:09,438
However, since in this serial killer case,

349
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,238
there are no casualties...

350
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,239
No...

351
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,039
That doesn't redeem him at all.

352
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:19,438
It turned out that this stupid attention seeker

353
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:22,638
just jostled the area around the Beika Police Station a bit

354
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,739
and the case was closed.

355
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:31,838
I'm sure glad that the culprit was caught though!

356
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,538
We don't have to worry about Ayumi being pursued by the culprit anymore!

357
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,338
I don't mind being pursued!

358
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:41,238
Why?

359
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,538
Because I know Conan will protect me.

360
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,939
Hey...

361
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:53,138
Of course, I was counting on Mitsuhiko, Genta and Ai too!

362
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:54,939
I know I'd be totally fine!

363
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:06,038
Sorry.

364
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,139
I have something I have to do.

365
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,139
Bye-bye.

366
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,138
Bye-bye!

367
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:20,639
See you!

368
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:58,038
My, how nice of you.

369
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,239
To come visit me.

370
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:04,538
If I let time pass by,

371
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,638
I felt like I was going to change my mind, that's why.

372
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:09,538
So, you've made up your mind.

373
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:13,838
As to whether to accept the witness protection program or not.

374
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,538
Yes.

375
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:16,639
Of course.

376
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,238
Of course...

377
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,539
I'm declining.

378
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,138
It's probably true

379
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:32,638
that I'd be safe if I change my name and address

380
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,638
and become an entirely different person.

381
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:37,838
But I'd have to go over the same thing again anyway.

382
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,238
I'll be living a vicious circle of fear and hiding,

383
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,239
then becoming another person

384
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,938
when the danger of my identity being revealed comes around!

385
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:47,738
Besides, there is no guarantee that

386
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,038
I can completely trust you FBI agents.

387
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,439
And besides...

388
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:58,238
Although I know how you feel about wanting to punish the bad guy,

389
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:01,638
but keeping out of the picture also requires a lot of courage too.

390
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,438
But...

391
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,238
But I...

392
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,739
don't want to run!

393
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:10,338
I can't win just by running around!

394
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:11,739
I can never win!

395
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,739
I don't want to run.

396
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,438
So, you've decided against it after all.

397
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,338
You're not going to try to convince me otherwise?

398
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:27,738
Well...

399
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:33,538
Of course, I'm against your idea as an FBI agent but...

400
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:34,838
since I experienced

401
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,439
somebody coming after my life when I was still a child.

402
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:43,239
I'd like you to cherish how you feel right now!

403
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,739
Hang in there.

404
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,839
See you.

405
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:07,938
Geez.

406
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:11,338
It's like I'm watching you as a child.

407
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:14,638
You, who kept denying to accept the witness protection program.

408
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:18,138
And in the end, shouted defiantly to let you join the FBI

409
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:19,738
in exchange for accepting the program.

410
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:22,638
Wrong, James.

411
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:28,139
She seems to already have what I lacked back then.

412
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:32,038
Yes.

413
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,038
Something that is very dangerous

414
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,438
and capable of breeding disaster.

415
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,539
But yet a very warm thing that gives you courage.

416
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,138
"Next Episode" -There's something

417
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,538
that feels familiar about this place!

418
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,539
Nostalgia, as they say.

419
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:10,238
Beware of fire!

420
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,638
Where's Ayumi?

421
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:14,639
Wait, don't leave me behind!

422
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:21,539
It can't be...

423
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,338
Next Conan,

424
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:27,639
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 1)"

425
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:46,238
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,538
"Seal."

427
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:50,438
The next episode is the off-season mystery.

428
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,339
I'm scared! Mother!
