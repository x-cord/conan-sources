00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,810
Progressing steadily towards the next phase of the future.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,380
Thanks to your support, we make progress every day.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,010
Running from Nagoya to Tokyo.

The Toto Railway is a proud sponsor of the World Sports Games.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,800
The Toto Railway is a proud sponsor of the World Sports Games.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,429
Everyone, if you find any large pieces of garbage,

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,840
don't touch it and let me know instead.

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,499
Jeez.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,220
Why do we have to clean up the shopping center?

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,999
This is part of our class, too.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,690
It's an activity for getting to know our local community.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,529
It may be part of class,

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,450
but that doesn't mean picking up trash isn't a pain in the butt.

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,049
If we pick up their garbage, it'll make it harder for adults to litter.

15
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,760
Yeah, but...

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,259
No matter how much we pick up, people will never stop littering.

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,449
Then what about the garbage right here?

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,249
Ayumi-chan, stop playing with that stray cat and help us over here.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,970
It's not a stray.

20
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,220
See?

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,419
You're right.

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,480
What's going on here? Oh.

23
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,470
That's Isojima-san's cat.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,289
Isojima-san?

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,990
Yeah.

26
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,920
She always cleans up around this area.

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,369
But recently Isojima-san hasn't been feeling well.

28
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,500
She's in the hospital right now.

29
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:53,340
Maybe that cat thought they'd get to see their owner if they came here.

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,299
Hey, what the heck is this?

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,839
I thought adults weren't supposed to litter while kids are cleaning up.

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,660
This is pretty awful.

33
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,670
Looks like there used to be a garbage bin here.

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,209
There definitely was, right?

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,970
Then where did it go?

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,030
What is it?

37
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,660
I feel someone watching me.

38
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,160
What is it? Who is it?

39
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,339
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

40
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,449
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

41
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,479
The shopping center is excited for the WSG!

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,300
Trouble with trash reveals a surprising blind spot!

43
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,129
Always determining the one truth

44
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,949
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

45
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,570
his name is Detective Conan!

46
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,240
"The Beika City Shopping Center Garbage Bin Mystery!"

47
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,650
The World Sports Games.

48
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,249
It's an international sports festival held once every four years,

49
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,600
and this year, it's being held in Tokyo.

50
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,510
That's right. Tokyo is hosting the WSG.

51
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,739
So we're asking students of all years and classes to submit ideas

52
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,270
for entertaining the guests coming to Japan.

53
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,030
The best ideas will be implemented here at Teitan High School!

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,399
Oh, they were originally a stray cat,

55
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,899
so they get outside sometimes.

56
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,410
But it's okay. They always come home when it's time to eat.

57
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,375
Yaiba Punch! Yaiba Kick!

58
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,151
Hey, it's Kamen Yaiba.

59
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,699
Purchase Kamen Yaiba Chocolate and shake hands with me!

60
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,470
Kamen Yaiba Chocolate manufacturer Mitsuzuka is a proud sponsor of WSG Tokyo.

61
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:31,120
I was looking forward to watching WSG Tokyo with my cat.

62
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,019
But in my current condition, I can barely get around in a wheelchair.

63
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,540
I can't go home yet.

64
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,159
But you were well enough to clean the shopping center until recently.

65
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,019
That's true.

66
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,180
Oh, right.

67
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,790
Do you know why the garbage bin that was here is gone now?

68
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,290
Oh, that garbage bin?

69
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,470
Whenever I cleaned this area, I'd dispose of my garbage in this bin.

70
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:10,310
The bin is probably gone because there's a feud going on at the nearby store association.

71
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,760
Thank you!

72
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,510
Hey, you.

73
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,020
Are you sure...

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,530
...you didn't...

75
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,750
...drop something?

76
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,649
We're sorry!

77
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,059
Good grief.

78
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,500
They ran off without picking up their trash.

79
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,670
This is all the fault of you eateries!

80
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,179
Now, now.

81
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,550
That's why the shopping center is overflowing with trash!

82
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,009
You're wrong. It's because there are more tourists.

83
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,300
It's a problem for us, too.

84
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,239
That's because you eateries recommend that people walk and eat at the same time.

85
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,310
That's why there's garbage all over town.

86
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,940
Now, now.

87
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,570
In any case, it sounds like the eateries should install garbage bins.

88
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,699
Why should we be the only ones to pay for garbage bins?

89
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,490
That's what the store association budget is for.

90
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,395
Most of the litter around town comes from people walking and eating.

91
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,849
Mister, you're part of the store association?

92
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,929
I'm here representing Poirot.

93
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:25,060
We're currently experiencing problems because of you eateries.

94
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,759
But that's no reason for you to remove the garbage bin in the empty lot.

95
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,510
Now there's trash all over the empty lot.

96
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,510
That garbage bin was paid for using the store association budget.

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,770
But recently, most of the litter around town comes from people walking and eating.

98
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,239
And it was constantly overflowing. It wasn't very sanitary.

99
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,650
You eateries should've been frequently collecting the trash.

100
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,280
Why are we the only ones responsible for collecting it?

101
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,535
Because most of it comes from people walking and eating.

102
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,359
This isn't going anywhere.

103
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,910
That's because there aren't enough garbage bins.

104
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,600
Who's there? Who's watching me?

105
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,710
Huh? It's gone.

106
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,350
Come to think of it, I feel like the number of garbage bins around town has decreased.

107
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,379
Apparently it's because people throw their trash into garbage bins,

108
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,360
even if they're overflowing.

109
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,240
And installing bins and collecting trash costs money.

110
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,280
Come to think of it, the store association was arguing about that today.

111
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,670
What? We're playing games at the professor's house again?

112
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,339
Same old, same old.

113
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,670
Then what do you want to do?

114
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,719
Again.

115
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,999
What's wrong with people? We worked so hard to clean this up yesterday.

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,949
Seriously. It's unforgivable.

117
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,489
All right, guys.

118
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,440
Indeed.

119
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,190
Yeah.

120
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,650
I have a bad feeling about this.

121
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,280
Me, too.

122
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,449
The Detective Boys will find the culprit!

123
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,489
Yeah!

124
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,510
I knew it.

125
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,620
What? Who dumped their trash?

126
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,429
Yes, where the garbage bin used to be in the empty lot.

127
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,969
Probably someone walking and eating again.

128
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,880
But there was other trash, too.

129
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,199
Well... no, wait.

130
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,680
Maybe the guys who run the eateries did it.

131
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,429
What? Why would the store owners dump garbage there?

132
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,209
So we'll put back the garbage bin we removed.

133
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,590
You said there was trash besides food-related garbage, right?

134
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,440
I wonder why?

135
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,640
Why would someone dump all their trash in a place

136
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,950
where there used to be a garbage bin?

137
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,699
That was probably the work of the bicycle shop

138
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,580
and the other stores opposed to installing garbage bins.

139
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,460
Here you are.

140
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,329
Thank you.

141
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,470
Why would the other stores dump garbage there?

142
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,470
To force the eateries to install a garbage bin.

143
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,290
They claim most of the litter comes from people walking and eating.

144
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,939
A little more to the right.

145
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,600
Right?

146
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:31,449
That's your left.

147
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:31,940
This way?

148
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,569
Yes, attach it around there.

149
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,280
Okay.

150
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,190
Professor.

151
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,299
Hey. How does it look, Ai-kun?

152
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,229
Looks good. Now walk sideways.

153
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,700
All right. Can you see me?

154
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,200
Yes, I can see you clearly.

155
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, Haibara?

156
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,240
All right. Now we should get a great look at the culprit.

157
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,750
I see. So that's how it is.

158
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,039
How about maps of phone charging locations

159
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,060
and WiFi hotspots for foreigners that are written in English?

160
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,000
That seems cliché, too.

161
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,399
Then... I know.

162
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,919
How about a map showing the foreign cuisine restaurants in Beika City

163
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,010
for when the foreigners are feeling homesick?

164
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,129
Are there any restaurants like that around here?

165
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,719
Seriously? You come up with some ideas, Ran.

166
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,809
Sorry.

167
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,030
I feel like I'm right on the verge of an epiphany.

168
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,589
Ran-neechan.

169
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,659
Hey, brat.

170
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,789
Isn't it a little late for you to be walking home from school?

171
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,160
Yeah, I took a little detour.

172
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,239
You were playing games at the professor's house again, weren't you?

173
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,489
No, not that.

174
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,370
Soccer, then?

175
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,450
Yeah.

176
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,930
Subaru-san.

177
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,449
Hey. Are you all on your way home from school?

178
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,869
Yes. Are you coming back from your college classes as well?

179
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,940
You dummy, Subaru-san is a grad student.

180
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,690
You're a grad student at the Toto University Engineering School, right?

181
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,570
I'm surprised you remember, Conan-kun.

182
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,200
This tote bag sure is cool.

183
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,419
What do you keep in here?

184
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,830
Hey, Sonoko.

185
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,569
What's this?

186
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,369
It's a circuit board for measuring electronic noise.

187
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,840
I use it in my grad school classes.

188
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,840
I bet it's the receiver for a listening device.

189
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,609
How about this?

190
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,220
It's called a tester. It's for measuring voltage.

191
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,980
That's probably a bug detector.

192
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,130
I'm sorry, Subaru-san. Jeez, Sonoko.

193
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,889
Yeah, but doesn't this bag look so cool that you wouldn't

194
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,969
expect to find such lame stuff inside of it?

195
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,030
You're right.

196
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,309
The inside is divided.

197
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,280
Yes.

198
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,799
Since I use it to transport precision instruments, it has cushioned partitions.

199
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,460
Huh.

200
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,380
If you're walking around with that stuff, does that mean you're doing something for the FBI?

201
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,630
That's right.

202
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,390
The man who outwardly presents himself as grad student Okiya Subaru

203
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,140
is actually FBI agent Akai Shuichi.

204
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,400
But that's a story for another time.

205
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,440
I know!

206
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,150
What the?

207
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,410
What? We're playing games at the professor's house again?

208
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,299
Same old, same old.

209
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,849
Then what do you want to do?

210
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,420
You guys are always having the same conversation.

211
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,379
Again.

212
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,800
What's wrong with people? We just cleaned this up yesterday.

213
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,140
Haibara.

214
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,390
Nobody's showing up.

215
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,650
Someone came.

216
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,590
He's acting suspiciously.

217
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,450
Hey, isn't he...?

218
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,360
I know him.

219
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,870
I buy croquettes at his store all the time.

220
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,280
Here you are.

221
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,510
That's one tuna corn dog and one cod roe croquette rice ball.

222
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,989
Thanks.

223
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,260
I told you, I just went to check it out because I noticed the camera.

224
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,379
I'm impressed you noticed from so far away.

225
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,269
Despite how I look, I've got a keen eye.

226
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,479
But mister, it looked like you were carefully observing your surroundings

227
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,130
as you approached the camera.

228
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,690
That's because I was wondering what the camera was filming.

229
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,489
Really?

230
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,519
Yes, really.

231
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,629
Come on, you're interfering with my business.

232
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,939
Get out of here.

233
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,200
Welcome.

234
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,719
That guy is definitely suspicious.

235
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,330
Yeah. He's the only one caught on camera.

236
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,540
Hold on.

237
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,170
What's this?

238
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,050
What is that? I'll rewind the video a little bit.

239
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,670
Something came down.

240
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,619
Could you play that again in slow motion?

241
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,430
Got it.

242
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,810
It's a crow.

243
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,729
Just a crow?

244
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,379
No, it's possible that the crow is the culprit.

245
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,360
What?

246
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,119
I have heard that crows will gather food or trash.

247
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,489
Then is this crow the culprit?

248
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,589
Haibara, can you tell if this crow has any trash in its beak?

249
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,530
Give me one minute.

250
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,360
Apply high-speed digital signal processing,

251
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,990
reduce noise, and adjust contrast.

252
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,860
That's probably the best I can do.

253
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,639
It doesn't look like this crow has anything in its beak.

254
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,449
Our theory about the crow being the culprit has fallen apart.

255
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,889
Then was it that man after all?

256
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,640
If only the camera had caught him dumping trash.

257
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,400
We did set up the camera at an angle that would capture the person's face.

258
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,999
In other words, this camera has a blind spot.

259
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,409
That is what that means.

260
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,570
Then couldn't we determine the range of that blind spot?

261
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,059
Based on our calculations,

262
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,489
we've determined that the camera captures an adult

263
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,640
from the knees up no matter where they approach from.

264
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,460
However, once they're right in front of the camera,

265
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,969
we can't see what's below it.

266
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,539
That height is roughly 115 centimeters.

267
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,220
In other words, a culprit shorter than 115 centimeters wouldn't be caught on camera.

268
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,600
But even if there were a culprit like that,

269
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,969
in order to avoid being caught on camera,

270
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,380
they'd have to approach from the fence side.

271
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,339
Is there anybody that small?

272
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,059
Does that mean a tiny child is the culprit?

273
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,910
Huh?

274
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,870
Now that I look closely, there's a hole here, like something passed through the bushes.

275
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,150
You're right.

276
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,520
Yeah.

277
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,870
What made this hole?

278
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,870
Conan-kun, did you figure it out?

279
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah.

280
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,660
The culprit is probably...

281
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,160
Isojima-san.

282
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,880
There something we'd like to ask you today.

283
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,835
Beika City Store Association Office

284
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,140
Really?

285
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,909
You figured out who's been dumping trash?

286
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,640
Yes.

287
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,770
You mean they were captured on that camera?

288
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,919
Yeah, they were.

289
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,400
First, take a look at this image.

290
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,449
Doesn't the camera seem a bit low?

291
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,280
We won't be able to see the culprit's face.

292
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,540
Hey, isn't that...

293
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,039
...Isojima-san's cat?

294
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,339
So the creature who was gathering garbage in that place every day...

295
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,040
...was the cat.

296
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,349
Isojima-san would clean that area every day.

297
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,729
She said she'd dispose of the trash she collected in the garbage bin at that empty lot.

298
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,050
We asked Isojima-san about it yesterday.

299
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,169
Now that you mention it...

300
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,560
You might be right.

301
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,509
That's why this cat has continued to collect trash in this place

302
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,190
where the bin used to be.

303
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,929
I see.

304
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,950
That's why you snuck out of the house every day.

305
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,450
Everyone, I'm terribly sorry for the trouble my cat has caused.

306
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,399
Oh, no.

307
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,580
That's okay.

308
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,210
I'll get better soon so I can get back to cleaning with this cat.

309
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,259
You don't have to do that.

310
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,449
Maybe we should reinstall the garbage bin.

311
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,720
We should install some in areas where people are likely to walk and eat, too.

312
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,849
Then we'll be reinstalling the garbage bin at the lot

313
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,730
as well as several more in other locations.

314
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,799
But the store association budget isn't enough to cover that, is it?

315
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,649
You're right.

316
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,149
Then what are we going to do?

317
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,730
Uh, um...

318
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,240
Why don't you use this?

319
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,910
Ran, what are you doing here?

320
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,429
Our class' idea is being turned into a product.

321
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,269
It was mostly Ran-kun's idea.

322
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,650
This is it.

323
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,040
A tote bag?

324
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,540
Not just any ordinary tote bag.

325
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,820
I call it the "garbage takeout bag."

326
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,579
At first glance, it looks like an ordinary tote bag with a Japanese-style pattern,

327
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,139
but when you hang a garbage bag off of the clips inside the bag,

328
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,390
it turns into a partition that allows you to separate out your trash.

329
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,060
You can put dirty things inside the trash bag.

330
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,599
In other words,

331
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,299
it's a bag that lets you take home whatever garbage you produce.

332
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,619
But because of its attractive appearance,

333
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,070
it doesn't look like you're carrying trash around with you.

334
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,879
So if you use it without attaching a garbage bag,

335
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,330
it functions as a reusable shopping bag.

336
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,769
And since it folds up so small,

337
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,749
it makes a great souvenir for foreigners.

338
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,209
I hope they take home both the idea of bringing their trash home with them

339
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,840
and a piece of Japanese culture as a souvenir.

340
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,659
How nice.

341
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,970
I'd love to sell those at my store.

342
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,350
We'd love to have you sell them in the shopping center.

343
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,269
Why don't you use the profits to install more garbage bins?

344
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,860
What a wonderful idea!

345
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,829
We'll use those bags and garbage bins to clean up the town.

346
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,240
How marvelous.

347
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,969
Is everyone okay with proceeding with this plan?

348
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,240
Yes.

349
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,490
Your Ran-neechan did a good job.

350
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,160
What?

351
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:47,969
An invitation to a party?

352
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,940
Yeah.

353
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:53,970
Only WSG Tokyo sponsors can attend the party.

354
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,230
Apparently several of Sonoko's dad's companies are sponsors.

355
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,100
So why are you inviting us?

356
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,449
Sonoko said it was a reward for finding the culprit who was dumping the trash.

357
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,990
You kids had better be on your best behavior.

358
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,940
I don't really get it, but it sounds like we'll be treated to great food.

359
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,870
I know this hotel.

360
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,580
It's the newly constructed big hotel by the Toto Railway Station.

361
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,009
Really?

362
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,500
I bet they have tons of tasty food.

363
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,655
Like eel, and eel, and eel...

364
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,430
And that's how we ended up attending the WSG Tokyo party.

365
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:38,340
However, we had no idea that would be the start of that horrifying case...

366
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,820
Ah, it's a chapel.

367
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,219
Who invited you?

368
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,570
We received a letter from someone named Nichihara Taisei.

369
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,700
Someone gathered all of us here while concealing their identity.

370
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,210
This situation is the most cliché of all mystery clichés.

371
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,350
There's likely to be serial murders.

372
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,200
The next episode of Conan is "The 36-Cell Perfect Game, Part One!"
