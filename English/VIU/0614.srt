1
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:07,397
Hey, we're in trouble, the culprit's still here!

2
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:10,697
At any rate, let's get out of here!

3
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:15,397
But, we've got to rescue that boy!

4
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:18,997
Hey, you guys! Stay close to me!

5
00:00:19,997 --> 00:00:23,397
Right. If we split up, that's it.

6
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:26,597
We could end up like that boy.

7
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,197
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

8
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:42,497
You must be true to yourself.

9
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:44,597
The sound of piano playing echoes throughout the empty villa,

10
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:46,697
together with the secret of a diary.

11
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,397
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,197
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,997
His name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,679
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 1)"

15
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,079
"24th April"

16
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,475
This is no good, sir!

17
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:47,675
The engine's burnt because of an oil leak.

18
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,875
We've got to take it to the repair factory

19
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,675
and fix it or it won't move.

20
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:53,975
For now,

21
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,475
we'll tow it away.

22
00:02:56,475 --> 00:03:00,175
Hey... you mean you're going to leave us here and leave?

23
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:02,075
I guess so.

24
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:05,375
Even if I were to suggest that you

25
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,775
take public transportation town,

26
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:08,375
that won't do,

27
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,275
because in the mountains like this no buses or cabs would go by.

28
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,675
What?

29
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:13,675
You mean we're going to have to walk

30
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:15,175
to get down from the mountains?

31
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:17,375
It's pretty far, you know.

32
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,675
Can't you give us a lift in your car?

33
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:23,875
Well, maybe just one adult,

34
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,775
but not all of you.

35
00:03:25,775 --> 00:03:28,375
Then, why don't you have them give you a lift, Doc?

36
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,475
Have them take you to town and come back in a rental car.

37
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:36,075
It'll take only about an hour besides.

38
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,875
That's right!

39
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:42,075
Okay then, you all wait for me there!

40
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,275
It's already

41
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,875
an hour and a half since Doc left.

42
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,475
No doubt about it.

43
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:00,375
No doubt that he got lost.

44
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,575
Very likely!

45
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,975
I'm hungry.

46
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,975
Some bamboo-shoot picking day this turned out to be.

47
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,675
We picked a lot, though!

48
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:13,975
Shoots! And we were supposed to have mushroom rice

49
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:17,475
for dinner at Doc's house tonight!

50
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,475
Rain?

51
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:22,675
No... no joke?

52
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:25,575
We don't have umbrellas!

53
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,975
Come to think of it, the place we passed by a while ago

54
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:31,575
was a villa district,

55
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,775
so why don't we go take shelter from the rain there.

56
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,475
Good idea.

57
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:41,175
Hey, Conan. Nobody seems to be here.

58
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:43,875
Well, it's off season.

59
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,675
True.

60
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:49,175
It's getting dark.

61
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:52,175
Why don't we take shelter under the eaves for now?

62
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:58,675
And, can't you get hold of Doc yet?

63
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,075
No.

64
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,275
I've been trying to call him from a while ago,

65
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,475
but it seems his cell is switched off.

66
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,975
It's from Doc's house?

67
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,175
Hey, just what do you think you're doing, Doc!

68
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:16,575
I'm sorry, so sorry...

69
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:18,175
I didn't want to lose my wallet and cell phone

70
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:19,875
while I was picking bamboo-shoot.

71
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:25,275
I'd forgotten that I had put them in Ai's knapsack.

72
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,875
So, I came all the way home to get them,

73
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,975
that's why I'm late.

74
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:32,475
I'm heading over there from now with a rental car,

75
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:35,875
so hang in there for another 2 hours, will you?

76
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,375
So he says!

77
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,875
What? We have to wait two hours?

78
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,175
No joke!

79
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,475
Oh boy... and it's starting to rain harder too!

80
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:47,075
Hang in there!

81
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:51,275
Getting angry isn't going to fill your stomach up.

82
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:57,275
She's right.

83
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,975
The sound of a piano.

84
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,775
I hear it.

85
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:13,275
It's coming from that house.

86
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:15,875
We have heard that music before, right?

87
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,975
Yeah?

88
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,975
I heard it being played on the violin before.

89
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:23,075
What was the title of the song? Conan, do you know?

90
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:26,675
No, I'm really not at home with music.

91
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:29,575
Composed by Johann Sebastian Bach.

92
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:34,475
The Orchestral Suites, Suite no. 3 in D major.

93
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:36,875
2nd movement, "Air".

94
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,375
Commonly known as...

95
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,875
"Air" on the G String.

96
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,675
I've heard that title before!

97
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:46,775
The player is as good as a professional pianist.

98
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:49,575
Okay then, let's go ask if we can take shelter there.

99
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,575
Okay!

100
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:53,075
I wonder if they'll make us bamboo rice?

101
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:55,475
I don't think so.

102
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,975
The piano stopped.

103
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,975
A hope it's someone nice!

104
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,175
No one's coming.

105
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,075
There's no answer on the interphone.

106
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:26,875
Strange.

107
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,275
The door's not locked.

108
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:45,175
Hello!

109
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:48,575
We'd like to take shelter from the rain here for a while!

110
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:52,075
It's... pitch dark.

111
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:54,875
I wonder why the lights aren't turned on?

112
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,275
I stepped on something!

113
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,275
Potato chips?

114
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,475
They're scattered all over the floor.

115
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:15,675
There seems to be a misbehaved child here.

116
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,175
Hey,

117
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,075
come over here everybody!

118
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:36,175
I found the piano!

119
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,175
But, if the person was playing this piano,

120
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:43,875
why didn't he or she come out to greet us?

121
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,275
Maybe nobody was playing.

122
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,175
Because there are a lot of audio devices and CDs here.

123
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,875
It could be that one of the CDs here was being played.

124
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,375
The pianist was too good too.

125
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,875
No, it was the sound of this piano without a doubt.

126
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,175
That music that was being played a while ago.

127
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,575
Only this sound was a bit off tune.

128
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,575
You've got a good ear,

129
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:09,275
despite being as tone-deaf as you are.

130
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,675
Leave me alone.

131
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,375
I'll play you something!

132
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,875
I can play the Flea Waltz!

133
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,475
Don't, you'll get scolded!

134
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,375
We'd better look for the owner of the house.

135
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:29,575
Mitsuhiko?

136
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:31,875
A tall person was staring in

137
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,975
from the window of that door!

138
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,975
Maybe it's the owner of the house!

139
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,075
We've got to say hello.

140
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,475
It's stuck.

141
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:54,675
A cart?

142
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:57,975
Hey! Didn't we turn on the corridor lights?

143
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,575
Yes!

144
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:02,275
Does that mean someone turned it off?

145
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:06,075
Maybe he plans to lock us in here.

146
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,975
No way.

147
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,875
We're sorry!

148
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,375
We're not bad people!

149
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,875
Please come out here!

150
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:26,475
There's a room with the lights on!

151
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:29,275
Really.

152
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,875
Maybe somebody's there!

153
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,975
This seems to be the kitchen.

154
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,875
But, what's with the top of this table.

155
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,275
There are a lot of left-overs of fried chicken, bread and ham.

156
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:48,375
It looks like a dog or something ate here and messed up.

157
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,475
The owner of the house must sure be some wild person.

158
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:53,775
The wine glass is left toppled over too.

159
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,475
A notebook?

160
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,175
Does it belong to the owner of this villa?

161
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,975
April 20th, sunny.

162
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:06,575
After talking to him, I found that he was quite a nice child.

163
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:08,875
He laughs a lot and plays a lot.

164
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:14,075
But, I'm not sure if he understands the situation he is in now.

165
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:15,575
I only know that this child seems

166
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,575
to have spent a greatly oppressed life.

167
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,275
At any rate, it's only two days more.

168
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:23,275
Patience till then.

169
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,775
April 22, cloudy.

170
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:29,375
Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven.

171
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,575
They're all melodies that touch the heart.

172
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,875
A genius born in the same era.

173
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,075
I envy that talent.

174
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:40,475
It's not a suitable song to play under this circumstance,

175
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,975
but I can forget the passing of time.

176
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,975
Please let one more day go by peacefully.

177
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,575
April 23rd, rain.

178
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,575
It's bad.

179
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:54,575
It seems that this boy knows who I am.

180
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,175
If he were to announce it to the public,

181
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,375
it would ruin my future.

182
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,575
I feel sorry for him,

183
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,275
but I guess I have no choice but to kill him.

184
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:02,975
Kill?

185
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:04,675
Just what does that mean?

186
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,475
He was probably kidnapped.

187
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,975
Somebody kidnapped a little boy

188
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:11,775
and confined him in this house.

189
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:13,275
Oh, no.

190
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:17,175
What's written on the next page?

191
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,975
The pages are stuck together.

192
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:21,075
And I can't peel it off.

193
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,875
A blackout?

194
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:34,275
By the way, the page just now had something red on it?

195
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:37,075
Isn't... it blood?

196
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,875
Moreover, the content says,

197
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,275
"I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me".

198
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,775
The... sound of the piano.

199
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,075
It... it's the song that was being played a while ago.

200
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:52,775
We've got trouble! The culprit's still here?

201
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,175
At any rate, let... let's hurry and get out of here!

202
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,975
But, we've got to rescue the boy!

203
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,775
Hey! Wait a sec!

204
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,975
You guys stay close to me!

205
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:12,875
Right. If we split up, that's it.

206
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,475
We may end up like the boy.

207
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:17,775
A coffin!

208
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,175
Hey! Didn't the Air on the G String gain popularity...

209
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:28,275
100 years after Bach's death.

210
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:32,475
Maybe the culprit intended to leave the boy asleep for that long

211
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:35,700
in this coffin.

212
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:46,980
Conan, what're you going to do about this?

213
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:51,306
Well, I guess we'll just have to open it.

214
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,906
Please wait!

215
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:55,606
From the contents of the diary we found earlier,

216
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,506
we know that someone had kidnapped a young boy

217
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,206
and confined him here.

218
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,706
And because it seemed the child knew who his captor was,

219
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:05,406
there was no choice but to kill him, right?

220
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:08,906
Yes. Moreover, on the last page of the diary,

221
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:11,606
there something red on it,

222
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,306
and the thing that was written is

223
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:16,206
"I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me".

224
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:19,806
Then, maybe in that coffin...

225
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:22,806
The corpse of that boy is inside.

226
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:26,106
Yeah. Could be.

227
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:31,406
No...

228
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:34,306
Hey, Ai, pull them away!

229
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,106
It's not something children should see.

230
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:37,406
I guess not.

231
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:39,706
I mean, you're a child too, aren't you?

232
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:41,706
Never mind, just stand back!

233
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,906
It's empty. Nothing's inside.

234
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:12,506
Thank goodness!

235
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:19,606
Which means, that boy may still be alive.

236
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:20,806
If he were killed,

237
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:23,106
the culprit would've put him inside that coffin.

238
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:25,906
He couldn't be playing the piano, like he was.

239
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:28,606
At any rate, we've got to call the police.

240
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,606
Does somebody have a cell phone?

241
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:35,606
I left mine in my knapsack a while ago.

242
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,006
Me too.

243
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:38,206
Same here.

244
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,606
Me too.

245
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,306
Hey, don't tell me that the place you left it,

246
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,806
is in the first room that we went to when we came to this villa.

247
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:47,306
Not... not again.

248
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:48,806
It's the same song that was played a while ago.

249
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:51,206
Air on the G String.

250
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:01,806
Why'd all of you leave it in the room where the piano is?

251
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:04,106
Because you left it back there, Conan.

252
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:06,006
We put it there together.

253
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,206
It can't be helped already, right?

254
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:09,906
Rather than that.

255
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:11,806
Let's all go back to the room with the piano

256
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:14,006
and get our cell phones back.

257
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,106
True.

258
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:17,406
Don't be silly. We don't even know

259
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:19,806
what kind of weapon the culprit may have,

260
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:23,406
so who knows what will happen to us if we get close carelessly.

261
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:28,006
But, we've got to do something quick or the boy may...

262
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:32,306
Doc'll be here about an hour later.

263
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:35,106
We could leave this villa and wait outside till then,

264
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:37,806
but it's raining cats and dogs outside.

265
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:42,606
Just waiting's not going to get us anywhere,

266
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:46,406
so why don't we all search for that boy.

267
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,506
Okay!

268
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,906
Isn't it too dangerous?

269
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:51,106
The kidnapper is still here, you know?

270
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:54,606
No need to worry.

271
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:59,406
So long as that piano is playing, the culprit is in that room.

272
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:04,306
But there could be more than one culprit.

273
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:05,706
There's probably just one culprit

274
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:08,106
because the diary was written in the first person.

275
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,906
Besides, there's nothing written that points to an accomplice,

276
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,606
and there was only one wine glass too.

277
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:17,606
But, stay close to me, understand?

278
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:18,706
Aye!

279
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:23,406
But, why doesn't the culprit come to get us?

280
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:27,106
Maybe because he doesn't want us to see his face?

281
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:29,206
If he goofs and we get away

282
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:33,206
and report to the police what he looks like, it'll put him in a fix.

283
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:36,406
Maybe that's why he's playing the piano in the dark.

284
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:41,006
He probably wants us to feel creepy and leave.

285
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:42,506
He probably hasn't realized yet

286
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:45,506
that we read the diary and found out

287
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:47,206
that he is a kidnapper.

288
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:50,606
But, either way, if the owner of this villa were to check later on,

289
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:52,906
he would find out who the culprit is.

290
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,106
Maybe he's not the owner of this house.

291
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,506
What?

292
00:17:56,506 --> 00:18:01,406
At this point, it's more natural to think that the culprit broke open

293
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:04,006
one of the doors of this house,

294
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,406
faking to be some rich man

295
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:08,506
and brought the boy here.

296
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,206
Is the piano still playing?

297
00:18:23,206 --> 00:18:25,306
Yes, it's still playing.

298
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:27,706
It's amazing how he can play in pitch dark.

299
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,706
His fingers remember the position of the keys.

300
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:33,206
There are blind pianists too, you know.

301
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,606
But, what's with this room?

302
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,406
It looks like a child's room.

303
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:40,006
It looks like a girl's room.

304
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:45,006
Chips are scattered here too.

305
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:47,006
Yeah.

306
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,406
It's a portable game device.

307
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:54,206
And, what're these drawings

308
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:57,206
in back of the leaflets of the newspaper that are cluttered

309
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:59,706
and looks like some kind of coded diagram?

310
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,506
That's a treasure map of Monster Getter III.

311
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,506
If you don't draw the map that you get from the game onto something else,

312
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:11,806
it'll be hard to find the treasure.

313
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:14,606
It seems like the culprit kept the child confined to this room

314
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:16,906
and let him keep playing the game.

315
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,906
Yeah.

316
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:27,806
It's 30 minutes till Doc gets here.

317
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:31,006
This is the kitchen where we came a while ago, right?

318
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:33,306
Did we go right around?

319
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:37,006
No. There was a forked corridor.

320
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:39,106
There still must be places that we haven't searched yet.

321
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:42,206
Right... Like the place just beyond here.

322
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,406
Something's shining.

323
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:54,006
Water?

324
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,606
Hot water.

325
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:57,706
Why in a place like this?

326
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:05,306
A picture?

327
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,806
Strange.

328
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:15,806
The dishes are all washed

329
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:18,306
and the trash is divided like it should be.

330
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,706
So, the person is probably a neat person and yet.

331
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:23,506
I wonder why half-eaten left-overs

332
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:25,906
are messily left on the table then.

333
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:29,406
Hey! Ayumi's gone!

334
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,606
Don't tell me that the culprit got her?

335
00:20:34,606 --> 00:20:38,506
It can't be! The piano's still playing, besides.

336
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,706
No, it's a different sound from that piano.

337
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:47,906
Don't you think it's strangely out of tune!

338
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:51,606
Maybe the CD in that room

339
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:54,506
was being played endlessly to make us think he was playing.

340
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:56,806
Maybe he was secretly following us around.

341
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:58,606
Oh no...

342
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:00,106
Let's hurry and go look for her.

343
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:02,606
It could be that she's just lost too.

344
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:10,906
Hey, did you find her?

345
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:12,706
Nowhere at all.

346
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:15,106
Then, maybe the culprit got her after all.

347
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,906
If worse comes to worst, he could already be killed.

348
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:20,906
No, you mean he was already killed?

349
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:24,006
No. I'm just saying there's a possibility.

350
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:25,806
Oh no.

351
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:27,806
What?

352
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:30,206
Ayumi, where were you?

353
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,406
I was here all the while.

354
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:33,806
Answer us if you were there then.

355
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:37,306
I thought that you were looking for the boy.

356
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:40,206
Because you all rushed out of the kitchen in a hurry.

357
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:47,306
Oh, that's right! I found a picture!

358
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,406
What?

359
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:51,906
A family picture.

360
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:54,306
They seem to be a family of musicians.

361
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:57,306
The picture is dated a year ago.

362
00:21:57,306 --> 00:21:59,406
Could the child in the center

363
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:01,706
have been the one who was kidnapped?

364
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:05,206
No. Because the child in the picture is a girl.

365
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:06,806
He's right. The one in the picture is either

366
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:10,606
without a doubt the owner of this house or...

367
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:13,406
a picture of the kidnapper.

368
00:22:13,406 --> 00:22:14,606
The culprit?

369
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:16,806
Oh, no.

370
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:24,606
The key to this case should be hidden in this diary.

371
00:22:24,606 --> 00:22:27,106
I'll solve the case no matter what.

372
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:58,106
"Next Episode" -There are two pages sticking out

373
00:23:58,106 --> 00:24:00,206
from the edge of the diary.

374
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,006
What?

375
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,506
Our things are gone?

376
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:08,706
And? Is the creepy player of the piano dangerous?

377
00:24:08,706 --> 00:24:12,506
Yeah, a very dangerously outstanding genius.

378
00:24:13,506 --> 00:24:17,306
That people would resent his birth.

379
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:20,306
Go for it!

380
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:22,606
Next Conan,

381
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:26,506
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 2)"

382
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:44,706
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:46,706
"Piano chair"

384
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,406
Did you figure out the secret of the diary?

385
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:50,806
-Yeah. -Let's keep it a secret till next week.
