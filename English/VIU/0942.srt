1
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:04,047
The day after we returned from Kyoto,

2
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:08,147
Maria Higashio missed class at Teitan Elementary School

3
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:11,147
without any notice.

4
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:12,947
Now that you mention it,

5
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:16,447
she said she found a letter from her dead grandma

6
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:20,847
in her desk drawer the other day.

7
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:22,647
It sounds like Grandma

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:27,406
set up a treasure hunt in her house for me.

9
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:30,447
Do you guys want to invite Conan

10
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,547
and look for it together sometime?

11
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:34,547
Sure, let's do it.

12
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:37,447
Believing Maria went to her dead grandmother's house.

13
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:40,947
"Higashio" -to look for treasure,

14
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,447
they visited her grandmother's home,

15
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:45,948
"Start! Maria, good luck!" -where they found a mysterious message.

16
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,547
Meanwhile...

17
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,548
Hello?

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,347
I told you not to draw attention to yourself!

19
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:55,647
Everyone's talking about you online!

20
00:00:55,648 --> 00:00:56,747
What?

21
00:00:56,748 --> 00:01:00,248
"High school detective Shinichi Kudo solves the case!"

22
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:04,147
"The rumors that he's dead were wrong!"

23
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,747
They're talking about me online?

24
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:09,748
This isn't good! The news has spread everywhere!

25
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:15,047
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

26
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:17,047
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

27
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:18,547
How will we combat the news spreading online?

28
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:20,547
The boss of the Organization is revealed!

29
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,147
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,147
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:26,248
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:12,928
"Find Maria (Part 2)"

33
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:18,556
Hey, Ran!

34
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:21,738
Look out the window.

35
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,431
Out the window?

36
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:27,430
Don't you think that's a huge group of reporters?

37
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:30,330
Yeah. Did something happen?

38
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:32,230
Something sure did happen.

39
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:37,730
Everyone's talking about your boyfriend online right now.

40
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:40,530
What? Why are they talking about Shinichi?

41
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:44,030
Oh, my. You just casually acknowledged

42
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:47,630
that Shinichi is your boyfriend, madam.

43
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:50,830
Why shouldn't I? He is my boyfriend.

44
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,730
Hey, take your seats.

45
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:55,431
Let's get started.

46
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:05,231
This room seems to be directly beneath that arrow.

47
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,731
What a cute room.

48
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,630
Maria must have stayed in this room

49
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,031
when she came to this house.

50
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:21,630
Isn't it kind of cold in here?

51
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,430
Well, we are in the basement.

52
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,630
So, where's the next arrow?

53
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:29,130
I don't see an arrow,

54
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:33,030
but there's a note stuck to the bedside table next to the bed.

55
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:34,031
What?

56
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:35,830
What does it say?

57
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:39,130
"Now you can use the bathroom during the night!"

58
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:41,130
During the night?

59
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:46,031
She must've meant to turn on this light before going to bed, so...

60
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:49,530
Could you turn out the lights?

61
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:50,831
Okay!

62
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:54,730
This is...

63
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,230
Wow!

64
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,030
The bumpy pattern goes all around the room.

65
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:02,130
But it doesn't look like an arrow.

66
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:04,630
No.

67
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,431
Something was left here.

68
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,530
These two rectangular marks

69
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:12,631
must've been left by this photo frame.

70
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,530
The shadow changed for some reason.

71
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:18,730
That's it.

72
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:23,031
Which means, if we place something in the other rectangular marks...

73
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:27,830
It must be this doll.

74
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:32,431
If you match the doll's base to this square mark...

75
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:35,530
It changed again!

76
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:37,730
Is there anything on the floor over there?

77
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:39,131
Huh?

78
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:46,230
Not on the floor, but this sailboat on the shelf fell over.

79
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:49,130
Could you try standing it back up?

80
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,131
Sure.

81
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,830
Try to keep it in the same place.

82
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:54,030
It's up.

83
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,030
Now, move out of the way.

84
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,431
Okay.

85
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,830
-Amazing! -There's an arrow on the wall!

86
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:03,431
That's it!

87
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:09,631
Then the next one must be in the room next door.

88
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,330
Huh?

89
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,830
It's a bathroom.

90
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:18,030
Indeed.

91
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:22,030
But there's very obviously an arrow in here.

92
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:26,430
But the only thing it's pointing towards is the bath.

93
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:30,230
That's not a bath, it's a shower.

94
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:33,931
There's a note in front of the arrow on the sink.

95
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:38,631
"Take care of my bird!"

96
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,830
What bird?

97
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:44,130
Does she mean this doll?

98
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:46,730
It seems to have a beak.

99
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:50,430
But how do we take care of it?

100
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,630
What a strange doll.

101
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,830
I don't recognize it.

102
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:59,530
I feel like I've seen this before.

103
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:00,930
Now that we're stuck...

104
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:01,931
That means...

105
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:04,730
-We'll have to ask. -Huh?

106
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,631
Ask Conan!

107
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,830
Can't we?

108
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,430
Why not?

109
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,931
I'm sure he knows what it is.

110
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:19,030
Conan's over his cold, right?

111
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:21,330
Then let's try calling him.

112
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:24,931
Don't we need to find Maria as soon as possible?

113
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:34,130
I hate to ask that promise-breaker for help,

114
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,231
but we don't have a choice.

115
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:40,230
I know!

116
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:43,630
Shinichi Kudo had a twin brother,

117
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,030
and it was his brother who died.

118
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,530
Why don't we spread that rumor online?

119
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:52,330
People would know immediately that that's a lie!

120
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:54,630
Don't you get it, Shinichi?

121
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:59,030
If the Black Organization finds out that you're alive...

122
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:02,430
Yeah, I know.

123
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:07,130
I'm so worried that if I don't joke about it,

124
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:08,831
I'll go crazy.

125
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,831
Gosh.

126
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,631
"Incoming Call, Ai Haibara" -Haibara.

127
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,731
Well? Did you come up with a plan?

128
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:27,130
What? You still haven't found Maria?

129
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,231
But it's already evening.

130
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,230
I see.

131
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:38,630
Maria seems to have stopped by her grandmother's house before school

132
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:41,930
in order to look for the treasure she hid,

133
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:43,530
but you couldn't find her.

134
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:48,330
You followed the notes and arrows left by her grandmother

135
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:51,230
and arrived at the bathroom,

136
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:56,030
but the arrow pointed to an empty shower room.

137
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:58,330
That's right.

138
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,830
Hey.

139
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,830
You just laughed, didn't you?

140
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:06,530
If you've figured out the answer, tell me, you traitor.

141
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:09,030
Traitor?

142
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,930
Conan, please!

143
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:14,230
If we don't find her soon, then Maria...

144
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:19,230
You guys aren't taking care of the drinking bird.

145
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,330
Drinking bird?

146
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,230
Drinking bird? You mean...

147
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:28,330
this bird-like doll to the right of the arrow?

148
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:29,530
Yeah.

149
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:34,830
Drinking birds use the slight heat generated by evaporation to...

150
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:39,130
In any case, the bird will move if you give it water.

151
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:42,330
How are we supposed to give it water?

152
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,930
There's a glass cup with a toothbrush on the sink.

153
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,230
Pour water in that and place it in front of the doll.

154
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,531
Okay!

155
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,731
I did it.

156
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,330
It's not moving.

157
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:03,230
Maybe it's broken.

158
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:06,231
Place the doll's beak inside the cup.

159
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,231
Like this?

160
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,330
That's it.

161
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:13,930
Now let go, and it should stand up on its own.

162
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:18,531
After some time, it'll dip its beak in the water again.

163
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,730
-Why? -It's amazing!

164
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:26,330
It's like it's actually drinking water.

165
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,031
Wow!

166
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:36,130
I see.

167
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:39,031
This is how it's using the vaporization heat.

168
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:43,930
So? What does this accomplish?

169
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:47,430
Look at the arrow through the cup.

170
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:49,631
Through the cup?

171
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,930
The arrow's pointing the other way!

172
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,730
Why?

173
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:00,930
The water in the cup is refracting the light,

174
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:03,630
changing the focal point because of something called Snell's law.

175
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:06,130
It makes objects appear flipped.

176
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:09,330
In other words, the arrow is pointing

177
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:12,430
not towards the shower room in the bathroom,

178
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:16,630
but that room across from the bathroom.

179
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:18,630
Let's check it out!

180
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:20,230
Yes.

181
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,730
Maybe Maria's asleep.

182
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:27,230
Call Ms. Kobayashi once you find Maria.

183
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:29,330
I know.

184
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:30,631
Later.

185
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:35,831
Who is it? Delivery?

186
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,830
Huh? Sushi?

187
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,830
-Hello. -But I haven't ordered anything.

188
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:48,130
Nah. I came to make a delivery in this neighborhood,

189
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:53,630
but I can't get through because of the commotion next door.

190
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:57,630
I thought the neighbors might know what's up,

191
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:59,130
so I stopped by.

192
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:02,630
Sorry, I wouldn't know.

193
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:07,130
That guy works at Irohazushi next to the detective agency.

194
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:11,631
I think his name is Kanenori Wakita.

195
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,931
No way.

196
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,231
It's really them.

197
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:43,231
Nice to meet you. I'm Yusaku Kudo.

198
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,931
And I'm Yukiko.

199
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:54,217
What? The door won't open?

200
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:58,617
No. It's the door the arrow in the bathroom was pointing to.

201
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:01,417
What kind of door is it?

202
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:03,117
What kind?

203
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:05,317
It looks like it opens inward.

204
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,717
There are lots of flowers carved into it.

205
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:09,917
These look hand-made.

206
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:12,717
Maria mentioned that

207
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:17,117
her grandpa was a really good hobbyist carpenter.

208
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:22,217
He could make anything, like shelves and desks and chairs.

209
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:27,317
Then maybe her grandfather made this door, too.

210
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:34,117
Yeah, but her grandpa passed away before her grandma.

211
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,617
Does that door have a trick?

212
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,117
A trick?

213
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,217
Does it make any noise

214
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:41,918
when you push or pull on the knob?

215
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:47,017
It won't budge an inch whether you push or pull.

216
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:49,518
In other words, there's no tri...

217
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:53,517
Did someone sneeze?

218
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:55,717
It's cold here in the basement.

219
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,217
I see.

220
00:13:57,218 --> 00:14:00,017
The door won't open because

221
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:02,317
the room on the other side of the door

222
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:06,217
is warmer than the hallway you're in.

223
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:10,517
The air pressure is keeping the door shut from the inside.

224
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:15,417
Normally, carpenters build a gap so that doesn't happen,

225
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:18,717
but her grandfather must not have known to do that.

226
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:20,717
So? What do we do?

227
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:24,117
Since the door was left as is,

228
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:28,618
there's probably enough space for an adult to open it.

229
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:33,318
If you all push with the knob turned, it should open.

230
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:42,418
Maria!

231
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:44,318
Maria!

232
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,617
Ai?

233
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:50,417
How is she?

234
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:53,518
It's okay. She's just asleep.

235
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:57,817
Wow!

236
00:14:57,818 --> 00:15:03,417
The room is covered with Maria and her grandparents.

237
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:06,717
That's a lot of home movies.

238
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:08,217
I see.

239
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:12,218
This room full of their memories is their treasure.

240
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:17,618
Is she awake?

241
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,417
Huh? Guys? What's going on?

242
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:25,117
You missed school.

243
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:27,417
We were worried, so we came here.

244
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:29,717
Huh? School?

245
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:31,217
Oh, right!

246
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:35,217
I was going to go to school after watching this video,

247
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:38,817
but I couldn't open the door.

248
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:43,917
I thought I had to finish watching to open the door,

249
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:46,118
but I started getting sleepy.

250
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:51,018
I fell asleep, and now I'm hungry.

251
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,417
Come on, Hattori!

252
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:08,917
Tell us something about Kudo.

253
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,317
I already told you,

254
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:15,617
that guy next to me on the news wasn't Kudo!

255
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:18,917
That's impossible! No matter how you look at it...

256
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:22,217
I'm not surprised you thought it was him.

257
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:25,017
That was Kyoto Senshin second-year

258
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:29,318
and Kudo lookalike Soshi Okita the kendo brat.

259
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,118
What?

260
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:35,817
Huh?

261
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:39,517
The crowd of reporters at the gates has shrunk.

262
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:41,017
You're right.

263
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,317
I wonder what happened.

264
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:45,217
-This is probably why. -What?

265
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:49,617
The person who said they saw your boyfriend at Kiyomizu Temple

266
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:52,717
says they might've been hallucinating.

267
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:54,617
Hallucinating?

268
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:57,417
But Shinichi was at Kiyomizu Temple.

269
00:16:57,418 --> 00:17:01,517
Hattori's saying the boy seen on TV in Ponto City

270
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,517
was Okita.

271
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:10,318
Looks like everyone's agreeing your boyfriend wasn't there.

272
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:17,217
Our teacher did just tell us not to respond to reporters

273
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:19,317
if they asked us about Shinichi.

274
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:23,618
Makes you wonder if what we saw was an illusion, too.

275
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:26,417
An illusion?

276
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:28,018
That wasn't an illusion.

277
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:31,717
Shinichi really was there.

278
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,818
Of course we're dating.

279
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:37,917
See?

280
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:43,717
I'm the one who said she saw Shinichi Kudo at Kiyomizu Temple.

281
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:47,017
But now that I think about it,

282
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,617
I think that was a hallucination produced by my own desires.

283
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:52,618
I'm sorry for the commotion I caused.

284
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:56,718
"Mouri Detective Agency."

285
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,817
Thank you.

286
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:04,017
By the way, do you have any plans for Christmas, Amuro?

287
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:05,917
None in particular.

288
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,617
I see.

289
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:08,618
What is it?

290
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,217
The manager wants to plan our shift schedule for December,

291
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:12,718
so he wanted me to ask you.

292
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,518
A message?

293
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:21,717
Seeking information on Shinichi Kudo.

294
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,517
Time is money!

295
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,917
Hurry, Bourbon.

296
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,117
Rum.

297
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,917
Roger that.

298
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:31,418
"Send."

299
00:19:56,918 --> 00:20:00,817
That giant crowd of reporters is gone.

300
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,517
I'm not sure why, though.

301
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:08,017
Probably because the world's biggest Kudo family fan,

302
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:13,217
who caused the commotion, calmed their excitement by posting that

303
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:17,617
the Shinichi Kudo she saw at Kiyomizu Temple was an illusion.

304
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:19,017
But why did she suddenly post that?

305
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:24,117
Because we used her fanaticism against her.

306
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:25,717
Shin!

307
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:27,918
Dad and Mom?

308
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:30,417
What?

309
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:33,417
You bribed her with your autographs?

310
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:38,417
Yeah. As our fan, we knew she'd accept our terms.

311
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:41,217
We even told her why.

312
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:43,817
"Our son is still young."

313
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:47,917
"We don't want this case to go to his head."

314
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:53,218
"Could you pretend the incident at Kiyomizu Temple didn't happen?"

315
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:57,317
I'm surprised you were able to meet with the owner of the blog.

316
00:20:57,318 --> 00:21:00,417
We sent a message to the administrator of the blog.

317
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:04,217
"This is Yukiko Kudo, avid reader of your blog."

318
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:05,817
"There's something I'd like to discuss with you,

319
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:10,217
so could you meet me and my husband at the airport?"

320
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:15,017
"Please let us know once you've confirmed it's actually us."

321
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:16,617
I see.

322
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:20,617
We also reached out to the school to give them a heads-up,

323
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:23,518
so that should be the end of the Shinichi Kudo disturbance.

324
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,218
Officially, that is.

325
00:21:29,318 --> 00:21:33,917
It's extremely likely your so-called Black Organization

326
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,417
has zeroed in on this.

327
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:41,317
Gosh. It's your fault for going wild on your school trip.

328
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:43,117
I couldn't help it.

329
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:46,417
I got caught up in the case.

330
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,217
Well, sounds like

331
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:50,818
something happened between you and Ran because of it.

332
00:21:53,618 --> 00:21:55,517
How do you know that?

333
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:59,217
The administrator of the blog said

334
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,818
she saw you kissing at the Kiyomizu butai.

335
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:05,417
Also...

336
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:10,318
the code left at the scene of Koji Haneda's murder...

337
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:13,317
ASACA and RUM.

338
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:14,917
About that...

339
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:19,117
I discussed it with the FBI agent living in our house.

340
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:20,717
He concluded that the code

341
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:23,717
isn't meant to be split into ASACA and RUM,

342
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:29,217
but instead should be read as a single name containing all eight letters.

343
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:30,918
A single name?

344
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:34,418
Not split into two?

345
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:40,317
Eight letters, one name...

346
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:43,917
As a low-ranking member, the only thing I know is

347
00:22:43,918 --> 00:22:47,217
that the organization's color is black.

348
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:49,018
Eight letters...

349
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:53,618
Could it be...

350
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:02,418
Renya Carasuma.

351
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:08,817
If I'm right, then you're making

352
00:23:08,818 --> 00:23:13,617
an enemy out of the most powerful man in the country.

353
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:16,717
The multi-millionaire who doesn't exist.

354
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:21,617
So until this is over, Yukiko and I are staying in Japan

355
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:24,617
to come up with a plan together.

356
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:28,217
This is the moment of truth, Shinichi...

357
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:31,717
No, Conan Edogawa.

358
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:33,017
Yeah.

359
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:34,818
Just what I was hoping for.

360
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:44,217
"Next Episode"

361
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:46,917
Tokyo Barls Collection?

362
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:48,318
What's that?

363
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,318
What's wrong, madam?

364
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:55,817
I can't breathe...

365
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:57,717
Have some water.

366
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:59,818
Calm down. Drink slowly.

367
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:04,117
Someone was trying to kill me.

368
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:06,618
They put the core of a cabbage in my monja.

369
00:24:07,418 --> 00:24:12,818
