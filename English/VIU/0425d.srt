1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,719
What? You don't know?

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,919
What do you mean?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,719
Wasn't he scheduled to go golfing?

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,919
Well.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,919
He cancelled it yesterday.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,419
Something about he suddenly promised to meet someone.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,119
Then, contact him quickly!

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,919
And tell him not to meet anyone

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,620
because his life is in danger!

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,419
We get a lot of calls like yours.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,919
But no need to worry.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,519
Mr. Domon is strong and he has two bodyguards accompanying him.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,219
Please don't worry.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,519
Please excuse me because I've other things to attend to.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,219
Hey, wait!

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,419
It seems he took your call to be a prank.

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,719
-No way! -Well, it really can't be helped, though...

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,019
Darn it.

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,619
We've to locate Edie P which is the other hint we have.

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,119
That announcer who's supposed to be interviewing Mr. Domon.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,820
Where is she now?

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,819
About 18 km southeast from here.

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,119
That's just around Nichiuri TV station in Shiodome.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,620
She's probably going to join the crew there and go with them.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,420
A phone call?

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
What's up?

27
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,120
Just confirming.

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,719
I have a very wary and persistent personality.

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,219
Don't worry.

30
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,119
Everything's fine.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,519
I'm going to join the crew

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,719
and head for Edie P on the TV station wagon now.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,419
The rain has cleared.

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,619
And it's turned out to be a great day for hunting.

35
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,019
Kir.

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,819
I've been thinking from this morning,

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,219
Your phone's very static.

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,519
Yeah. Maybe because I'm in the basement?

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,620
I answered the phone in the basement this morning too.

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,219
Okay, Gin.

41
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,219
We'll go on ahead then!

42
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,619
Hey, Chianti!

43
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,120
Good luck.

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,919
I'll kill her!

45
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,619
I'll kill!

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,319
I'll kill her for sure!

47
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,719
I hate Vermouth too.

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,719
Calvados used to love her.

49
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,119
She used him to her advantage.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,719
That's why I hate her.

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,919
Yes. I would've killed her long ago if I had my way.

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,220
And that woman was not our boss' favorite.

53
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,019
Darn it!

54
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,219
We have less than 30 minutes to go

55
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,419
before the assassination time that they mentioned!

56
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,419
Edie P...

57
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,819
Where on earth is it?

58
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,319
Edie P!

59
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,819
I think we should head over to the TV station too, don't you?

60
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,419
Yes, I agree.

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,019
We're not getting anywhere wasting our time here.

62
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,419
Even if we were to locate their hunting ground.

63
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,019
If we're too far away from the TV station wagon,

64
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,620
we can't possibly beat them to it.

65
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,619
Hunting ground.

66
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,019
Come to think of it, Vermouth was saying.

67
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,919
I guess there's no better place for hunting?

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,520
What? What do you mean?

69
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,019
You should at study a bit of their history too, Vodka.

70
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,819
History.

71
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,119
Oh, a phone call?

72
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,220
It's mine.

73
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,719
Well...

74
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
This sound is...

75
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,920
Conan's cell phone.

76
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,119
Hello?

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,819
What do you mean, hello?

78
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,919
Gosh. How dare you hang up on me like that?

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,219
I'm sorry, Ran.

80
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,519
If this horse comes, it'll be a big win!

81
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,919
Please put Dr. Agasa on the phone!

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,619
It's already our turn to ride the Ferris Wheel!

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,119
So I'll call you again later!

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,219
Hey, Conan!

85
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,919
Geez!

86
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,819
Oh, cool kid!

87
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,819
It's like you have dual personality!

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,619
Dual personality?

89
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,919
Wait a second.

90
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,119
Hunting ground.

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,319
History.

92
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,619
Park.

93
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,020
Dual personality!

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,019
You're cleaning up?

95
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,119
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,819
It's Jekyll and Hyde!

97
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,920
How nostalgic.

98
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,419
I see! Dr. Agasa!

99
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,519
Take a left at that traffic light over there and get on the freeway!

100
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,219
The freeway?

101
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,819
If we go on the freeway,

102
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,319
we'll be driving away from Nichiuri TV, you know?

103
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,119
It's okay.

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,820
Because we're beating them to the hunting ground.

105
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,419
Beat them to it?

106
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,919
Don't tell me that...

107
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,219
Yeah.

108
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,419
I finally figured it out!

109
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,019
The location Edie P that they're planning to assassinate Mr. Domon is...

110
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,419
Haido Park!

111
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,119
Haido Park?

112
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,819
But what makes you think Edie P is?

113
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,019
It flashed upon me when Ms. Jodie said "dual personality" a while ago.

114
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,319
That Eddie is the short form of Edward!

115
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,419
I see.

116
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,719
Edward Hyde.

117
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,819
Edward is the first name of a character

118
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,919
that appears in Stevenson's bizarre novel,

119
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,219
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".

120
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,219
Which means, Edie P stands for Haido Park!

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,319
I'm sure there was a parking space in that park, though.

122
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,419
No.

123
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,819
They mentioned that there was no better place for hunting.

124
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,819
In the real Hyde Park in London,

125
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,019
until around the 16th Century, deer and wolves existed

126
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,419
and it used to be the hunting ground of the nobles.

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,419
That's the hunting ground!

128
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,619
There's no mistake about it!

129
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,719
This is bad.

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,819
If we go as is, the TV station wagon will be there before us.

131
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,919
Dr. Agasa! Hurry!

132
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,220
Okay!

133
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,719
Hey, Gin.

134
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,019
Isn't Kir here yet?

135
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,719
I'm dying of boredom.

136
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,319
Hold it. She's on her way there while bringing DJ along with her.

137
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,619
Don't you dare hunt some other prey to get rid of your boredom now.

138
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,120
The same goes for Korn.

139
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,019
That boy.

140
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,619
And FBI agents!

141
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,119
Why?

142
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,219
Listen.

143
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,019
Only Ms. Jodie and me are going!

144
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,919
Both of you don't come out of the car, no matter what!

145
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,119
Okay.

146
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Ms. Jodie!

147
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,019
We don't have time!

148
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,120
Where is it?

149
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,719
Sorry for all the trouble.

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,919
Thank you so very much for agreeing to our scoop interview.

151
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,119
No problem. Anytime.

152
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,419
Was this the place the interview is to be held?

153
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,519
Yes.

154
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,119
It's a wonderful park.

155
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,319
It's my usual jogging course.

156
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,419
Well, at that time, my two bodyguards here

157
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,519
end up running with me though.

158
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,919
I wonder what's taking her so long.

159
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,519
Kir.

160
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,619
By the way, about the, you know what...

161
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,419
In place of my accepting this interview,

162
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,719
you'll approve of the condition I set forth too, won't you?

163
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,319
Yes. Of course.

164
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,820
I appreciate it.

165
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,519
Okay, Kir.

166
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,719
Guide DJ to the designated place.

167
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,919
This is going to be some heavy film.

168
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,119
Too bad it's not live broadcast.

169
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,019
90 m more!

170
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,919
Please make it in time!

171
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,119
We shouldn't just stand and talk.

172
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,019
Let's go some place where we can relax and talk.

173
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,219
True.

174
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,019
Well...

175
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,819
How about sitting on that bench over there?

176
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,719
Bench?

177
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,819
Great.

178
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,319
Good. That's right.

179
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,919
Let's get it over with as soon as possible, Mr. Domon.

180
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,119
What? Isn't that Mr. Domon?

181
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,220
What?

182
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,819
Amazing, he's for real!

183
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,620
Please shake hands with me!

184
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,219
It's fine.

185
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,419
I support you!

186
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,319
Please change Japan!

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,220
Oh, thank you!

188
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,019
I got him.

189
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,819
Can I shoot him?

190
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,719
Not yet, Korn.

191
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,619
There're too many sheep in the way.

192
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,220
Wait until DJ sits down on the bench.

193
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,819
There he is!

194
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,519
Hey. Isn't he Mr. Domon that appears a lot on TV?

195
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,620
For real?

196
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,819
But where's the snipers?

197
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,019
They were concerned about the rain.

198
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,120
So they're probably...

199
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,419
On the roof of a building!

200
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,019
Over there?

201
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,619
And the other one.

202
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,819
It's under the water tank.

203
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,619
I'll go save Mr. Domon.

204
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,619
So you go ahead and take the others to a safe place.

205
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
No.

206
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:29,519
If I carelessly charge in there and he fires at random,

207
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,219
he may hit the spectators in the area!

208
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,119
In order to prevent them from shooting.

209
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,820
In order to make them give the whole thing up.

210
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,719
Umbrella?

211
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,019
Well...

212
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,420
Let's shake hands after the interview.

213
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,619
How annoying.

214
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,119
Hold your horses

215
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,620
and wait.

216
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,620
There!

217
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,819
Sprinkler?

218
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,920
Hey, Ms. Jodie.

219
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,620
Do you have a gun?

220
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:14,305
Mr.Domon!

221
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,069
Thank you...

222
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,569
A gun?

223
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,069
Well, yes.

224
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,669
What about a silencer?

225
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,670
Yeah.

226
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:26,369
Then, will you shoot what I tell to shoot at?

227
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,369
But do it so no one notices!

228
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,569
So, like I said, let's shake hands later.

229
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,269
Mr. Domon!

230
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,969
I support you!

231
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,869
So please do your best!

232
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,970
Yeah.

233
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,470
Thank you!

234
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,469
Will films like this come in handy later during the election?

235
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,670
Yes, of course.

236
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,969
Understand, Korn?

237
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,869
I shoot his head!

238
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,169
And you shoot his back.

239
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,269
I want to shoot his head.

240
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,770
Okay! Suit yourself!

241
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,769
What's up, Kir?

242
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,870
Hurry and make DJ sit down!

243
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,070
Kir?

244
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,269
Mr. Domon?

245
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,769
It's about time we get the interview going.

246
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,070
Yes, I guess so.

247
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,469
Excuse me.

248
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,469
Will you all back off a bit?

249
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,670
We'd like to film the interview.

250
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,470
Sprinkler?

251
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,570
Rain?

252
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,070
Hey, come on. Give me a break.

253
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,470
Seriously?

254
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,669
Come on, and sit down.

255
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,770
Quickly!

256
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,970
Thanks.

257
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,169
DJ has a navy blue umbrella.

258
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,369
Can I shoot him?

259
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,669
Wait.

260
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,169
Shooting him through the umbrella will reduce accuracy.

261
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,369
But how strange.

262
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,470
It's not raining on this side.

263
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,270
It's begun raining on this side too.

264
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,069
It's really started raining.

265
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,770
Blessed rain.

266
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,769
Chianti.

267
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,669
Kir, Korn.

268
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,669
Withdraw for now!

269
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,169
I'll be waiting for you at the place in an hour.

270
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,569
Then...

271
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,670
Will you tell me?

272
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,270
The synopsis of the second part of the assassination scheme is?

273
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,769
We have no choice.

274
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,269
Let's continue the interview at the summerhouse within this park.

275
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,270
Yes.

276
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,770
Shall we get going then?

277
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,569
Excuse me. May we go with you too?

278
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,869
Yes, of course!

279
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,970
-Then, me too! -Same here!

280
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,369
Chance!

281
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,669
-Hurry up... -Wait...

282
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,869
I'd better get the transmitter and wiretap

283
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,070
that on the sole of her shoe now!

284
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,370
Okay! It's mine now!

285
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,969
Sonny?

286
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,270
I found it!

287
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,270
Don't tell me that you followed me here?

288
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,470
No. I didn't.

289
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,170
It's just a coincidence.

290
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,670
I see.

291
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,570
Thank you.

292
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,670
For picking my shoe up for me.

293
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,070
Thank you very much.

294
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,569
Director!

295
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,369
Could you substitute someone in my place to hold the interview?

296
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,369
-What? -I'm sorry.

297
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,469
I'm having trouble with my shoe since earlier.

298
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,270
Hey...

299
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,370
Gin.

300
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,369
The announcer found you?

301
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,869
No way!

302
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,869
Don't tell me she found out that we were tailing her.

303
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,169
No, I think I pulled through okay on that one.

304
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,269
She hasn't noticed the transmitter and wiretap either.

305
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,269
Then, why didn't you retrieve them?

306
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,469
All you had to do was tell her that

307
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,269
something was on the back of her shoe and take them.

308
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,769
Yeah. I thought of doing so too,

309
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,269
but she...

310
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,970
Thank you very much.

311
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,270
I sort of felt strange.

312
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,169
But thanks to you, we can pursue going after them!

313
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,369
Besides, there seems to be more to their assassination scheme.

314
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,669
Yeah.

315
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,669
Is it okay to leave things as they are?

316
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,469
The TV crew, that she brought along with her, are with him, aren't they?

317
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,769
The crew aren't involved in this!

318
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,269
She deliberately tried to find a reason

319
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,169
for acting on her own without the crew.

320
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,469
So my guess is...

321
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,969
Those guys are probably going to get together somewhere.

322
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,470
And get on with their next plan.

323
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,569
Well, leave the rest to us, FBI agents,

324
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,670
and you people get on going home with the Beetle.

325
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,069
I'm going to keep him with me for a while, though!

326
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,669
Then, how do you intend to pursue them without a car?

327
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,270
No problem.

328
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,270
My boss offered of his own initiative to be my driver.

329
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,169
Then, Dr. Agasa.

330
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,369
Smooth things out with Pops and Ran for me.

331
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,169
Invite them over to your place and make sure they don't find out anything.

332
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,569
Okay!

333
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,869
Just to be on the safe side,

334
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,269
we'll have two or three of our members stay on guard too.

335
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,070
Then, I'm counting on you!

336
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,870
Hey!

337
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,569
I'm sure you already know.

338
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:13,469
But your prime purpose is to retrieve the transmitter and wiretap!

339
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,869
If you hesitate because of curiosity or a sense of justice,

340
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,169
