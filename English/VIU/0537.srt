1
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:02,903
Calling all officers!

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,003
Head for the Nabei residence on the double!

3
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:06,503
There's a possibility that the suspect

4
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:08,803
has possession of Takagi's gun!

5
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:12,303
Be on full guard when coming in contact with him!

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,903
Listen! Life is lost in a split second!

7
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:25,203
Darn, you asked for it.

8
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:27,403
Darn! Dogs.

9
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,103
They've figured it out!

10
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:31,603
No, Officer Sato?

11
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,703
Officer... Sato...

12
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:43,803
Officer Takagi was shot?

13
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:46,103
Why does Officer Takagi have to die just because

14
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:48,903
we promised to go to the hot spring together?

15
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:52,103
-Hot spring? -Officer Takagi!

16
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:53,503
Oh, no, I mean...

17
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:54,903
You know, the usual?

18
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:57,003
The evidence that he coincidentally put inside his pocket

19
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:58,503
during the investigation

20
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:01,703
saved his life from the culprit's bullet.

21
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:05,003
Then, how is Officer Takagi?

22
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:09,103
He's gone through treatment and is sleeping in his room now.

23
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,703
He's fast asleep.

24
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:14,603
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

25
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:17,203
Saturday nights are for mystery.

26
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:19,203
A forewarning letter of crime arrives from Thief Kid.

27
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:21,903
His next target is an innovative formidable safe.

28
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:23,303
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:25,203
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:27,403
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:12,403
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 1)"

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
An almost suicidal attempt to arrest the culprit!

33
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,100
It was announced later,

34
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,600
that a police officer, while being shot by the culprit's bullet,

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,900
pinned the culprit down, and this eventually lead to the arrest!

36
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,600
So, this is the article about you, Officer Takagi, isn't it?

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,100
Yes, well... it turned out that way to begin with

38
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,600
because my gun was stolen by the culprit, you see.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,500
You'd better be grateful,

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,200
because thanks to my genius deduction,

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,300
we found out that

42
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,000
there was a scar on the back of the serial killer.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,900
Although like always, I don't remember a thing.

44
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,500
But, I'm sure glad the case was solved!

45
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Yeah, me too!

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,000
Including a lot of other things...

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Officer Takagi.

48
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Officer Takagi?

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,200
Your face is red.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Did something good happen?

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,400
Oh, no...

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
Nothing in particular.

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,400
I know! Because I saw!

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,300
What? What did you see?

55
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,500
Well, he was with Officer Sato in the hospital room and...

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,900
Conan, hold it.

57
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,600
Just because they're always on the winning end.

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,500
They think they can keep pushing their weight around.

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,800
Inspector Nakamori?

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,300
As for me, I repeatedly, almost,

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,200
but never, get to nab that snobbish thief.

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,700
So, I've been disappointed and burned, God knows how many times.

63
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,000
Hot!

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,300
Oh, I'm sorry!

65
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,900
Was it too hot?

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,800
No, it's okay.

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,500
My heart is chilled,

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,200
so something this hot is just right for me!

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,500
Your heart is chilled?

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,100
Well, Thief Kid's been quite quiet recently

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,500
so in other words, I kind of have nothing to live for.

72
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,100
Haven't you read the papers?

73
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
The papers?

74
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,700
There's a really big article on the front pages!

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,200
It says that Thief Kid

76
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,700
sent a challenging letter to Jirokichi Suzuki, his arch rival.

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Advisor Suzuki!

78
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,200
Just what is the meaning of this?

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,300
Please tell us in more detail!

80
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
What on earth is Kid going to come and steal?

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
Beats me...

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,900
What does that mean?

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,700
On the letter of warning, this is what was written.

84
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,000
"I'd advise you to resign yourself, Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki."

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,300
"Let's not fight a futile battle and surrender solemnly,"

86
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,100
"when the moon is swallowed by the darkness."

87
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,500
"And I, in front of your surprised eyes of wonder, break into"

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,900
"the great safe that has been handed down to you for generations,."

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,000
"Thief Kid."

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,700
The great safe,

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,200
don't tell me...

92
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
Right.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,100
The masterpiece of a lifetime that the great puppeteer,

94
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Kichiemon Samizu is said to have made just before his death.

95
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,100
The impregnable great safe,

96
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Iron Badger!

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,200
This is that letter of challenge!

98
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,000
Well, it seems that he's more interested in the safe itself

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,500
than the contents of the safe, but,

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
I sure am interested to see

101
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,100
whether he can break through the door of Iron Badger

102
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
that up to this time,

103
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,300
counter-attacked even the greatest known thieves of all times

104
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,600
that attempted to break into our house.

105
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,900
Very interesting, my foot!

106
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,400
Despite this letter of challenge being sent here,

107
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,000
it's very upsetting for we the police

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,100
to think that the press got this information before we did!

109
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,000
It's Inspector Nakamori from the Metropolitan Police Station!

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Just what do you propose to do this time to cope with Kid?

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,900
Inspector Nakamori, any comments?

112
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,600
Inspector!

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,700
How should I know? I just found out a while ago myself.

114
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,500
Well, take a good look at the picture on the letter of challenge!

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,100
It's different from the usual illustration!

116
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,900
That's why I didn't report it to the police

117
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,300
because there's a possibility that it's an imposter.

118
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,400
Then, why didn't you say so to the press too?

119
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,700
If I win this match that everybody thinks is genuine,

120
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,600
I can add this to my tale of heroic exploits, can't I?

121
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,800
This old man's... still at it...

122
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,400
At any rate, the police is to stay out of this,

123
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,900
because it isn't Thief Kid.

124
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,200
"Three Days Later" -What? It could be an imposter?

125
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,400
The Thief Kid that sent the letter of challenge this time?

126
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,900
Yes, that's what Uncle Jirokichi said!

127
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,500
I sent you a picture

128
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,400
of the letter of challenge by cell phone, didn't I?

129
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,800
Wasn't there something strange about it?

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,600
It's true that it wasn't the usual illustration.

132
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Besides, his letters of challenge are always written horizontally.

133
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,900
The phrasing in the letter's also old fashioned and quite weird.

134
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Then, why'd you call us over here?

135
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,500
It's a woman's intuition!

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,300
I can't help feeling that Kid's going to show up!

137
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,800
Well, although it seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way.

138
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Don't be off your guard thinking

139
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,100
that this guy's not the real Kid, understand?

140
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,700
Tonight's the night of the new moon,

141
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,000
in other words, the time when the moon will be swallowed by the darkness,

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,800
as was written in the letter of challenge!

143
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,000
Make sure you tightly secure the area around the room where the safe is!

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes, sir!

145
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,100
Inspector Nakamori... he's here.

146
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,800
But, why guard the area around the room?

147
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,500
I think it'd be better if they keep guard

148
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,200
inside the room in front of the safe.

149
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,100
It's because that's not necessary, Detective Mouri.

150
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,500
Would you like to see my pride and joy, Iron Badger?

151
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,200
A safe made by Kichiemon Samizu.

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,700
Come to think of it, some time ago,

153
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,700
we went through hell at a house of tricks that Kichiemon built.

154
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,100
So, is that the impregnable safe?

155
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Just by the looks of it, it looks pretty tough to open.

156
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,600
There's nothing in this room, not even furniture.

157
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,500
But, it's embedded in the wall,

158
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,800
and looks more like a room with a safe than a safe.

159
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,700
That's right.

160
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,400
The depth of the room is a little less than 4m,

161
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,300
and the size is approximately six mats.

162
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,100
It's surrounded by an iron plate 50cm thick.

163
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,200
In other words, it's a little steel room!

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,800
During the war, I took shelter here with my parents

165
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,600
and made it alive through the air raids!

166
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,300
Which means that there are air holes?

167
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
Yeah. There's small window for ventilation,

168
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,400
and see, under the door!

169
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,900
Do you see that space about 3cm?

170
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,000
But, did you have someone open it for you

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,600
when you went outside?

172
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,100
It opens easily from the inside.

173
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm the only one who knows how to open it from outside now, though.

174
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,100
Okay, then, would you let us take a look at it at closer range?

175
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,300
Hold it!

176
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,400
If I remember correctly, you smoke, do you not, Detective Mouri?

177
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,900
Yes.

178
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,300
Would you give me one, please?

179
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,400
Yes, of course.

180
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,700
He's a bodyguard that I hired the other day.

181
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,700
He's reticent, but very dependable!

182
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,100
Yes, I can tell.

183
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,700
If you will excuse me, then.

184
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,100
What's going on? What's that sound?

185
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Well, just watch!

186
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,600
Bars surrounded the room in an instant.

187
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a weight sensor that I installed!

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
It even reacts to the weight of one cigarette!

189
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
That's why there's no furniture here.

190
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,100
Now do you understand?

191
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,400
He can't even come near this safe!

192
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,400
This old man really likes to surround things.

193
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Akitsu, pick up the cigarette that's on the floor inside

194
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,100
and get rid of it!

195
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,600
But...

196
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,900
If I go inside, won't the bars come down on me like just now?

197
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,000
You fool!

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
It's switched off!

199
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,800
Just hurry and clean it up now, will you?

200
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,300
Oh, yes, sir!

201
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
Gosh.

202
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,400
I tell you, he's a new one I just hired the other day, but...

203
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
he sure is useless.

204
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,100
This cigarette...

205
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Should I give it back to Mr. Mouri?

206
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,400
You idiot!

207
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,700
You're going to make him smoke a cigarette that was on the floor?

208
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,000
Hurry up and throw it away in the wastebasket or something!

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,500
Yes, sir!

210
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,500
Once you're finished with your business, would you please

211
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
stay away from that door?

212
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,700
You're in the way of security.

213
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
I'm telling you that it's useless,

214
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,600
because this guy's an imposter!

215
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
Detective Mouri and everyone else, go on home!

216
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,100
Nothing's going to happen tonight.

217
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,500
That goes for you too, little one, arch rival of Kid.

218
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,400
Yep.

219
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay, shall we head on home then?

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What? Are you leaving?

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,600
Well, it doesn't seem like Thief Kid will be coming.

222
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
Right!

223
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,100
Won't you wait just a while longer?

224
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Ouch.

225
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
I'm sorry, sonny, are you okay?

226
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
Yep.

227
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
I was looking for the doggie

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,400
and on all fours looking for it, so I wasn't looking ahead.

229
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh, you mean Uncle's doggie?

230
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,600
Oh, yes.

231
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,000
If it's Uncle's doggie Lupin, I heard from Uncle

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,700
that he got sick and was hospitalized a while ago.

233
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,300
I mean, you're his maid and you didn't know?

234
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,600
Oh, no.

235
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,400
I just started working here from today, you see.

236
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
But, how disappointing,

237
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,100
because I was looking forward to seeing the cute doggie.

238
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,800
The doggie that I had died last month, so the more...

239
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,100
I see.

240
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,900
Well, I had it from when I was little,

241
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,200
so it was already pretty old.

242
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,600
Oh, no!

243
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,300
I shouldn't be talking to you, I'm still working!

244
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,900
I'm sorry! Excuse me!

245
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,200
Inspector!

246
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,200
Superintendent Chaki's orders are to withdraw from here!

247
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,600
What?

248
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,300
It seems that there was pressure from Advisor Suzuki to do so.

249
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,900
Come to think of it, they were talking away with each other

250
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,500
about being alma maters of the same university.

251
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,700
Well, there seems to be a super security device here after all.

252
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,500
Yeah, I guess they'll be fine without us.

253
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,600
Hey, gramps!

254
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Switch off all the security devices right now!

255
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,400
It's on the floor!

256
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,600
The card that wasn't there before!

257
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,400
This is...

258
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
"Just as promised,"

259
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
"I guess I shall come to get the precious treasure"

260
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,200
"that is inside the tummy of the badger,"

261
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,400
"before the moon shows its face out of the darkness."

262
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,900
"Thief Kid!"

263
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,000
This is genuine!

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,300
But, how did he put this card in this room?

265
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,100
Why didn't the weight sensor go off?

266
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,300
I guess, all's fine.

267
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,048
Please take a look!

268
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:36,448
This security group that envelopes the Suzuki residence!

269
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:38,748
It's become more real that Thief Kid will be coming.

270
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:40,248
More and more members of security squad

271
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:41,748
are gathering at the residence!

272
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:44,848
Will Thief Kid really appear as promised

273
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:47,448
amidst all this tight security?

274
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:48,948
He'll come!

275
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,148
He'll come without fail!

276
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:56,248
Wearing that hateful dauntless grin on his face.

277
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,848
Listen, all of you!

278
00:15:57,848 --> 00:15:59,548
Let's catch the thief today

279
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:03,148
and turn his snobbish face into one of dupe!

280
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:10,148
Making a big fuss over an imposter.

281
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:12,048
He's the real one!

282
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:17,848
It's true that his first letter smelled fishy,

283
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:19,048
but it was all just

284
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:21,948
some fancy joke of his to make fun of we, the police.

285
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:27,448
But this letter of challenge that was found inside the safe

286
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:29,648
is undoubtedly what he put there!

287
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:33,348
So, now, you calling him the imposter is the queer!

288
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:35,848
Well, even if it were to be so...

289
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:39,248
I don't see the need for all this tight security.

290
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,448
Have you forgotten?

291
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:43,948
What he's after is the great impregnable safe made by

292
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:49,248
the legendary genius of tricky gadgets, Kichiemon Samizu!

293
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:53,448
His ultimate goal is to open the door of Iron Badger!

294
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:57,448
It's loaded with gadgets to get rid of impudent ones

295
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:59,748
who dare try breaking into it.

296
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:01,548
It's so well made, that even I,

297
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:04,048
the only one who knows how to open it,

298
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,948
at times, make mistakes and almost lose my life.

299
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:09,248
There's no one that could possibly open it!

300
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,448
But, you're coping with the magician under the moon,

301
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,048
Thief Kid, you know!

302
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,448
No matter what kind of safe it may be,

303
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:16,348
if it falls into his hands, he'll open it in the wink of an eye.

304
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:18,748
Even if he did have such a talent,

305
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:20,848
he would never be able to get close to it!

306
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:24,648
I showed you the security device in this room, didn't I?

307
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:28,048
Once he sets foot into this room, that's it.

308
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,148
The weight sensor that's embedded in the floor will go off

309
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:33,748
and he'll be surrounded by iron bars in an instant

310
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:36,048
and nothing more than rat in a trap!

311
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:38,448
But,

312
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:43,448
Thief Kid actually put the letter of challenge in this room, didn't he?

313
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:48,248
He already had something worked out to bypass the device here!

314
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:53,248
Which means, when Thief Kid put that letter of challenge there,

315
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:56,648
he was near us, right?

316
00:17:56,648 --> 00:18:00,048
Because when the door of this room was opened the first time,

317
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,848
nothing was here,

318
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:05,248
but it was there the next time the door was opened, right?

319
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:09,448
All during that time, we were near this room.

320
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:11,948
If something is placed on the floor

321
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:14,648
when the switch of the weight sensor is turned off,

322
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:17,148
it doesn't respond even after the sensor is later turned on?

323
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:21,448
Right, because it only responds to weight that is detected

324
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:23,748
after the device is switched on.

325
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:27,648
Which means it was placed there after the switch was turned off.

326
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,748
Come to think of it,

327
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:31,148
Uncle, you turned the switch off back then, didn't you?

328
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:35,248
Yes, when you showed us how the weight sensor worked,

329
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:38,348
by throwing a cigarette inside the room...

330
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:41,948
What's this sound?

331
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:43,948
Well, just wait and see!

332
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:54,848
In order to retrieve the cigarette, you turned off the switch.

333
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:55,948
Akitsu!

334
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:59,548
Pick up the cigarette that's on the floor and get rid of it!

335
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,148
But...

336
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:05,448
If I go inside, won't the bars come down on me like just now?

337
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:08,048
You fool! It's switched off!

338
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:10,348
Just hurry and clean it up now, will you?

339
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:11,548
Oh, yes, sir!

340
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:14,048
Gosh.

341
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:16,748
I tell you, he's a new one I just hired the other day, but...

342
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:18,748
he sure is useless.

343
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:27,348
That man called Akitsu went inside the room

344
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,548
and picked the cigarette up!

345
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:30,948
So, that guy was the Kid!

346
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:32,548
He pretended to pick up the cigarette

347
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,448
and audaciously placed the letter of challenge inside!

348
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:36,748
But, I don't think that.

349
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:39,648
Mr. Akitsu's the only one who could've put it there.

350
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:41,848
The bodyguard who was constantly standing next to

351
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,248
old man Jirokichi could too.

352
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,848
He could've put it in the room,

353
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,548
just as old man Jirokichi was about to close the door.

354
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:49,748
And, the maid who said that she just came here today,

355
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:51,348
could've done it too.

356
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:55,548
She did say that she was on all fours looking around for the dog.

357
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:58,048
But, she wasn't near the door

358
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:00,648
when the switch was turned off, was she?

359
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:02,148
Nope!

360
00:20:02,148 --> 00:20:06,348
She wasn't by the door that we were shown the security device!

361
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:09,048
But, in this room where the safe is...

362
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:14,148
See, there's another door!

363
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:16,348
If the maid were the Kid,

364
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,448
she could pretend to be looking for the dog

365
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:20,748
and slide the letter under the door

366
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:23,848
when the guards were off their guard.

367
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,448
Right.

368
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:28,748
Back then, Uncle was giving orders in a loud voice so...

369
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:31,248
She could've heard him.

370
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:32,448
I see.

371
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,848
Which means she could've known that the switch was turned off

372
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:37,348
even if she were over there.

373
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:38,748
Besides, all three of them

374
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:41,548
seems to have been hired only recently too.

375
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:44,848
In other words, it's very likely that.

376
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:47,848
Kid snuck into this house in disguise.

377
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:52,348
Okay! Bring that guy called Akitsu and the maid over here!

378
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:55,248
I'll pull on their faces with all my might

379
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:58,948
and confirm whether it's a disguise or not!

380
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:01,248
Okay, first for...

381
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:03,848
Mr. Bodyguard, you.

382
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:05,248
No!

383
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,948
All the people that I hire,

384
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:11,048
are from that point on, a member of my family!

385
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:12,248
Be it the police or not,

386
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:14,348
I will not have you pushing your weight around!

387
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:16,448
Oh, no. But...

388
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:21,948
If you insist, show me proof that he's Thief Kid!

389
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,048
At any rate, I'm going to have a meal in my study!

390
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,348
Don't you dare make too much of a fuss!

391
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:31,448
Darn it!

392
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:34,248
Everything could be made clear only if I get to pull at their faces.

393
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:37,448
Uncle is sort of acting strange.

394
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:39,648
Because he would usually be all out to get, saying,

395
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:44,948
"I'll teach that sneaky thief a lesson!"

396
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:46,548
But, today, he's saying things like,

397
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:48,248
"Let him be because he's an imposter",

398
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:50,948
"Don't investigate because there's no proof".

399
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:55,248
Maybe Uncle is dear Thief Kid!

400
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,148
No way.

401
00:21:57,148 --> 00:22:00,148
It sure is strange.

402
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:02,348
After all, he did receive a letter of challenge from Kid

403
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:05,948
saying that he may be coming.

404
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:07,348
And yet, he hired new people to work for him.

405
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:09,948
And, three all together too, at a time like this?

406
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:12,648
Thief Kid's action of sending out that letter of challenge

407
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,948
is incomprehensible to begin with too.

408
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:17,548
Even if the first old-fashioned letter that arrived was,

409
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:21,248
something to make fun of the police.

410
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:23,248
Why would he send a new letter of challenge,

411
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:24,848
in the form he usually does,

412
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:27,548
on the very day that he's coming to do his thing?

413
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,148
Something's fishy.

414
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:35,548
There's definitely something behind this case.

415
00:23:57,848 --> 00:24:00,548
I wonder who he's disguised as.

416
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:04,048
That brat said a while ago that,

417
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:06,348
it's the tanned bodyguard, Goto,

418
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:09,048
the somewhat dense secretary Akitsu

419
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:13,048
and the klutzy maid, Mizuki.

420
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:16,548
Don't tell me that he's Thief Kid?

421
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:19,948
I'll leave the rest to you, little genius!

422
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:23,048
Next Conan,

423
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:27,248
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 2)"

424
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,248
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:47,148
"Jirokichi Suzuki."

426
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:48,648
My dear Thief Kid.

427
00:24:48,648 --> 00:24:50,048
That man is the hint.

428
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,248
Dear Thief Kid.
