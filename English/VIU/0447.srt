1
00:00:00,898 --> 00:00:02,297
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:04,197
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:05,897
Finally solved is the mystery of the mansion.

4
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:07,397
Officer Yamamura is not his usual self.

5
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,197
Everyone is surprised and amazed!

6
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:10,497
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:12,197
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:13,998
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,407
On the way to Sonoko's villa,

10
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,007
we run into an accident.

11
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,708
So we decided to borrow the phone at a villa nearby.

12
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:05,707
The villa happens to be a place

13
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,707
where members of a popular rock band "Dorcus" bought.

14
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:08,907
It was a mansion with a story behind it.

15
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:10,408
A devil is said to live in it.

16
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:14,807
And...

17
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:17,407
one of the members,

18
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:19,308
Rinko Honami dies.

19
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,907
But I began to doubt it was a suicide.

20
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:27,208
So this is nothing other than suicide.

21
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:32,307
Its what you think I might say, but the fact is otherwise.

22
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:37,007
This is a locked-room murder that was cleverly set up by someone!

23
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:39,808
And the murderer is among you.

24
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:47,808
"Sealed Western-style Window (Part 2)"

25
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:49,308
Wait a minute.

26
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:52,807
Do you mean there is a murderer among us?

27
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:54,607
It's a joke, isn't it?

28
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,607
I want you to explain

29
00:02:56,608 --> 00:03:00,507
how this became a locked-room case.

30
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,608
I was just stating an example.

31
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,107
Well, let us hear it, shall we?

32
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:11,307
When and where did you see Rinko for the last time?

33
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:13,107
Before her body was discovered,

34
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:17,807
-Ran, please put me down. -where and what were you all doing?

35
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:19,707
The last time I saw her

36
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:24,107
was when she stormed into the next room shouting at us about the noise.

37
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:29,107
Afterwards, I went upstairs to my room to practice with my guitar.

38
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,707
"Yoji Kuramoto (28)" -Until Toru began shouting

39
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,707
that something was wrong with Rinko in front of this room.

40
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,507
When Rinko yelled and came into the room,

41
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,007
you both were there, weren't you?

42
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,407
Yeah.

43
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:39,807
"Toru Tendou (30)" -After that,

44
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:43,307
I was listening to CDs in my room right above this room.

45
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:48,007
And I remembered that I haven't give the CD Rinko asked me to buy,

46
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:51,007
so I went down to Rinko's room.

47
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:53,907
"Jun Makino (29)" -I was arranging books in the room

48
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:56,207
where Rinko shouted at us earlier.

49
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,907
Since the previous owner had said

50
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:59,707
in return for selling the house for a cheap price,

51
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:03,707
he wanted us to get rid whatever was left in the villa on our own.

52
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,307
I was sorting out and choosing books that I thought could be sold.

53
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:08,807
I had no trouble choosing the books,

54
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,808
because all the book in this house were in order.

55
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,807
But...

56
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:18,507
I wonder why the owner leave everything behind?

57
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,007
He probably didn't want to come back here again.

58
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:26,007
The owner's brother and his brother's wife commit suicide here.

59
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:29,408
He even left the window that the demon is said to come through as it was.

60
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:32,107
Did you say a devil?

61
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,907
Do you want to see it?

62
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:37,008
It is in the next room which I was in before.

63
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,607
It's true.

64
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:51,407
It sure looks like a devil came through it.

65
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,907
I heard that's why it was closed off.

66
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:57,807
The elder brother of the wealthy brothers who built this villa did this.

67
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:00,807
How can you sleep in a room like this?

68
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,607
This is your room, isn't it?

69
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:03,608
No, sir.

70
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:08,107
My room is on the first floor which was used by the younger brother's wife.

71
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,707
This is the maid's room,

72
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,207
which is why it doesn't look as furnished.

73
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,807
But don't you think it's unnatural?

74
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,007
The maid's room were on the second floor

75
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:18,107
and the owner's wife on the first floor.

76
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,407
It seems she had a physical disability,

77
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:22,907
so she stayed on the first floor with no stairs.

78
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:26,307
Well, I'm sleeping in the elder brother's room

79
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,508
who is said to have committed suicide without problem.

80
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:31,507
This sure was the elder brother's room.

81
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:33,908
There are a lot of fine furniture here.

82
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,907
There are four windows facing the backyard.

83
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,608
It is the same size as Rinko's room.

84
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:47,407
This is a really gorgeous room.

85
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:50,207
This belonged to the younger of the rich brothers.

86
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,507
Well, I guess you could say that

87
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:55,008
the elder brother's wife committed suicide because of the younger brother.

88
00:05:56,308 --> 00:06:00,507
When we bought this house, we were told a story.

89
00:06:00,508 --> 00:06:02,307
The reason the older brother's wife committed suicide

90
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,907
was because the older brother found out

91
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:06,107
that she was having an affair with his younger brother and he accused her.

92
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,707
Maybe the older brother regretted driving her to death

93
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,507
and killed himself.

94
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:12,907
An affair?

95
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:14,107
Yes.

96
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,907
The younger brother and his older brother's wife

97
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,007
seems to have been secretly contacting each other since they came here

98
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:20,708
and saw each other at nights.

99
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,807
Anyway, let me consult with a senior officer about the case.

100
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:28,108
You all wait here for now.

101
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,707
Just as I thought.

102
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,007
The tree branches are in the way,

103
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,207
so only the window on the second floor is in view.

104
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,808
Which means that behind the lid of the bird nest...

105
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:56,207
I thought so.

106
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,208
There's a slot to slide the plate in.

107
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:00,907
There's no doubt about it.

108
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:03,707
The one who killed Rinko and made it look like a suicide

109
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,407
is that person.

110
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,507
All by utilizing the story

111
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:09,308
of this villa's demon.

112
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:21,607
Well, after asking the senior officer,

113
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:26,407
an incident seems to have happened here at the villa two years ago.

114
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,407
The people who died back then

115
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:32,407
were the older of the two brothers and his wife.

116
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,007
First, the older brother's wife committed suicide

117
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:37,807
using a rope in her room on the second floor.

118
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:40,007
Three days later, the older brother killed himself

119
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:43,607
by jumping from his room on the third floor.

120
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:46,407
The room in which the older brother's wife killed herself using a rope

121
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:52,007
seems to have been the same room where Rinko Honami was found dead.

122
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,707
The incident occurred after the older brother nailed down the window,

123
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,407
saying, "A devil has come to live here."

124
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:03,207
He then renovated the walls and floors of the house.

125
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:08,008
The locals became frightened and call it the villa where the devil resides.

126
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,707
So we'll be going to the police station.

127
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,807
What? You're leaving?

128
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:19,007
Shouldn't you investigate more in detail?

129
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:22,507
Like, who the ominous silhouetted figure

130
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:26,207
that was looking out from the supposedly sealed window.

131
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,607
What? You saw that?

132
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,807
Well, yes.

133
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,407
From the backyard where the window is in view.

134
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,207
If so, the more I'll be on my way.

135
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,007
-What? -What? Why?

136
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,707
Because it's a devil! A devil!

137
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,008
The police could never catch something like that!

138
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:43,907
Hey.

139
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:49,007
Besides, the room where Rinko hung herself was completely sealed.

140
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:52,007
The door key was found in the center of the room, too.

141
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,707
Rinko was possessed by the devil, that's why she committed suicide.

142
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,407
That's the only thing thinkable, right?

143
00:08:56,408 --> 00:09:00,407
Then, was the prank played in that room also the work of the devil?

144
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,207
Prank?

145
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,207
Because 3 came after 6, and 1 came after 4!

146
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,208
But the others were all in sequential order!

147
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,807
Just what are you talking about?

148
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,907
Ignore him!

149
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:16,807
He's just a brat.

150
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:20,407
By the way, may we get on with what we need to do?

151
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:23,207
Since such a terrible thing happened to one of our band members.

152
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,607
We want to discuss how we'll go about things from now on.

153
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,407
Yes, you may,

154
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:32,907
but I advise you all to get out of here as soon as possible.

155
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:34,707
When Rinko committed suicide,

156
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:39,207
Ms. Jun Makino was in the room next door, which is the maid's room.

157
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,207
The window that has been sealed with nails is also there.

158
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,107
At that time, Mr. Yoji Kuramoto was in the room

159
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:47,107
on the third floor right above Ms. Jun Makino,

160
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:51,507
the same room in which the older brother jumped from and killed himself.

161
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,807
And at about the same time,

162
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:56,507
there is no queer story behind Toru Tendou's room,

163
00:09:56,508 --> 00:10:00,107
but it is next to Yoji's room

164
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:02,107
and right above Rinko's room.

165
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:05,407
Which makes it the path that Rinko's dead spirit would walk through.

166
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:06,907
Maybe...

167
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:12,307
something may have possessed you three, too!

168
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,308
Yeah.

169
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:15,307
That's why we decided to stay here tonight

170
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,707
and head home first thing in the morning.

171
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,407
I've got to organize Rinko's things, too.

172
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:23,708
We brought a lot of things here with us.

173
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,407
It must be big sis!

174
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:30,507
Since she has come for us, shall we go home?

175
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:31,807
I guess so.

176
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:33,108
Hey, officer.

177
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,508
The fact is, just a while ago...

178
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:42,408
What is it? Is something wrong?

179
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,107
No, it's nothing.

180
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,507
That's right.

181
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:49,407
I'd like to have all your contact numbers,

182
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:52,007
so could you all wait in your rooms?

183
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:54,007
It'll only take a few minutes.

184
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:55,507
Yeah.

185
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:56,907
Sure.

186
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,308
That's no problem.

187
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:07,007
They're finally gone.

188
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:09,907
Shall we go get our stuff together then?

189
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:12,007
-Yeah. -I guess so.

190
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:15,708
I'll go clean up my room as well as Rinko's.

191
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,307
Are you sure you can handle it alone?

192
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:20,807
I'll help you with Rinko's room if you like.

193
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,307
Forget it.

194
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:24,507
Leave it up to Jun.

195
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:28,507
I'm sure Rinko has stuff that she doesn't want others to see.

196
00:11:28,508 --> 00:11:30,007
That's right.

197
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,807
Okay, so let's hurry and clean up,

198
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,507
so we can head home first thing tomorrow morning.

199
00:11:34,508 --> 00:11:35,808
Yeah.

200
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:06,623
So you've finally given yourself away.

201
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,323
Mr. Yoji Kuramoto!

202
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:10,323
Rather, I would like...

203
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:14,324
to address you as the man who killed Rinko!

204
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,121
Yoji, it was you after all.

205
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,621
You killed Rinko.

206
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:23,021
Hey, just what are you talking about?

207
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:25,021
Why would I do something like that?

208
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:28,321
How come you guys are in my room?

209
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:30,121
I'm sure I locked the door.

210
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:32,822
I opened it from inside.

211
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:35,121
What?

212
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:36,621
The officer told me to do so.

213
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:40,021
I pretended that I already went home,

214
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:42,322
but I was hiding in this room all this time.

215
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,821
I snuck into this room like you just did,

216
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:50,921
passing through the secret corridor from Rinko's room.

217
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,321
Secret corridor?

218
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:53,921
No use playing dumb!

219
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:56,922
We were watching from Rinko's room just now!

220
00:13:58,122 --> 00:14:01,121
We watched you open the door behind the bookshelf

221
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:04,322
and rearranged the books before putting them back, right?

222
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:10,521
And we also watched you came out of that closet

223
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:12,522
from the peephole on that door.

224
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:17,221
In other words, I also know how you did it.

225
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,521
You told Rinko that you had something to talk to her about

226
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:22,121
and made her let you into her room.

227
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:25,321
Then you caught her off guard and strangled her to death.

228
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,721
You suspended her in mid air using a rope,

229
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:30,121
then locked the door and the windows to create a locked room.

230
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:33,321
You used the secret corridor that was used just now

231
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:36,121
and snuck back to your room

232
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:41,621
and made it look as if Rinko had committed suicide.

233
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:44,421
But your plan wasn't perfect.

234
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:46,221
When you put the books back on the bookshelf,

235
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,121
which is the entrance to the secret corridor,

236
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,621
you made a mistake in lining the books up in sequential order.

237
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:54,621
You heard Conan mention the order of the books.

238
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:58,921
You were afraid the police would find the secret passage,

239
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:02,922
so you decided to fix it while everyone was asleep.

240
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:07,321
Well, it's not surprising that you'd make a mistake.

241
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:11,321
Because you can't see the order from outside.

242
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,521
But it's amazing that you found out

243
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,421
about the secret corridor.

244
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:18,321
I found it easily.

245
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:19,521
Because...

246
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:20,721
Because?

247
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,522
Because, well...

248
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,121
Huh?

249
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:26,321
Let's see...

250
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:27,922
What was it?

251
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,422
I see. I get it, that's right.

252
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:37,921
When I saw the windows at this villa,

253
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:41,021
something suddenly hits me.

254
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:43,321
Unlike Rinko's room on the second floor,

255
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,321
or Yoji's room on the third floor

256
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:48,821
and Toru's room,

257
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,121
I noticed that only the maid's room with the sealed window

258
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:54,221
has narrow spaces between the windows.

259
00:15:54,222 --> 00:15:58,421
And the distance between the side wall was short.

260
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,621
And when I heard Conan's casual remark

261
00:16:00,622 --> 00:16:04,521
about the queer change in the bookshelf of Rinko's room,

262
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:06,521
I was convinced.

263
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:10,721
The window couldn't be opened not because it was nailed shut,

264
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:13,421
but because only half of it was nailed.

265
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:17,021
The left side of the window is inside of the secret passage,

266
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:19,521
which is why it can't be opened.

267
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:21,121
And a narrow corridor in the space made from this contraption

268
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:23,421
lead to the bookshelf in Rinko's room,

269
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:26,122
which was the doorway to this corridor.

270
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:30,021
To make the nailed window stand out less,

271
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,821
a bookshelf was put between the next two windows.

272
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:39,121
This way, no one would notice the amount of space between them.

273
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:41,921
If a wall partition is positioned on one side of the window,

274
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:45,121
a window that will open only half way could be made in the secret passage.

275
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:46,221
I see!

276
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:50,021
That's why when I saw someone looking out the window,

277
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:53,521
only the lower window on the left side was opened.

278
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:57,522
But who built the secret passage and for what reason?

279
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:04,021
The one who made it was the owner of this house, the older brother.

280
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,321
The four rooms in question

281
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:08,821
have four windows each of the same size, facing the backyard.

282
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:11,721
If the room right below has a narrow window because of the secret passage,

283
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:17,121
it is because the entrance to the passage is directly above it.

284
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:18,921
The brother pretended he saw a devil,

285
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,421
so he could build this secret passage

286
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:24,421
and renovated the floor and walls of the villa.

287
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:28,221
Even if the room became a bit smaller, it was the maid's room,

288
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:32,021
so no one would complain about the room becoming smaller anyway.

289
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,522
Then why did he make it?

290
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,521
To watch and confirm

291
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:41,321
whether his wife and younger brother were having an affair.

292
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:44,721
According to Conan, there's a bird house in the backyard.

293
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:48,221
On the back of the bird house entrance, there's a slot to slide a plate in.

294
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:49,922
When the younger brother slide a plate in...

295
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:53,821
it was a sign telling his sister-in-law

296
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,621
to unlock the door of the room and wait for him.

297
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:59,121
But if his older brother looks into the bird house,

298
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:00,821
he would find out right away, wouldn't he?

299
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:03,321
If his younger brother and his wife sees that,

300
00:18:03,322 --> 00:18:07,521
they would come up with another idea to signal each other, wouldn't they?

301
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:10,221
Moreover, that bird house could only be seen from the second floor

302
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,021
because the branches of the tree were in the way.

303
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:15,321
He couldn't look in from his wife's or the maid's room.

304
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:18,521
That's why the older brother made that secret passage.

305
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:22,321
He could confirm the signal when they wanted to see each other secretly,

306
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:25,921
as well as watch them having an affair from the passage.

307
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:30,421
Well, there's no way of knowing at this point already.

308
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:34,921
Let's say the older brother killed his wife and made it look like suicide.

309
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:36,721
Then unable to bear the feeling of guilt over what he had done,

310
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:40,021
he most likely committed suicide after killing his wife.

311
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:43,721
And Yoji who happened to find the secret passage

312
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,221
killed Rinko the same way the older brother killed his wife,

313
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:48,622
I see.

314
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:52,721
You didn't let me clean Rinko's room,

315
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:54,421
so that I would use the secret passage in the middle of the night

316
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:58,521
to put the books that were out of sequence back in sequence again.

317
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:01,521
So both of you were working along with the police?

318
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:02,621
Yes.

319
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:06,621
The officer told us when he came to get our contact number.

320
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:09,922
He told us not to let you near Rinko's room.

321
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:16,121
And aren't you going to ask me why I killed her?

322
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,921
No. It's about the guitar, isn't it?

323
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:22,121
But didn't you settle it saying that you would go along with her?

324
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:23,621
Yeah.

325
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,921
I tried the best I could

326
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:29,621
and went over to Rinko's room to show her how much I tried.

327
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:31,921
But that woman...

328
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:35,121
No good at all. You're way off.

329
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:37,821
Haven't you been listening to the latest music?

330
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:40,321
Your guitar playing is out of date!

331
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:43,521
I'd advise you to start learning everything from scratch again.

332
00:19:43,522 --> 00:19:48,821
Then she started degrading my favorite guitarist.

333
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:51,522
And when I realized that I couldn't hear her anymore...

334
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:56,021
Right in front of my eyes...

335
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,821
Right in front of my eyes, Rinko was...

336
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,521
Rinko was lying on the floor.

337
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:02,922
Then you weren't planning on killing her to begin with?

338
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:07,021
Wrong. I think I had the intention to kill her.

339
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:11,121
I didn't tell anybody that I found the secret passage

340
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:12,621
and was waiting for the chance to kill her one day.

341
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:15,122
I had the rope hidden at that time, too.

342
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:20,421
It's not like I was thinking of killing her at that time.

343
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:23,921
That's why I panicked and hung her from the chandelier near the door

344
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,621
and rushed to remove the key to that room from the key holder

345
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:29,021
and left through the secret passage.

346
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:31,422
To make sure no one saw me, I looked outside.

347
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:38,422
I ended up being seen by that boy wearing glasses.

348
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:40,621
Well...

349
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:45,821
Maybe it's me who was possessed by devil in this villa.

350
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,521
The rope that I used

351
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,722
was something I found on the floor of the secret passage.

352
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:52,921
It was probably the rope that was left

353
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:56,322
after the wealthy older brother killed his wife.

354
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:29,021
Please take him to the station.

355
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:30,022
Yes, sir!

356
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:39,021
What a fantastic deduction it was, officer.

357
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:41,721
I didn't know you had such hidden talent, Officer Yamamura.

358
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:46,121
Well, I wouldn't mind considering you my rival.

359
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,221
No, well...

360
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:49,422
The deduction I made were all thanks to Mr. Mouri...

361
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:52,722
P.S, P.S.

362
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:55,122
P.S.?

363
00:22:59,022 --> 00:23:00,221
P.S.:

364
00:23:00,222 --> 00:23:01,222
"I'd be embarrassed if people found out

365
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:04,221
that I was involved in such a rinky-dink case.

366
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:06,922
So don't tell anyone that you were getting help from me."

367
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:09,522
Kogoro Mouri.

368
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:15,021
Well, with a brain like mine,

369
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:17,021
a case like this is as sweet and easy to handle

370
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,222
as honey in sweet azuki beans dessert!

371
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:24,621
Shall we head on home then?

372
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:25,722
Let's go.

373
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:28,321
But to see through the case at the villa

374
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:30,921
just by hearing about it from you on the phone,

375
00:23:30,922 --> 00:23:33,421
Detective Mouri is really something after all.

376
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:34,422
Yeah.

377
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:38,321
If he had to move in to the range of the service area of the cell phone

378
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:41,121
and e-mail me something like this,

379
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:42,421
he may as well have come here directly

380
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,421
and put on the Sleeping Kogoro show.

381
00:23:45,422 --> 00:23:46,521
Yeah.

382
00:23:46,522 --> 00:23:50,321
Actually I wanted to put either Sonoko or you to sleep.

383
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:51,722
But I couldn't.

384
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:56,222
Not in front of him.

385
00:23:58,422 --> 00:24:01,621
"Next Episode" -It's Paipo, Paipo's Shuringan.

386
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:03,621
Shuringan's Gurindai.

387
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,621
Gurindai's Popokopi and Ponpokona.

388
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:09,722
Now, the name is Chokyumei Chosuke.

389
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:16,422
Who was the master waiting for, anyway?

390
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:19,721
These two think that the other is the culprit

391
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:21,322
and they're protecting each other.

392
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:28,422
Next Conan, "Meguro Saury".

393
00:24:44,222 --> 00:24:46,321
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:48,476
"Fairy tale."

395
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:52,501
Too bad for Deduction Queen Sonoko...
