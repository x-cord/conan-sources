1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,580
Everyone, Happy New Year!

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,710
Thank you for all your support last year.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,840
Thanks to you, Case Closed has been airing for 25 years.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,840
And the 1000th episode will be airing soon.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,210
We'll work together again this year to produce an entertaining product.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,100
So we appreciate your continued support.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,950
Osu!

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,830
What's that?

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,939
From heaven, earth, and man,

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,369
the silent voices call.

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,340
Kamen Yaiba!

12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,720
Born in Japan.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,509
Are you the ones who called me?

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,719
No matter the time or place, I, Yaiba, shall defend justice...

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,230
That was great.

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,860
Superhero Team Azengers was as good as they say.

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,179
Yeah,

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:21,110
although I was a little dumbfounded by Kamen Yaiba's reason for joining them.

19
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,490
You're right.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,990
After all, it was, "We want to increase our Japanese audience."

21
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,620
It was so blunt, I laughed out loud.

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,639
If that movie were real, I bet they'd recruit Makoto-san first.

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,260
Th-Thank you.

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,829
I think Ran-kun and I would be pretty good, too.

25
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,390
You think so?

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,139
When you think about it, it really is a waste.

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,890
What?

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,400
After all, you're Kanto's strongest karate practitioner.

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,650
A tomboy equally skilled in jeet kune do.

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,650
And a young martial artist with a 400-0 undefeated record.

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,419
But you're just watching movies and strolling around town.

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,910
What's wrong with that? It's peaceful.

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,239
This isn't a manga.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,629
You can't expect incidents to occur at your own convenience.

35
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,130
What?

36
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,699
Stay back!

37
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,999
I'll blow her brains out!

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,309
No!

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,590
I expect you to fulfill the three demands I'm about to list.

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,689
First, I want a car.

41
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,010
Bring me a car so I can get out of—

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,470
What?

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,110
Are you all right?

44
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,690
Cut!

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,660
What?

46
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,450
Makoto-san!

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,490
Huh?

48
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,700
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

49
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,080
What?

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,909
Find the question that solves the mystery!

51
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,840
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,059
Kyogoku-san makes his acting debut?

53
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,399
Solving mysteries at a filming location with Sera!

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,049
Always determining the one truth

55
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,959
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,310
his name is Detective Conan!

57
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:57,645
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy (Part One)

58
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:00,025
I-I'm sorry.

59
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,844
I thought a woman was in danger.

60
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,224
Oh, Makoto-san.

61
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:08,035
Well, we were just watching that kind of movie.

62
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:11,964
It's no use. He's unconscious.

63
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:15,344
It's your fault for not keeping an eye on the crowd.

64
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:16,754
Sorry.

65
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:20,915
I didn't think anyone would come running from the other side of the street.

66
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:24,284
Give me a break.

67
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:26,925
He still has scenes left to shoot.

68
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:30,044
Is there anyone who can take his place?

69
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:34,424
Since the role involves wearing a full face helmet,

70
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:35,924
anyone can do it.

71
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:38,315
We can dub his lines in later.

72
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:44,055
But finding an actor who can do action scenes on such short notice will be difficult.

73
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:51,354
Now that I get a better look at you, you're pretty fit.

74
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:55,075
Was that something special that you did earlier?

75
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:58,604
Well, I know a bit of karate.

76
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,715
Oh, really? Really? You don't say.

77
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:05,715
Let's do a camera rehearsal.

78
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,465
Ready, action.

79
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:17,664
Makoto-san, you're amazing!

80
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:19,895
Nice. Nice.

81
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:21,275
Huh.

82
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:24,315
He's the understudy?

83
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:28,054
He moves pretty well.

84
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,655
I wish he'd do my stunts for me.

85
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,184
You used to be able to move like that, Nanako.

86
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,375
You mean when I just started.

87
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,694
I can't do that anymore.

88
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:41,625
Plus, I'd hate to break a nail.

89
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,114
I see.

90
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:44,634
I guess you're no longer a youngster.

91
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:45,965
You're a mid-level actress now.

92
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:48,904
Don't make me sound so old.

93
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:50,724
I'm still in my 20s.

94
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,244
Excuse me.

95
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,975
Anyway, I was hoping I could get this famous actress' autograph.

96
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,214
My nephew is a fan.

97
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:58,885
What?

98
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:00,605
Sure, fine.

99
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:02,135
I can do that.

100
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:04,935
What's his name?

101
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:06,935
Ow!

102
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:08,735
What is this?!

103
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,155
A practical joke.

104
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:15,295
It produces an electrical current when you press the button.

105
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:17,285
How stupid.

106
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:22,374
I bet you're the one who planted that whoopee cushion on my chair in the makeup room.

107
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,285
Yeah.

108
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:26,664
It's what you get for leaving those things lying around.

109
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:28,794
What things?

110
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:29,795
Excuse me.

111
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,805
He might be talking about your false eyelashes.

112
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:36,805
When two of them get stuck together, they look like a centipede.

113
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,334
So you just mistook them for something else.

114
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,444
I'm asking you to be careful.

115
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,565
You know I don't like it.

116
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:48,484
Isn't it kind of pathetic for you to be scared of bugs?

117
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,945
You're supposed to be a man.

118
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:53,834
Now that's inappropriate.

119
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:56,755
It's like you don't even realize you're a famous actress.

120
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:00,645
He's infuriating!

121
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:05,184
Anyway, he sure is great.

122
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,414
He was quick to learn the fight scenes, too.

123
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:08,255
Yeah.

124
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:12,634
This only happened because he jumped to conclusions.

125
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:18,264
Have we actually unearthed an unbelievable diamond in the rough?

126
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,834
But he's just a meathead.

127
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,015
An actor's all about the face.

128
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:27,355
What?

129
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:29,124
Wait, what?

130
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,695
He's super handsome.

131
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:36,424
Maybe I'll scout him to play a new police detective.

132
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:40,614
It's about time your character died in the line of duty.

133
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:43,205
You can't be serious.

134
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,284
But even we could handle those fight scenes, right?

135
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:48,455
Yeah.

136
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:51,755
What? You girls can do action scenes, too?

137
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:54,064
I guess.

138
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:55,885
Better than the average person.

139
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:58,384
Th-They're so cute!

140
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:01,895
In that case, maybe I'll have one of you do Jinmei-chan's stunts.

141
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:07,144
I don't need a stunt person.

142
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,864
L-Let me do my own stunts.

143
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,315
What? Really?

144
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:11,495
What?

145
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:14,065
You were scouted to play a police detective?

146
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:15,435
Y-Yes.

147
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,904
I told them I don't have the time, though.

148
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:20,645
Why not give it a shot?

149
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:23,745
What kind of drama is this?

150
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,064
It's called KEG48.

151
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:30,065
It's a police drama people are talking about for all kinds of reasons.

152
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:34,864
That show with 48 officers, so you can't remember them all.

153
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,965
That's why it doesn't matter much if they swap one out.

154
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:45,474
But doesn't that mean I might eventually become the wife of an action star?

155
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,895
Huh? What about a wife?

156
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,525
Nothing. Just talking to myself.

157
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:54,405
Talk all you want, gold digger.

158
00:09:57,915 --> 00:10:00,584
I can't ignore what you just said.

159
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:01,445
What?

160
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:03,665
Take it back.

161
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:09,734
It's fine, Makoto-san.

162
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,165
But...

163
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:14,175
Don't get into a fight before your debut.

164
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,845
Hey, there's a nail on the ground.

165
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:26,515
Sorry.

166
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:33,695
That's where the carpenter flipped his toolbox over earlier.

167
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,224
Then clean it up.

168
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:39,094
What if I stepped on this and hurt myself?

169
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,485
S-Sorry.

170
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,904
It's because you're careless.

171
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:46,245
This is why the previous AD died in an accident.

172
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:54,714
Unlike you ADs, us actors can't be replaced.

173
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:55,965
Be careful.

174
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:03,325
The previous AD?

175
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:14,740
This is the last scene. Good luck.

176
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:15,471
Got it.

177
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:19,840
And give some thought to playing the new police detective.

178
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,471
O-Okay.

179
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:24,790
I'll explain how the safety tether works later.

180
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,880
Please head up to the fourth floor.

181
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:28,091
Understood.

182
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,150
Sonoko-san, excuse me.

183
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,520
Could you hold onto these?

184
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:35,941
Okay. Makoto-san, good luck.

185
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:40,730
Where's Tokuzono-chan?

186
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:43,701
He's supposed to kick our future star off the building.

187
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,110
Tokuzono-san was looking for his phone.

188
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:51,501
He said he couldn't find his main girl's phone.

189
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:55,840
Aburai-chan, your allergies have been going on for a while this year.

190
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,011
That's just what he said.

191
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:04,011
He's probably already up there talking to his main girl on the phone.

192
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:07,240
Maybe he really is looking for it.

193
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:12,771
He keeps a different phone for each girl but leaves them lying around all the time.

194
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,191
Are you speaking from experience?

195
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:20,361
No. He and I were never...

196
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,441
Uh, well...

197
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:25,741
Not that it matters.

198
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:31,410
Come to think of it, he asked me earlier if I'd seen his phone.

199
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:34,711
Jeez. We're supposed to film soon.

200
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:38,341
Jinmei-chan, why are you short of breath?

201
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:43,780
Because I just filmed a fight scene with the culprit on the fourth floor.

202
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,900
That was you?

203
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:47,270
Not the stunt woman?

204
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:49,870
What? Didn't I tell you?

205
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,871
What are you even talking about?

206
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,691
I'm joking, I'm joking.

207
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:59,220
If you yell too much, your fake wounds will come apart.

208
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:00,701
I know that.

209
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:05,951
Sir, how's this for the camera angle?

210
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,201
Be right there.

211
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:15,991
Looks pretty good. It's got intensity.

212
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,581
So, has anyone seen Tokuzono-chan?

213
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:26,931
Hey, we're not ready ye—

214
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,491
Excuse me.

215
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,941
Is something wrong?

216
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,061
Makoto-san.

217
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:51,331
The deceased is actor Tokuzono Saiya-san, 34 years old.

218
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:54,170
While the staff was down here

219
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:57,961
preparing to film the next scene for their TV drama,

220
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,600
Tokuzono-san, who had ascended to the fourth floor,

221
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:03,841
shouted and fell.

222
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,360
He died when he struck the ground.

223
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:08,721
I see.

224
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,740
And at that time,

225
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:14,620
the only person on the fourth floor with him was you,

226
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,640
Kyogoku Makoto-kun.

227
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:17,401
Yes.

228
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:20,290
You think Makoto-san did it?!

229
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,211
Why?!

230
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:22,281
Sonoko.

231
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:26,031
Was there really no one else there?

232
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:27,341
Yes.

233
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:33,181
Tokuzono-san came in while I was visualizing the action scene by myself.

234
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:36,041
Did you notice anything then?

235
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,430
Come to think of it,

236
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:43,551
Tokuzono-san said he was looking for his phone and called it using another one.

237
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:47,741
But I think I heard a strange noise other than a ringtone.

238
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,090
Then I heard his scream.

239
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:52,430
When I turned around, he was gone.

240
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:53,731
A strange noise?

241
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:56,641
There was a sound just before he fell.

242
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,900
Then someone else must've set something up!

243
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,550
There's no way Makoto-san would do something like that!

244
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:05,651
Sonoko, calm down.

245
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:10,241
Do you have any idea what could have made the noise?

246
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,200
All that was in the fourth floor classroom

247
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:16,751
were the safety harness he was going to wear.

248
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:19,760
We'd finished filming the scenes inside the classroom.

249
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,050
All we had left to film was the culprit falling

250
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:25,500
from the fourth floor shot from inside the schoolyard.

251
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:29,391
Once the actor playing the culprit reached the fourth floor,

252
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:31,650
and the camera position was set,

253
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:33,680
I was supposed to head up there, too.

254
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,891
But then Tokuzono-san...

255
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,790
Is it possible that it was an accident?

256
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:43,901
Could Tokuzono-san have accidentally fallen while playing around with his harness?

257
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:47,520
He was looking for a phone that was important to him.

258
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,640
I doubt that's what happened.

259
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:56,451
Although it is true that he frequently pulled childish pranks.

260
00:15:56,941 --> 00:16:00,071
Hideka-chan, you've been his victim a few times, right?

261
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:01,581
Y-Yes.

262
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:08,011
He often pranked me with jack-in-the-boxes and whoopee cushions.

263
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,380
He pranked us with some bleeding soap once.

264
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,391
That was intense.

265
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:21,210
The AD who fell for it screamed like he was dying.

266
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:27,901
It made everyone in the studio gather in the bathroom.

267
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:32,260
That AD went on to actually die later.

268
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:34,911
Because of those practical joke devices?

269
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:38,930
He got into a car accident on his way to a filming location.

270
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:39,801
I see.

271
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:44,921
But weren't there staff members who resented Tokuzono-san for his pranks?

272
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,161
Yes.

273
00:16:46,162 --> 00:16:48,510
Some ADs even quit over it.

274
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:52,520
And actors who quit after getting into arguments about it.

275
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:57,141
Tokuzono-chan himself was trying to break the ice.

276
00:16:57,491 --> 00:17:00,230
He didn't have any malice.

277
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:02,110
Speaking of arguments,

278
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:07,110
that guy playing the culprit got into an argument with Tokuzono-san just before he fell.

279
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,930
I guess he made fun of his girlfriend.

280
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:13,570
What?! That hardly qualifies as an argument!

281
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:15,911
Sonoko, restrain yourself.

282
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:20,770
In any case, let's head to the fourth floor classroom.

283
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:25,791
Kyogoku-kun, director, and AD, come with us.

284
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:29,301
The rest of the staff will wait here.

285
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:36,371
After a fight, the culprit is kicked out the window in this scene.

286
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:39,870
This is the safety harness you mentioned.

287
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:42,851
It seems fairly standard.

288
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,860
Could you call the last number the victim called using his phone?

289
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:49,941
Got it.

290
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,220
It's over there?!

291
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,751
Huh? That's odd.

292
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:05,650
Nobody would forget their phone here.

293
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,381
C-Conan-kun?

294
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:13,520
Isn't it possible that something made him drop it there after he found it?

295
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:17,891
But look. There isn't a scratch on this phone.

296
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:20,910
In other words, it wasn't dropped or thrown.

297
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:26,130
It was carefully placed there by someone other than Tokuzono-san.

298
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:27,401
That's right.

299
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:29,780
What are you kids doing?!

300
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:31,861
You, too, Sera-san?

301
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,281
I mean, after all, we're detectives.

302
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:41,361
Because of us, we now know that someone may have used this phone to do something.

303
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:43,041
Jeez.

304
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:48,291
We don't know what their intention was or who left this phone there.

305
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:53,770
After Tokuzono-san entered the classroom and said he'd call his phone,

306
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:56,040
I heard the ringtone immediately.

307
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,711
I believe it came from the window.

308
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:04,841
That narrows down the time when the phone was placed.

309
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:09,630
Did anyone else enter the classroom?

310
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:11,490
Everyone did.

311
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:15,321
We filmed the fight scene in the classroom first.

312
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:18,110
All of the staff—camera, lights,

313
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:21,331
and makeup—were here in this room.

314
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:26,860
After that, we left to film the falling scene from outside.

315
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:30,591
With all the equipment being moved, things were busy.

316
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:37,841
So anyone could've taken advantage of that to leave the phone outside the window.

317
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:41,290
We were up here watching them work,

318
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,971
so nobody was keeping an eye on the window from the outside.

319
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:48,440
Sounds like we should ask who was last to leave the classroom.

320
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:49,351
Indeed.

321
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:59,031
Please don't pick anything up until forensics has a chance to examine the room.

322
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:02,201
My shoelace came untied.

323
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:05,710
What are you doing acting in a drama, anyway?

324
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:07,790
I-It's a long story.

325
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,870
He knocked an actor unconscious.

326
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,211
Not that he can tell them that.

327
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:17,471
What? Who left the fourth floor classroom last?

328
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:20,310
How do you expect us to remember that?

329
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:22,870
We took a lunch break after that.

330
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:25,680
People were eating their lunches all over the place.

331
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:27,731
It was about 30 minutes.

332
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:33,111
From down here, the fourth floor is a blind spot.

333
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,380
In other words, it would've been possible for someone

334
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:40,361
to return to the fourth floor during that break and lay a trap.

335
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:45,621
Come to think of it, Jinmei-chan, you were oddly short of breath earlier.

336
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,251
That's because I had an action scene.

337
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:52,501
But you had a 30 minute break after filming ended.

338
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:58,511
Though it would make sense if you ran up to the fourth floor at that time.

339
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,260
I haven't done an action scene in a while, and I'm out of shape.

340
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,810
I run out of breath easily these days.

341
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:07,431
You did suddenly insist on doing it yourself.

342
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:12,350
In any case, someone placed the phone outside the window during the break

343
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:14,610
between the time filming ended

344
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:17,441
and when Tokuzono-san and Kyogoku-san returned to the fourth floor.

345
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:23,460
It's possible they were lurking nearby in order to retrieve whatever trap they set.

346
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:26,331
Is there anyone who was missing during that time?

347
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,470
We were about to start filming.

348
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:30,751
We would've noticed if someone disappeared.

349
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,890
Would you like to check the camera footage?

350
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:37,501
We happened to start filming shortly before Tokuzono-chan fell.

351
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,840
I don't see you, director.

352
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:45,001
I was looking through the camera to check the angle.

353
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:48,540
Hey, we're not ready ye—

354
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,141
See? That's my voice.

355
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:02,981
Sorry. This is an inappropriate time for me to laugh about the past.

356
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:08,230
Only four people besides Ran-san's group are visible.

357
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,790
And we can't see the fourth floor.

358
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,501
Odori Daisaku Found the culprit [music]

359
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:48,090
Anyway, what are we going to do about the shoot?

360
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,721
It's obviously canceled.

361
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,890
Don't touch the cut on my temple.

362
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,480
It's real.

363
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:56,381
Yeah, I kno—

364
00:23:57,461 --> 00:23:59,440
I'll buy drinks for the staff.

365
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:00,691
Let's take a break for tea.

366
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,691
Hey, what's that?

367
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:05,441
You've found a fun toy, haven't you?

368
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:09,201
Th-That's the sound.

369
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:14,491
The next episode of Conan is, "Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy, Part Two!"
