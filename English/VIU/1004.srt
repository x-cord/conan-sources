1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,129
The old man received a letter from someone named Ichihara Taisei,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,699
asking him to determine why his old friend committed suicide

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,180
by deciphering the code left at the feet of the body.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,030
The old man and I gathered the number of guests specified by the letter

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,010
and arrived at an abandoned church deep in the mountains of Nagano.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,920
We learned that the client Nichihara Taisei-san

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,600
was the man who committed suicide in that church.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,430
At the instructions of presumably the person who invited us here,

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,010
we searched the abandoned church for additional codes.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,430
Here we are.

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,030
Hey, you.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,610
How long are you going to...

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,030
Hey!

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,860
What the hell is going on here?!

15
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:57,280
Wada Kohei (28) Office Worker

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,209
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,659
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,709
Snowed in deep in the mountains, there's nowhere to run.

19
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,330
Amuro and Conan's investigation begins.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,419
Always determining the one truth

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,349
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,050
his name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,980
"The 36-Cell Perfect Game, Part Two!"

24
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,410
Wh-What's going on?

25
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,790
Why is Wada bleeding on the ground?

26
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,750
Hey, Wada! Kohei!

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,790
Don't come any closer.

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,670
This is the scene of a murder.

29
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,979
M-Murder?

30
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,180
Y-You mean Kohei is dead?

31
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,440
B-But why?

32
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,979
Why is it okay for you guys to touch the body?

33
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,259
It's not as though you're police officers.

34
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,110
Amateurs messing around with the crime scene will surely cause problems later.

35
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,409
Hold it right there!

36
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,610
I'm not going to sit here quietly while you insult us.

37
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,120
Clean our your ear holes and listen carefully.

38
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,250
The truth is, he's the great detective who puts crying kids to sleep.

39
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,249
"Puts crying kids to sleep?"

40
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,400
He's Mori Kogoro,

41
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,760
also known as the Sleeping Kogoro.

42
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,989
What's Mori Kogoro doing here?

43
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,760
You said you came here because you received a letter from Nichihara, who committed suicide.

44
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

45
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,829
We were likely invited here by someone who found Nichihara Taisei-san's suicide suspicious.

46
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,020
They asked us to solve the code and uncover the truth behind his suicide.

47
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,780
It would seem that whoever they are,

48
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,699
they think you guys were the cause of his suicide.

49
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,530
N-No way.

50
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,399
So if you don't want anybody else to die,

51
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,040
then let the professional handle it.

52
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,259
Now, now, Wakita-san and Amuro-kun.

53
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,349
I'm sure they're just panicking because their friend was killed.

54
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,999
Let's remain calm, notify the Nagano police, and ask them for instructions.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,039
Yes, Master.

56
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,380
You're right.

57
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,230
They're beginning to resemble vice-shogun Mito Komon and his samurai retainers.

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,700
What? Someone was killed?

59
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,189
What the hell are you doing?

60
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,360
I didn't kill him.

61
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,530
What's your situation?

62
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,789
According to the license on the body,

63
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,290
the victim is Wada Kohei-san, 28 years old.

64
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:21,170
A crossbow was rigged to fire when the bathroom cabinet was opened.

65
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,550
It hit Wada-san right in the head.

66
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,989
I don't understand.

67
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,429
Why was a crossbow set up in the bathroom?

68
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,490
It was a trap set by whoever invited us here.

69
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,319
In any case, we'll preserve the crime scene.

70
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,940
I'll fill you in on the details when you come for us tomorrow.

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Then take a video of the crime scene and send it to us.

72
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,950
Wow, that's awful.

73
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,210
Right between the eyebrows.

74
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,909
He's a rather unlucky victim.

75
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,710
If the culprit knew this man would open the cabinet,

76
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,650
it would've been possible to aim for his forehead.

77
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,240
But didn't Mori-san say they drew lots to determine who would search where?

78
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,810
That's why it's if the culprit knew.

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,179
Could you rewind the video a bit?

80
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,240
What? To here?

81
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,980
This blond man behind him.

82
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,610
I've seen him before somewhere...

83
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,510
The culprit who invited you all here

84
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,969
and killed Wada-san is probably trying to get revenge

85
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:51,510
for Nichihara Taisei-san who committed suicide here two months ago.

86
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,189
Seriously?

87
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,379
I knew it. And Wada was killed, just like I expected.

88
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,899
Raito, hey.

89
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,270
You're being indiscreet.

90
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,650
Sorry.

91
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,380
Just like he expected?

92
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,749
So, who's the culprit?

93
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:17,660
We don't know if the culprit is one of you or hiding in the abandoned church.

94
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,040
We don't even know if their revenge is over after killing that man.

95
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,539
Y-You mean they're trying to kill us, too?

96
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,670
We won't be able to go to the bathroom alone.

97
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,399
So I have a suggestion.

98
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,180
Why don't we form pairs?

99
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,430
We can act in pairs at all times with someone we trust.

100
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,159
Pairs. That's a good idea.

101
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,299
But I'm the only woman.

102
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,579
Then why don't you two form a pair?

103
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,480
You used to date a long time ago.

104
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,490
Yeah, but the person you pair up with could be the culprit.

105
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,869
The culprit invited a detective here.

106
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,000
They wouldn't do anything to expose themselves as the murderer, like killing their partner.

107
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,459
Then I'll pair up with Ikue. Is that okay?

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,500
Sure.

109
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,239
Then I'll pair up with Nishino, right?

110
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,719
Sure, no problem.

111
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,809
Then I'll pair up with Conan-kun.

112
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,510
Okay.

113
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,519
Then I'm with the master. Is that all right?

114
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,560
Sure.

115
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,440
We'll go to the bathroom first.

116
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,660
Don't do anything without checking in with the others.

117
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,990
Hey, Amuro-san. Have you figured out who the culprit is?

118
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,120
No.

119
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,380
Since we drew lots to determine who would search this room,

120
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,509
for the time being, we can only assume it was a coincidence

121
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,630
that Wada-san was killed in this bathroom.

122
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,929
It could be that there are other traps,

123
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,219
and the culprit intends to kill everyone here at random,

124
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,020
and anyone could have set up this crossbow beforehand.

125
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,139
But it struck Wada-san here because he's tall.

126
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,789
If it had been Ikue-san, who's short, then it wouldn't have hit her.

127
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,400
Exactly.

128
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,590
But there was nothing suspicious about the way we drew lots.

129
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,160
Also, I have an odd question for you.

130
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,790
RUM...

131
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,760
You know who they are, don't you?

132
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,380
Where did you get that information?

133
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,420
Have you met them?

134
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,690
I'm not sure how to answer that question.

135
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,219
If I tell you I've met them,

136
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,820
then I assume you'll begin investigating everyone associated with me.

137
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,959
And if I say I haven't,

138
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,430
then you'll be unnecessarily cautious around anyone who approaches either me or you.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,180
Yeah.

140
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,460
Either way, it doesn't benefit me.

141
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,500
I suppose all I can tell you is that they're very impatient.

142
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,120
Impatient?

143
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,949
It's really starting to come down.

144
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,729
I'm not sure they'll be able to come get us tomorrow.

145
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,230
That's not good. Our water is limited.

146
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,959
You've always drunk too much water.

147
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,509
Could I get something to drink?

148
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,490
Sure.

149
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,439
Did anyone just hear an odd noise?

150
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,599
Sounded like glass breaking.

151
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,750
It came from the building next door that we were just in.

152
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,039
I-Is there someone hiding in there after all?

153
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,209
Someone go check. I won't be able to sleep like this.

154
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,760
But we were told not to act on our own.

155
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,219
Then why don't we send one pair to check things out?

156
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,640
If there's two of us, I'm sure we can handle whatever's out there.

157
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,640
You're right.

158
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,020
I don't think that's a good idea.

159
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,170
Yeah.

160
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:18,780
This blizzard probably blew something into one of the church's glass windows.

161
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,609
Maybe we should go check.

162
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,849
How will we decide which pair is going?

163
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,119
Rock-paper-scissors should be fine.

164
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,040
No way. I suck at rock-paper-scissors.

165
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,709
Ikue, you brought a dozen mint cases, right?

166
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,620
Could I get a few of those?

167
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,190
We'll use three of those cases and empty two of them.

168
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,419
These two empty cases that don't make noise are safe.

169
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,820
Choose the case that does make noise, and you're out.

170
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,320
The pair that chooses the noisy case goes to check things out. How's that sound?

171
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,700
Since I'm the one who suggested it, my pair will take whichever case is leftover.

172
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,460
Go ahead.

173
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,529
Master, since you know which one not to choose, go ahead.

174
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,500
You can count on me.

175
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,210
Hup.

176
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
Let's see...

177
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,779
It's empty.

178
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,730
I knew you could do it, Master!

179
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,330
Mine's empty, too.

180
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,089
I guess we'll go check things out, then.

181
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,270
I guess so.

182
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:56,040
We heard the sound of breaking glass, too.

183
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,960
You had someone go check on the situation?

184
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,210
Yeah. We tried to stop them.

185
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,880
Who was it?!

186
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,640
Who texted Kawasaki?!

187
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,939
Texted him?

188
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,510
Not me.

189
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,980
When he saw that text, his expression changed and he headed to the bath.

190
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,009
Wasn't that Kawasaki's voice?

191
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,920
You said he headed to the bath, right?

192
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,430
K-Kawasaki-san.

193
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,080
Hey, hang in there.

194
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,810
Hey. Hey!

195
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,960
Hey!

196
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,620
Poison?

197
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,850
Judging by his breath, his must've consumed a cyanide poison.

198
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,829
But the water in the bottle at his feet isn't producing a oxidation-reduction reaction.

199
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,110
The poison wasn't in his water.

200
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,490
Then how?

201
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,660
It wasn't me.

202
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,780
It's that code again.

203
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,120
If this code was left here,

204
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:31,900
then that might mean these murders aren't over yet.

205
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,890
Damn it.

206
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,869
My phone doesn't have service.

207
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:56,290
We can't get in touch with the Nagano police when two people are dead.

208
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,449
This blizzard must have knocked out a cell tower.

209
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,059
B-But why Kawasaki?

210
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,300
Was he really poisoned?

211
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,590
Yes.

212
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:12,939
Either someone forced him to take the cyanide,

213
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,310
or else he was convinced to consume it.

214
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,630
Then there really is someone besides us hiding in this abandoned church.

215
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:30,700
After all, there wasn't any poison in the water in the bottle beside him, right?

216
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,279
Someone must've forced the poison inside his mouth

217
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,580
and made him swallow it using that water.

218
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,580
Maybe.

219
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,279
Kawasaki was a clean-freak.

220
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,610
Even if the poison was mixed into something, he would've been too cautious to drink it.

221
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,429
He did drink constantly, though, as long as it was water.

222
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,199
Just water?

223
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,970
He once collapsed from dehydration during practice.

224
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,350
Since then, he started drinking water all the time.

225
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,129
He'd chug some water after using the bathroom, cleaning, or attending class.

226
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,199
It was practically a habit.

227
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,780
Yeah.

228
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,100
Yeah, but...

229
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,620
If the poison was forced into his mouth and washed down with water,

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,309
then the water should have spilled from the corners of his mouth or been spit out.

231
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,380
But the area around his mouth and neck isn't wet at all.

232
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,750
Was he really forced to drink a poison?

233
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,880
If not, then he must've been convinced to drink it

234
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,950
by one of you.

235
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,229
Come to think of it,

236
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:47,310
didn't you say the victim Kawasaki-san received a text from someone on his phone?

237
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,129
Y-Yeah.

238
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,450
When he saw it, his expression changed, and he ran towards the bath.

239
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,219
I don't know if he really didn't want me to see the text

240
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,699
or if he didn't want me

241
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,780
to overhear the conversation he was going to have with whoever texted him.

242
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,710
Then maybe we can figure something out by examining his phone.

243
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,100
Indeed.

244
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,470
Since this phone seems to use a fingerprint lock...

245
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,250
Excuse me.

246
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,870
We'll borrow the body's finger.

247
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,350
He certainly did receive a text earlier.

248
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,110
Let's see. What does it say?

249
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,900
"You promised you'd take that secret to the grave, traitor..."

250
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,839
Does anyone know what secret this is referring to?

251
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,540
D-Dunno.

252
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,460
I'm curious to know why he called him a traitor, too.

253
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,739
I have no idea what any of that means.

254
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,089
What's the sender's address?

255
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,470
Couldn't we use that to determine who sent that creepy message?

256
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,350
Then let's take a look at everyone's addresses.

257
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,030
We'll compare them to the address of whoever sent this creepy text.

258
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,110
Hey, what's going on here?

259
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,990
All three of your addresses are different from the culprit's.

260
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,390
Then who sent the text?

261
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,249
If someone had multiple addresses,

262
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,369
they could delete the address they used to text Kawasaki-san.

263
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,130
Or else someone secretly has a second phone,

264
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,630
or there really is another person hiding

265
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,490
somewhere in this abandoned church.

266
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,270
Then maybe we do have to solve them.

267
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,900
The ones we were first sent, the one stuck to the chapel door,

268
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,280
the ones in the rooms we searched,

269
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
and the one we found next to Kawasaki-san's body.

270
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,420
These four codes.

271
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:09,290
They do seem related to Nichihara Taisei-san who committed suicide here.

272
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,799
Was Nichihara-san your classmate, too?

273
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,389
Y-Yeah.

274
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,670
Then you must've had more in common, right?

275
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,479
For example, did you guys secretly get up to any shady business together in high school?

276
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,050
No.

277
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,190
The only other thing we have in common is that Wada who was killed first in the toilet

278
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,060
and Kawasaki who was just poisoned in the bath

279
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,190
attended Shinano University with Fujide.

280
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,289
Shinano University is a prestigious school.

281
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,310
I suppose it is...

282
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,480
Huh?

283
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,950
There's something stuck to the indentation on the phone.

284
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,580
You're right.

285
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,340
It's some kind of gel.

286
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,430
This smell...

287
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,120
It's honey.

288
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,559
What's it doing on this phone?

289
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,310
You two seem to be rather close friends.

290
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,690
Yeah, I guess so.

291
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:24,200
But we only run into each other occasionally at Mori-sensei's detective agency.

292
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,950
You seem awfully close considering.

293
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,460
And the kid with the glasses seems pretty smart.

294
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,219
He's just copying Mori-sensei's detective work.

295
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,720
It's just the shallow wit of a child.

296
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,720
Huh.

297
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,640
I'm excited to see how he turns out.

298
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,190
Still?

299
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,889
They still can't clear the tunnel leading to that abandoned church?

300
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,750
Yeah.

301
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:09,120
I'm having them prioritize, but still...

302
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,479
Damn.

303
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,169
I hope nothing terrible is happening up there.

304
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,160
That blond man...

305
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,620
I believe I met him

306
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,189
while my brother Hiromitsu was attending Toto University

307
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,670
and staying with relatives in Tokyo.

308
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,600
I was waiting for my brother in a café.

309
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,590
Yes,

310
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,570
the friend my brother brought with him was...

311
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,200
Brother.

312
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,070
This is my friend Furuya Rei-kun.

313
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,270
He wants to become a police officer like you and me.

314
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,930
Rei... Zero?

315
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,460
Is he the one who sent me my brother's phone with the hole in it?

316
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,420
Hello?

317
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,149
It's been a while, Yamato.

318
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,050
First Division Chief Kuroda?

319
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,550
Idiot, I'm not your section chief anymore.

320
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,920
Put Morofushi on the phone.

321
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,560
I've got a question for him.

322
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,700
For Komei?

323
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,340
What's wrong? Hurry up and put him on.

324
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,770
Three hours...

325
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,860
