1
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:06,219
An old pot is found in the storeroom of Dr. Agasa's house.

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:08,419
Wanting the pot to be appraised,

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,419
Doc uploaded the pot on a video site,

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:12,619
but who would've known that doing

5
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,819
so would lead to an incident like this.

6
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:17,619
While we were out buying groceries to make curry,

7
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:18,619
we got home to find that Dr. Agasa

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,019
was fainted after being attacked with a stun gun,

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:23,019
and that Ayumi had been kidnapped.

10
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:26,819
At first we thought that somebody had come after the pot,

11
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,719
but the pot was found left behind.

12
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,319
And, instead, the carpet that was found together

13
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,619
with the pot was gone.

14
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,619
It seems to have been used to carry Ayumi out.

15
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:39,919
Mail sent by the culprit was eventually received.

16
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:40,919
It demanded that the cat that was shown

17
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:42,419
in the attachment be searched for,

18
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:45,619
and that Ayumi will be kept hostage in exchange for the cat.

19
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:49,619
We split up to look for the cat, but to no avail.

20
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:50,719
It's getting close to sundown

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,019
and we were starting to get panicky

22
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,619
when the culprit sent us another mail.

23
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,419
It said that they had found the cat on their own

24
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:58,019
so they would be releasing Ayumi.

25
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,219
Ayumi was found safe,

26
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,519
but what on earth was the culprit after anyway.

27
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,619
If all cases were men,

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,519
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

29
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,919
Glimpses of the Organization are here and there.

30
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:31,119
Could they be after the pot, the cat or Haibara?

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,619
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,519
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,919
His name is Detective Conan.

34
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:07,319
"Doc's Video Site (Part 2)"

35
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:12,294
In other words, the cat keeper of some rich person,

36
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,419
carelessly makes the cat get away and panics.

37
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,437
Then, wanting to get the cat back,

38
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:21,337
he commits a kidnapping case.

39
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,037
But, it ends up being a stupid story

40
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,037
where the keeper eventually finds the cat on his own.

41
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,137
But if so, he should've just truthfully said,

42
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:28,837
"Since it's my master's cat,

43
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,937
if you find it, please return it".

44
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:35,237
I wonder. If people find out that his master is super rich,

45
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:37,437
maybe he was afraid that an exorbitant reward would be demanded

46
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:40,437
and that his master would find out that the cat got away.

47
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:43,837
No, I don't think it's that simple of a case.

48
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:46,637
No matter if we went out shopping,

49
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:50,637
unless the culprit knew that only Doc and Ayumi were staying back home,

50
00:03:50,637 --> 00:03:52,737
it's unthinkable that he would try to break in

51
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:54,837
with just a stun gun.

52
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:58,837
Besides, we were gone for only less than 30 minutes.

53
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:01,537
If it was a house that he were entering for the first time,

54
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:04,337
do you think he could've made Doc faint,

55
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:07,337
then check to see if the cat was anywhere in the house,

56
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:12,137
wrap Ayumi in the carpet and carry her out?

57
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:13,937
In addition, the culprit also found Doc

58
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:15,837
and Ayumi's cell phones too.

59
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:18,037
Then don't tell me that the culprit...

60
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:22,237
Yeah, he knew, that Doc and Haibara were living here,

61
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,637
just the two of them together in this house.

62
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:28,237
And that we four came over here to play often too.

63
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:31,737
As well as the fact that all of us have cell phones too.

64
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:34,237
But, how did they get that information?

65
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:37,837
Didn't anyone you don't know recently come over?

66
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,637
Come to think of it, yes.

67
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:40,937
About 3 groups of people.

68
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:42,037
3 groups?

69
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:44,437
You see, they came after seeing

70
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:46,637
the video site that I just showed you.

71
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:47,637
And?

72
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:50,237
What kind of people did the 3 groups consist of?

73
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:55,137
The first group was a young pair of sisters.

74
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:57,237
They lifted the pot, tapped on it

75
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:58,937
and kept staring at it for a while

76
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:01,837
but, they asked me to sell it to them for 500 yen.

77
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:06,237
500 yen? Is that pot so invaluable?

78
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:08,637
I asked the same question too.

79
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,237
They weren't sure either,

80
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:11,937
but it seems that at the cost of 500 yen,

81
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,737
they thought they could use it as a flower pot.

82
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:17,437
They asked me to check on it in more detail,

83
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:19,737
but they left saying that their legs went numb.

84
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,737
Was the pot left on the floor?

85
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:25,037
Yeah. On top of that carpet.

86
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:27,837
I thought it would look nicer that way.

87
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:30,637
The next group that came was a middle-aged couple.

88
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:32,037
They carefully checked the pot

89
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:35,237
using a magnifying glass without touching the pot at all.

90
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,637
And? What did they say?

91
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,037
They told me that maybe it could be a very valuable pot,

92
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:45,837
so to take it to a legitimate appraiser.

93
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:48,037
They also told me that there may be people

94
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:49,837
who'd want to buy it at an unreasonably cheap price

95
00:05:49,837 --> 00:05:53,837
so that it may be better if I don't show it too much to others.

96
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:56,237
Then, what about the 3rd group?

97
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:58,837
They were a very rude father and son!

98
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:01,837
After touching the pot just a little and looking inside it

99
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,837
the son asked, "How much do you think this is?"

100
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:06,937
He said so, with a grin on his face

101
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:09,537
so I got upset and said, "It's about 500,000 yen!"

102
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:12,037
I told him that I'll give him the carpet along with it

103
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,137
if he bought it now.

104
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:16,337
The father said, "You've gotta be joking".

105
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:17,737
The son also said laughing,

106
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:20,237
"I pity people who don't have an eye for things".

107
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:22,537
So I got angry and kicked them out of the house!

108
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:26,837
And? Was Haibara close to you then?

109
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:31,237
No, the three groups came while Ai was in school, you see.

110
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:34,137
Come to think of it.

111
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:35,937
There was someone who asked a lot about Ai,

112
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,437
including what time she comes back from school,

113
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,937
about her friends,

114
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:42,437
or about what she usually does on Saturdays and Sundays.

115
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,937
Isn't that person the culprit?

116
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,837
Don't you remember who it was?

117
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:52,137
No... I think it was someone among the three groups though.

118
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,937
Wasn't there anyone among

119
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:56,237
the three groups that asked about a cat?

120
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:59,737
Especially someone who asked about this Russian Blue?

121
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:03,337
It was mostly talk about the pot, you see.

122
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:05,637
Russian Blue?

123
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:09,837
If I remember correctly, Ran's mother also has a Russian Blue.

124
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:11,037
If it's a pot and cat,

125
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,637
you can find it on a pot-cat video site, right?

126
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:14,137
What's that?

127
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:17,737
The cat going inside the pot is really cute.

128
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:19,837
Hey, Doc!

129
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:22,337
What did name the title of the video you uploaded?

130
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:23,937
If I remember correctly...

131
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:25,337
I think it was, "Although this pot is like casting pearls before swine,

132
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:26,637
that is, throwing gold before cats for me,

133
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,837
I would like to have it appraised".

134
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:32,437
If so, we can search for videos concerning cats and pots.

135
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:37,737
I found it. It's Ran's mother's video.

136
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:41,137
It's one above Doc's video site.

137
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:43,137
It's a cat pot!

138
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:46,037
No, don't go in there.

139
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:47,437
How cute!

140
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:50,637
Goro chan, say hi to everyone!

141
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:55,837
Hey, doesn't that cat look like the culprit's cat?

142
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:58,737
True, even the background looks similar!

143
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:01,637
But how come Ms. Kisaki's cat...

144
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:06,637
There's no reason that she would pass me out with a stun gun, is there?

145
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:11,437
Wait. I wonder why the culprit didn't use the stun gun on Ayumi?

146
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,537
If he passed her out like he did Doc,

147
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:17,337
he wouldn't have had to change his voice using helium gas.

148
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:19,037
I wonder why?

149
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:24,237
There something on your ear.

150
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,837
This is when I tried to run from the culprit,

151
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:30,537
coffee spilled, and I was pushed downward on it

152
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:33,837
so that's why I got coffee on my hood.

153
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:37,337
You sure got a lot of coffee on your hood.

154
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:39,837
When I was wrapped around with the carpet,

155
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,237
the coffee came soaking all the way up to my ear

156
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:45,037
and really felt gooey!

157
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:47,837
I'm sorry I got your clothes dirty, Ai.

158
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:51,837
No problem, I can get it clean by washing it.

159
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,337
I see. So in other words,

160
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:58,237
the culprit's target was neither Haibara, the pot nor the cat.

161
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,137
So, what do you intend to do about this case then?

162
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:03,237
Are you going to report it to the police anyway?

163
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:04,537
I guess so

164
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,837
since it's a fact that Ayumi was kidnapped too.

165
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:10,437
But, I wonder if they'd believe us?

166
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,537
A story like two people wearing caps

167
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:14,237
suddenly break into the house,

168
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:16,437
make Doc faint using a stun gun,

169
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:20,237
wrap Ayumi inside the carpet and carry her off.

170
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,637
Moreover, that the purpose of the culprit

171
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:24,537
was for us to find the cat owned by his master

172
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,537
that ran away near here.

173
00:09:26,537 --> 00:09:27,937
True.

174
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:30,237
The two kidnappers sent us mail demanding for us

175
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,037
to look for their cat

176
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:34,337
from the cell phone they stole from Dr. Agasa.

177
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:38,037
And that mail was sent to Ayumi's cell phone

178
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,937
that was inside the pot.

179
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:41,637
On top of that, both kidnappers

180
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:43,937
had changed their voices with helium gas

181
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,537
and we've got no clue.

182
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:47,737
I'm sure that Ayumi who was wrapped in the carpet

183
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:50,937
wouldn't have had an idea of where she was taken to

184
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,837
nor how she got back either.

185
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:55,137
But, Ayumi, you said

186
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,637
that they let you out of the carpet once

187
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,937
and let you drink water, right?

188
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:01,337
Weren't you at the culprits' hide out?

189
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:04,337
It was dark and I couldn't see well,

190
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,737
but it seems that I was in a moving car or something.

191
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:13,637
The only clue that we have is this image of the cat

192
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:15,837
that the culprit demanded us to look for, but...

193
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:17,937
Since it looks exactly like the image of the cat

194
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:21,137
that Ms. Kisaki had uploaded on her site.

195
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,137
It could be that they borrowed

196
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,937
the image of the same type of cat

197
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:28,237
and sent it to us.

198
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:31,037
But, somebody may have witnessed

199
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,437
suspicious people carrying out the carpet,

200
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:36,437
so I think we should contact the police either way.

201
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:40,337
Why don't we call them after we make the curry?

202
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:43,637
I mean, I'm really starving.

203
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:45,037
I guess so.

204
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:47,637
Okay, I guess I'll go take a bath then.

205
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:50,337
Because my ear is still stained with coffee.

206
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:51,637
Hold it!

207
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:54,837
I'm sorry, but will you take a bath

208
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:56,837
after the culprits are arrested.

209
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,637
Because that coffee stain is important evidence

210
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:04,337
that shows that the culprit pushed you down on the stain,

211
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:07,137
rendered you helpless, wrapped you in the carpet

212
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:09,237
and carried you away, you see.

213
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:14,137
What? You mean I can't take a bath until the culprits are caught?

214
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:17,337
Well, it'll only be a little while.

215
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:19,437
Because we're going to raid

216
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:20,937
the culprits' place together starting now.

217
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:21,937
What?

218
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:25,037
Are you saying that you figured out who the culprits are?

219
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:29,037
Yeah, it's probably somebody that you know, Doc.

220
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:32,637
Somebody I know?

221
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,566
Somebody I know?

222
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,866
Don't tell me that you're saying that Ms. Kisaki is the culprit.

223
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,566
No.

224
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:48,666
Just as you said the image of that cat

225
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,366
was one that the culprit sent at random.

226
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:55,466
And, it just happened to be Attorney Kisaki's cat.

227
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,266
At random?

228
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,166
You mean the culprit didn't kidnap Ayumi

229
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,866
in order to search for the cat?

230
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,666
No, anything would've been fine.

231
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,566
As long as they had something that sounded appropriate enough

232
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,366
to carry Ayumi out of the house

233
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,666
after wrapping her in the carpet.

234
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,966
You mean, they demanded the cat to be searched for

235
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,966
just as a make-shift reason?

236
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:20,666
Yeah. Don't you think it's strange?

237
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,566
Doc was shot with a stun gun that fainted him and yet

238
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:27,266
all they did to Ayumi was seal her mouth with masking tape.

239
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,366
Thanks to that, we found out from the conversation of the culprits

240
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:32,566
that they came here to look for the cat that ran away,

241
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,966
and that they had no choice

242
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,566
but to wrap Ayumi in a carpet

243
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:39,766
in order to make us search for that cat.

244
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:43,466
But, if they made Ayumi faint like they did to Doc,

245
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,966
to begin with, they wouldn't have had

246
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:47,466
to change their voices using helium gas, did they?

247
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,866
I guess so.

248
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:51,966
In spite of that, the only reason for them doing so would've been

249
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:56,166
because the culprits wanted Ayumi to hear their conversation.

250
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,466
They did so in order to distract everyone

251
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:01,666
from the fact that they were actually after the carpet.

252
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,466
What? The carpet?

253
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:06,866
You mean that old looking carpet is expensive?

254
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:09,266
No, I'm pretty sure that this is cheap stuff.

255
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,366
Then, why?

256
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,766
Like Doc was saying just a while ago.

257
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,366
Although the back side of the carpet was stained,

258
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:18,466
the front had no stains what so ever on it when it was returned.

259
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,966
While Ayumi was wrapped in the carpet,

260
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,766
the coffee that soaked through her hood

261
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,966
stained her ear too, you know.

262
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:28,666
Then, shouldn't there be a coffee stain somewhere on the carpet?

263
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,566
However, the fact that there is no such stain anywhere means...

264
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:32,866
I see.

265
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:36,966
They switched the carpet when they let Ayumi drink water.

266
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,166
Yeah.

267
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,266
They let Ayuymi out of the carpet once in the dark

268
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:44,366
so that she wouldn't realize that they switched the carpet.

269
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,066
I'm sure that they had another carpet

270
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,166
that looked similar to this one inside their car beforehand,

271
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,366
so that they could switch it right away.

272
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:54,466
But then they didn't have to go as far as to kidnap Ayumi, did they?

273
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,866
Right! All they had to do was steal the carpet!

274
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,466
I see!

275
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:00,966
If the carpet were stolen,

276
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,366
it would be reported to the police as such,

277
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,666
so they wouldn't be able to sell it off even if they wanted to.

278
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:10,766
Yeah. The pattern of the carpet is clearly shown on your video too.

279
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,966
But, I don't think I have any acquaintances

280
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:15,166
that would do something like that around me.

281
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:19,066
It could be someone that you recently met just once.

282
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,966
Recently?

283
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,366
Don't tell me it's the one who came to appraise that pot.

284
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:24,466
Yeah.

285
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:27,266
Or the sisters who were lifting the pot,

286
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,566
touching it and staring at it for a while,

287
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,066
the couple who were carefully checking the pot using a magnifying glass

288
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,566
without touching it at all.

289
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,266
Or, the father and son who were told by you

290
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,266
that you would sell the pot along with the carpet for 500,000 yen

291
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:40,766
and laughed about it.

292
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:43,366
That would make the last father and son suspicious.

293
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,866
Yes. I'm sure they knew the real value of the carpet

294
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:48,366
and wanted to buy it at an even lower price.

295
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:49,966
No, just the opposite.

296
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:53,066
They laughed because Doc mentioned a price that was much too cheap.

297
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,666
Judging from the fact that they wanted

298
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,366
to get a hold of your carpet despite

299
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,866
having to kidnap a child means that your carpet

300
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,566
was probably a Persian carpet.

301
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,766
It's said that not one carpet has the same pattern

302
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:03,866
and depending on the carpet,

303
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:06,266
it could easily range over 10 million yen.

304
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,466
What? Ten million yen?

305
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,266
It's true that looking at the pattern of aging

306
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:12,566
on the outside and inside of the object in question,

307
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:14,766
is one way of appraisal,

308
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:18,166
but the father and son had an eye for antiques

309
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,366
because they could tell the value by just a slight touch

310
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,366
and quick look inside the pot.

311
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:24,066
I'm sure they could tell right off that it was a Persian carpet,

312
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,266
but they aren't the culprits.

313
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:27,566
Why?

314
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,166
If they went as far as to cause an incident like this

315
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,366
just to get a hold of the carpet,

316
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:32,666
there's no reason why they wouldn't go

317
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,566
for an offer of 500,000 yen, is there?

318
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,266
Then, you mean the very first pair of sisters who came here is the culprit?

319
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:41,066
Why isn't it the couple that came here second?

320
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,466
Of course not.

321
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:44,966
Because the couple kindly told me

322
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:46,866
that the pot may be valuable

323
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,366
so to show it to an appraiser.

324
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,666
They were referring to the pot, weren't they?

325
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,066
Besides, to put it accurately,

326
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:56,666
they recommended you to take it over to an appraiser

327
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,766
to get it appraised, didn't they?

328
00:15:58,766 --> 00:15:59,766
Yeah.

329
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,666
On second thought, they could be telling you

330
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,066
not to call anyone here anymore because they don't want anyone

331
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:07,866
to realize that it is a Persian carpet, right?

332
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,066
Besides, contrary to the sisters who raised

333
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,166
the pot up and stared at it for a while,

334
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,466
the couple didn't touch the pot even once

335
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:16,566
and checked it with a magnifying glass, right?

336
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,766
Yeah, that's right.

337
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,866
The sisters who had their minds only on the pot, would've done so,

338
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:24,066
but not so for the couple.

339
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,866
If you had the pot on the carpet,

340
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,666
they could've seen the carpet through the magnifying glass, right?

341
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:33,266
I see! The thing that the couple was checking...

342
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:35,166
Was the pattern of the carpet.

343
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,566
They were not only checking

344
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:39,366
if it was a real Persian carpet,

345
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,966
but also confirming whether it was the really the carpet

346
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,466
that they were looking for.

347
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,566
They probably saw the carpet once somewhere

348
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:50,666
and were dying to have it.

349
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,466
Otherwise, they would never jump

350
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:56,266
at something they coincidentally saw at a video site.

351
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,266
Then, they used the excuse of appraising the pot

352
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,666
and came here to check out the carpet.

353
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,266
They found out that Doc not only didn't know the value of the pot,

354
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:05,766
but neither he have any knowledge of the value of the carpet.

355
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:07,266
I'm sure that after finding out that just Haibara

356
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:11,866
and you were living here together, they thought up the crime.

357
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:16,066
But, how are we going to pinpoint where the culprits are?

358
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,766
Judging from the fact that they didn't want Ayumi

359
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,966
to recognize their voices,

360
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:23,266
it's most likely that they are running a store near here.

361
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,066
We can probably find them quite easily

362
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:27,066
if we narrow the shops down to those that sell carpets.

363
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:30,966
Yes, yes, I'm already doing so.

364
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,766
I found it.

365
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:35,766
Interior shop Kanbe on 3rd Avenue.

366
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:37,866
It seems that they carry carpets too.

367
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:41,166
The president's face also seems to be on the website,

368
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,366
but is he the one?

369
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,766
That's right. It's him.

370
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,666
No mistake about it.

371
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,466
Bingo.

372
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,766
If I remember correctly, you're...

373
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:02,466
It's amazing how you found my residence.

374
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:04,466
When I went to your shop last week,

375
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:05,766
I was told that you were off from work

376
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:08,966
because of a cold, you see.

377
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:10,266
But, judging from the looks of it,

378
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,666
it seems you've completely recovered already.

379
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,766
Huh? Oh, no.

380
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,566
I still have a bit of cough.

381
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:20,266
By the way, what brings you here?

382
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,366
I heard that your shop carries carpets too,

383
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:26,666
so I wanted you to look at the carpet I have.

384
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,766
I see.

385
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:30,466
And, who are those children?

386
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:35,866
I couldn't bring it here alone so I had them help me.

387
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:44,866
It's very well made but...

388
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:47,166
It seems to be fake.

389
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,566
Just as I thought, after all.

390
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:53,766
Well, there are many fake Persian carpets going around.

391
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,166
Then, is this carpet

392
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,066
that is standing against the wall authentic?

393
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,266
Yeah. That one's authentic.

394
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,466
There something stuck between the carpet.

395
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:07,066
It looks to be a picture.

396
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,866
A picture of what?

397
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,366
This is...

398
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:14,066
It's a picture of a carpet!

399
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,966
It looks just like Doc's carpet.

400
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,966
But why would a picture like this be here?

401
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:19,666
Oh... well...

402
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,766
My wife is a bit of a scatterbrain, you see.

403
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,566
Right?

404
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,466
Well... Yes!

405
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:29,366
I always get newspapers and stuff stuck in between.

406
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,366
I thought that you rushed and folded the carpet

407
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:34,866
because Doc came home while you were comparing the carpet with the picture,

408
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:37,066
so it got stuck in between,

409
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:40,466
but I guess it was just my imagination.

410
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,466
Let's try spreading it out then!

411
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:44,866
Yes!

412
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,666
Hold it!

413
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:52,966
Oh, my. It looks just like Doc's carpet.

414
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:55,866
But, it seems the pattern is a bit different?

415
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:59,766
It seems that the carpet in the picture is this one.

416
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,466
Oh goodness!

417
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,266
There's ear shaped stain.

418
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:08,766
Judging from the smell. It seems to be coffee.

419
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,166
My wife did that too.

420
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,766
Because I'm a scatterbrain, I was rushing and...

421
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:15,866
Don't you know?

422
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,466
The shape of an ear is called an ear print

423
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:23,966
and like fingerprints there is no one person with the same prints.

424
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,266
So, I'm sure that if we match the stain

425
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:29,466
with Ayumi's ear print, it'll readily become obvious...

426
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,666
that you're the ones, the kidnappers,

427
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,366
who wrapped Ayumi in this carpet.

428
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,766
What's with you?

429
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:41,766
Who the hell are you?

430
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,566
Conan Edogawa.

431
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:45,166
A detective.

432
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,866
After a while, the police arrived

433
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:51,866
and the kidnappers were taken to the police.

434
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,866
It seems that the carpet that Doc had belonged

435
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:56,566
to a certain tycoon, but since he passed away,

436
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,266
his bereaved family who received the carpet as a keepsake,

437
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,666
seem to have passed it on from person to person,

438
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,266
where it ended up at Doc's place.

439
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:06,066
The kidnapper couple seems to have

440
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,866
worked on the interior of that tycoon too.

441
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,566
And after hearing that his bereaved family unaware

442
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,766
of the value of the carpet sold it off,

443
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,966
had been pursuing its whereabouts.

444
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:17,066
They happened to find the carpet

445
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:20,866
because Mrs. Kanbe was hooked on the "Pot Cat Video Site".

446
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:23,166
They seem to have come up with their scheme when they saw the girl

447
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,466
that was reflected on the lens of his glasses,

448
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:27,966
and when they found Attorney Kisaki's cat one above Doc's video site,

449
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:30,166
they decided to use it to get a hold of the carpet they were dying to have.

450
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:34,066
That seems to have been the motive for the crime they committed.

451
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:37,166
By the way, after finding out that he owned

452
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,066
a genuine Persian carpet, Doc was delighted.

453
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,766
However, he was disappointed to hear that

454
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,266
he would only get the carpet back

455
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:43,666
after the incident and trial of the case end,

456
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,866
which would take several months.

457
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:48,366
His dream of wanting to purchase a new Beetle

458
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,566
would have to wait for a while now.

459
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,966
But I wonder if everything will be okay?

460
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:56,266
What?

461
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:59,266
My reflection that was on Doc's glasses.

462
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:01,566
It's been distributed throughout the world, wasn't it?

463
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:03,066
No problem!

464
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,266
That video site has already been deleted,

465
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,566
and besides the kidnapper also said that

466
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:09,066
he coincidentally saw you only

467
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:12,366
when he zoomed in on the pattern of the carpet.

468
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:17,466
Hold it. How did she find Haibara's image?

469
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:45,566
Delete...

470
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:49,666
Delete.

471
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:55,066
If it's data it can be deleted right away, but...

472
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:03,066
"Next Episode" -A world renown chocolatier and...

473
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,566
A beautiful shop producer join to create.

474
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:07,666
A love-romance Chocolate.

00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:14,666
Now, we shall take you ladies and gentlemen

476
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,666
beyond the world of dreams to the distant Milky Way.

477
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,566
Everybody, outside!

478
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:24,466
Conan!

479
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:25,766
Next Conan,

480
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:29,966
"Hot Chocolate Trap"

481
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,566

483

In the next episode super delicious chocolate will make an appearance!

484
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,566
I'd like to have a taste of it too.
