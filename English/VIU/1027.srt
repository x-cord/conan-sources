1
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:07,258
Wow!

2
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:09,397
It looks so good!

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:10,608
Yeah!

4
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:13,137
Shall we eat?

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,418
Thanks for the food!

6
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:24,407
By the way, why aren't Conan and Haibara here?

7
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:29,747
Ai-chan has a TV show she wants to watch, and Conan-kun's home alone at the detective agency.

8
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:33,277
It's too bad they couldn't come with us.

9
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,388
Yeah.

10
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:35,988
Yeah.

11
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,768
Everyone, look at that.

12
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:42,018
Huh?

13
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:04,627
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

14
00:01:04,628 --> 00:01:06,248
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

15
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:08,457
A vanishing case witnessed as a silhouette!

16
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,207
Cast a bright light on it and you'll find the culprit!

17
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,807
Always determining the one truth

18
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:13,457
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

19
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,138
his name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:50,768
"Beyond the Curtain!"

21
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,408
A man and a woman?

22
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:01,807
You can see their silhouettes so clearly.

23
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:03,908
They look like shadow puppets.

24
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:07,157
Do you suppose they're eating?

25
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:09,168
They're probably throwing a party.

26
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,428
Things seem to be going well between them.

27
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,677
Wait, are they...

28
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:22,307
C-C-C-Could it be?

29
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:23,437
K-Kissing?

30
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:27,687
Like I said, things are going excellently!

31
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:31,438
H-H-H-Hey! This isn't appropriate for children's eyes!

32
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:37,448
Huh?

33
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:43,328
Wh-What's going on?!

34
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:45,517
Aren't they making up?

35
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,657
They're clearly fighting.

36
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:48,578
Oh, no!

37
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,588
Call the police immediately!

38
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,198
He's here.

39
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:04,598
Hurry, officer!

40
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:10,298
Yes?

41
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,577
Excuse me, I'm with the police.

42
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,877
Could I have a few minutes of your time?

43
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:18,238
What do the police want with me?

44
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,167
Well, someone reported that they saw a man

45
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:26,228
attacking a woman inside your home through the curtains.

46
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:30,447
They saw a man attacking a woman through the curtains?

47
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:33,917
In that case, I have a large pet dog.

48
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,607
Perhaps that's what Chocolat playing with me looked like through the curtains.

49
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,177
That's not what happened!

50
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:43,758
That wasn't a dog. It was a man.

51
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:48,578
What do you think? Could I take a look around inside?

52
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:54,268
Very well. In that case, officer, would it be all right if you only you came in?

53
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:58,067
I don't want strangers looking around inside my home.

54
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,308
Understood.

55
00:05:11,618 --> 00:05:14,038
That way! They went that way!

56
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,418
Don't let them escape!

57
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,048
Over there! Hurry!

58
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,548
You're not getting away!

59
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:22,548
Conan-kun.

60
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:25,968
Ayumi-chan? What happened, guys?

61
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,968
We'd like to get your advice on a situation.

62
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:30,588
Advice?

63
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:35,228
Last night, when we went to a restaurant with Professor Agasa...

64
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,228
Everyone, look at that.

65
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:46,988
A man and a woman?

66
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:50,237
You can see their silhouettes so clearly.

67
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:52,498
They look like shadow puppets.

68
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:55,617
Do you suppose they're eating?

69
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:57,748
They're probably throwing a party.

70
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:04,888
Things seem to be going well between them.

71
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:10,888
Huh?

72
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:17,088
W-What's going on?!

73
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:23,767
So you witnessed the incident through the curtains,

74
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:27,477
but the police wouldn't take you seriously?

75
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:29,467
We really did see something!

76
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,097
Then why are the police saying nothing happened?

77
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:33,578
It's not like we could do anything about it.

78
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:40,588
The cop said there was only a woman inside.

79
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:45,197
Are you sure it wasn't just a mistake on your part?

80
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:47,287
No, it wasn't!

81
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:49,657
We all saw it!

82
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,708
Okay, I believe you.

83
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,857
But there's too little information.

84
00:06:57,858 --> 00:07:00,978
Anything helps. Tell me everything you remember.

85
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:03,737
According to the police,

86
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:08,187
the woman who lives in that apartment is Kokubun Yuko-san, 26 years old.

87
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:10,988
She works at an event planning company.

88
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:15,248
This is the photo we found of her on their website, taken when she was hired.

89
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,748
You've done your research, Mitsuhiko.

90
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:22,057
So, what were the two silhouettes doing?

91
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:27,127
The man brought dishes and wine to the table.

92
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:29,927
The woman stayed seated the whole time.

93
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:30,758
Yeah.

94
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:36,257
We thought they were enjoying a party together,

95
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:39,018
and then the man suddenly became violent.

96
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:42,257
Now that I think about it, maybe that wasn't a party.

97
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:46,528
It kind of looked like a police officer questioning a suspect.

98
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:50,777
To me, they looked like a couple just before a proposal.

99
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:55,538
I think they looked like an old man and woman basking in the sun.

100
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:58,077
How did you guys all see different things?

101
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,788
We can't help that. That's what it looked like to us.

102
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,567
Silhouettes, huh?

103
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,724
Depending on the perspective and angle,

104
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:10,798
their size and overall impression can change completely, like shadow puppets.

105
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:16,808
The police claim only the woman who was allegedly attacked was inside.

106
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,668
That's the exact opposite of what they're claiming.

107
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:23,227
What's going on here?

108
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:24,607
Interrogation!

109
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:25,897
Sunbathing!

110
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:29,107
How do you sunbathe at night?

111
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,997
What? Uh...

112
00:08:30,998 --> 00:08:33,237
They were having an afternoon nap at night.

113
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,407
They'd been staying up all night from that afternoon.

114
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:38,288
You two have got everything backwards.

115
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:39,748
Backwards?

116
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:44,248
I see. So that's how it is.

117
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:46,918
Conan-kun, did you figure something out?

118
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:48,987
Yeah, I did.

119
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:55,138
If everything you're saying is true, then this is the only possible answer.

120
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:07,707
Sorry to bother you while you're so busy, Detective Takagi.

121
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,827
It's fine.

122
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:13,198
Did Kokubun-san really say they have a pet dog?

123
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:17,698
I've said repeatedly that we don't allow pets here.

124
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,067
Looks like no one's home.

125
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:22,958
Yeah.

126
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:28,958
Hey, kids!

127
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:44,978
She loves sports, huh?

128
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:51,068
So a woman lives alone here.

129
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,468
Is that blood?

130
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,668
Looks like it.

131
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:16,487
This blood someone tried to wipe clean, the broken glasses and plates in the trash.

132
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:20,047
And it doesn't look like she has a pet dog.

133
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:21,518
Conan-kun.

134
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:25,268
Look at this.

135
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,757
She must've really hated him.

136
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:34,277
Conan-kun, what we saw last night...

137
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,687
Yeah, last night you guys watched a crime take place.

138
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,967
But what we saw was...

139
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:43,237
You had it backwards.

140
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:44,538
Backwards?

141
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:48,038
People tend to get stuck on their first impressions.

142
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:52,557
And it doesn't make sense that the man was delivering dishes

143
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:56,798
and wine to the table when the woman who lives here was sitting the whole time.

144
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:59,548
If you swap the genders of the people,

145
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:05,978
then it also explains why the police officer said there was only a woman inside.

146
00:11:06,508 --> 00:11:11,657
In other words, the person you thought was a man was a short-haired woman,

147
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:16,317
and the person you thought was a woman was a long-haired man.

148
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:17,568
What?

149
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:21,328
Look. This is a recent photo of her.

150
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:22,867
You're right.

151
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,578
We had no idea.

152
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:29,527
She only let the police officer inside the apartment

153
00:11:29,528 --> 00:11:33,508
because he'd been told that the victim was a woman.

154
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:36,838
That did in fact allow her to get away with it.

155
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,687
Though she made it through that visit,

156
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:45,037
she must sense the investigation turning up the heat on her.

157
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,648
In other words, she's already acted on the next step?

158
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:52,078
Detective Takagi.

159
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:55,108
I checked the security cameras.

160
00:11:55,338 --> 00:12:01,368
I saw Kokubun Yuko-san leaving early this morning with a large suitcase.

161
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:05,027
Head back to the station and report what you saw.

162
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:06,207
Yes, sir.

163
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,368
I'm going to check the security cameras in the area.

164
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:12,447
We don't need to help?

165
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,457
Nah, I think it'll be fine.

166
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,867
Are you sure?

167
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:20,767
Surely not even you can deduce where the culprit went, right?

168
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:22,527
I don't know about that.

169
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:24,638
What does that mean?

170
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:29,647
She probably still believes that as long as the body isn't found,

171
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,647
she can keep evading the police.

172
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:35,898
Which means she's probably doing what she'd do on any other day.

173
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:37,318
See?

174
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,438
What is this?

175
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,698
Kokubun Yuko-san's social media profile.

176
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:52,867
But maybe she buried the body before going to work.

177
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:55,918
No, she's probably still pretending everything is normal.

178
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:58,447
Since it seemed like a premeditated crime,

179
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,407
if she's going to bury the body, she'll probably do it after work.

180
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:03,678
Hey, look. We've arrived.

181
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:06,328
It's the flower park.

182
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:14,718
It's so pretty.

183
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:21,737
Thank you for visiting the park today.

184
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:28,247
The Haido City Flower Park will be closing soon.

185
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:31,208
Let's hurry. She'll make her move once work is over.

186
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:36,537
Kokubun-san? Oh, she already left.

187
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,767
When?

188
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,868
Just now, I think.

189
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:45,067
The truth is...

190
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,218
What?

191
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:50,378
We'll split up from here on out. Let's find her.

192
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:53,728
What should we do once we find her?

193
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,478
Slow her down until the police arrive.

194
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:57,978
How?

195
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,668
Leave that to me. I've got an idea.

196
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:19,667
I found her. She's heading towards the exit from the plaza.

197
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:22,607
All right. Follow the plan, guys.

198
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:23,758
Got it.

199
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:29,008
That way! They went that way!

200
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,047
Don't let them escape!

201
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:32,898
Over there! Hurry!

202
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,717
Where did they go?

203
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:46,898
Don't worry. They're trapped in here.

204
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,788
It worked.

205
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,327
Professor.

206
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,038
Good work, everyone.

207
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:03,958
Now let's leave the rest up to Conan-kun.

208
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,238
You're Kokubun Yuko-san, correct?

209
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:35,248
What?

210
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,577
Uh, yes. That's me.

211
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:39,748
Who are you?

212
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:44,258
My name is Mori Kogoro. I'm a detective.

213
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:48,828
What does a detective want with me?

214
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,008
I'm actually looking for someone.

215
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,888
And you think I can help you?

216
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:56,697
Of course you can.

217
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:00,768
Nobody else knows where he is.

218
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:03,778
Who are you talking about?

219
00:16:04,018 --> 00:16:05,987
Don't play dumb.

220
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:10,278
I'm talking about the man you had dinner with last night.

221
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:15,288
I have no idea what you're talking about.

222
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:18,897
The police investigation is already closing in.

223
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:21,038
See? They're just over there.

224
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:26,468
By the way, what's inside that suitcase?

225
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,798
What do you think is in here?

226
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:36,058
If I'm correct, he should be in there.

227
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:49,568
You're not very nice, are you?

228
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:53,558
Most detectives aren't.

229
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,318
It's his fault.

230
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:03,017
After naming me his guarantor and borrowing a bunch of money,

231
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:06,538
he bilked his debts and pushed all the responsibility onto me.

232
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:11,838
Apparently he spent the money on other women.

233
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:21,848
He destroyed my life, forced his debts onto me, and then tried to dump me.

234
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:26,978
So I destroyed him!

235
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:38,607
What do you want me to do to you?

236
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:41,607
Shall I start by cutting all your fingernails to the quick?

237
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:45,458
Or perhaps I'll make you swallow a thousand needles.

238
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:59,848
Or would you prefer to be electrocuted?

239
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:06,718
You don't like pain? In that case...

240
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:09,438
How's this?

241
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:19,788
Apparently if you drink these together, you can end your life pleasantly.

242
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:21,428
But we can't do that.

243
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:26,918
You have to experience the worst possible pain and suffering.

244
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:32,628
Otherwise, I won't be satisfied.

245
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,128
You think I'll let you go?!

246
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:39,428
I can't believe someone was watching.

247
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:46,397
Uh, everything's fine.

248
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:47,348
Ahem.

249
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:51,398
More importantly, you must've been rather surprised

250
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:53,738
when the police paid you a visit after the murder.

251
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:57,317
Excuse me, I'm with the police.

252
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,797
Could I have a few minutes of your time?

253
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:02,118
What do the police want with me?

254
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:05,917
Well, someone reported that they saw a man

255
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:09,918
attacking a woman inside your home through the curtains.

256
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:14,377
They saw a man attacking a woman through the curtains?

257
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:17,847
In that case, I have a large pet dog.

258
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:22,388
Perhaps that's what Chocolat playing with me looked like through the curtains.

259
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:27,078
What do you think? Could I take a look around inside?

260
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:33,028
Very well. In that case, officer, would it be all right if you only you came in?

261
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:36,358
I don't want strangers looking around inside my home.

262
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:43,198
I thought that was pretty clever of me, but apparently it didn't work.

263
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:46,227
Crimes are a gamble you have a slim chance of winning.

264
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,928
You shouldn't have done it to begin with.

265
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,287
Mr. Detective.

266
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:52,577
Yes?

267
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:55,117
Do you smell something burning?

268
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:56,968
Huh? What?

269
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:00,618
Hot, hot!

270
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:03,947
Are you all right?

271
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:06,728
Y-Yes, of course. I'm fine, obviously.

272
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:10,887
Mr. Detective, you're alone, aren't you?

273
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,728
What do you mean by that?

274
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:17,488
Do you think you'd be willing to let me go?

275
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:20,127
I can't do that.

276
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:22,988
I see. That's too bad.

277
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:28,608
Mr. Detective, you know what that means, don't you?

278
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:34,748
Mr. Detective, why won't you let me see you?

279
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:37,258
I'd like to see your face.

280
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:41,758
I want to see the face of the detective who hunted me down...

281
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:47,488
Up close!

282
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,488
Why, you...!

283
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:00,737
Kokubun Yuko, the time is 19:58.

284
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:03,768
You're under arrest for a weapons violation.

285
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:08,828
You got here quick, Detective Takagi.

286
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:13,208
Sorry to keep you waiting, Conan-kun.

287
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,047
Okay, what's this?

288
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:44,048
A sea urchin!

289
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:46,837
What are you talking about? It's a crab.

290
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:47,928
What?

291
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:51,428
Genta-kun, does that really look like a sea urchin to you?

292
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,907
What? I'm just being honest.

293
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:57,188
At least they're both sea creatures.

294
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:06,698
Anyway, I can't believe what we thought was a pleasant date was actually a ghastly affair.

295
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:11,017
Seriously, and there was only a single curtain between you and it.

296
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:14,787
As they say, the future lies beyond the veil.

297
00:23:14,788 --> 00:23:16,198
Hey, Conan.

298
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,378
What does that look like to you?

299
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,377
Huh? Isn't that a rabbit?

300
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:23,857
Right?

301
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,128
What?

302
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:28,138
It's clearly an eel carrying a leek.

303
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:29,888
What?

304
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:32,437
How does this look like an eel to you?!

305
00:23:32,438 --> 00:23:37,077
This is the eel's head, and this is the leek.

306
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:41,318
It's ducks that carry leeks.

307
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:43,148
Is that right?

308
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,908
Huh? Isn't this place...

309
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,438
Jeez.

310
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:04,067
What? The president's been murdered?

311
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,668
He drowned in red bean paste?

312
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,788
A red car, shampoo...

313
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:13,798
The next episode of Conan is "Ballad of the Woman Who Loved Cake!"
