1
00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:03,153
On our way home from fishing

2
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:08,353
when Mr. Subaru came to pick us up instead of Dr. Agasa,

3
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:10,353
we stopped over at the Ikkaku Rock,

4
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:12,753
that is known for the legend of the one-horned dragon.

5
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:15,853
There, we find the names of fish,

6
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:19,553
mackerel, carp, sea bream and flatfish carved on the rock,

7
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:22,653
as well as the dead body of a woman wearing a wet suit.

8
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:26,653
It looked as if she got messed up in a diving accident

9
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,053
and escaped to the rock,

10
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:30,053
but help failed to come and she died of dehydration.

11
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:31,953
But, I wasn't deceived.

12
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:34,653
Even though the woman was wearing lipstick,

13
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:38,853
there were no signs of any lipstick on the regulator near her.

14
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:43,553
This is homicide set up to look like an accidental death.

15
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,253
Moreover, we found a diver's watch

16
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:51,653
that seems to have been used to carve words on the rock.

17
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,953
I noticed that a part of the words in the back was scratched off.

18
00:00:56,553 --> 00:01:00,253
The name of the woman who died is Ms. Hikari Akamine.

19
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:03,553
According to her three male friends that say they're her diving friends,

20
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:07,153
Hikari seems to have disappeared while diving three days ago.

21
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:12,553
Who on earth could've left Hikari alone at Ikkaku Rock

22
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:14,053
to dehydrate to death?

23
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:17,753
And, what's hidden behind the names of fish

24
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:23,153
mackerel, carp, sea bream, and flatfish?

25
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,853
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

26
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,253
Saturday nights are for mystery.

27
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:34,453
Fish messages left behind on a Dragon legend rock.

28
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:36,053
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:37,753
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:39,853
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:25,035
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 2)"

32
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:30,635
That's what she gets for being reckless when she can't even swim.

33
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:32,835
She couldn't swim and yet she went diving?

34
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:36,235
Yes, there are a lot of divers who can't swim.

35
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:39,935
Because we can use fins and breathe using a tank.

36
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:44,835
By the way, what's your relationship with Hikari?

37
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:47,435
We're just her diving friends.

38
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,835
In the beginning, only we were diving together.

39
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:53,735
"Rokusuke Oto (23)" -but Hikari said she wanted to join us,

40
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,335
so we started diving together.

41
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:59,435
"Shuhei Aosato (25)" -Using her cruiser,

42
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,535
we could dive at any diving point we wanted too.

43
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,935
"Yasuji Kaida (24)" -With her around,

44
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,335
we got to eat gorgeous gourmet dishes too.

45
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:13,035
But, don't people usual scuba dive in pairs of two?

46
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:16,135
How did you lose track of Hikari?

47
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:19,535
Hikari swims of ahead of us on her own,

48
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:23,135
saying things like she wants to be alone when in the water.

49
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:24,235
A half a month ago,

50
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,635
because of that she was taken in by the current

51
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:28,735
and had the fright of her life.

52
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,835
Yes.

53
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,635
If that didn't happen,

54
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:34,335
Yoshiro wouldn't be dead.

55
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:38,335
Yoshiro?

56
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:39,335
Oh, well...

57
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:40,435
Don't talk about Yoshiro.

58
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:42,935
It has nothing to do with what we're talking about now.

59
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:47,235
By the way, Mr. Kaida.

60
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:50,235
What happened to your eye?

61
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:54,135
Last night, he punched me

62
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,935
when I said that Hikari's probably in bed

63
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:58,235
at some man's place,

64
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,435
so to just leave her as she is.

65
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:03,935
He got angry saying what if the worst happens.

66
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:07,235
Then what about the mask you're wearing Mr. Oto?

67
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:08,835
Hikari forced me to go diving

68
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:11,135
when I wasn't feeling all that well...

69
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:16,735
so I caught a cold and it's taking me forever to recover.

70
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:20,835
Oh, but I'm diving without worrying about a thing now, though.

71
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:22,035
Mr. Aosato.

72
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:24,935
Under your lip... did you hurt yourself?

73
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:26,535
Pimples.

74
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,235
Last night when I was net surfing at an internet cafe

75
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:30,835
and was holding my head in my hands,

76
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:32,635
I burst a pimple.

77
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,135
What were you net surfing for?

78
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,435
What else but information on Hikari?

79
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:42,535
I was checking to see if there were any young guys who saw her at sea

80
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:45,635
and picked her up or something even if the chances were really slight...

81
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:47,735
I was checking blogs on the subject.

82
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:50,235
Hey, you guys.

83
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:52,535
What kind of fish do you like?

84
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:55,735
Please answer one by one.

85
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:59,535
Tell us! I like eels!

86
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:02,435
What's with these kids?

87
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:04,135
Well, you see...

88
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:06,835
Hey! What's with you guys blurting out

89
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,935
something weird like that out of the blue?

90
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,735
It's not weird!

91
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:14,735
That dying message of sea bream and flatfish.

92
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:20,235
They could be the names of the fish that the culprit liked.

93
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:21,335
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:25,335
No, they've got a point.

95
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:30,435
It's not unusual that an innocent idea not bound by common sense

96
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:34,435
will serve as a key to revealing the truth.

97
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,735
Isn't that how you solved many cases,

98
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:40,835
using the words of this boy as a clue?

99
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:44,935
Well... I wouldn't say that many, but...

100
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:48,935
Hey, do you guys have fish that you like a lot?

101
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:52,435
All three of us love fish.

102
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:54,835
We don't have any particular fish we don't like either.

103
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:56,135
So they say.

104
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:02,135
Hey, hey, just how long to plan to stay here?

105
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:05,735
Right, the sun'll go down soon too.

106
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:12,235
You all have the same diver's watch as Hikari's.

107
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:13,935
Yes.

108
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,935
Hikari made it for us.

109
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:21,735
She wanted us to all have something in common as a diving team.

110
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:25,735
She carved the name Akamine Angel Fish Club on the watch.

111
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:29,235
Angel fish?

112
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:34,535
I'll hear you out at the station.

113
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:37,335
I want to hear if you have anything will lead to the culprit too.

114
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:38,635
Culprit...

115
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:41,435
You mean this is not an accident?

116
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:44,535
Right. There's a killer

117
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:48,135
and most probably among the three here.

118
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,935
But, what can it be?

119
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:51,835
The dying message having to do with fish

120
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:55,335
mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish.

121
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:57,635
What on earth does it mean?

122
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:01,435
Besides the word on the diver's watch that was scratched out...

123
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,435
Why only the word fish?

124
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:04,635
I get it.

125
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:07,835
The name of fish.

126
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:10,335
If you add words to it and connect it,

127
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:12,135
it'll form a phrase.

128
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:13,235
Add?

129
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:15,035
If you add "ku" to "saba" (mackerel),

130
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,135
it makes the word "sabaku" meaning desert!

131
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:17,635
Add "ai" to "tai" (sea bream),

132
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:19,035
it makes the phrase, "I want to see you."

133
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:22,235
In other words, the message is,

134
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,435
"I want to see you so come to the desert!"

135
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,835
Then what about flatfish?

136
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:29,435
It means to be inspired,

137
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:33,435
(hirameke-flatfish+ke) of this reading the message.

138
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:38,335
But who's going to wait for who at the desert?

139
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:41,135
That woman's dead.

140
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,835
Right.

141
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:46,935
Besides, so conveniently adding certain letters

142
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:48,935
to words and connecting them forcibly to make phrases,

143
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:51,135
I don't think leads to solving anything.

144
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:53,835
Whether letters are added or removed,

145
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:54,935
there's got to be a key word

146
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,435
that serves as a hint as to what should be done.

147
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:00,535
Great work, you guys!

148
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:02,835
What?

149
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,835
So, you can't make light of innocent remarks after all.

150
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,635
Don't tell me you...

151
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:09,835
Figured out the culprit?

152
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:13,235
Yes, thanks to all of you.

153
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:15,135
What do you mean?

154
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:18,035
The culprit was telling us who he was to begin with.

155
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:24,135
That he was the one who left Hikari back at Ikkaku Rock

156
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:26,435
and killed her.

157
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:30,235
Hey, hey, the sun's really going to set if you don't hurry.

158
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:35,335
Don't you think we should take Hikari's body to land as soon as possible?

159
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:37,835
If you still have something you want to ask us,

160
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:40,235
you can do so to your heart's content back at the station.

161
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:42,235
Okay, carry her body onto the boat...

162
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:43,435
-Wait a second! -Wait a second!

163
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,535
What, both of you?

164
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,635
Well... this boy wants to talk to you.

165
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:54,735
But if you have something you want to say, you can go ahead, Subaru.

166
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:59,535
So, I'll hear everyone out to their heart's content back at the station.

167
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,935
But, then...

168
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:07,135
All proof that is here will be hidden.

169
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:08,535
Isn't that right?

170
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:09,635
Sort of.

171
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:13,235
Proof? What proof are you talking about?

172
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:17,435
Can't you tell?

173
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:19,735
Of course, it's proof of the culprit

174
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:24,135
who left that woman back here at Ikkaku Rock

175
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:26,635
leaving her to dehydrate to dehydrate to death.

176
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,935
Hey, hey.

177
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:30,535
Hiding proof means... Don't tell me that...

178
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:33,535
Yes, he's probably here.

179
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:36,635
The culprit is among one of us.

180
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,135
Wait up!

181
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,535
How do you know something like that?

182
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:42,635
It's true that Hikari disappeared

183
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:46,935
while she was diving with us three days ago but...

184
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:48,235
It could be that she was picked up

185
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:53,035
by some bad guy and was left behind here!

186
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,835
No, that's close to impossible.

187
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,435
You said when Hikari disappeared

188
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,735
that you received text mail from her saying,

189
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,935
"I'll leave the rest to you guy", right?

190
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:08,335
That's proof that the culprit is among you.

191
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,835
I think that the culprit sent that mail

192
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,735
so that you wouldn't go out to search for Hikari right away

193
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:15,735
after he left her behind at the site.

194
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:18,435
In order to do so, he had to come on board the boat

195
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,235
from diving earlier than everyone else

196
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:22,235
look for Hikari's cell phone,

197
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:26,135
"I'll leave the rest to you guy" -and send the mail out.

198
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,435
"Sent."

199
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,735
Unlike the phone, the address remains

200
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,435
when you mail something out.

201
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:34,335
So, it had to be sent using Hikari's address

202
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:36,035
to avoid being suspected.

203
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:39,335
I see, so the only ones who could've sent the mail

204
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:42,435
are the ones who knew

205
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,935
that it wouldn't be strange for her to be sending you mail.

206
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,335
But...

207
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:49,935
where's Hikari's cell phone that you're talking about?

208
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:53,535
Well, if it were me, after I send the mail

209
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:57,435
I would dispose of it in this vast sea.

210
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:00,235
Then, there is no proof.

211
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:01,735
Not so.

212
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:06,935
Not only proof, Hikari left us the name of the culprit.

213
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,635
Isn't that right,

214
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:12,535
Mr. Shuhei Aosato?

215
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:28,998
Hey, cut out that weird talk.

216
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,198
It's like you're saying that I'm the one who did it.

217
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:37,098
Besides, how did you know that his name is Shuhei, kid?

218
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:39,598
We only gave you our last names.

219
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:46,598
Hikari carved the name of the culprit on the Ikkaku Rock,

220
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,598
that's why I know. Your full name Shuhei Aosato.

221
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,698
Where is something like that written?

222
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:56,998
Carved? You mean the name of fish?

223
00:12:56,998 --> 00:12:59,598
But, the only names written were mackerel,

224
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,298
carp, sea bream and flatfish?

225
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,098
It's true if you look at only that

226
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,698
it looks like the names of fish are carved but...

227
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,798
If you take into consideration

228
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:12,798
the word that was scratched out in back of Hikari's diver's watch,

229
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:14,698
it comes to light, doesn't it?

230
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:16,598
Was something scratched out?

231
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:22,198
Yes. The word in between "Akamine Angel" and "club" were...

232
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:25,098
Akamine Angel Fish Club.

233
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:28,998
The word that was scratched out was fish.

234
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:30,098
In other words,

235
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,998
she wanted you to scratch out the word fish.

236
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:35,398
-Yes. -Wait, please.

237
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,798
The word fish?

238
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:42,998
Mackerel, carp, sea bream and flatfish are all fish!

239
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:48,298
If you scratch out fish, they'll all disappear.

240
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,898
I get it, kanji characters.

241
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,798
You change the names of the fish into kanji characters

242
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:57,998
and cross out the fish part of it.

243
00:13:57,998 --> 00:13:59,098
Kanji?

244
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:02,598
Is there a kanji character for mackerel?

245
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:04,998
Yes, you write the word "fish" to the left of the kanji

246
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:08,598
and "Ao" to the right making the word mackerel.

247
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:12,198
"Fish" on the left and "Sato" to the right, carp.

248
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,698
"Fish" to the left and "Shuu" to the right, sea bream.

249
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:23,298
And to the left and "Hei" to the right makes flatfish.

250
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:27,798
If you remove the "fish" part from all the kanji characters...

251
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,498
Ao.

252
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:31,598
Sato.

253
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:33,798
Shu.

254
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:34,898
Hei.

255
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:37,798
"Aosato Shuhei."

256
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:40,698
-Aosato Shuhei! -Aosato Shuhei!

257
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:42,598
-Hey! -You...

258
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:45,698
No way. Don't take them seriously.

259
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:49,098
No one's going to make a culprit out of me

260
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,198
using such a riddle like reason.

261
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:52,898
But...

262
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:56,298
It seems pretty logical to me.

263
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,898
But, if I'm the culprit

264
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,098
all she had to do was write my name as is, right?

265
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:06,098
She probably thought that you'd erase it if she did.

266
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:11,098
You know, when you come back here to confirm if she died.

267
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:13,398
What're you talking about?

268
00:15:13,398 --> 00:15:16,698
Did you see me come here or what?

269
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,698
No, we didn't.

270
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:23,798
But, we know the other reason why you came here today, Mr. Aosato.

271
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:24,898
What?

272
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:27,698
To switch the regulator.

273
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:32,398
You probably slashed the pipe of Hikari's regulator with a knife

274
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,698
and after faking an air leak brought her here to Ikkaku Rock

275
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:38,898
lied to her saying that you'd be coming back to get her

276
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,898
and left her behind like you did, right?

277
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:44,898
People don't come to Ikkaku Rock

278
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:49,098
and since Hikari can't swim you figured she couldn't escape.

279
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:52,598
In other words, you came to switch

280
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:56,798
that slashed regulator with your own.

281
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,598
If the slash is found later,

282
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,598
the case would not be handled as an accident.

283
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:03,498
If you close off the slash with a vinyl tape or something,

284
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:06,198
you can make it back with that regulator.

285
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,398
So, I'm asking if you guys saw me do that?

286
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:11,298
The band-aid by your lip...

287
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:15,698
You said that you busted a pimple

288
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:17,598
while you were net surfing at an internet cafe

289
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:20,598
with your head in your hands, right?

290
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:23,798
Most of the mouse in internet cafes are for right-handed people.

291
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:27,298
Which means that you were holding your head with your left hand

292
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:31,798
so the busted pimple should naturally be below your left chin.

293
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:34,198
But, judging from the position of the bandage...

294
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:36,198
The Band-Aid is not under your left side, is it?

295
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,098
It got smeared on, didn't it?

296
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,998
When you went back to the boat to switch regulators

297
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:44,498
with Hikari's and put it in your mouth?

298
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:45,698
Oh, no...

299
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:49,498
Hikari's lipstick.

300
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:54,998
I see. When you got on board and wiped your mouth

301
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:58,198
you realized for the first time that lipstick was smeared on you.

302
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:00,698
So, you hid the lipstick that smeared under your right lip

303
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:04,598
by using Band-Aid, right?

304
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:07,298
Lipstick doesn't come off that easily

305
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:10,198
just by wiping it off with your hand.

306
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,898
But, she sure is a strange diver.

307
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,698
I mean if she was a beginner I can see,

308
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,598
but, she's been diving for some time,

309
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:19,398
and yet why did she dive without removing her lipstick?

310
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,998
She did so deliberately.

311
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,598
When she first started diving,

312
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:26,998
I mistakenly used her regulator and got lipstick smeared on me.

313
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:29,098
She thought that was funny,

314
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:33,498
so she continued to keep her lipstick on when diving.

315
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:37,498
Well... thanks to that,

316
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:41,698
we found out that Hikari left Yoshiro to die.

317
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:44,298
Left him to die?

318
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:48,398
Do you remember the accident 6 months ago?

319
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:53,498
Yes, you mean when Hikari was taken by the current at the lake

320
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:56,098
and Yoshiro went to save her.

321
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:58,498
We somehow managed to find Hikari

322
00:17:58,498 --> 00:18:00,598
and pull her up to the boat but...

323
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:04,898
Yoshiro was dead a while later.

324
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:08,898
Hey, don't tell me that Yoshiro was near Hikari back then too?

325
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:11,398
Yes, it's likely.

326
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:14,598
But, that isn't what she said back then.

327
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:19,298
I'm alone. Sorry and let me on board.

328
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,498
It's so cold I'll freeze to death.

329
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:23,898
So, we all thought...

330
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:27,098
She didn't see Yoshiro.

331
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:29,698
Of course, she saw him,

332
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:33,298
because on the Yoshiro's rescue regulator that was found later.

333
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:38,198
Hikari's lipstick was smeared all over it.

334
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:40,098
When I pushed her for an answer,

335
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:41,598
she said that she thought that Yoshiro

336
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:44,598
had already swum back to land but...

337
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:46,798
Isn't it natural to ask right away?

338
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,698
About Yoshiro who came to rescue her

339
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:52,298
and got caught in the current again, wondering if he's okay.

340
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,198
All she was concerned about was getting back on land

341
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:58,198
and jumping into a warm bed!

342
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:02,598
She could care less if Yoshiro lived or died!

343
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:09,398
That's why I left that woman behind at Ikkaku Rock here.

344
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,698
Well...

345
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:18,098
You're all going to experience the same thing!

346
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:20,698
Shuhei, don't be stupid!

347
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:24,198
Don't worry.

348
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:27,398
I'm just going to buy time until I get out of here.

349
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:29,998
You guys are staying here for a while.

350
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:31,698
Hey, officer!

351
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:34,298
Tell your men on board the boat,

352
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,998
that you're returning on my cruiser while listening to my story,

353
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:40,398
so to go on back without you.

354
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:43,798
And when the police boat is out of sight...

355
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,498
Fisherman!

356
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:51,298
Cut the rope that is tied to the rock and let it go.

357
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,698
When the fishing boat is out of sight,

358
00:19:53,698 --> 00:19:55,898
I'm taking this child

359
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:58,898
and getting out of here with the cruiser!

360
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:02,998
Darn. My watch type tranquilizer gun's on the boat.

361
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:04,598
Although it's a bit dangerous

362
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:07,498
I'll use my super kick shoe.

363
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,598
I'm wearing boots.

364
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:14,498
Hey, Ai, don't you have anything that may serve as a weapon?

365
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:17,198
What makes you think I'd have something so convenient on me.

366
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:26,498
0.12 percent...

367
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:27,898
What?

368
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:31,898
That's the rate that a culprit makes a safe escape.

369
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,198
It's one in a thousand people.

370
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:38,898
But, those few who have received the blessing of the devil

371
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:41,998
and fled will eventually tire from hiding their true identities,

372
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:44,798
living in fear and continue living on.

373
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:46,498
Putting aside those who have confessed

374
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:49,198
to their crime or committed suicide,

375
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:52,198
the success rated is virtually...

376
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:54,298
nil.

377
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:57,198
Will you be able to endure being all alone

378
00:20:57,198 --> 00:21:01,698
as well as the pressure of all that is to come?

379
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:03,998
Shut up!

380
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:20,298
Okay, you're fine now.

381
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,398
Thank you.

382
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:30,498
Well, then, shall we have you flee all the way to the station?

383
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,398
Yes, sir.

384
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:37,898
You're sure strong!

385
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:39,698
Really awesome!

386
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,998
Not really...

387
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,598
Thank you, Subaru.

388
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:49,198
Is what you said about 0.12 percent really true?

389
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,798
Of course, it's a lie.

390
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:55,298
I thought I had no choice

391
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,198
but to provoke him if I wanted him to divert

392
00:21:58,198 --> 00:22:00,598
the knife away from her.

393
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,498
You're really something after all.

394
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:55,398
Just as I thought. He's...

395
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,198
She has been choked to death.

396
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,498
Manual strangulation.

397
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:07,098
Excuse me. There are green stains

398
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:10,198
on both shoulders of Ms. Yukiko.

399
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,998
Yukiko took the stairs all the way down to B1.

400
00:24:13,998 --> 00:24:16,598
Why didn't she use the elevator?

401
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:19,998
The one who killed Yukiko...

402
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:21,498
is among them.

403
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:23,698
Next Conan,

404
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:30,498
"Hands that Play Chords of Discord."

405
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,791
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:47,091
"Crayon".

407
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:49,691
Shin, your name is Shinichi, isn't it?

408
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:52,191
You can't say it with that kind of timing.
