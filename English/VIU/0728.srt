1
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:06,145
Ran, Sera, Pops and I were invited

2
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:09,145
by Sonoko to participate in a TV show.

3
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:12,945
But, after shooting of the program starts

4
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,645
and the locked box with the fruit

5
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:17,445
that will be determining the victory

6
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:19,045
or defeat of the patissiers is opened.

7
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:21,545
The corpse of Mr. Takegi,

8
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:24,545
-"Shoutoku Takegi, age 69" -the chief judge found inside.

9
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:26,345
Moreover, what bothers me more

10
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:29,445
is Mr. Takegi's actions.

11
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:33,245
Why was he going that far to check the box?

12
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:36,945
Maybe he just thought it was being leaked

13
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,945
to Mr. Kurimura, the champion,

14
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:41,045
who won for six consecutive weeks?

15
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:42,145
Huh?

16
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:45,745
It seems that he always brought ingredients

17
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,245
that went along well with the theme fruit.

18
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:49,845
So, maybe he suspected

19
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,645
that Kurimura knew the contents of the box.

20
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:52,845
Inspector Megure!

21
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,545
Huh?

22
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,645
It seems that last night Mr. Takegi

23
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:58,545
secretly came to the TV station

24
00:00:58,545 --> 00:01:00,945
and mingled among the extras of a samurai show.

25
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:02,345
I see.

26
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:03,445
He wanted to make it look

27
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:05,145
as if he wasn't at the TV station

28
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,545
and wanted to try catching the perp in the act.

29
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:10,845
It's very likely that Mr. Takegi was hiding

30
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:12,745
in the storeroom where the box was stored,

31
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,645
ambushing the perp.

32
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:23,145
There were traces of blood being wiped off

33
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:26,145
by the area where the lid and box match.

34
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:28,345
That means that the box

35
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:29,845
was at the scene of the crime, no?

36
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:36,745
That's where Mr. Takegi was killed.

37
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:42,545
By the perp...

38
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:48,645
Who secretly opened the box.

39
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:03,845
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

40
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:05,645
are slashed by the light of deduction.

41
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,245
The hidden trick about the box.

42
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,345
What is the key evidence that points to the perp?

43
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:10,845
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,745
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:15,845
His name is Detective Conan!

46
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,370
"A Treasure Box Full of Fruits (Part 2)"

47
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,170
Oh, here they come!

48
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,770
Isn't this Mr. Takegi?

49
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,670
See, he's looking around

50
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,270
and going into the storage room.

51
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,970
The problem is, who's coming after him?

52
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,170
Like I told you before, it's me.

53
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,870
No. The one who came is...

54
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,170
Producer Taruoka?

55
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,470
Why you?

56
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,670
I... I am the producer, you know.

57
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,970
I went to confirm whether the box arrived safely.

58
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,970
-"Toshide Taruoka, age 48" -Mr. Takegi had warned me that

59
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,070
if the contents of the box were to be leaked outside,

60
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,270
I would be responsible too, so...

61
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,970
Either way, you're sure taking a while.

62
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,870
You've been inside for about 30 minutes.

63
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,070
I forgot where the box was,

64
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,970
and I was looking around for it.

65
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,370
The storage room is spacious and really cluttered, you see.

66
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,770
The next one to come is...

67
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,870
Assistant director, Mr. Furuya.

68
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,670
He has two young ADs with him.

69
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,270
You seem to be taking your time too.

70
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,870
The thing is, I finished checking the box right away,

71
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,870
but I was taking a puff.

72
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,970
-"Wataru Furuya, age 31" -It's practically no smoking

73
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,270
inside the TV station,

74
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,970
and ADs are so busy that we have no time to take a puff.

75
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,370
I smoked three to four cigarettes

76
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,970
while checking my mail.

77
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,770
Well, the storage room is no smoking too, though.

78
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,570
There you are.

79
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,770
You've been inside for about 30 minutes too.

80
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,970
If no one else went in after this,

81
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,470
you two would be the suspects.

82
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,570
What...

83
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,770
Oh, I went into the storage room too.

84
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,870
Huh...

85
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,470
You did too, Mr. Kasuga?

86
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,570
-"Terafumi Kasuga, age 45" -Yes, sir.

87
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,270
I was concerned about what Mr. Takegi told me.

88
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,070
Although I was confident about the key that I locked,

89
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,670
but as for the key that the TV station locked,

90
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,870
I wasn't too sure because I didn't really check it.

91
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,170
Oh, true!

92
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,470
Mr. Kasuga has come.

93
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,770
I think I was inside for about 30 minutes

94
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,670
just like the two before me.

95
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,870
Because I checked it many times repeatedly

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,970
and took a lot of picture

97
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,670
on top of that to show to Mr. Takegi.

98
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,770
And what did you come up with?

99
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,770
Since the keys were all completely locked,

100
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,570
I left for home that day.

101
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,970
After Mr. Kasuga left,

102
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,470
it seems that no one has come into the storage room

103
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,170
until some of the staff members

104
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,470
came to pick up the box the following day.

105
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,170
In other words...

106
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,570
Producer Taruoka, assistant director Mr. Furuya,

107
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,970
and food coordinator Mr. Kasuga...

108
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,770
The perp who killed Mr. Takegi is among you three.

109
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,570
-"Nichiuri TV" -So, well...

110
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,770
The suspects have been narrowed down to three.

111
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,670
But, who on earth is the perp?

112
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,170
I mean, in the first place,

113
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,770
it's a mystery as to how the key was opened.

114
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,270
Unless we figure that out.

115
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,770
I wonder why it's packed so tightly?

116
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,270
Even if the champion and the challenger were to use it,

117
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,270
they would probably use no more than ten during the program.

118
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,970
You mean, you don't know something so basic?

119
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,670
The more packed the box is the better it looks.

120
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,070
The fruit that left over

121
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,070
is always given out to the audience by drawing lots.

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,470
Well, it seems that the box has a raised bottom,

123
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,170
so that it doesn't get too heavy.

124
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,170
Because it's always packed with rare fruit

125
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,770
that you can hardly get a hold of.

126
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,170
There seems to be a lot of people

127
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,070
who send in entries to be in the audience.

128
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,870
And, how is it?

129
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,370
Have you figured out the perp?

130
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,970
Not at all. Nowhere close.

131
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,970
We don't even know how the box was unlocked either.

132
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,470
Well, compared to that mystery,

133
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,370
that's trivial.

134
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,570
That mystery?

135
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,870
What?

136
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,570
What's that about?

137
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,970
Hey...

138
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,170
don't tell me you really don't know?

139
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,170
Yes.

140
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,470
You don't know something so important like this?

141
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,470
You really haven't realize it?

142
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,370
Listen well!

143
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,770
The rear view of Yoko's hair!

144
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,370
In the live program the other day,

145
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,670
her hair was quite short.

146
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,770
But, today her hair is long.

147
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,970
The rate at which her hair grew is not normal.

148
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,470
Oh, she's probably wearing an extension.

149
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,170
Exten...

150
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,270
Short for hair extension,

151
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,670
in other words a mini wig!

152
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,170
Mini wig?

153
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,070
In Yoko's case,

154
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,470
I think she made it look natural

155
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,870
by using a decorative hairpin.

156
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,370
Is that so?

157
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,470
I see.

158
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,270
So, that's the story.

159
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,570
If so, that person is unmistakably the perp.

160
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,470
You came up with the same idea as me just now, didn't you?

161
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,470
Huh?

162
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,270
When she laughs,

163
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,370
those double teeth that show...

164
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,070
But, the problem is the proof.

165
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,270
I think that I...

166
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,770
I've met her somewhere before.

167
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,270
Huh?

168
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,870
What... what is it?

169
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,770
Is there something on my face?

170
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,070
Oh, no.

171
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,370
It's nothing.

172
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,170
We've taken pictures, so all we've got left to do now

173
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,070
is take the box back and check it thoroughly.

174
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,970
Right.

175
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,270
Are those apples all that were in the box?

176
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,070
Yeah.

177
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,170
Weren't there any that were spilled out of the box

178
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,570
or stuck to the lid of the box?

179
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,670
We put everything in the box.

180
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,870
If any spilled out,

181
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,870
it probably did when we opened the box.

182
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,070
Hey... you mentioned that

183
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,070
there were a lot of theme fruit packed

184
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,270
in that box all the time, didn't you?

185
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,570
Yep. It's always so packed

186
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,170
that two or three would spill out when opened.

187
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,670
Besides the MC Mr. Kenzaki used to always say,

188
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,770
take a look

189
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,470
at these fruit that are virtually spilling over!

190
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,370
If so...

191
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,370
That would serve as proof.

192
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,270
Oh, hey!

193
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,970
That brat.

194
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,470
He's moving around like he's with Heiji Hattori.

195
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,070
Huh? What's the matter, Ran?

196
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,770
Waves...

197
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,570
When I watch the rear view of Sera running off,

198
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,970
I always hear this deep sound inside my ear.

199
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,870
The sound of rippled waves.

200
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,070
As if I magic spell is cast over me.

201
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,370
Ran?

202
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,870
What...

203
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,370
Don't tell me you fell in love with her?

204
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,570
No, it's nothing like that.

205
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,770
I think you only think that way

206
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,470
because that tomboy is a returnee.

207
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,570
Huh...

208
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,470
Just what do you mean?

209
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,770
See, because she came back from overseas.

210
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,770
Way over the sea, right?

211
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,870
What a stupid...

212
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,070
-"Storage Room Number Three" -Why aren't you letting me in?

213
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,470
Come on! Letting me in just a bit!

214
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,770
No!

215
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,670
This storage is where the box was kept,

216
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,170
as well as the scene of a crime, you see.

217
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,570
Then, didn't you find anything in the storage room?

218
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,970
Nothing that has anything to do with the crime for now.

219
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,670
What about something strange inside?

220
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,570
Come to think of it,

221
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,270
when I went inside to check the storage room,

222
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,070
a young AD was being scolded,

223
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,970
because the little prop that was to be used

224
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,370
in the kitchen setting of a drama was not washed clean.

225
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,170
The kitchen?

226
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,470
A little prop?

227
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,270
Well, it seemed to have nothing to do

228
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,170
with the case though.

229
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,170
Hey...

230
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,170
Those three suspects are still there, aren't they?

231
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,870
Yeah. They're still waiting in the room.

232
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,070
All three are pleading

233
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,370
that they want to leave as soon as possible.

234
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,770
If I remember correctly,

235
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,770
producer Mr. Taruoka says he needs to do

236
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,970
a press conference on the case.

237
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,370
Mr. Furuya says he hasn't eaten anything since morning,

238
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,870
so that he'd like to go get a bite to eat.

239
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,270
The food coordinator, Mr. Kasuga,

240
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,870
says he wants to go home to feed his pet dog.

241
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,070
I think it was.

242
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,970
Then you'd better hurry and start.

243
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,470
Huh? Start what?

244
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,470
Well just a little...

245
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,370
Magic show.

246
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,894
What? A magic show?

247
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,919
You mean you called us and the suspects over here

248
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,319
to show us something like that?

249
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,819
Moreover, that tomboy's going to do it?

250
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,319
Well, come now...

251
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:57,619
I'm sure that you'll be surprised when you see it.

252
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,919
Conan's not here.

253
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,719
I'm sure he's with Sera.

254
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,819
-"Waiting Room C" -Over here!

255
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,419
Welcome to Masumi Sera's Hall of Magic.

256
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,619
I mean, don't tell me that...

257
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:19,119
you're sitting on the box

258
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,619
that the victim was put inside?

259
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,719
Well, yes.

260
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,519
I also have the padlock for this box

261
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,019
and the key to open it too.

262
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,419
Hey...

263
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:32,219
I had the large prop staff

264
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:34,719
prepare a similar box.

265
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:37,119
The key is for real though.

266
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:40,119
And, what's going to start?

267
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:44,019
First of all...

268
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,519
Please confirm that there is nothing in the box!

269
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:56,419
There seems to be nothing inside.

270
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,219
Yeah.

271
00:13:58,219 --> 00:13:59,319
Okay!

272
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,819
And...

273
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,519
I close the lid of the box.

274
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,719
I pull the iron lever of the padlock

275
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:11,619
through the lock hole of the box.

276
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,119
See, it's locked.

277
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,819
So now, without the key for the padlock,

278
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,119
the box won't open, will it?

279
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,519
No.

280
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,219
Then take this key

281
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,119
and leave this room for a while please.

282
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,319
What? We have to go out?

283
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,819
You can come in

284
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,319
after Officer Takagi finishes what he has to say.

285
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:37,519
Officer Takagi?

286
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,819
Oh, hey, where's Conan...

287
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,719
Oh, that's right.

288
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,119
Please allow me to explain.

289
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:52,019
The key to this case

290
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,219
is indeed the box locked with a key.

291
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:56,619
Mr. Kasuga, the food coordinator locked

292
00:14:56,619 --> 00:15:00,019
the box filled with fruit with the padlock

293
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,119
and sent it to the TV station.

294
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:06,819
Next, the producer Mr. Taruoka instructs Mr. Furuya, the AD

295
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,419
to lock the box with yet another padlock

296
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,219
and send it back to Mr. Kasuga.

297
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:17,619
Then Mr. Kasuga removes the padlock that he locked

298
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:20,019
and sends it back to the TV station again

299
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,219
and was stored in the storage room.

300
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,519
But then, why the corpse of Mr. Takegi

301
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,419
was found inside the box

302
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,719
until the program began?

303
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:35,019
Of course after Mr. Kasuga first locked the box,

304
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,919
Mr. Furuya, the AD who had come

305
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,219
to pick up the box from the TV station,

306
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:45,619
had confirmed that Mr. Takegi wasn't inside.

307
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,419
Moreover, that key,

308
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,119
was a special key with no spare

309
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:53,319
that it's not easy to pry open.

310
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,719
Of course it has no hidden door

311
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,119
and is in this condition.

312
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:59,719
How on earth did the perp...

313
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,319
Never mind the introductory remarks,

314
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:03,219
hurry up and out with the answer!

315
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:06,219
Please tell us, Officer Takagi!

316
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,219
More than me telling you,

317
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,519
it's faster if I show you.

318
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:17,119
This is indeed the answer!

319
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,619
Conan?

320
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,819
Where were you?

321
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,219
I was hiding behind the box.

322
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,919
I mean, where's Sera?

323
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,319
Where do you think she is?

324
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,019
Hey, don't tell me that...

325
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,419
In the box?

326
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,619
That's ridiculous! The box is locked and yet!

327
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,319
Then, why don't you open it?

328
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,719
No joke!

329
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,119
Why?

330
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,819
I used this.

331
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,819
A rubber tube?

332
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,219
It seems to be colored gold

333
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:17,019
just like the padlock though.

334
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:20,419
I had the large prop staff make it for me a while ago.

335
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,819
But, how on earth?

336
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,419
Yeah...

337
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,719
I'll use this and show you.

338
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,419
Lend me that padlock too, please.

339
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:30,419
Yeah.

340
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,519
When using the padlock,

341
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:38,119
fit the tube onto the tip of the bar.

342
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,119
Then, I forced this through the hole of the padlock.

343
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,019
See, like this,

344
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,719
it looks like the box is locked.

345
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,119
True!

346
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,719
True...

347
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:56,019
With this all you have to do is twist the lock

348
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:58,719
and the padlock will unlock easily.

349
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:01,919
Moreover, the border at which the tube attached is hidden

350
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,819
by the seam of the parts of the box

351
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,619
where the bar of the padlock is pushed through

352
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,319
and can't be seen.

353
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,819
In other words, I pretended to lock the key

354
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,219
using that tube,

355
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:15,219
unlocked the padlock and went inside the box.

356
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:19,119
Conan who was hiding behind the box pulled the tube out

357
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,119
and then really locked the padlock.

358
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,719
That's how it was done.

359
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:28,819
Right. The point of this trick is the padlock.

360
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:32,119
That is, you don't need the key to lock the box.

361
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,619
Mr. Kasuga who knew the contents to begin with

362
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:40,119
didn't need to open the box using such a trick.

363
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:45,019
Producer Taruoka who instructs the padlock to be locked

364
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:48,919
also didn't have the chance to use this trick.

365
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,119
If so, the only person left is,

366
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,719
the one who was instructed

367
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:56,319
by Mr. Taruoka to lock the box and send it back...

368
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,419
Mr. Wataru Furuya, the AD.

369
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:04,219
I think you're the only one who could've done it?

370
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,119
You probably just did it to get your reward

371
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,119
for telling the champion

372
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,219
what the theme fruit in the box was.

373
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,819
You must've been opening the box each time

374
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,819
in the storage room.

375
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,319
Last night Mr. Takegi was hiding.

376
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,819
Since he saw you and got at you for what you were doing,

377
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:31,619
you got into a struggle...

378
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,019
You killed him inadvertently,

379
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,619
and then hid him into the box

380
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,219
at the spur of the moment, no?

381
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,819
Where do you have such evidence?

382
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,919
The evidence is...

383
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,219
In your stomach, Mr. AD.

384
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,319
Huh?

385
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,119
Mr. AD, after you put that man into the box,

386
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,419
you drank up about ten juiced apples

387
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,619
because there wasn't enough space to put him inside, right?

388
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:00,619
You did this by using the little prop juice mixer

389
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:03,619
that was in the storage room, no?

390
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,519
After all, the footage of the surveillance camera

391
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,019
shows that you weren't holding anything

392
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:09,619
when you came out of storage room.

393
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,319
Even if it were so,

394
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,419
it's already digested in my stomach.

395
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,119
Don't you know?

396
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,919
There is a substance in the seed of apples

397
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,819
called amygdalin,

398
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,719
and over eating it can cause problems, you know?

399
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,119
Mr. AD, when you put the apples in the juice mixer,

400
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,819
you didn't take away the seeds, did you?

401
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,819
Well, don't worry.

402
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,419
If it were seeds from about ten apples,

403
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,419
it can't give you cyanide poisoning.

404
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:44,719
But, if you haven't eaten anything from morning,

405
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:46,819
I'm sure you haven't moved your bowels yet.

406
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,319
So, I think it'll come out in time,

407
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,119
the seeds of the rare apple

408
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,619
that weren't crushed by the juice mixer.

409
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,119
When they come out,

410
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,919
the case is closed.

411
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,419
I guess it's a case of your bowel tells it all.

412
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:30,319
Oh! It's on the internet news!

413
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,919
Just as Sera had said,

414
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,719
the seeds came out of the AD

415
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,219
and matched those of the theme apples.

416
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:39,919
It seems that the champion Mr. Kurimura confessed too.

417
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,719
That he knew the theme fruit beforehand.

418
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,819
But, Conan was really amazing this time too.

419
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,419
I didn't know that...

420
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,119
the seeds of apples were poisonous.

421
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,419
I... I just happened to remember

422
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,719
what Shinichi told me.

423
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:59,719
You and Shinichi are really close, aren't you?

424
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:01,719
By the way...

425
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,319
I have something I'd like to ask you, Sera.

426
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,219
Oh yeah, you were said something like that a while ago.

427
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:13,119
Sera, by any chance...

428
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,619
Have you ever met me somewhere before?

429
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,719
Huh?

430
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,219
Well, I wonder...

431
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,719
What?

432
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:32,019
Sorry, but I can't tell you that.

433
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,119
Not until the time comes.

434
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,519
-"Next Episode" -These are the things

435
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,919
my belated husband had collected.

436
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,919
I see.

437
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,819
Watch out, Dad.

438
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:49,319
Be careful!

439
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,819
Yeah, I know.

440
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,319
Just what is the meaning of this?

441
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,019
What is all this commotion about?

442
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,019
Why did you cancel the passing the audition?

443
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,719
Madam's room is...

444
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,419
Mama!

445
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,119
Next Conan,

446
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,819
"A Diamond, A Portrait and A Great Actress"
