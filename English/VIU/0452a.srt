1
00:00:01,492 --> 00:00:02,891
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:04,791
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:06,291
Today's episode is a one-hour special!

4
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:07,491
It's the long awaited travelling performers' troupe story.

5
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:09,291
A phantom appears on the stage of Konpira!

6
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:10,691
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:12,291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:14,392
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:53,591
This is just great!

10
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:55,591
It's nice and easygoing.

11
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:57,091
Yep.

12
00:01:57,092 --> 00:02:00,091
I'm thirsty. I'd like a shot of beer, I tell you!

13
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:04,191
Dad, we've come all the way to Shikoku, you know.

14
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,591
We should be more interested in eating than drinking!

15
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,192
-Sanuki udon! -Sanuki udon!

16
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,691
I know.

17
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,891
That's why I want to moisten my mouth a little before that.

18
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:16,891
I'll bet you'll drink and fall asleep during the performance.

19
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:21,191
Right, I mean after Tamanosuke invited us and all!

20
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:22,991
I know.

21
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:25,391
Hey, the opera house that Tamanosuke and his troupe is going to perform

22
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:29,191
at called Kanamaru-za is a very famous place, isn't it?

23
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,291
Right!

24
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,891
Every spring they perform

25
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:34,591
the "Shikoku Konpira Kabuki Great Performance",

26
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:38,692
"Konpira Station" -every year a huge number of people come to watch it.

27
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,091
Look, look!

28
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:43,891
You're right. Amazing!

29
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:46,392
This is sure going to be something to look forward to!

30
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:53,491
"The Phantom of Konpira."

31
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,291
"Miyatake Hand-made Udon."

32
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,591
Is this the noodle shop that was recommended?

33
00:02:57,592 --> 00:02:59,991
It looks like an ordinary house.

34
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:01,792
Welcome!

35
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:06,691
Well, well, appetizers to go with beer!

36
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,191
These are toppings to be put into the udon, Dad!

37
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:11,291
"Menu" -Thank you for waiting.

38
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,491
Oh, here it comes.

39
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,191
The tempura is over there so help yourself to as much as you like.

40
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:16,392
Okay!

41
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:21,892
It's delicious!

42
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:25,491
They just take your tongue with them!

43
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:27,491
This is really the real taste.

44
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:30,491
This sure is the taste of the genuine!

45
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,191
Okay, I've made up my mind!

46
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,391
Made up your mind?

47
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,191
I mean that, that.

48
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,391
What?

49
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:40,291
"Sanuki Udon roaming eating contest"?

50
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:43,091
"Omotesandou" -Hey, you girls over there!

51
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:45,591
Please use this cane.

52
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,591
Just return it when you come back down.

53
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:50,491
-Thank you! -Thank you very much.

54
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:53,992
Canes, my foot. I mean we're not old.

55
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,691
How many steps are there here anyway?

56
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:05,391
Until the main shrine which is at the very top,

57
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:08,591
it seems there are 785 steps all together.

58
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:09,691
Seven hundred...

59
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,692
And eighty-five?

60
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:14,291
Easy, easy, duck soup!

61
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,191
"100th stage" -We said to begin with that

62
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,392
if there's something as convenient as this.

63
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,591
Where's dad?

64
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:22,592
Over there.

65
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:25,091
This is so good!

66
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:27,991
Locally brewed sake sure is different!

67
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:29,492
Dad!

68
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,891
What about praying at the shrine?

69
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:34,291
Sorry, but pray for me too while you're at it!

70
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,491
What?

71
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,291
Besides, Kanamaru-za is right there, isn't it?

72
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,791
I'll wait for you guys here.

73
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:41,491
Miss! One more serving, please!

74
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:44,492
What happened to tasting udon at different restaurants?

75
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,391
I've finally made it.

76
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:01,491
It's so unfair only getting to ride the basket half way up!

77
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:03,191
What took you so long, Sonoko?

78
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:06,591
You should've stayed below and rested together with Dad!

79
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:09,291
Hey, don't put me in the same boat as Pops!

80
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,491
Konpira is the god that protects the sea, isn't it?

81
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:17,492
Right. It says that it is worshipped fervently by people who work at sea.

82
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:21,591
It's about time. Shall we head for Kanamaru-za?

83
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:23,091
Let's go!

84
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:25,991
I wonder if Tamanosuke is doing okay.

85
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,391
Yes, and Renge too.

86
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:30,091
-Right! That's the point! -What?

87
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:33,291
I wonder if those two are still lovey-dovey with each other.

88
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:37,092
-I've got my eyes on Tamanosuke, you see. -Come on, Sonoko.

89
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:40,692
What's with everybody...

90
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:46,746
Hello, everyone.

91
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,547
Thank you for coming such a long way.

92
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:51,824
This is hopeless.

93
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:53,124
I guess they're doing well.

94
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,625
You can tell just by looking at them that they're in love.

95
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,924
Conan!

96
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,325
Megumi.

97
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,125
Hello.

98
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,224
What's the matter?

99
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,724
The little ones are not here today, are they?

100
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:07,424
Oh, those kids?

101
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:09,624
They sort of couldn't make it.

102
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,524
I'm glad. It makes me so happy!

103
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:13,124
Hey, Megumi.

104
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,424
Hey, hey, what's this glasses kid!

105
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:16,524
You're popular, aren't you?

106
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,724
I'm gonna get you.

107
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:19,125
Conan.

108
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,324
This way, please.

109
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:25,824
It's a crawl-in entrance, so please watch your head.

110
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,825
And what's a crawl-in entrance?

111
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:30,824
-It's hurt... -Dad!

112
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,824
Are you all right?

113
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,525
I knew he'd do that.

114
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:38,824
We're still making preparations for the performance

115
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:41,024
so everyone's still busy here.

116
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,924
My, how fantastic!

117
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:46,824
Oh, they're right in the midst of checking the movement.

118
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:48,824
"Seri (Trapdoor)" -of the trapdoor on stage.

119
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,024
Trapdoor?

120
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:53,324
It's being pushed up by a lot of stagehands in the basement.

121
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:56,424
The actors come out from there and pose.

122
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,224
The stage is moving!

123
00:06:58,225 --> 00:06:59,924
That's a revolving stage.

124
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:03,324
Likewise, stagehands are pushing from the basement and turning the stage.

125
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,224
They're doing it in the same way as was done in the past.

126
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,824
They used to call the basement Naraku (pitfall) in the past,

127
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,824
because water drainage was bad

128
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:11,724
and the stagehands had it tough.

129
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,824
That's how it ended up being called that way.

130
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:16,224
That path on the other side is the flowery way.

131
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,824
The actors come from the birdhouse beyond

132
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:22,224
weaving through the audience and appear, then head towards the stage.

133
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,424
The thing you see part way along the way

134
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:24,624
is the Suppon (Soft-shelled turtle).

135
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,224
Just like the trapdoor that you just saw,

136
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,224
it is devised to rise from below.

137
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,724
And the thing right above the flowery way

138
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,224
that looks like a crane is called "Kakesuji".

139
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:36,024
It's used to pull the actors up and suspend them in air.

140
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:37,824
That's amazing!

141
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,524
"Grape vine trellis" -The ceiling is made of bamboo in trelliswork,

142
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:44,924
and confetti of cherry blossom petals are scattered from there.

143
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:47,224
"Balcony seat" -It's like we've time slipped 100 years back!

144
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:48,624
True!

145
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,724
It's even further back than 100 years.

146
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,924
Kanamaru-za was originally built towards

147
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:55,124
the end of the Edo Period, in the year of Tenpo

148
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,324
after approval from the shogunate.

149
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:01,024
It is the oldest playhouse in existence in Japan.

150
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:05,624
It's really an honor for an actor to be able to perform here.

151
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,125
Besides, you're both love-dovey too...

152
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:10,624
Sonoko.

153
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,324
I heard that you will be doing a performance of a samurai show

154
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,424
that takes after the Phantom of the Opera today.

155
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:18,324
That's right. This is a gruesome story of love and hate,

156
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:21,224
takes place on the flamboyant stage of this opera house,

157
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:24,724
between a mysterious phantom who covers his ugly dreadful face with a mask,

158
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:29,024
and a pretty singing princess and her lover.

159
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:32,125
Taking after the Phantom of the Opera, this is the Phantom of the Konpira!

160
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:44,525
-You're arrested! -Arrested!

161
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,024
My beloved princess, sing!

162
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,224
For me, who loves you!

163
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,224
For the angel of music!

164
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,924
Sing! You must sing!

165
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:59,324
You pure angel! Brilliant angel!

166
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,624
Take my soul way up to heaven!

167
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,124
Don't sing! Wake up!

168
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,825
That's the devil! It's a ghost!

169
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,124
How nice.

170
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,424
Hey, who's that?

171
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:15,724
He is Mr. Tatsuhiko Rausu, who's going to be supporting

172
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,324
our performance this time.

173
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:19,124
A sponsor.

174
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,324
Rausu?

175
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,624
The Rausu Concieron in Kansai?

176
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,424
I did read about it in the papers.

177
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,224
The family head passed away

178
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:31,025
and his yet young son became his successor.

179
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:32,725
Hi there!

180
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:36,224
Oh, no! Don't...

181
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,724
Not all of sudden like that.

182
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:41,625
Hello, I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

183
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,324
Give it your best shot, Renge!

184
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:45,225
Yes, I will. Renge?

185
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,924
I, Tatsuhiko Rausu is with you all the way!

186
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:51,024
Thank you.

187
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,524
But, I only play a small part in this play.

188
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,624
I was thinking about that, but no matter how much I think about it,

189
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,924
you're the only one fit to play the role of the heroine singing princess.

190
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:01,524
-So, why not change... -Mr. Rausu!

191
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:04,325
I, the leader of this troupe is who decides,

192
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,724
not you, the sponsor.

193
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:09,124
Neither the phantom, right?

194
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,524
Absolutely.

195
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:11,724
Phantom?

196
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:14,324
You have no intention of taking in my request, do you?

197
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:15,424
Of course not!

198
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:17,624
Well, all I wanted to do was see my childhood friend

199
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,325
at her proud moment appearing as the star of the show.

200
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:24,724
Request. Changing heroines.

201
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:28,024
Childhood friend and the phantom.

202
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:30,524
This sounds just like that famous opera...

203
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,424
The Phantom of the Opera.

204
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,024
It's exactly that, don't you think?

205
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,924
He's Renge's childhood friend.

206
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:45,824
Wouldn't it be better if you would be a little more honest, Tamanosuke?

207
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,024
I'm talking about the feelings you have for Renge.

208
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,224
You like her, don't you?

209
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:51,424
Mr. Rausu.

210
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:54,425
If you dilly-dally, I'm going to take her away from you.

211
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,324
It's a love triangle?

212
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,525
Sonoko!

213
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,625
I don't mind, troupe leader.

214
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:06,424
I'll give Renge my role.

215
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:08,024
What are you talking about?

216
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:10,424
Don't be silly.

217
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:14,324
The purpose we had you come here would completely be lost!

218
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:15,724
That's right!

219
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,724
I've been your fan all this time!

220
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,825
Just sharing the stage with you will make me happy.

221
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,524
Thank you.

222
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,124
What a beauty!

223
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,924
She sure looks familiar...

224
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,324
Ms. Romi Karube.

225
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:31,024
She's a famous young stage actress.

226
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,424
Big brother went to ask her to act the heroine part for this play.

227
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:37,224
He was sure that she was going to refuse, but on the contrary,

228
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,224
she surprisingly agreed immediately.

229
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,724
Oh well, I'm so very sorry.

230
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,225
Please do your best.

231
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:48,625
Well, well, I guess she doesn't like me.

232
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:55,024
I'm really can't see well in dark places.

233
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:58,024
Somebody! Give him the luminous tape for sponsor.

234
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,224
Luminous?

235
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:00,825
Does she mean this?

236
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:03,024
What a dirty tape.

237
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,524
It's tape that shines in the dark.

238
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:07,424
Look. There are some over there too.

239
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,124
You're a smart fellow, sonny.

240
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,424
You're right, when the stage turns dark, it is pasted on the stage

241
00:12:12,425 --> 00:12:15,325
so that the performers don't stand in the wrong place.

242
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:22,824
Either way, you don't have a chance, Sonoko.

243
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,524
I'm just fine.

244
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:26,924
-I've found someone else. -Someone else?

245
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:29,224
"Otoya Kawatake (25), Actor" -So we're finally starting practice.

246
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:30,924
Talk about a slow moving stage performance.

247
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:34,624
But, all I'm interested in is my role so...

248
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,524
He's so cool.

249
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:38,324
Move it, move it! Out of my way!

250
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,225
Oh, I'm sorry.

251
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,524
Who let them in? It's no time to let the audience in yet, is it?

252
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:45,624
What a snob.

253
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,924
Sonoko!

254
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:50,124
I'm sorry, Mr. Nabe. I should've introduced them to you earlier.

255
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,224
He is Detective Kogoro Mouri and...

256
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:54,524
A detective?

257
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,824
Kogoro Mouri?

258
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:57,425
You mean that famous...

259
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,224
Yes, I am the famous Kogoro Mouri!

260
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:04,524
His daughter, Ran.

261
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:05,624
Nice to meet you.

262
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,625
And...

263
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,224
He's the boy I love, Conan Edogawa!

264
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,724
How do you do?

265
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:14,224
-And she is... -I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

266
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:15,425
Nice to meet you.

267
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:20,524
I don't care who, I don't like people getting in the way of my job.

268
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:23,024
The former leader was stricter when it came to things like this.

269
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:25,225
Father is father and I'm me.

270
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:28,824
Well, but I wouldn't have been able to pay my debts back

271
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,324
if it hadn't been for this job,

272
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:33,624
so I am grateful to you, leader.

273
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,824
Hey, let's go!

274
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:37,225
-Yes, sir! -Don't get in the way of practice.

275
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:43,624
Okay, let's begin!

276
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,524
Renge, will you go to my room backstage and get me my mouthwash?

277
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,124
-All right. -Conan and the rest, go sit in the audience.

278
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,325
Okay!

279
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:03,825
Watch out!

280
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,600
Romi!

281
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,825
Are you all right? Romi!

282
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:44,012
Romi!

283
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:45,536
What's this?

284
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:48,436
Somebody, get an ambulance! Call the ambulance!

285
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,636
No, leader.

286
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:53,537
It's no big thing. I'm not all that hurt.

287
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:54,732
Romi.

288
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:56,602
It's just a scratch.

289
00:14:56,603 --> 00:15:00,302
But, this stage is known for coming in close contact with the audience,

290
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:02,602
so I've got to wear a bit more greasepaint than usual.

291
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:05,202
Shoots, how dare...

292
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:07,402
What dirt bag could've done something like this?

293
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:09,302
Empty that place up right away!

294
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:10,602
We've got to fix this up immediately

295
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:12,602
or we won't be able to make it in time for the show!

296
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:15,702
He's the pits! He's the one who did it!

297
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:16,703
Sonoko.

298
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:18,202
Let's give her treatment immediately.

299
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:20,603
Let's go to your room backstage, Romi.

300
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,302
There's a cut that looks like it's been slashed

301
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,303
with a knife or something on that rope.

302
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:29,602
Could it be the work of the phantom?

303
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:31,002
Don't be silly!

304
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:33,002
That's just some sort of prank.

305
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:35,202
Then, what about this?

306
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:38,302
If worse comes to worse, we may really have to change heroines.

307
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:40,102
I won't let that happen.

308
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,802
This is really challenging.

309
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:45,402
I won't let the phantom has his way.

310
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,302
Right, leader?

311
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:50,302
Uh, I hate to interrupt your conversation,

312
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:51,602
but what is this phantom thing about?

313
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:53,502
The Phantom of the Konpira!

314
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:54,902
Like I was saying, that's not...

315
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:57,802
If I remember correctly, that's the title of this performance,

316
00:15:57,803 --> 00:15:59,402
Phantom of the Konpira.

317
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:01,302
Yes, but...

318
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:03,902
I see! It's the chandelier, the chandelier!

319
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:05,702
Right!

320
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:06,902
Chandelier?

321
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:11,803
Well, this stage that made after the Phantom of the Opera...

322
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:15,402
A chandelier's going to come falling onto

323
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:17,603
the first actress that acts the role of the heroine.

324
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:22,102
Not only that, the connection you have with one another,

325
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:26,302
greatly resembles the character setting of the Phantom of the Opera!

326
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:27,702
Come to think of it, you mentioned that

327
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,602
you wouldn't give in to the demand of the phantom

328
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:31,902
just a while ago, didn't you, Tamanosuke?

329
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,402
That's what exactly how it went in the story too!

330
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:34,702
But in the Phantom of the Opera,

331
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,703
the phantom was the one who demanded that the heroine be changed.

332
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:40,702
What does this mean?

333
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,602
It seems that you all have some you're hiding from us.

334
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,302
Well, well, as expected of a famous detective.

335
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:53,503
Tamanosuke, maybe we should tell Mr. Mouri about it already?

336
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:56,803
All right.

337
00:16:57,303 --> 00:17:01,703
At first, I thought it was just a prank that someone was playing on us.

338
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:08,902
After all, it didn't really do anything

339
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:13,202
but, appear and scare people.

340
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:14,702
However...

341
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:16,202
10 of these types of letters.

342
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,003
"To troupe leader" -were delivered here.

343
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:24,302
The contents are all the same.

344
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:26,802
What in earth is the meaning of this?

345
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:30,602
"Get a large audience, you shall be stabbed to death in the end."

346
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:33,202
"Phantom of the Konpira."

347
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:35,302
It's only natural to want to get a large audience.

348
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,502
I mean, after all this is a stage play.

349
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,502
"You shall be stabbed to death in the end"

350
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:41,502
sure sounds like a dialogue in the play too.

351
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:44,602
Isn't that a code? About the word "Sanuki"?

352
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,302
It's amazing you figured it out, sonny!

353
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:47,702
Sanuki?

354
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:50,802
What bothers me is that the code is too easy to decipher.

355
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,202
Sanuki...

356
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:56,802
Oh, I see! Sanuki means

357
00:17:56,803 --> 00:18:00,002
removing the letter "sa" from the sentence and read it!

358
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,402
Let's see.

359
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:05,002
It may be easier if you changed the entire sentence into hiragana first.

360
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,702
So, the "sa" is removed.

361
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,102
Then...

362
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:10,102
That's incredible!

363
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,302
"Change the heroine to Renge"?

364
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:16,002
This is genuine blackmail!

365
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:18,302
But, if we take every such thing that we get seriously,

366
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:19,802
we can't be doing any stage performance!

367
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:21,102
Exactly.

368
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:24,902
But, after ignoring it, look what just happened a while ago.

369
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,802
So, it wasn't just a simple threat.

370
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:31,902
Which means, something else is bound to happen.

371
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,103
Leader.

372
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:35,602
I'm going through with this!

373
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:37,302
If it's okay with you, Romi...

374
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:39,302
Well, if you quit because of something like this,

375
00:18:39,303 --> 00:18:40,702
I guess you can't be called an actress.

376
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,402
Hey, hey.

377
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:45,402
Are things going to be okay, Mr. Mouri?

378
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:47,602
There seems to be no direct connection

379
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:50,702
between the blackmail and collapse of the paper lantern.

380
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:52,102
And as for the cut found in the rope,

381
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,802
we've got to investigate further

382
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:56,302
to see if it was really cut with a knife too.

383
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,402
True.

384
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,602
Even if the police were to do something right now,

385
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:02,102
as far as the play is concerned,

386
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:06,602
they would have no choice but to leave the final decision up to the leader.

387
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:10,202
Okay, all set, the cast stands as is.

388
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:12,702
I want you all to do your best at today's show,

389
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:15,703
as well as tomorrow's general public performance.

390
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,903
Come, my beloved child!

391
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,002
Believe me and sing!

392
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:42,902
Those who believe in me shall not die!

393
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:45,202
Who is it?

394
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,602
Please wait!

395
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,002
Are you god?

396
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,102
Or are you the devil?

397
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,802
He's the devil! I shall punish you!

398
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:56,403
You inhabitant of the world of darkness where there is no light!

399
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:01,702
You ignorant and impudent youth! You shall be cursed!

400
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:05,102
You who attempt to take away my love and victory,

401
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:09,402
shall learn of the power of the world of darkness!

402
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:11,103
How touching!

403
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:18,003
Just as I thought. Dad drank again after that so...

404
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:22,503
What is she looking at from some time ago?

405
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:28,503
That's...

406
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:31,503
Hey, what's that?

407
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,102
Look there!

408
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:36,302
What happened?

409
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,703
Who is that jerk?

410
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,702
-What's up? -What's wrong?

411
00:20:43,703 --> 00:20:45,102
What's with her voice?

412
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,702
That's...

413
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,002
She sounds just like...

414
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:49,403
A frog.

415
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:53,302
What's wrong with her?

416
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:56,502
This is the same as the Phantom of the Opera too!

417
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:57,803
Seriously?

418
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,202
Darn, where'd he go?

419
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,902
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

420
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:14,403
Romi, come back!

421
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:21,803
What's happening?

422
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,502
This is the only way in or out.

423
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:31,002
There are this many people in the audience and yet,

424
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:34,202
no one seems to have noticed the phantom passing through at all.

425
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:35,903
Why?

426
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:38,503
What's that?

427
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,802
Hey, brat, what're you doing?

428
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:49,402
Well, I thought it was fun being in a high place like this so I...

429
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:50,602
This isn't an amusement park!

430
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:52,302
Only authorized personnel are allowed in here!

431
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:54,302
I'm sorry!

432
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:57,902
Someone switch Romi's mouthwash?

433
00:21:57,903 --> 00:22:00,802
She thought it was the same mouthwash as usual.

434
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:05,402
After the curtains went up, she went ahead and drank it.

435
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,403
Then...

436
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:09,102
How cruel. Who could've done something like that?

437
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,702
Don't tell me that...

438
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:12,902
Never mind that for now.

439
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:15,303
The problem is what to do about this stage performance.

440
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:19,402
You were Romi's prompter, weren't you?

441
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:21,002
You know the lines, don't you?

442
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:23,102
Don't tell me that you want me to...

443
00:22:23,103 --> 00:22:25,102
We've no time to be arguing.

444
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:26,903
The audience is waiting!

445
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:30,302
But...

446
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:33,503
The curtains are down now but we'll open them in 15 minutes.

447
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:38,603
So, hurry!

448
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:45,302
The phantom? It' probably just a part of the performance.

449
00:22:45,303 --> 00:22:49,003
It seems that the others in the audience think so too, but...

450
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,403
Where's Conan?

451
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:57,603
A dead end, huh? This is almost like a labyrinth.

452
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:07,402
Don't be afraid, my beloved child.

453
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:08,503
Who's there?

454
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:13,203
This is not too good... where am I?

455
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,302
I wonder if I can do it.

456
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:20,502
I wonder if I can act out Romi's part all right.

457
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:22,402
Don't worry.

458
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:23,403
The phantom?

459
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:27,603
I, the angle of music is with you.

460
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:39,503
Nobody's inside?

461
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:41,503
What's going on?

462
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:47,602
After meeting him, my heart was filled with joy.

463
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,902
But, he is an inhabitant of the world of darkness.

464
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:52,202
I am a captive of darkness.

465
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:55,102
Let's stop talking of the world of darkness.

466
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:59,002
I shall guide you to the world of light.

467
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,702
I shall be with you wherever you go!

468
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:02,602
Conan, where were you?

469
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:03,702
To the restroom.

470
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:07,002
Please swear that I am your only love.

471
00:24:07,003 --> 00:24:11,002
I swear that you are my only love.

472
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:13,302
There is no way you can go back,

473
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:15,602
since you have already come here,

474
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:17,002
to this basement cell that is shut off from all things

475
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:19,502
and everything vanishes in darkness!

476
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:22,602
I am not afraid of your appearance.

477
00:24:22,603 --> 00:24:26,602
What frightens me is your distorted heart!

478
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:28,302
Renge is fantastic!

479
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:30,302
She sure doesn't seem like a substitute actress at all!

480
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,202
This showing is a whopping success.

481
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:35,402
That substitute actress is fantastic!

482
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:38,103
I'm looking forward to tomorrow's show.

483
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:57,203
Shoots, this place is so eerie.

484
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:18,602
This is...

485
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:20,003
What on earth...

486
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,302
Mr. Nabe?

487
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:24,802
Freeze!

488
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:26,602
Stay right there and don't move!

489
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:29,502
No! I didn't do it!

490
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:30,903
I didn't kill him!
