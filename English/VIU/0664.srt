"Hiroshi Yagisawa (34)"

2
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,889
Good evening, Anera.

3
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:43,589
Hey, not that way.

4
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:51,389
What's the matter, Cool?

5
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:23,689
If all cases were men,

6
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,489
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

7
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,089
There are four marks on the map that was found.

8
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:28,989
The Youth Detective Squad wonders if it's a treasure or a case.

9
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,589
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,389
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:34,789
His name is Detective Conan!

12
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:04,844
"Good Work Cool 2"

13
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:08,344
"The following day, Saturday"

14
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:11,841
Genta, you're licking candy again?

15
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,441
Today it's grape flavour.

16
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:16,541
You're licking candy drops a lot

17
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,141
even when we're going to school, right?

18
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:20,141
If I lick it just before leaving home,

19
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,141
I finish licking it just around when I get to school.

20
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:25,541
You're going to get cavities.

21
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,341
I mean, he probably has them already, no?

22
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,541
Sakaeya Cleaning?

23
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,941
What, what?

24
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,541
It's a map, isn't it?

25
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,341
Is it a treasure map?

26
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:45,041
I don't think so,

27
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,141
because the four X marks all seem to be houses.

28
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,841
Maybe they are houses that burglars are targeting?

29
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,141
Burglars?

30
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,341
See. There have been a several such burglaries

31
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,841
in the Yonehara community area.

32
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,141
Idiot.

33
00:03:58,141 --> 00:03:59,841
Why would such a map be drawn in back of a flyer...

34
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,241
I'm sure.

35
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,641
We've got to report it right away.

36
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,541
Are you guys listening?

37
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,041
Okay, let's go!

38
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,441
-All right! -Hey!

39
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:09,141
Aren't you going to the library...

40
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:13,741
His imagination way far out does yours.

41
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,041
Geez.

42
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:19,341
Then, you haven't been burglarized or anything?

43
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,941
"Ooga" -I'm glad.

44
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:24,141
We made it in time didn't we, Mitsuhiko.

45
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,141
Yes.

46
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,641
"Norifumi Ooga (36)" -But, I wonder if it's really something

47
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,341
that a burglar drew.

48
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:32,341
It's very likely.

49
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,341
Have you seen any suspicious person

50
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,041
or encounter any strange occurrences recently?

51
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,341
Nothing in particular, but...

52
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:42,041
Do you know, the three houses?

53
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,341
No.

54
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,941
"Misako (34)" -It sure is creepy.

55
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:49,841
Why is our house marked with an X?

56
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,841
Hey, don't go on the grass!

57
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,241
You too.

58
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:59,541
I told you not to smoke in front of Tomoya.

59
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,641
"Tomoya (6)" -Sorry.

60
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:05,841
What do you do for a living?

61
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:07,341
I'm a constructor.

62
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,641
At any rate, don't bring strange things over.

63
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,641
How about it?

64
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:17,541
Do you know anything about the three houses?

65
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,541
"Eguchi" -Nothing in particular.

66
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,341
"Tamae Eguchi (32)" -We haven't been burglarized,

67
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:24,541
nor I have I seen anybody suspicious.

68
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:34,841
There's been no strange occurrences either.

69
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:38,141
Are you living here alone, ma'am?

70
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:40,641
Yes.

71
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,041
What do you do for a living?

72
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,241
An illustrator.

73
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,141
So, I guess that's enough already.

74
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,541
I'm busy, you know.

75
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,441
How is it?

76
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,541
Does anything come to mind?

77
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,341
"Shizuko Fujiki (61)" -No.

78
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:01,941
Who on earth made something like this?

79
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:20,941
What's wrong, mother?

80
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:23,341
Koichi.

81
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,941
These children say that they found this map.

82
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:28,441
Map?

83
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:32,341
See? There's an X mark on our house.

84
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:35,641
We thought that it could be a map that a burglar drew.

85
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,041
Have you seen any suspicious people lately?

86
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,841
Were there any strange occurrences and stuff like that?

87
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,441
"Koichi Fujiki (33)"

88
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,941
I don't think there was any in particular.

89
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:48,641
Do you know any of those three houses?

90
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,941
No.

91
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,241
What do you do for a living?

92
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:53,841
I'm a businessman.

93
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:57,141
I'm getting kind of worried.

94
00:06:57,141 --> 00:07:00,641
No, I don't think it has anything to do with a burglar.

95
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:02,641
But, if it bothers you,

96
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:05,241
I'll keep this map and take it to the police.

97
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,341
No, if we find out that is what it is,

98
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,141
we'll take it to the police.

99
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,841
-Okay then. -Yes.

100
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:17,241
Police cars are here?

101
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,841
"Eitaro Kouzuki" -Kouzuki. It's over here.

102
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:22,741
Maybe the burglar already broke in here?

103
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:25,141
Darn, we were too late.

104
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:29,041
Hello. Did anything happen at the Kouzuki residence?

105
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,641
Mr. Kouzuki passed away.

106
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:35,441
He was found at the bottom of the stairs bleeding from his head

107
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:40,041
in the underground pass a little ways from here on Beika Boulevard,

108
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,141
last night around 10:00 pm.

109
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:45,141
At the bottom of the stairs?

110
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,841
Did he fall to his death...

111
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,641
or is it a murder case?

112
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:03,841
So, if anything comes up...

113
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:05,841
"Sawako Kouzuki (35)"

114
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:08,241
Thank you very much.

115
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,841
Who is she?

116
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,141
She's his only daughter, Sawako.

117
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:16,041
Maybe this map has nothing to do with a burglary,

118
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,241
but rather has something to do with Mr. Kouzuki's case.

119
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:21,041
What do you mean?

120
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,941
This map was drawn by that culprit.

121
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:27,441
And, he is still after somebody in the remaining three houses.

122
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,041
What? What shall we do, Mitsuhiko?

123
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:36,941
Officer, this map...

124
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:38,141
I'm busy now.

125
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:40,341
Go ask for directions at the police box.

126
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,441
What the heck?

127
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,041
I won't give them any information anymore!

128
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,541
What do you think?

129
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,241
The map, do we have a case?

130
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:54,441
No connection. I'd like to say but...

131
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:57,841
At any rate, let's go take a look at the site.

132
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:01,041
Hey, you guys, wait for me at the library park.

133
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,141
Where are you going?

134
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:14,341
What is it?

135
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:17,541
Did the dead person's hand really smell of cigarette?

136
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,341
Yes, sir. No mistake about it.

137
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,041
When I got there,

138
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,541
I smelled it slightly from his bloody right hand.

139
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,641
But, his daughter told me that he doesn't smoke.

140
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:31,741
Moreover, there were no cigarette butts near the scene of the crime.

141
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,841
Strange.

142
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,241
Cigarette.

143
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,341
Conan sure is late.

144
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:39,841
While we're doing this,

145
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,541
the evil hands of the culprit may be...

146
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,841
Say, why don't we do our thing on our own...

147
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:47,141
Wait until Conan comes back.

148
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:48,341
Okay.

149
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:50,441
It sure is hot, don't you think?

150
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,741
I want ice cream, don't you?

151
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,341
There's a vending machine in the library.

152
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:57,341
Let's go get some.

153
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:59,141
How about you, Ai?

154
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,541
No, thanks.

155
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,741
-Ice cream... -What should I get?

156
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:31,568
What on earth are they doing?

157
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,468
Mr. Yagisawa, hello.

158
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:41,468
Hi, Conan, long time no see.

159
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:45,568
Cool! How're you doing?

160
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:48,268
Do you know them?

161
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:50,668
Yes. I got to solve a murder case

162
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:53,568
thanks to Cool some time ago.

163
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:54,868
By the way, you guys...

164
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:56,868
We lost the map.

165
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:02,668
Maybe the culprit of Mr. Kouzuki's incident took it away?

166
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:05,268
You mean Mr. Kouzuki who passed away last night?

167
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,268
Do you know him, Mr. Yagisawa?

168
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:11,568
Rather... Cool's the one who found his body.

169
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:13,068
What?

170
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:16,368
And, that map that you guys are looking for,

171
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:19,668
is it the one with the X mark on Mr. Kouzuki's house

172
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,668
as well as three other houses?

173
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:24,068
How did you know?

174
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:27,468
Because I drew that map.

175
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:35,768
I drew that for my wife who takes Cool for a walk for me at times,

176
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:36,968
to let her know which houses to be careful of,

177
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:38,968
by marking them with X marks.

178
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:42,768
My wife dropped that map while she was walking the dog.

179
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,368
Mrs. Ooga who lives in the first house, has a bad temper.

180
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:48,868
Back when Cool went a bit into the lawn,

181
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,568
she bawled him out.

182
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,568
I thought it better not to let Cool near the 2nd house

183
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,668
which is the Eguchi residence,

184
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:57,768
because she sprays insecticide on the roses.

185
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:00,368
Mrs. Eguchi uses organic fertilizer

186
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:02,068
and since dogs like the smell,

187
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,568
they tend to go near it, right?

188
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:07,068
Yes, and the 3rd house, the Fujiki residence.

189
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:08,668
The mother of the house is fussy about cleanliness

190
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:09,968
to the point of being phobic

191
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:12,868
and hates dog's urine to the extreme.

192
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:14,468
Right.

193
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,968
How did you know, Conan?

194
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:20,368
That lady, not only flooded the area around her house

195
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:22,668
but did the same to the house opposite hers

196
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:24,968
as well as at the foot of the telephone pole.

197
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,668
I see.

198
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:30,368
And, so Mr. Kouzuki also hated dog urine, right?

199
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:31,868
Yes.

200
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:34,768
He used to clean the outside of his house all the time.

201
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:38,168
When Cool almost urinated during his walk,

202
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:40,268
the man shooed him away with a wooden broom.

203
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:41,568
Come to think of it,

204
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:44,168
there were a lot of PET bottles lined out.

205
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,868
Those are to keep cats away.

206
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,468
I saw that, I figured it out.

207
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,068
So that's what is was.

208
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:54,268
That map had nothing to do with any case then.

209
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:58,368
But, another question's come up.

210
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:04,368
Who could've stolen the map that was drawn for such a trivial reason?

211
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,268
The person who stole the map

212
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:09,768
is probably the one who killed Mr. Kouzuki.

213
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:11,968
What?

214
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:16,768
That person may not have known who or why the map was drawn,

215
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:17,968
but after Mitsuhiko showed the map

216
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:20,768
that indicated some kind of relationship with Mr. Kouzuki,

217
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:23,468
that person not wanting it to be taken to the police stole it.

218
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:25,968
Which means...

219
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:28,768
The culprit who killed Mr. Kouzuki

220
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:32,168
is one of the residents of the three houses that we visited.

221
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:33,568
Oh, no.

222
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,168
They key is...

223
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:38,368
the cigarette.

224
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,568
Cigarette?

225
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,668
Talking about cigarettes,

226
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:43,568
that lady called Eguchi was smoking.

227
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:44,668
Mr. Ooga too.

228
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:47,468
He tried to smoke one and was stopped by his wife.

229
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:49,368
Mr. Fujiki...

230
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:50,968
His son smokes.

231
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:54,268
He went out of his way to hide the cigarette that he bought

232
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,968
in the back pocket of his pants.

233
00:13:57,168 --> 00:14:00,368
His mother probably doesn't like cigarettes.

234
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:02,468
Talking of cigarettes...

235
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:06,168
about 10 days ago around 8 in the morning.

236
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:07,468
Darn.

237
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:10,668
Always throwing cigarette butts down like this!

238
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:12,568
Who the heck can it be?

239
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:14,768
If I remember correctly,

240
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:17,768
there were two blue lines on the cigarette.

241
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,568
Two blue line?

242
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,668
It's the same cigarette that the three were smoking.

243
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:25,968
Maybe Mr. Kouzuki met the person

244
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:28,768
who was always disposing cigarettes in front of his house

245
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,368
at the underground crosswalk.

246
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:33,168
And, they got into a quarrel.

247
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:35,768
Then, that person is the culprit?

248
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,968
Who is it, Conan?

249
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:40,268
I don't know yet.

250
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:42,068
I don't have enough information.

251
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:44,168
If we check Mr. Kouzuki's house,

252
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,668
maybe we'll find the cigarette butts that he gathered.

253
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:50,668
No, it was probably thrown away yesterday as burnable trash.

254
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:53,968
Okay. Let's go gather information!

255
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:55,268
Okay, let's go!

256
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,268
Let's split up and carry out interrogation.

257
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:58,368
Hey.

258
00:14:58,368 --> 00:15:01,368
All right. I'd like to give the one who stole the map

259
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,268
a taste of his own medicine too.

260
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,568
Not you too.

261
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:07,868
Okay.

262
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:10,268
Only, don't push yourself too far.

263
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:12,168
If you sense danger in any way,

264
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,468
pull out right away.

265
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:15,568
-Okay! -Roger!

266
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,368
You can count on us.

267
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:20,268
Will you draw a map for us again, Mr. Yagisawa?

268
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:21,268
Okay.

269
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,668
About the cigarette butts...

270
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:59,968
It seems that they were disposed of as burnable trash after all.

271
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:01,468
I see.

272
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,168
It seems that Mr. Ooga walks everyday

273
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,068
to his architecture design office

274
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:07,668
which is located in front of Beika Station.

275
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:11,568
He leaves his home between 7:30 am and 8:30 am.

276
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,668
He comes home at random hours,

277
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,868
and last night it seems he came home after 10:00 pm.

278
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:17,768
Mrs. Eguchi part-times at a club near

279
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,468
Beika Station four days a week from evening.

280
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:23,468
Club? You mean a soccer club?

281
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:24,868
It seems she came home last night after 10:00 pm too.

282
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:28,668
Mr. Fujiki also seems to going on foot to Beika Station too.

283
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:32,968
According to the granny living in the house opposite his,

284
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:37,568
he leaves every morning at 7:00 sharp.

285
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:40,668
She says she heard the front door close

286
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:41,968
at around after 10:00 last night.

287
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:45,268
The three commute to Beika Station.

288
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:47,968
And if they take this course,

289
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:49,768
they would pass in front of Mr. Kouzuki's house

290
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:52,268
and the underground pass.

291
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:55,468
In other words, it is possible for all three of them

292
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:58,068
to dispose of cigarettes in front of Mr. Kouzuki's house

293
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:01,568
before 8:00 in the morning or late at night.

294
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:02,968
If she's not in the soccer club,

295
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,668
maybe she's in the baseball club?

296
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:07,868
I asked the cleaning man at the underground pass

297
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:10,268
and was told that he also sees the same brand cigarette butt

298
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,168
on the ground all the time.

299
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:13,968
Blue line.

300
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,368
Last night at around 10:00,

301
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,368
one of the three disposed of a cigarette butt at the underground pass.

302
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,368
Mr. Kouzuki who happened to see that,

303
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:23,668
got into an argument with that person.

304
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,968
You're the one who's always throwing cigarette butts

305
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,968
in front of my house.

306
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:48,568
That's why there was no cigarette butt near the corpse.

307
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,968
The problem is, who of the three is the culprit?

308
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:55,368
Come on, what club is she in?

309
00:17:57,268 --> 00:17:58,368
Oh, no!

310
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,368
Genta, how filthy!

311
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:04,268
I was almost finished licking it.

312
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:06,268
What a waste.

313
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:07,368
Finished licking?

314
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:08,868
Finished smoking.

315
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:11,668
Maybe...

316
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:12,968
But, the proof...

317
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,968
Hey, I've got something I want to confirm.

318
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:20,668
Let's go, all of us.

319
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:22,168
Cool too.

320
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:36,968
The flow of the river is fast after all.

321
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,168
Somebody's there.

322
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:49,268
It's Mrs. Eguchi.

323
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:50,868
What?

324
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,368
She looks different

325
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:54,468
because she's got make-up on.

326
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:03,268
She laughed.

327
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,668
Very suspicious.

328
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:06,768
Okay, let's follow her.

329
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:09,868
It's floated away.

330
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:11,968
The cigarette butt that would've served as evidence.

331
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:13,668
It'll be hard to prove.

332
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:26,968
Just as nasty as ever.

333
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,968
She's throwing her cigarette on the ground again.

334
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,568
What a lady.

335
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:37,368
-Good evening. -Good evening.

336
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:39,968
You're a good girl,

337
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:41,468
but you still bark.

338
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:43,468
Depending on the person.

339
00:19:43,468 --> 00:19:45,768
Especially anyone who looks suspicious.

340
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,868
Ai.

341
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:50,368
We've got to hurry and go after Mrs. Eguchi.

342
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:56,268
That person is...

343
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:57,768
Mr. Ooga.

344
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,168
What's going on?

345
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:02,068
I see.

346
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,768
Not again.

347
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:08,168
There seems to be a woman who always litters.

348
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:09,368
Always?

349
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:17,768
What's up, Cool?

350
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:21,868
The men forgot to take that,

351
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:24,168
so I had no choice but to keep it.

352
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:26,268
Maybe...

353
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:42,868
It... it can't be.

354
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,068
I threw that cigarette into the river.

355
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:47,668
You threw a different cigarette butt into that river.

356
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,368
A different one?

357
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:50,768
Mr. Fujiki,

358
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:53,868
last night, after grabbing the cigarette butt from Mr. Kouzuki's hand,

359
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,568
you ran towards your house, didn't you?

360
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:59,968
Then, a black dog suddenly barked at you

361
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,668
so didn't you drop the butt?

362
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:04,668
Mr. Fujiki that was looking around

363
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:06,868
for the cigarette butt in the dark in a rush,

364
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:09,768
found it and picked it up.

365
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,068
Since it was the same brand,

366
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:14,368
as well as had a red stain on the filter,

367
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:15,668
thought it was the one he was looking for,

368
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:18,468
ran off again and threw it into the river.

369
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:22,868
But the one that Mr. Fujiki picked up was that of someone else.

370
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,268
What he thought was blood was lipstick.

371
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:27,368
The butt that Mr. Fujiki dropped was found

372
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:31,368
in between the recycle bin in front of the house.

373
00:23:03,368 --> 00:23:07,568
Mr. Ooga had an affair with Mrs. Eguchi behind his wife's back.

374
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:12,268
Yes, that's why his facial expression changed when he saw the map.

375
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:14,768
When did you figure out he was the culprit?

376
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,168
I wasn't that sure.

377
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:20,168
I just assumed that the culprit started smoking the cigarette

378
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:21,768
from in front of the station.

379
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,168
It takes 400 meters to get to the underground pass,

380
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:26,468
so I figured that was the distance it would take

381
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:29,368
for the culprit to just finish smoking.

382
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,468
Then, I took a look at the house that would take

383
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:34,668
about the same distance as from Mr. Kouzuki's house.

384
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:36,768
I see.

385
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:41,168
Okay, I guess I'll give the great detective a treat then.

386
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:43,568
I don't care for anything like that.

387
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:45,168
What the...

388
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:48,568
Great Detective, here's your beef jerky treat.

389
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:52,068
So, she wasn't talking about me.

390
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,968
Sir, over there.

391
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:00,768
"K".

392
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,868
Could this be a dying message?

393
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:06,268
I can't let him live.

394
00:24:06,268 --> 00:24:09,168
That guy doesn't deserve to live.

395
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:11,568
Both their initials are K.

396
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:13,668
Katsutoshi Kusaka

397
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:15,668
and Kiwako Kaitani...

398
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:18,568
the culprit is one of the two.

399
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:20,068
Next Conan,

400
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:24,068
"Suspicious Initial K".
