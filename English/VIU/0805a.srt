1
00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:03,122
At the start of the new year,

2
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:06,622
I got caught up in an unexpected case.

3
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:11,522
It all started when I saved a car that went out of control.

4
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:12,922
The owner of the car,

5
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:15,322
"Takuya Hosoo (47), HO Tradings President" -Takuya Hosoo, was a wealthy man

6
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:17,022
who ran a trading company.

7
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,023
He was on his way to deliver

8
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:20,622
a culturally significant two-faced mask that he owned

9
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:23,722
to a certain individual.

10
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,422
The person he was delivering the mask to

11
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:27,522
was the currently most popular Kabuki actor,

12
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:30,322
"Ebizo Ichikawa XI" -Mr. Ebizo Ichikawa.

13
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:32,922
Ebizo who was friends with Mr. Hosoo,

14
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:37,322
had decided and was supposed to use that mask in his February performance.

15
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:41,622
However, the two-faced mask that was entrusted to President Yabusaki

16
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:44,922
was stolen by someone.

17
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:49,022
Moreover, Mr. Hosoo's secretary, Mr. Hitoshi Takahashi,

18
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:52,022
"Hitoshi Takahashi (40), Hosoo's secretary" -was found dead in his car.

19
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:55,622
Beside him, the case that had the two-faced mask inside it

20
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,723
was found empty.

21
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:00,422
There are several suspects.

22
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:03,822
"Shinnosuke Iwami (29), Playwright" -Mr. Shinnosuke Iwami, the playwright,

23
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:06,822
"Eiji Kaneko (37), Cameraman" -Mr. Eiji Kaneko, the cameraman,

24
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:09,722
"Yoshiyuki Yabusaki (57), President" -Mr. Yoshiyuki Yabusaki, the president

25
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:13,322
and Ms. Yukari Shioji, an accountant

26
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,822
"Yukari Shioji (32), Accounting secretary" -working at Mr. Hosoo's company.

27
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:19,822
I naturally started my search for the perp.

28
00:01:19,823 --> 00:01:22,323
But was attacked by someone in an alley in Ginza.

29
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,722
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

30
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,922
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

31
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:34,922
The whereabouts of the mask and Conan.

32
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:37,122
A graceful finale on the Kabuki stage!

33
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:38,622
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:40,522
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:42,523
His name is Detective Conan!

36
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,219
"Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery (Part 2)"

37
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,519
Where is this?

38
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,818
I'm fine.

39
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,519
There's nothing wrong with me.

40
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,619
A basement somewhere.

41
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,018
That's a boiler?

42
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,019
If it's that big, this must be the B2 or B3 floor.

43
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:18,318
This is...

44
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,519
a building that's being demolished!

45
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,919
My cell phone is gone.

46
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:30,719
No good.

47
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,019
Darn.

48
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,818
What? The can opener?

49
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,418
You were saying something about snacks to go with your beer

50
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,318
and ate the canned salmon, right?

51
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,318
Canned salmon?

52
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,018
I ate it.

53
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,618
Hold it, there!

54
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:55,118
I didn't use the can opener!

55
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,418
All the cans are pull tops now, right? Pull tops!

56
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,018
What're you going to open?

57
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,818
What... A tuna can.

58
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:05,918
A tuna can. Those cans are all pull tops, aren't they?

59
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,018
You mean they have tuna cans that aren't pull tops?

60
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,718
But these cans were three for 58 yen.

61
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:15,718
What? 58 yen?

62
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:18,018
Are you sure it's really tuna?

63
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,118
Forget it!

64
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:22,018
I'm sure you'll get a stomachache if you eat something like that!

65
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,718
Thank you so much for waiting.

66
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:26,718
Right! Now I remember!

67
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,319
That glasses kid!

68
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:30,718
Canned peaches?

69
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,018
That brat. I told him to give me a piece

70
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,618
and he had the nerve to say no.

71
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:38,019
Okay. I'll ask him then.

72
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,918
Really tough, isn't it? Such a long meeting.

73
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,018
Four hours.

74
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:49,018
With the other side being foreign, I sure need a lot of time.

75
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,518
Just going through all the papers and with so many of pages,

76
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,418
it's really time consuming.

77
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,019
Besides, they're all written in English.

78
00:05:57,219 --> 00:05:59,618
Could I have you look through these too?

79
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:02,619
"Receipt" -Yes, of course.

80
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:14,919
Gee.

81
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,119
Okay.

82
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,018
If it weren't for this body,

83
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,919
I wouldn't have been able to make it out.

84
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:48,819
It stopped.

85
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:54,618
Okay! Let's get it done by today.

86
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:57,618
After dinner, we'll start again at 19:00!

87
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:00,719
Yeah! Roger!

88
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:10,419
This is the power supply room.

89
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,319
Lucky!

90
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:29,619
While I'm still lucky. I guess I'll...

91
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:33,118
Are you returning to the practice hall?

92
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,618
Yes, because Ebizo says he wants to talk to the staff and us.

93
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,619
He wants to talk to you?

94
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,418
Is it okay?

95
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:49,718
I brought you the can opener, but is it okay for us to eat with you?

96
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,118
This is actually dinner for Conan, right?

97
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:55,018
You still can't connect to his phone?

98
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:58,318
This super delicious!

99
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,018
Tuna salad and tuna spaghetti.

100
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,818
All tuna.

101
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,218
Today is supposed to be tuna day.

102
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:08,318
-You mean the tuna festival. -What's the tuna festival?

103
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,218
Is the cell phone ringing?

104
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:14,318
Yeah. It kind of concerns me.

105
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,918
True.

106
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,018
I wonder if I should call Shinichi.

107
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,318
-I don't think it'll do. -What?

108
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,218
If he has his GPS function on, then...

109
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,618
You can tell where he is?

110
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,219
Of course.

111
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,518
If he went to the sushi shop in Ichikawa all by himself,

112
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,118
I'll never forgive him.

113
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,118
You're really stuck on that, aren't you?

114
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,518
Ai, not yet?

115
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,418
Haste makes waste.

116
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,019
Okay, his GPS is on.

117
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,419
Found him!

118
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,918
-Where? -Ginza.

119
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,518
A sushi shop in Ginza?

120
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,418
Forget the sushi shop already.

121
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,018
An alley in three-chome.

122
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,119
Why is he in a place like that?

123
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,218
Strange. He's not moving.

124
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,818
I wonder if he dropped it.

125
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,718
If so, he would at least call, right?

126
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,818
-Because he's not a kid. -What?

127
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,218
-Let's go! -Yes, let's go!

128
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:04,618
Okay, let's hurry and finish eating.

129
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:05,818
-Later! -Later!

130
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:09,119
Oh, boy. You don't have to all come at me that way.

131
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,518
I did it!

132
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,518
Getting out from inside is easy.

133
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,719
Huh?

134
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,219
Hey! No joke!

135
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,219
It's crushed from above.

136
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:51,419
Anybody, please notice!

137
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,019
Okay! Let's get started!

138
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,318
Hey!

139
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,918
Somebody!

140
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,819
Hey!

141
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,017
I'm sure you already know about it,

142
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:25,917
but the two-faced mask that we borrowed from Mr. Hosoo had been stolen.

143
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:31,817
Moreover, Mr. Takahashi, Mr. Hosoo's secretary has passed away.

144
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:36,417
The playwright, Mr. Iwami, has also been hospitalized.

145
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:39,017
The most unsuspicious one

146
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:42,017
is in fact the most suspicious.

147
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,017
Yes? Did you say something?

148
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,918
It's nothing.

149
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:50,217
I intended to entertain the audience

150
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:54,817
with a new interpretation of the Kabuki Juhachiban The Seven Masks.

151
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:58,717
But what I started has resulted as such

152
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:01,417
and it's causing me much pain.

153
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,717
However, I can't let that hold me back after I've come this far!

154
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:09,117
I'll need to turn this performance into a success no matter what!

155
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,517
I'm counting on all of you!

156
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:13,417
Yes...

157
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:14,918
Ebizo.

158
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:17,317
Iwami?

159
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:19,517
Are you okay being discharged from the hospital?

160
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:22,317
Knowing that all of you are doing all you can,

161
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:25,417
I can't be staying in the hospital.

162
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,618
I won't run anymore.

163
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:30,817
The most unsuspicious one

164
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,817
is in fact the most suspicious.

165
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,817
In this new performance,

166
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,417
all the four actors besides me

167
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:39,417
will change into modern clothes in an instant.

168
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,317
It's the part where I mention that

169
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:44,917
the karma of people hasn't changed, be it in the past or present.

170
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:47,917
Iwami, please think up a good dialog.

171
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:49,117
Yes, sir.

172
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:52,317
Everyone, may I have your attention please?

173
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:54,418
Inspector Megure.

174
00:11:56,918 --> 00:11:58,717
Is it really here?

175
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,417
Definitely.

176
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,217
I wonder why Conan came to a place like this.

177
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:07,017
There are just a bunch of bars if we go through here, you know.

178
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,317
You mean he can drink now?

179
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,417
We're not allowed to drink!

180
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,117
It's grown-up taste, right?

181
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:15,117
Try ringing his cell phone.

182
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:16,618
Okay.

183
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:22,317
Is it ringing?

184
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,318
Yes, it's ringing.

185
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:26,617
I don't hear anything.

186
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:29,317
He could have it set to vibe of manner mode.

187
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:31,118
Quiet, everybody.

188
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,217
There you are.

189
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:37,917
Did you find the kid?

190
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:39,218
What's this about?

191
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,317
-Here? -I hear it!

192
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:47,818
Conan!

193
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:50,418
Found it!

194
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,517
Why is it in a place like this?

195
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:56,017
Maybe he was duped by a fox.

196
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:58,717
Please stop it, Sonoko!

197
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:00,217
Let's hurry and look for him!

198
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:02,617
Ask Inspector Megure and the others for help.

199
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:04,417
What?

200
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:08,417
It's obvious that he's got messed up in something.

201
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:10,217
Everybody, take out your badge.

202
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:12,618
Split up and keep calling Conan!

203
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,418
-Let's go, Sonoko. -Where to?

204
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:24,018
Okay.

205
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:32,218
I wonder how much battery's left.

206
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,617
The car nor the case,

207
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:44,817
neither had prints other than that of Mr. Hosoo and Mr. Takahashi.

208
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:49,917
The perp wanted to get a hold of the mask bad enough to commit murder.

209
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:53,617
If only I had stored it more carefully...

210
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:55,717
No, not true.

211
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,817
There are three thinkable patterns.

212
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:03,217
One, Mr. Takahashi steals the two-faced mask

213
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:06,017
and tried to sell it to a third party.

214
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:08,217
However, he was killed by that person

215
00:14:08,218 --> 00:14:10,218
and the mask was stolen.

216
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,317
If so, why did the perp have to

217
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:18,017
make Mr. Takahashi's death look like a suicide?

218
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:20,517
It's strange that the perp would go through

219
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:22,017
the trouble of doing all that was done, isn't it?

220
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:26,717
Is this guy just trying to confuse me?

221
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:28,017
Excuse me?

222
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:31,717
Well, deductions are never perfect.

223
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,917
Pattern number two!

224
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:37,017
The perp thought that he could make money and stole the mask.

225
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:39,617
"Takuzo Minowa (55), Security guard" -I... I didn't steal it.

226
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:43,318
Mr. Mouri is not referring to you, Mr. Minowa.

227
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,817
The perp who thought that the mask was worth money

228
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:52,217
contacted Mr. Takahashi asking him to buy the mask back.

229
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:55,917
And after receiving the money, killed him!

230
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,317
After all, his face has been disclosed.

231
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:00,117
Besides, in order to put the blame on Mr. Takahashi,

232
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:01,517
he framed the suicide.

233
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:05,217
But then, why go to Mr. Takahashi? He made contact, right?

234
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:06,717
If he wanted to make money off the mask,

235
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:09,918
shouldn't he have gone to Mr. Hosoo to have it bought back?

236
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:14,417
He's countering me every chance he has after all.

237
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,817
Which means...

238
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:19,617
Did such an individual try to get in touch with you?

239
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,717
No, not at all.

240
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:26,217
You may be the perp.

241
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,817
So, the possibility of suicide has been totally erased?

242
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:30,818
I would say so.

243
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:35,917
So he's trying to switch the crime he committed over to suicide now.

244
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:37,717
There were traces that the inside of the car

245
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:41,117
as well as the engine room had been cleanly wiped.

246
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:42,217
Right.

247
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:44,817
A person contemplating to commit suicide

248
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,917
wouldn't think of wiping off his prints, would he?

249
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,617
True.

250
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:52,117
True, my butt!

251
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,318
He dug his own grave.

252
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:58,818
Ran.

253
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:02,017
Dad, big trouble!

254
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,517
I'm busy right now.

255
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:06,217
Talk to me about the can opener after I get home.

256
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:07,218
It's not that.

257
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:10,717
It's not the can opener. We're looking for Conan!

258
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:13,017
What about the glasses kid?

259
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:16,317
What? He's missing?

260
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,717
Is that something unusual?

261
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:21,517
Maybe he's just taking his time in the john or something?

262
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:22,718
Excuse me!

263
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,417
Who?

264
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,117
Yes. Ichikawa...

265
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:30,618
You mean you're Ebizo!

266
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,217
Okay, I'll be right over.

267
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:37,617
What seems to be the matter?

268
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:41,417
It seems that Conan went missing around the four-chome area.

269
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,317
Conan?

270
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,517
This is my turf,

271
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:46,918
so I'll go look for him.

272
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,518
Now I'm sure.

273
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:54,717
Those who commit crimes

274
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:58,018
are most likely to act as if they're cooperating.

275
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,517
Cooperate?

276
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:03,318
Act as if?

277
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:09,488
"Iwai Bridge"

278
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:12,887
Let's presume that he's been abducted.

279
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:14,587
I'm sure this is in some way

280
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:17,987
connected to the case of the two-faced mask being stolen.

281
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:20,387
Will you show me the cell phone that you found?

282
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:21,588
Yes.

283
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:29,587
The last incoming call was at 16:05 from you Ran.

284
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:32,287
He said that he was at Kabukiza at that time.

285
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:34,587
So we missed each other.

286
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,887
Then right after that,

287
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,387
he called somebody at 16:08.

288
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:40,087
"Call history" -Since there's no name,

289
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:42,187
he must've entered the number manually.

290
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,887
I tried calling it,

291
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:45,687
but the phone seems to be switched off.

292
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:47,387
You're...

293
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,287
I'm Ai Haibara,

294
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:52,587
adviser for the same detective squad that Conan is in.

295
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,587
-Conan's... -Adviser?

296
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:57,587
-That's one hell of a job. -Somebody who gives advice to the leader.

297
00:17:57,588 --> 00:18:00,187
Ai's voice kind of sounds sweeter than usual.

298
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:03,087
I see! In my contacts?

299
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,787
It's hard to tell just by looking at the number, though, right?

300
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:08,387
I used to be able to remember all the numbers before, but now...

301
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,387
I'll enter the number.

302
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:13,487
Then, push here last.

303
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:15,487
"Eiji Kaneko" -It's Kaneko!

304
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:18,787
Mr. Kaneko... The cameraman?

305
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:21,987
I got the staff together just a while ago,

306
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:23,688
but he wasn't there.

307
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,988
There!

308
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:35,288
If I can widen this...

309
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:40,888
I'll make it!

310
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,088
Darn!

311
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:52,387
Let's go to Kaneko's residence.

312
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:54,187
Where is it?

313
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:56,988
President Yabusaki should know where it is.

314
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,487
Edogawa?

315
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:01,587
Conan?

316
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:02,588
You guys!

317
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:05,087
You've come for me after all!

318
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,388
Look for a building that's being demolished!

319
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,788
There's one nearby.

320
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,388
The basement of the building that's being demolished.

321
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,887
Edogawa? Where are you? Which building?

322
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,087
-Conan! -No good, it's been cut off.

323
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:23,787
I heard the basement of a building!

324
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,488
He said it's nearby.

325
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:29,787
A building under construction nearby...

326
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:31,887
That's it!

327
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:34,787
Will someone go tell Mr. Mouri and the others about this?

328
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:36,387
They should be at Kabukiza!

329
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:38,387
Go Mitsuhiko.

330
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:40,087
You go, Genta.

331
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,187
I'm worried about Conan!

332
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:44,187
Then, let's decide with this!

333
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:46,287
Stone, paper, scissors!

334
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:48,888
There...

335
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:53,588
Why me?

336
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:01,487
Over there?

337
00:20:01,488 --> 00:20:02,488
I'll stop them!

338
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:05,387
Okay, good pace.

339
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:07,187
Hey. You!

340
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:11,188
Hey! Stop!

341
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:13,487
What?

342
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:14,488
What's that?

343
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:15,987
An earthquake?

344
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:18,387
Oh, you're Ebizo.

345
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,388
In the basement!

346
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:20,587
There's somebody in the basement!

347
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:22,187
What?

348
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,088
This way.

349
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:27,987
Conan!

350
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:29,787
Over here!

351
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:30,887
There he is!

352
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:32,588
Oh, watch out!

353
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:36,387
-Are you there? -Yes!

354
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:38,888
I've come to rescue you, buddy!

355
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,487
Ebizo...

356
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,287
This doesn't move?

357
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:45,887
The frame is crushed,

358
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:47,887
so it'll take something more than a person to move it.

359
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:49,187
Get me a wire!

360
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:50,987
We'll do it.

361
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,087
Never mind!

362
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:54,687
Just put the hook through here and wind it!

363
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:55,688
If something happens,

364
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,787
we'll have the whole nation coming after us.

365
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:00,287
-Conan! -Ran?

366
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:03,287
Are you all right? I hope you're not hurt.

367
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,487
Yes, I'm fine.

368
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:08,887
Don't worry.

369
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:11,887
Thanks, Ran.

370
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:14,787
Conan, pass this under the door.

371
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:16,687
Pass this through the space over to this side.

372
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:18,187
Okay!

373
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:19,588
Great.

374
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:22,787
Step back a bit, okay?

375
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:24,587
Okay!

376
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:27,887
Okay. Pull slowly!

377
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,687
Boss! No good!

378
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,788
The second floor will fall!

379
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:34,488
Wind it!

380
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:37,287
Support it!

381
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:40,388
-Masa! To the right! -Roger!

382
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,087
Conan.

383
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:53,588
Ebizo.

384
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:08,487
Honestly, that was really close.

385
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:09,887
Really?

386
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:12,587
You look to be saying it was still too soon to come for you.

387
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:14,788
That would be an outright lie.

388
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:19,487
-Conan! -Conan!

389
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:21,987
Later with all of that!

390
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:25,387
Just get out of here because it's dangerous.

391
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:29,587
Ebizo and all you others, hurry and come this way.

392
00:22:29,588 --> 00:22:32,788
Really. What a tough guy.
