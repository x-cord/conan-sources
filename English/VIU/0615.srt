1
00:00:01,656 --> 00:00:03,656
We all came out to pick bamboo shoots

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:06,456
along with Dr. Agasa,

3
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:08,056
but his car broke down

4
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:10,356
and we ended up being stranded in the mountains.

5
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:14,656
We walked over to a villa district seeking shelter from the rain

6
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:16,556
and were lured to a certain villa

7
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:19,556
by the melody of a piano playing, stepped foot into it.

8
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:23,256
Although there are traces of someone having been there,

9
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,156
no one is in sight.

10
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:28,456
Eerie sentences are written in the diary that is left behind.

11
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:34,056
It seems that someone kidnapped a boy and confined him to the villa.

12
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:35,856
But, after the kidnapper's identity is revealed,

13
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:38,956
it seems the kidnapper decides to take the boy's life.

14
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,956
We've got to find the boy quickly!

15
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:47,556
Then, the villa is suddenly overtaken by a blackout,

16
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:50,756
when the sound of the piano playing is heard again.

17
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:54,656
Oh no. The kidnapper is still in the villa.

18
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:00,156
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

19
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:02,656
You must be true to yourself.

20
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,256
The mystery of the diary is solved.

21
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,556
What is the true identity of the genius pianist?

22
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:08,056
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,156
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:12,256
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:56,892
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 2)"

26
00:02:57,622 --> 00:03:01,122
That's right! I found a picture!

27
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:05,822
A family picture.

28
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:08,122
They seem to be a musical family.

29
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,022
The date on the picture is a year ago.

30
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:12,922
Maybe the child in the middle of the picture

31
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:15,422
is the one who was kidnapped?

32
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:18,822
No. Because the child in the picture is a girl besides.

33
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:20,622
He's right. The one in this picture

34
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:24,422
is probably the owner of this villa or...

35
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:27,222
the kidnapper, no doubt about it.

36
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:28,422
The kidnapper?

37
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:29,722
No!

38
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:37,922
I'm sure that the key to the case is hidden in this diary.

39
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,522
April 20th, sunny.

40
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:46,022
After talking to him I found out that he's quite a nice boy.

41
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:48,422
He laughs a lot and plays a lot.

42
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:52,822
I'm not sure if he understands the situation he's in

43
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,622
but there's no doubt that this child

44
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:56,722
had been oppressed on a daily basis.

45
00:03:56,722 --> 00:04:00,322
Either way, only two more days to go, and it'll be over.

46
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:03,522
April 22nd, cloudy.

47
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:06,822
Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven.

48
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:08,922
Melodies that make your heart quiver.

49
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:12,822
I'm jealous of the talent of the genius born in the same era.

50
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:15,722
Although they're not songs that are appropriate to play in this situation,

51
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,122
they help me forget the passing of time.

52
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:21,622
Just one more day. Please let it pass without incident.

53
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:26,222
April 23rd, rain. No good.

54
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:30,022
It seems as if this boy somehow knows who I am.

55
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:33,822
If this is revealed, it would be a hindrance in the future.

56
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,222
Although I feel sorry for him,

57
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:37,922
I guess I've got no choice but to kill him.

58
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:40,022
The last thing written in the dairy is...

59
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:43,722
April 24th, rain.

60
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:47,922
I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me.

61
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,122
First, what bothers me is

62
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:54,822
why the entry for April the 21st left out.

63
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:58,022
On April 20th, it's written two more days to go,

64
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:02,322
and on April 22nd it reads one more day.

65
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:06,322
They're connected as if the 21st never was.

66
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:10,922
Moreover, the last entry, April 24th, rain is also strange.

67
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:13,922
This red stain is probably from wine that was spilled

68
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:16,522
but the pages dried pages are stuck together,

69
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:18,322
so somebody would've had to write in it

70
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:20,422
more than an hour before we found this.

71
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:22,422
Why does it read rain?

72
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,122
An hour hasn't passed yet since we got here

73
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,622
and it began to rain.

74
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:30,022
Besides, this stain.

75
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,922
Some sentences are slightly uncovered by the stain after all.

76
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,022
It goes to show that it was wet once,

77
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,722
then wet again for some reason.

78
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:38,622
Why?

79
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:46,722
The tips of the staples in the middle are out of alignment.

80
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,622
And the holes are also slightly bigger.

81
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:53,522
And, two pages are sticking out of the edge of the diary.

82
00:05:58,122 --> 00:05:59,622
There's a trace of something

83
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:02,222
having been written on the page next to the one sticking out.

84
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,322
Hey, Conan?

85
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:23,322
What are you doing rubbing the lead of the pencil against the diary?

86
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:27,722
-Oh, that's... -Monster Getter's...

87
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,422
Treasure map!

88
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,022
What's going on?

89
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:34,722
I still don't have proof, so I can't say for sure, but...

90
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,922
I guess we'll figure out the answer

91
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:38,522
if we go and check out the room with the piano.

92
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,522
Nobody's here.

93
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:00,322
I guess the sound of the piano playing

94
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:03,622
was a CD playing just like you said.

95
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:04,622
If it were the radio cassette player,

96
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:07,722
it would move on batteries even during the blackout.

97
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:11,122
What?

98
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:13,522
Our things are gone.

99
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:16,022
-No. -No joke?

100
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:20,722
And, what about your deduction?

101
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:23,622
Aren't we supposed to figure something out here?

102
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:29,122
So I thought but...

103
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:32,022
I'm completely lost.

104
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:34,322
Maybe...

105
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,222
we've really got trouble.

106
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:38,622
Hey, Conan!

107
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:40,122
Don't tell me you're going to

108
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:43,122
play the piano at a time like this?

109
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:45,422
The seat of the piano is not right for you.

110
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,822
It was perfect for me, though.

111
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:51,822
I think you turn the dial that is under this cover

112
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:54,722
and adjust the height of the seat?

113
00:07:56,222 --> 00:08:00,622
And? Is the creepy player of the piano dangerous?

114
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:05,222
Yeah, a very dangerously outstanding genius.

115
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:09,122
That people would resent his birth.

116
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:12,422
A dangerously outstanding genius?

117
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:15,522
Is... is this person the one we are up against?

118
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:16,922
Sort of...

119
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:24,022
Okay! The height of the chair is just about right.

120
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:26,122
Okay, Ayumi, play the piano

121
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,322
and sing with everyone, will you?

122
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:33,022
A super peppy and cheerful song.

123
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:41,022
Here goes!

124
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,022
"I stepped on a cat, I stepped on a cat,"

125
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,022
"I stepped on a cat, and it scratched me."

126
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:46,922
"The cat scratched me, the cat scratched me,"

127
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:49,122
"the cat was scared so it scratched me."

128
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:53,022
"Bad, bad cat."

129
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:55,622
"Let's cut off its claws."

130
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:58,822
Why don't we quit playing

131
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:00,722
hide-and-seek already?

132
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,222
Whoever you are?

133
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:14,222
Don't worry, we're on your friends.

134
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,622
Wow, amazing.

135
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:20,822
It's just as Conan said!

136
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:24,122
It was really a child!

137
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:28,422
The lights are back on.

138
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:31,722
Okay, so we're all ears.

139
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:34,722
First, tell us your name

140
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:36,522
and age.

141
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:44,784
My name is Keita Onoda. I'm 7.

142
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,484
7? Then, you're in first grade?

143
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:48,684
"Keita Onoda (7)" -Yep!

144
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:51,384
Haido Elementary 1st grade, class 3!

145
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,884
You're a 1st grader just like us?

146
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,884
But, how did you figure out that he was a child, Conan?

147
00:09:57,884 --> 00:10:00,884
First the names Bach, Mozart, Chopin

148
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:02,384
and Beethoven that were written in the diary.

149
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,684
Melodies that make your heart quiver.

150
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,884
A genius born in the same era.

151
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:10,384
I envy that genius. These sentences mean...

152
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:13,784
Chopin was born 60 years after Bach died.

153
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:17,684
So, he couldn't be a genius who was born in the same era, right?

154
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:21,184
It was a mystery who was being indicated here,

155
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:24,684
but when I looked at this picture that Ayumi picked up, it hit me.

156
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:29,984
That the one who was kidnapped was a genius piano player the same age

157
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:33,384
as the girl in the picture.

158
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,884
The kidnapper probably kidnapped the boy

159
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,484
and confined him in his own villa, so that his daughter

160
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:39,484
who is going to participate in the Beckahm International Music Contest

161
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:40,784
or something that is to be held

162
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:42,884
at the end of April, gets to win the contest.

163
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,684
His own?

164
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:46,784
You mean this is the villa of the kidnapper?

165
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:50,384
Yeah, because the room with the piano in the picture

166
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,484
is the same room we're in right now.

167
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,684
According to what's written in the diary,

168
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:55,884
is the one who kidnapped you

169
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:59,184
the father of the girl in the picture?

170
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:01,884
Yeah, he's Chiaki's father.

171
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:02,984
I met him for the first time,

172
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:07,184
but I knew his face. Chiaki showed me his picture.

173
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:10,184
But, I wasn't kidnapped!

174
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:13,684
Chiaki's father saved me!

175
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:15,484
The contest was drawing close

176
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:17,784
so I had to practice the piano day

177
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,984
in and day out and I couldn't have any fun for a long time!

178
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:21,584
That's why you did things that you were usually

179
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:23,384
not allowed to do without being scolded,

180
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,684
like eating snacks while walking along the corridor,

181
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,384
playing on the cart and get carried away playing games.

182
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,484
Yep!

183
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:34,084
Riding the cart through the corridor really feels good!

184
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:37,884
Then, who was the tall person I saw?

185
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:42,284
This boy was probably leaning over the handle

186
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,984
of the cart and looking inside.

187
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,384
I see!

188
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:47,484
Food was messed up on the kitchen table

189
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:50,184
because you got hungry and the man

190
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:53,684
who brought you here fled and disappeared, right?

191
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:56,084
Yep! I ate the ham, bread

192
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,884
and fried chicken that were in the refrigerator.

193
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,984
Because I can't cook.

194
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:02,684
This room with the piano sure is nice and neat.

195
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:05,084
That's probably because he was told by

196
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:08,084
his parents not to mess up this room no matter what.

197
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:10,084
Yep! Mommy told me

198
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:13,284
that the God of Music is in the piano room.

199
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:15,584
That's why you returned the seat of the piano back

200
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,784
to its originally height after you finished playing the piano?

201
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:18,884
Yep!

202
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:20,484
When all of you got here, at first,

203
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:22,884
I was so surprised that I forgot to do it.

204
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:25,884
I see. That's why you were flustered.

205
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,384
Because although you were sure that the piano player

206
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:29,484
was a child, the height of the piano chair

207
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,184
was not adjusted to child size.

208
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:36,084
Yeah, because I didn't think you could change the height of the chair.

209
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:39,484
But, did the culprit really flee?

210
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:41,284
According to the diary, the culprit wrote,

211
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:44,784
"I've got no choice but to kill him because he knows me".

212
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:47,584
Then, on the next day, it reads, "Sonny, forgive me".

213
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:50,684
It's true that if both days were connected,

214
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:54,984
it would seem as if he had no choice but to kill,

215
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,784
and so did, but both pages weren't connected.

216
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:01,484
Because he switched the pages.

217
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,284
He did so because he ran out of paper

218
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,384
and drew this treasure map in the diary,

219
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:11,684
then he ripped the page off!

220
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:16,384
See, there are two pages that

221
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:18,584
are sticking out from the edge, aren't there?

222
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:19,884
True.

223
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,684
That's proof that the pages were switched!

224
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:24,384
Just what do you mean?

225
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:29,084
This diary is the type that is stapled together in the middle.

226
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:32,584
If all the pages are the same size, when the diary is closed,

227
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,384
depending on the thickness of how many

228
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:36,484
pages are stacked up, the edges will stick out.

229
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,984
The diary is made so that the edges

230
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,884
that are sticking out are cut to even them out.

231
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:45,584
The result is, the outer pages are slightly

232
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:48,084
larger than those in the middle.

233
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:51,984
That's why if you bring the outer pages to the middle,

234
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,584
it sticks out like this!

235
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,884
The reason why the staple tips on the middle page

236
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:59,684
are not aligned together is because of this as well.

237
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:02,584
Since he pried the staples apart once and switched the page

238
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:06,384
and pressed them back down, causing the staples to misalign.

239
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:09,384
The page in question where he drew the treasure map,

240
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:14,084
is on the right hand side of the April 24th page with the wine stain.

241
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,784
And on the backside of the 24th

242
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:19,384
the contents of April 23rd should've been written.

243
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,684
But if only that page were to be removed,

244
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:23,784
when the owner decides to write the diary for the following day,

245
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:27,084
he would most likely realize that the diary for April 23rd is gone.

246
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:30,084
That's why the April 21st page

247
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:32,984
was placed after the April 23rd page.

248
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:35,384
Then, strokes were added to the number 21

249
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:36,884
to change it to 24.

250
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:39,984
Finally, wine was spilled onto the page, like the other page.

251
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:45,084
I see. If the April 21st page was really written there,

252
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:49,184
the page written behind it would be for April 20th.

253
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:52,084
What we thought was the diary for the 23rd that read,

254
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:55,084
"I've got no choice but to kill him"

255
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:56,784
was actually written on April 20th.

256
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,784
Yeah, in other words...

257
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:01,784
It began with "I've got no choice but to kill him" on April 20th

258
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,484
and continued on to "After talking to him,

259
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:05,984
I found him to be quite a nice boy", on the 21st.

260
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:09,884
Then comes the page about Bach and Mozart on April 22nd.

261
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:12,984
Then to the April 23rd page that was torn off

262
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:14,984
and finally, the last page, April 24th,

263
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:18,184
"Sonny, I'm sorry, please forgive me".

264
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,584
If what was written on the page of the 23rd that was removed,

265
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:22,784
described the feelings of regret

266
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:25,384
he felt for the crime he committed, it could be that,

267
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,984
first, he thought that he had no choice but to kill the boy,

268
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:29,784
but his intent for murder gradually waned.

269
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,384
So, the diary shows that he decided

270
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:33,884
to leave the boy here and flee!

271
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:37,484
But, how brilliant to think of removing the page!

272
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:39,684
You could've just ripped it!

273
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:42,584
If I rip it, he'd find out one day.

274
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:43,584
My big brother who became

275
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:46,484
an intermediate school student last year taught it to me!

276
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:50,684
When I had to write a lot of notes on a musical score for homework,

277
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,284
he told me I could cheat my way through

278
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,484
if I switch the pages with the pages of notes that I wrote before.

279
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:59,484
And? Do you have the page you ripped off?

280
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:01,184
Yep.

281
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:08,384
No good. I can't go through with it after all.

282
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,784
He, like me, is striving to become a musician.

283
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:12,584
The thought of sending his talent to the grave

284
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:14,284
deserves me none other than death.

285
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,084
I've made up my mind.

286
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:19,084
Hey! Did the man tell you where he was going?

287
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,084
Nope.

288
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,484
He just said that mommy would come to pick me up soon,

289
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:24,984
so don't let anyone into the house till then,

290
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,384
and left.

291
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,684
Come to think of it,

292
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:30,484
that picture was floating in the hot water

293
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:31,884
that came flowing out into the corridor.

294
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:33,384
The bath tub!

295
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,584
Hot water is flowing out from the space under the door.

296
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,484
He's probably trying to commit suicide by soaking his wrist

297
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:46,484
that he had cut into the tub with water.

298
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:48,884
If he keeps the water running, it'll prevent the blood from clotting

299
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,584
and make it easier to die from exsanguination.

300
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:53,484
That's when the picture he was holding flowed out.

301
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,084
Darn, it's locked!

302
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:05,884
No good. It won't budge with the strength of a child.

303
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:07,984
Besides, the width of the corridor

304
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,484
is too narrow for me to use my Super Kick Shoe.

305
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,484
On top of that the corridor is soaking wet

306
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:14,584
that I wouldn't be able to brace my feet either.

307
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,584
Okay then...

308
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,884
What're you doing, Conan?

309
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:32,284
Marking the wall like that.

310
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,984
Will you go get my shoes from the front entrance?

311
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:37,984
Hurry!

312
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:45,684
Listen. Stand back, you guys.

313
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:53,584
Go for it!

314
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,184
Awesome!

315
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:03,184
The floor is soaked with water!

316
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:11,184
He's passed out, but he's still breathing.

317
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:12,284
His wound is shallow

318
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:14,584
and he hasn't bled as much as expected.

319
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,784
With immediate treatment, he may still make it.

320
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:21,284
The hot water flowed out to the corridor

321
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:24,484
because the towel drifted to the drain and is blocking it.

322
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,784
Hey! Get me the slender can

323
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:32,384
of shaving cream by the basin!

324
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,084
Oh, okay!

325
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:42,484
I'll wrap his arm around with this to stop the bleeding.

326
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:44,884
Then all we have to do is get him to a hospital.

327
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:47,584
But, we children could never carry an adult out.

328
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,984
No need to worry.

329
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:53,084
I'll drive him over to the hospital.

330
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:54,584
Dr. Agasa!

331
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:57,784
It's amazing how you figured out we were here!

332
00:18:57,784 --> 00:19:02,184
Your knapsacks were lined out by the front entrance too.

333
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,684
By the front entrance?

334
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,684
I put it there because I wanted you to leave as soon as possible.

335
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:09,084
Besides, on the way here

336
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:10,584
when I was driving along the mountain path,

337
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,884
I heard of what happened from this lady

338
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:17,084
that was stalled because her car ran out of gas.

339
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:23,184
-Keita? -Mommy!

340
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,784
Keita!

341
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:31,484
I'm glad. You're okay.

342
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,984
Yep. I'm just fine!

343
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:36,684
Thanks to Chiaki's father saving me,

344
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:39,484
I could do a lot of things I always wanted to do.

345
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:41,984
I really had a lot of fun!

346
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:46,384
Wrong, Keita.

347
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:49,384
That man didn't save you.

348
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:53,184
No, he may have saved Keita.

349
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:59,184
It's been a long time since I've seen him smile like this.

350
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:06,784
Maybe the one who was confining him

351
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:08,984
by saying, practice...

352
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:14,984
was me, his very own mother.

353
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:41,684
And, what happened to the kidnapper after that?

354
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,584
Yeah. After he was discharged from the hospital,

355
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:46,384
it seems he went straight to the police and turned himself in.

356
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:48,084
Well, since he went as far as to

357
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:50,784
prepare the coffin that he planned to put Keita inside,

358
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,684
he probably doesn't have a chance to plead extenuating circumstances.

359
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:56,184
But, thanks to Keita's mother's testimony

360
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:59,784
the case was spared being publicized.

361
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,184
The kidnapper himself was the one who

362
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:05,684
called the boy's mother over by mail too.

363
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:08,484
But, I'm worried about the girl name Chiaki

364
00:22:08,484 --> 00:22:09,684
that was in the picture.

365
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:14,584
Yes, because her father had become a criminal.

366
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,184
It seems that they're not going to tell Chiaki

367
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:18,784
about it until after she's grown up.

368
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:19,884
It seems that her parents

369
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:22,584
got a divorce a half a year ago too, besides.

370
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:27,184
And? Did the girl Chiaki win the contest?

371
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:30,284
Well, I haven't heard anything on that.

372
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:34,084
What? You didn't enter the contest, Chiaki?

373
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:39,084
I talked it over with mommy and decided not to enter.

374
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:42,984
I was so worried when you disappeared,

375
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:45,884
that I couldn't think about the contest at all.

376
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:47,384
Oh...

377
00:22:47,384 --> 00:22:49,384
But, what a surprise that

378
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:51,584
you were playing with Daddy at the villa.

379
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:54,484
Mommy became really kind to me after that.

380
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:57,484
She stopped telling me over and over to practice!

381
00:22:57,484 --> 00:22:59,684
But, when they stop telling you to practice,

382
00:22:59,684 --> 00:23:01,984
don't you feel like playing all the more? The piano!

383
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:06,084
Yep! Let's do a four-hand performance next time!

384
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,084
Let's play Mozart's sonata for two pianos!

385
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,984
Okay, promise!

386
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:14,984
Parents don't understand the hearts of their children.

387
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:19,184
Why was he playing just that one song?

388
00:23:19,184 --> 00:23:20,684
He says he heard the piece on

389
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:22,984
the video of his big brother's graduation.

390
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,184
Each time the Air on G String began,

391
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:29,984
graduates left the room one after the other.

392
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:34,084
So, he thought that we would leave, just like them.

393
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:37,184
Or...

394
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:42,084
maybe he himself wanted to graduate...

395
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:46,584
from the pressure of being a genius.

396
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:56,084
"Next Episode" -You're going to Great Britain?

397
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,784
I've got so many places I want to go to that.

398
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,484
I can't decide!

399
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:03,184
I'll bet Shinichi would be just as excited

400
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:05,284
as Conan is right now.

401
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:07,684
This?

402
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:10,184
To think that

403
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:13,284
someone would die in front of all those children.

404
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:14,784
A massacre?

405
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:17,684
Here in Great Britain?

406
00:24:17,684 --> 00:24:19,084
Next Conan,

407
