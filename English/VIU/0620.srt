1
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:11,403
Let!

2
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:13,403
First service.

3
00:00:14,903 --> 00:00:16,303
The net again.

4
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:22,003
Hey, hey. Wasn't Minerva Grass' serves said to be accurate?

5
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:26,403
Yeah. She rarely shoots a double fault either.

6
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:28,903
I wonder why she's shooting the ball at the net.

7
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:33,403
Let!

8
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:34,903
First service.

9
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,403
All she's doing is touching the net.

10
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:42,203
Yep. I wonder if she's not in very good condition.

11
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:45,003
No, her form's how it should be,

12
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,703
so she should be shooting where she's aiming.

13
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:49,603
Then, why?

14
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,203
What's the matter, Minerva?

15
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:52,503
Just what are you doing?

16
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,703
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

17
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:02,203
You must be true to yourself.

18
00:01:02,203 --> 00:01:04,103
The message from the Grass Court Queen,

19
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:06,303
will it reach the apprentice of Holmes?

20
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:08,003
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,003
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,203
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,887
An eerie coded message awaits us when we arrive in London.

24
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,687
It was a forewarning of murder

25
00:02:57,687 --> 00:03:00,587
from the vicious criminal on the run, Hades Sabara.

26
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:03,587
We deciphered the code and figured out

27
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:04,887
that the crime was going to be committed

28
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,787
at the Wimbledon Center Court.

29
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:13,387
On Baker Street, Ran happened to run into

30
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:16,087
and get acquainted to a world famous number 1 ranking tennis player

31
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,587
named Minerva Grass,

32
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:20,087
who plays in the finals of the ladies' single competition.

33
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,987
Although we rushed over to the Wimbledon,

34
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:27,387
we couldn't get into the Center Court

35
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:30,087
because we didn't have tickets.

36
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,887
Darn it! You mean there's nothing we can do

37
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:34,687
but suck our finger and watch?

38
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:42,887
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Grass Court Queen)"

39
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:55,887
Minerva lost the 1st set 0-6!

40
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,487
Of course.

41
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,987
I mean she kept grazing the net, 2 or 3 times

42
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:03,187
followed by soft serves.

43
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:05,387
Maybe something's wrong with her serve

44
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:08,287
that she is only able to make slice serves.

45
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,187
But it's strange.

46
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:12,287
It's still first service,

47
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:14,487
so she could've switched to hard serve

48
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,087
until she hits too hard and gets a fault.

49
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:19,687
But not only has she not double faulted,

50
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:22,487
she hasn't even faulted a single time, why?

51
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:24,587
It's on the screen!

52
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,687
The spots where Minerva's serves have landed in this match!

53
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:29,287
It seems that the positions

54
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:30,987
where her serves grazed the net are also indicated.

55
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,287
They're neatly spaced

56
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:35,487
as if she calculated where each serve would land.

57
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,087
Don't tell me that this is...

58
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:42,987
Is there anything different about Minerva than her usual self?

59
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,887
Something different...

60
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:47,087
You mean like something is wrong with her serves?

61
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,187
No, like if she's doing something she usually doesn't do,

62
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:52,787
or something she usually does, but isn't doing today.

63
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:56,287
Come to think of it,

64
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:57,587
it looks like she's not wearing her wristband

65
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:59,287
on her right hand today.

66
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,587
She said in an interview

67
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:04,187
that she makes it a point to wear the wristband

68
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,187
that was given to her by her father during all of her finals.

69
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:08,387
I wonder if she forgot it today?

70
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:11,387
Wristband...

71
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:25,087
Unbelievable!

72
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,287
It's the 2nd set,

73
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:28,387
and Grass hasn't won a single game yet!

74
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,887
That unrivaled Grass Court Queen, Minerva Grass,

75
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:33,487
what on earth has happened to her?

76
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:37,687
Oh my...

77
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:41,187
I guess we're going to have a disappointing get together tonight.

78
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,287
Yep.

79
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:48,787
How sad, a fan even gave her a cute stuffed doll too, and yet...

80
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:50,987
I guess I won't be able to give it to her.

81
00:05:56,987 --> 00:05:59,687
It's mail from Holmes' apprentice.

82
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,587
Meet me at Murray Mound?

83
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:07,387
What? The culprit is after big sis?

84
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:08,687
Are you serious?

85
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,787
Yeah. She probably found out about it,

86
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:14,787
and is trying to tell us about it with her serves!

87
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:17,287
But, how did she find out?

88
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,487
Maybe the culprit told her?

89
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:22,987
By sticking a letter or something on the inside of her wristband.

90
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,087
It wouldn't be possible to do anything

91
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:26,087
with the racket that she always uses,

92
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,487
but it's the wristband that she only uses during the finals,

93
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,387
it wouldn't be difficult for the culprit to stick something in.

94
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:31,887
Come to think of it,

95
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:35,187
sis lost her bag at the hotel the other day,

96
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,387
but we found it right away

97
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:37,887
and she checked the contents of the bag after finding it too!

98
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:40,387
Then, it was probably put there, back then!

99
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:43,587
She probably didn't check inside the wristband at that time.

100
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:46,487
I'll go tell everybody about it, then!

101
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:47,787
No!

102
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,087
Huh?

103
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,287
I have no idea how the culprit is planning to kill your sister.

104
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,287
But he's heinous enough to bomb the hospital

105
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:57,887
even after the code was deciphered!

106
00:06:57,887 --> 00:06:58,987
If we make the wrong move and cause a fuss,

107
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,087
canceling the match and all,

108
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,787
he may kill your sister at that instant!

109
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:06,387
Then, just what are we supposed to do?

110
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:08,387
Are you telling me to just do nothing and watch?

111
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,087
I'm not just going to do nothing.

112
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:14,687
So, won't you give me your ticket?

113
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,087
I'll go into the Center Court in your place,

114
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:20,187
find the culprit and protect your sister no matter what it takes!

115
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:22,287
What? You're going, Conan?

116
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:24,487
Wouldn't it be better if I go?

117
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,287
Not you, Pops!

118
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,787
Because the culprit may know

119
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:31,787
that you're a famous detective from Japan.

120
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,287
I may be able to catch the culprit off guard since I'm a child!

121
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:39,687
Okay, I'll give you my ticket.

122
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:43,687
But if I don't go back, mother and Ales may worry.

123
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,887
It'll be okay if you mail Ales and tell him

124
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,687
that you'll wait outside

125
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:50,187
because you don't want to watch Minerva lose!

126
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:54,887
But, how on earth do you expect to find the culprit inside?

127
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,387
After all, it seems like the culprit, Hades

128
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:59,287
has been changing his face repeatedly!

129
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:02,187
I mean as to that, I'll just do what you always do, Pops!

130
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:03,687
It's the spirit that counts, the spirit!

131
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:05,387
Sp... Spirit.

132
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:06,387
Conan!

133
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,887
You don't have to go out of your way to nab the culprit,

134
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,387
but make sure that you protect Minerva no matter what it takes!

135
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:14,887
Because I have something that I have to tell her!

136
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,787
Okay, I got it!

137
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:30,887
Shout... scream... make more noise!

138
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,987
The more noise you make,

139
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:38,287
the more impact there'll be of the fearful silence that will follow.

140
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,187
A little longer...

141
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,087
Soon, mother...

142
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:47,187
Let!

143
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:48,987
First service.

144
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,287
Just as I thought.

145
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:54,387
The thing that she's etching on the court is...

146
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:56,587
Braille!

147
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:58,387
She's trying to make Braille letters

148
00:08:58,387 --> 00:08:59,687
by dropping her serves at the appropriate locations

149
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:01,687
so that the culprit won't notice.

150
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,187
The Braille that she learned for her mother

151
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:06,287
whose vision is disabled.

152
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:07,787
A Braille cell expresses a letter by etching dots

153
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:12,187
in the six positions arranged in a 2 X 3 rectangle.

154
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:14,687
She hit the net repeatedly with her serves

155
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,387
because in order to etch on the bottom row,

156
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:17,487
she needs to let the ball graze the net

157
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,687
or the ball won't drop where it should.

158
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:20,787
And depending on the letter,

159
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:22,587
she will need to hit a lot of serves to position

160
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:24,287
as many as five dots in the correct position.

161
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:30,087
If so, the first serve as viewed from her side

162
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,287
would be "H".

163
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,287
Next, "E".

164
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,587
Next, "L".

165
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:37,987
The fourth, "P".

166
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:39,887
Connected...

167
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:41,787
The word "Help" is spelled!

168
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:48,487
She was seeking someone who could read this to help her.

169
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,487
Let!

170
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,487
First service.

171
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:54,887
Until her service game is up,

172
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,087
she's repeatedly hitting the ball to spell out "Help"

173
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:58,887
until her service time is over.

174
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:03,387
Now, what I want to know is

175
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,987
what message did Hades relay to her.

176
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:11,087
Just as I thought,

177
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:14,087
there was a paper stuck inside her wristband,

178
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:18,387
but I can't see at all what's written.

179
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:19,687
Darn it!

180
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:23,187
I'd like to relay to her in some way that I'm on her side.

181
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,987
But how can I relay it to her

182
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:26,887
without causing a commotion during the match?

183
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:29,687
Come on, Minerva!

184
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,087
Come on!

185
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:36,487
Come on, Minerva...

186
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,187
Thank you.

187
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:44,987
Yes.

188
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:48,187
If you really exist in this world,

189
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:51,887
you would appear gallantly and help me.

190
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:55,887
But of course, you're nothing more than a character on paper.

191
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,087
There's no way that someone like you would exist in this world.

192
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:01,887
Yes, a person like Sherlock Holmes...

193
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,187
Minerva!

194
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:08,187
I'll help you!

195
00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:10,787
I'm Holmes' apprentice!

196
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:16,787
Holmes' apprentice?

197
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:18,587
Conan!

198
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:19,987
That idiot!

199
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,987
What on earth is he doing?

200
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:29,987
What a laugh that such a brat is Holmes' apprentice.

201
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:33,787
He's wearing glasses and short,

202
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,687
but really sharp and brainy apprentice of Holmes!

203
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:39,287
He says he's going to help me...

204
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:42,287
Does that mean he was able to read my message?

205
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:51,387
Oh, you can help me? When you're so small?

206
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,087
Of course.

207
00:11:57,887 --> 00:11:59,087
Thank you.

208
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,787
Then, I'm counting on you.

209
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:08,787
Apprentice of Holmes'.

210
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:19,032
Thank you.

211
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:28,732
The last letter are made of four dots.

212
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,532
She shot three times so what remains

213
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:34,332
is the one beyond in the right corner.

214
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:36,995
That's the only place left.

215
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,295
Out!

216
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,595
15-40.

217
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:50,695
Minerva scored a point!

218
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:55,495
But I wonder what happened to her opponent, Baur?

219
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:56,695
Yeah.

220
00:12:56,695 --> 00:12:59,695
I guess she was taken aback when Minerva shot back.

221
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,195
It was a slice serve and yet...

222
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:04,895
It's no wonder that she's taken aback.

223
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,595
The Braille Minerva's forming now is not the

224
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:11,895
H, E, L or P that she was repeatedly hitting till now.

225
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:15,295
It's a "G".

226
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,695
Since she's starting to form letters that she didn't form before,

227
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:21,495
it's most likely that what she's going to start doing from now is

228
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:23,795
to let us know what the message that she received was.

229
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,895
Holmes' apprentice...

230
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:30,995
If I'm not mistaken, Apollo told me you're a boy from Japan.

231
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:32,695
If you call yourself the apprentice

232
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,395
of the famous detective that I adore and respect...

233
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:37,995
Read it like it should be read, okay?

234
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,195
The next letter is,

235
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:42,395
the only one out of all the 26 letters of the alphabet...

236
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:47,595
that can be etched

237
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:49,495
by one dot in Braille!

238
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,795
Yes!

239
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:02,495
Service A!

240
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,095
She made it land to the upper left,

241
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,595
so this is literally the Braille for "A".

242
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,895
Connecting it with the previous one, we have "G" and "A".

243
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:11,295
So, what's next?

244
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,295
She's changing her serve patterns.

245
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:19,895
I see. She's finally getting serious.

246
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,595
Fault!

247
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:31,095
She missed her serve for the first time.

248
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:33,195
And really off too.

249
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:36,395
Which means that, this is probably where the letter cuts off.

250
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:46,595
"G" is followed by A, M, E.

251
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,295
So the first word is "Game"!

252
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,095
Let!

253
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,595
Second service.

254
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:00,495
She's got amazing concentration.

255
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:07,095
She accurately changed the angle of her serves that hit the net

256
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:08,795
in order to place each ball in the correct six spots

257
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:11,195
to represent letters in Braille.

258
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:13,495
Just as would be expected of the Grass Court Queen.

259
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,595
She can place her serves wherever she wants.

260
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:19,295
Deuce!

261
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,195
And Minerva had the advantage.

262
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:27,195
Deuce again.

263
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:29,695
This is her sixth time.

264
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,195
She's doing it deliberately.

265
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:32,495
She's playing deuces on purpose

266
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:33,995
in order to extend the game

267
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:36,095
and form more Braille letters.

268
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:41,795
The words she formed till now are...

269
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:45,795
Game, Set, Death, M.

270
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:51,095
When the game ends, M will die?

271
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:55,895
Advantage, Ms. Grass!

272
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:58,295
The Braille just now is an "O".

273
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:03,495
After "Death" the letters "M" and "O" follow, which means...

274
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,895
No...

275
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:10,795
The game goes to Ms. Grass!

276
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:14,395
The score now is 3-1, with Baur in the lead.

277
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:17,595
If the game ends, the message ends here too.

278
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:20,295
And the Braille that she just shot was "M".

279
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:22,595
Put together, it spells "Mom".

280
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:24,295
Mother.

281
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:28,295
The one that Hades is after is not Minerva.

282
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:31,595
But, rather her mother.

283
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:36,795
Come to think of it, Ran said...

284
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,495
that Minerva lost at last year's French Open,

285
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,695
which was the only time her mother couldn't come to support her.

286
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,895
If Hades had placed a large debt on Minerva's win

287
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:48,395
at that championship game...

288
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:49,695
If he were to wrongfully have held a grudge against her mother

289
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:52,395
thinking that the defeat was due to her mother not coming...

290
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,495
It makes sense that he would direct his murderous intent

291
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,095
towards her mother.

292
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,995
But how is he planning to kill her?

293
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,095
Is he nearby?

294
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:07,395
She received a large stuffed doll for big sis from somebody!

295
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:08,795
It couldn't be...

296
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,495
That stuffed doll that her mother is carrying...

297
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:14,495
That's right.

298
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,495
Hold it tight and don't let go.

299
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,895
Because it's the fireworks that will help me celebrate

300
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,095
the end of my revenge.

301
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,595
What? A bomb?

302
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:33,095
What?

303
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,495
What was that?

304
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:37,295
Is there a bomb inside that stuffed doll?

305
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:38,295
Yeah.

306
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:41,995
Hades is probably planning to kill your mother

307
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,895
by blowing it up when the game ends!

308
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:47,295
I'll call mom and tell her to pretend she's going to the ladies room,

309
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:48,695
and to get out of her seat!

310
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:51,295
No! If you make any suspicious moves,

311
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:52,595
he may think that we figured everything out,

312
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:56,195
and push a remote control switch to set off the bomb!

313
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:58,995
Your mother may be spared,

314
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,695
but the crowd of people in the surroundings may get involved.

315
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:05,295
It'll be one of the worst disasters since the start of Wimbledon!

316
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:07,195
No...

317
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:08,695
So, there's no other way than to find Hades

318
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:11,895
who is among the people here in the Center Court

319
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,895
and capturing him!

320
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:17,495
But, can you find him?

321
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:22,395
Your mother and Ales weren't in the family box,

322
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:23,895
but do they always sit in that general admission seat there?

323
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,695
Yep. Mom said in a magazine interview

324
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:28,295
that she doesn't like to be taken by the TV cameras

325
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:33,895
so she prefers to sit in the general seat under the shade.

326
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,595
In the shade?

327
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:38,195
If so, Hades may be on the other side

328
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:39,895
where the sun is shining, then.

329
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:41,495
Huh? Why?

330
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,795
The video!

331
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,395
He video tapes the moments of his crimes each time,

332
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:47,795
and sends them to the police.

333
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:50,595
If he read that magazine interview,

334
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:53,395
it is most likely that he would be sitting right opposite of her,

335
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:55,995
so that he can have a good shot of the moment of the blast!

336
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:58,795
If so, if we look for a guy with a video camera

337
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:00,995
sitting on that side of the bleachers...

338
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:03,395
No, there are a lot of them.

339
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,395
We've got to narrow it down to one person.

340
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,795
Then... Then, how?

341
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:10,895
Right. How do we find him?

342
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:14,595
Just how, from among the 15,000 spectators here!

343
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:18,995
Hey, what's with this cheering?

344
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:21,395
The spectators are coming out to the corridor!

345
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,795
Don't tell me that the game ended?

346
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,095
Not yet.

347
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:27,595
The match just entered the tie-break

348
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,695
because sis tied, 6-all!

349
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:33,195
The spectators are probably making a fuss

350
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:34,895
because of the rain.

351
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:36,795
They're suspending the game by 30 minutes,

352
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:38,495
and the spectators are noisy

353
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:40,995
because the roof of the Center Court is closing.

354
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:43,595
Then, isn't your mother going to leave her seat

355
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:45,095
until the roof closes?

356
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:48,095
She won't. She has an umbrella besides.

357
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,595
Mother... When she lost her vision

358
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:54,295
and couldn't make it to the French Open and sis lost...

359
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,995
She really regretted what happened.

360
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,195
And since then, she always says that

361
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,895
she will never leave her seat until the match ends.

362
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,895
When the roof closes,

363
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:07,895
the cheers echo throughout this place,

364
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:10,295
-and it kind of feels strange. -Yes.

365
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:14,895
But I wonder what happened to Apollo?

366
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:17,895
When Minerva is competing in such a great match.

367
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:19,595
True.

368
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:24,395
I'll explain the details later,

369
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,395
so don't move from your seat!

370
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,095
Apollo.

371
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:29,595
What on earth is going on?

372
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:33,095
Oh, no!

373
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:35,095
The spectators who evacuated to the corridors

374
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:36,295
are beginning to go back inside.

375
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:38,695
The game's going to resume.

376
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:42,695
If Minerva loses this tie break, the game ends.

377
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:45,995
Hades will push the switch for the bomb!

378
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,695
I've got to find him somehow by then,

379
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:52,195
but I don't even know what he looks like.

380
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:54,295
How do I look for him?

381
00:20:56,895 --> 00:21:00,295
Apollo! Did you text mail Ales like I told you to?

382
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:04,795
Yep. And this may not be relevant,

383
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:07,595
but I've heard about how sis finds the seat

384
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:10,295
that mom is sitting in during her matches.

385
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:12,295
I always wondered how,

386
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:13,795
although sis was never told where mom would be sitting,

387
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:15,795
she always managed to call out to mother

388
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:17,395
after she won a match.

389
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:20,195
And? How does she do it?

390
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,595
She said she lobs the ball really high during the match.

391
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:25,995
Too high, I should add.

392
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:29,995
She never told me how she found mom, though.

393
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:32,695
She lobs the ball really high, too high...

394
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:42,095
The Queen appears again.

395
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:44,795
Struggle along as much as you can

396
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:46,495
to prolong every second your mother

397
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:49,095
gets to live as much as possible.

398
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:57,095
If I lose this tie break,

399
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:59,895
mother will...

400
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:02,895
Come on, Minerva!

401
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:06,995
Don't give up the fight!

402
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:10,395
Even though she has a championship point!

403
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,195
Hang in there, win the match!

404
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:15,095
Hang in?

405
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,495
Grass Court Queen.

406
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:20,395
Can you do it?

407
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:24,195
Okay!

408
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:29,895
Now, our game is on.

409
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:31,395
Hades!

410

"Next Episode" -If the opponent scores the next point,

411
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:57,295
Minerva loses...

412
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:58,795
Big sis.

413
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:01,595
So, you're at the end of your rope.

414
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:04,795
I'll show you... the Grass Court.

415
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:07,595
Queen, Minerva Grass' real power!

416
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:10,795
Show yourself, Hades!

417
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,995
May this reach you! Please!

418
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:19,395
