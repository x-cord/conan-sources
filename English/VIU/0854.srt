1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:01,912
No way!

2
00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:05,212
So Shinichi acted like he solved the mystery of the cherry blossom badge

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:09,413
through reasoning when he actually just saw what happened?

4
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:11,612
Maybe.

5
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:16,512
Back then I was surprised and thought he was a genius.

6
00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:19,712
I want him to give me back how I felt for him.

7
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:24,012
Well, I think that he just wanted to look good in front of girls.

8
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:29,113
And I think he also wanted to save Ran from the bullies, too.

9
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:31,512
Stupid.

10
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:34,012
What I saw through the window back then

11
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,012
was a girl in a fix because something was taken from her

12
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:40,212
and the phrase, "You're not one of us."

13
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:42,312
So what I saw back then

14
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:45,613
was what I encountered for the first time.

15
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:50,313
My heart was beating when I was solving the riddle.

16
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:06,012
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

17
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:08,112
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

18
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:09,912
Sakura Class is where I encountered Ran.

19
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:12,412
Behind the shadows of tears is the conspiracy of adults.

20
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:14,112
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:16,212
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:18,813
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:52,757
"Memories of Sakura Class (Shinichi Boy)"

24
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:56,801
Then, I'll stop over there on my way to take Shinichi to the nursery

25
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,201
so wait there for us, okay?

26
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:01,801
Don't forget to wear your hat and sunglasses when you come, okay?

27
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:03,601
You'll cause a commotion if people know it's you.

28
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,001
Okay.

29
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,402
Let's go then, Shinichi.

30
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:11,801
Shinichi?

31
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:13,302
Hey, where are you?

32
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,801
Remove all the deduction from the middle

33
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:20,401
and present only the start and answer to your counterpart,

34
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:21,901
although it isn't very sophisticated,

35
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,702
it is enough to surprise people!

36
00:03:26,302 --> 00:03:28,302
Found you. There you are!

37
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,601
Come on. What do you think you're doing?

38
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:34,701
But I haven't finished reading this book yet!

39
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:38,201
I told you we're going to your new nursery school from today, didn't I?

40
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,801
We don't need to go there!

41
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:44,301
Besides, reading books in a dark place like that,

42
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:47,202
you're going to have to use glasses just like Yusaku!

43
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:51,902
I'll never wear glasses. No way.

44
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,801
It's Yukiko Fujimine!

45
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:02,501
How strange. I've got my hat and sunglasses on.

46
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:08,301
Right, ones that scream that you're an actress.

47
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:12,001
Here. This is the name tag for the Sakura Class.

48
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,301
Now, stop stealing the spotlight at my event.

49
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:16,602
Copy.

50
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:21,401
Then Shinichi, after putting this on your chest we're splitting!

51
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:23,901
Okay. I know.

52
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:26,302
"Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class"

53
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,901
Mrs. Kudo.

54
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,401
The last thing I'd like to ask about is allergies.

55
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:36,301
Are there any things he shouldn't be fed?

56
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:39,301
Like eggs, noodles or cheese?

57
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:41,701
No, nothing in particular.

58
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,301
He doesn't like raisins.

59
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:44,702
He hates them.

60
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:49,501
Let's see.

61
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:52,402
Where is the library?

62
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,601
Seriously?

63
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,802
They don't have a library.

64
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:26,702
What's this? Everybody's lined up sleeping?

65
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:30,601
I thought it was a morgue

66
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:32,902
like the one I saw in that movie the other day.

67
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:37,401
This row is the Apple Class.

68
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:40,301
The next row is the Tulip Class.

69
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:43,401
And the row at the very top

70
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:45,101
is the Sakura Class.

71
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:47,702
Okay, good children, good children.

72
00:05:55,202 --> 00:06:00,302
That girl had something taken from her and was in a fix.

73
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:05,001
Only her clothes don't have a name tag on it.

74
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,401
So her name tag was probably taken from her.

75
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:10,602
But what is it that she's making now?

76
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:14,501
Wait a sec.

77
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:16,302
I've seen that way of folding before!

78
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:24,101
I think it was the way Dad folded the paper to make a star

79
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,801
to decorate on the Christmas tree.

80
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,801
Back then, Dad cut the paper straight diagonally

81
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,601
and it turned into a star.

82
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:34,002
If you bend it and cut like she did...

83
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:37,501
it's a cherry blossom!

84
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:39,101
I'm convinced!

85
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:41,701
Since her name tag was taken from her a while ago,

86
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,601
she's making a new name tag with paper.

87
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,101
Darn it.

88
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:48,801
I want to ask her if I'm right.

89
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:53,001
Holmes said if one simply knocks out all the deduction from the middle

90
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:56,101
and present only the start and answer to your counterpart,

91
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:57,701
although it isn't very sophisticated,

92
00:06:57,702 --> 00:07:01,101
it is enough to surprise people!

93
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:03,901
I wonder if she'd be surprised.

94
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:06,502
I wonder if she'll think that I'm amazing and be surprised.

95
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,101
No, wrong.

96
00:07:10,102 --> 00:07:13,101
You're not one of us because yours is different from ours!

97
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,801
The thing was taken from her

98
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,201
wasn't this plastic badge!

99
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,501
I finished making it!

100
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:21,402
Make one for me, too.

101
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,101
That's a cherry blossom, right?

102
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:29,801
What's that puzzled look on your face?

103
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:31,501
Don't tell me that you...

104
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:32,901
Am I wrong?

105
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:34,601
It is, but...

106
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,101
How did you know?

107
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:37,601
I was right!

108
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:39,401
What do you mean how?

109
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:42,001
Are you making fun of me, or what?

110
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:46,001
All I have left to do is to explain how I knew it.

111
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:49,202
I'm sure that she'll be surprised.

112
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,301
That's how I know

113
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,301
that you lost your cherry blossom name tag

114
00:07:55,302 --> 00:08:00,001
and was making your tag while crying your eyes out like a cry-baby!

115
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:02,501
Okay, how's that?

116
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:05,301
Did I surprise you like Watson?

117
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,902
Did you think I was amazing?

118
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,301
Everybody's surprised.

119
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:13,501
Fantastic.

120
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:15,601
Holmes is fantastic!

121
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:17,201
You're really something!

122
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:19,101
Like some psychic!

123
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:21,801
Stupid. I'm no psychic.

124
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:25,501
So, I'm sure she's also surprised.

125
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:26,801
She's angry?

126
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:29,002
I'm not a cry-baby either!

127
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:32,201
But you were crying.

128
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:33,402
I wasn't crying!

129
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:35,601
You were crying.

130
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,401
No, I wasn't!

131
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:40,401
I mean, you're in tears now.

132
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:42,601
Shinichi, there you are!

133
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:46,601
Don't go running off when I'm filing out your admission papers.

134
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:49,201
Mom.

135
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:52,501
What happened to your name tag?

136
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:55,001
You had it on your chest till just a while ago!

137
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,402
I lost it somewhere.

138
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:00,701
The cherry blossom name tag that I hid in my pocket,

139
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:03,102
I've got to make sure it won't be found.

140
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:10,201
What's with him?

141
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:11,502
Who is he looking at?

142
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:15,502
Her.

143
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,301
But why?

144
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:21,101
Mrs. Kudo?

145
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,001
If you can't find the name tag,

146
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:28,001
we'll get one ready for you together with Ran's by next week.

147
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,201
Oh, really?

148
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,001
Hey, if you want a cherry blossom,

149
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:34,101
I'll give you this that I made a while ago.

150
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:35,701
Oh, okay.

151
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:38,301
I'll write your name for you, too.

152
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:39,702
What's your name?

153
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:44,402
Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class!

154
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:47,401
Shinichi...

155
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:49,902
Kudo.

156
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,702
Thanks.

157
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:56,401
Here, all done!

158
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:58,902
"Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class"

159
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:04,302
I'll give you that so promise, okay?

160
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:08,401
I'm not a cry-baby!

161
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,602
Don't ever call me a cry-baby again!

162
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:13,101
There, there.

163
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:15,301
Both of you, no fighting!

164
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:19,301
Shinichi, don't call her a cry-baby anymore.

165
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,401
Who are you?

166
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,601
I'm Ronsuke Efune.

167
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,801
Your homeroom teacher.

168
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,401
Nice to meet you.

169
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:29,602
Nice to meet you, too.

170
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:36,371
Something is really strange about him!

171
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:38,571
I'm positively sure!

172
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:42,371
Him? You mean Mr. Efune from nursery school?

173
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:44,571
Strange? How?

174
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:47,471
During nap time,

175
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,972
only the place where she puts her futon is always the same.

176
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:52,771
During the walks,

177
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:55,272
he holds her hand the whole time.

178
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,571
Even at the sliding board of the park we went for a walk,

179
00:10:58,572 --> 00:11:00,671
there were others waiting in line,

180
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:03,071
but he skipped them and made her use the sliding board first.

181
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:05,371
He calls out her name really loud, too.

182
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:08,971
I'm sure he's trying to win her over

183
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,972
so that she'll listen to whatever he tells her to do.

184
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,071
Who are you referring to?

185
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:18,572
She's...

186
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:23,272
A girl named Ran.

187
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:30,271
Shinichi, I'll bet you're jealous

188
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,571
because that teacher favors only Ran?

189
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:34,471
Are you stupid?

190
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:35,971
It's nothing like that!

191
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,271
You're totally off!

192
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:42,571
But it is a problem for a teacher to favor just one student, though.

193
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:44,671
Did you ask the teacher the reason?

194
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:45,672
Yes.

195
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:46,971
About her futon,

196
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,571
he said that in the past she didn't make it to the restroom in time

197
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,571
because she was sleeping some distance away,

198
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:54,972
and that's why he put her nearest to the restroom.

199
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:59,271
The reason he hold hands with her during the walk

200
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:01,471
is because she's terribly bad at directions

201
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:04,972
and went somewhere way off away from the others.

202
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,671
He also said that since she always gives her turns up to others

203
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:13,271
so he let her get on the sliding board first.

204
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,771
So he has reasons for everything.

205
00:12:15,772 --> 00:12:16,971
Come to think of it,

206
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:18,771
didn't you say that the walking course changed

207
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:22,771
and that you started going to a different park than before?

208
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,071
Oh, yes.

209
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:27,072
He told me he'd tell me why tomorrow!

210
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:32,271
But I think that you're jealous after all, Shinichi?

211
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:34,671
I'm telling you that's not it!

212
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:39,271
He definitely looks at her with the eyes of a bad guy!

213
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:41,971
I'm not making him beat me!

214
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:43,772
Hey, wait.

215
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:46,371
Hey, Shinichi.

216
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:50,671
Could it be that Ran gets up late every time?

217
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:54,172
Right. She always fast asleep and the last one to get up.

218
00:12:56,972 --> 00:13:00,171
Yusaku, have you come up with something?

219
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:04,171
Shinichi's homeroom teacher's name, Efune.

220
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:06,971
I know another person by that name.

221
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:09,572
She's this girl from Hokkaido, you see.

222
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:13,071
"The next day" -What's the matter, Ran?

223
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:15,071
You seem depressed.

224
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,671
Mother scolded me last night.

225
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,771
She told me that I shouldn't bully my friends.

226
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:23,471
I'm not bullying anybody, right?

227
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,571
No.

228
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:28,172
Rather, you may be the one that's being bullied.

229
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:31,372
Okay, everyone. Be careful.

230
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:52,471
Besides, the main reason I chose this park is her.

231
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:55,771
She's actually my wife.

232
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:57,271
What? Your wife?

233
00:13:57,272 --> 00:13:58,772
You mean she's your bride?

234
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:28,172
"Two days later"

235
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:02,371
-What? A black van? -Yes.

236
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:05,371
It's been parked outside the rear exit of the nursery school for a while.

237
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:09,971
I wonder if things like these should be reported to the police?

238
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:11,271
That's right.

239
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:14,771
I think we should write down its license plate number just in case, too.

240
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:18,971
In that case, should I go check things out?

241
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,471
Mr. Efune.

242
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:22,371
Could you do that then?

243
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:24,272
Please be careful!

244
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:29,971
Forget it. She's not coming back anymore.

245
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,971
No, that's not true! That's not true!

246
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:35,771
Then, what do you want to do about it?

247
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,571
I want to reset things.

248
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:40,271
Then, I'm sure everything will work out this time.

249
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,571
It won't do.

250
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:46,171
There's no time constraint to start over.

251
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:49,371
Let's not go through with it after all!

252
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:52,171
Let's not stand in the rain and talk.

253
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:53,671
Please come and sit in the passenger's seat.

254
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,472
Who are you?

255
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,471
I'm just an ordinary novelist

256
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:01,472
that has just started selling recently.

257
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:04,771
A novelist?

258
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,071
Where is he?

259
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:08,971
This is my brother-in-law's van.

260
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:11,171
Oh, he...

261
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:15,271
was trying to sneak in to the nursery from the window of the bathroom,

262
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:19,171
but was nabbed by a police detective friend of mine

263
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:23,171
and is undergoing interrogation now.

264
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:26,171
For suspicion of breaking and entering

265
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,572
and attempted kidnapping of a toddler.

266
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:34,871
He tried to kidnap a girl named Ran Mouri,

267
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:39,771
and he is your wife's blood related younger brother.

268
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:44,471
In order to let her younger brother know which child he should kidnap,

269
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:47,671
you held the child's hand.

270
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,371
And to make your wife confirm

271
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:51,671
whether that girl was really who she wanted,

272
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,971
you called the child's name out loud

273
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,971
and put her on the sliding board

274
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:57,671
to bring her closer up to the window of the hospital,

275
00:16:57,672 --> 00:17:00,271
so she could get a good view of the child.

276
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:03,971
You made her lay the futon near the restroom

277
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:08,172
so that she'd be closest when the perp broke into the bathroom.

278
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:12,471
Wasn't the reason for putting her futon near the restroom

279
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:14,471
was because she wet herself?

280
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:16,371
Probably because you'd been slipping her sedatives

281
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:19,571
so she'd be easier to kidnap?

282
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,371
If you administer a sleeping drug to children it will make them drowsy

283
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:28,471
leading them to do things that are against their will, you see.

284
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,871
Yes. It was all to make it look

285
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:33,771
as if you were favoring just that girl

286
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:36,371
so the other children would resent her

287
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:40,371
and start bullying her.

288
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:43,471
Moreover, as to the communication book,

289
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:46,571
you wrote in that she was bullying other children.

290
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:48,571
As a result, her parents would scold her for something that she didn't do.

291
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:53,071
So you'd become the only person she could depend on.

292
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,371
In other words,

293
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,771
you were trying to win that girl over

294
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:59,271
so that you would be able to live happily with her

295
00:17:59,272 --> 00:18:01,971
even after kidnapping her.

296
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:04,771
It's just as my son had deduced.

297
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:06,471
Son?

298
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:07,571
Yes.

299
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:12,071
You were planning to spend more time to win her over,

300
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:16,171
but since my son almost found out, you speeded up your plan.

301
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:19,871
That son of mine is now doing as I told him to,

302
00:18:19,872 --> 00:18:22,171
checking the door of the restroom

303
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:25,871
after you came out to make sure that it's locked

304
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:29,471
and is standing guard in the restroom right now.

305
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:32,072
In order to protect that girl.

306
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:38,571
My wife has come down with serious neurosis.

307
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:42,771
That's why her younger brother as well as I...

308
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:46,471
That's because your daughter ran away from home, correct?

309
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:49,871
How do you know?

310
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:54,971
Your wife probably was heartbroken by your daughter running away

311
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:58,271
and wanted to raise a child again from preschool age,

312
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:02,771
when your daughter was cutest.

313
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:03,971
Yes.

314
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,971
She attempted to commit suicide several times

315
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:07,871
and became anorexic,

316
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:11,571
and I couldn't bear watching her losing weight day by day.

317
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:15,571
Therefore, could we leave my wife out of this?

318
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:20,971
No, I'm sure your wife has already gone to the police

319
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:23,071
together with your daughter.

320
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:25,871
Together with my daughter?

321
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:30,771
There is a girl called Efune among my fans.

322
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:33,071
And although she is resident of Hokkaido,

323
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,571
it seems she used an umbrella.

324
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:38,571
She said it was an old habit of hers.

325
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:42,671
People living in Hokkaido rarely use umbrellas when it snows.

326
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:48,471
If so, it is more likely that she grew up in a place other than Hokkaido.

327
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:52,771
Moreover, she said that the last dialogue in my novel

328
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:56,171
of the woman detective was as if it were being said to her.

329
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:57,172
"The Missing Body, Yusaku Kudo"

330
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,771
In that novel,

331
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:03,671
the detective finds a runaway girl who faked her suicide,

332
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:07,671
and tells them that there's no time constraint to start over

333
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:12,171
in order to convince her to return to her parent.

334
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:14,771
If those words moved her,

335
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:18,172
I figured maybe she was also a runaway.

336
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:21,671
If you want to see your daughter,

337
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:23,471
go on and turn yourself in, too.

338
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:29,472
Before my friends who are staking out get impatient.

339
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:32,771
The following day,

340
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:36,571
it was announced that Mr. Efune quit of his own convenience

341
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:38,771
and surprised the children.

342
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:42,972
The children who liked Mr. Efune were practically all crying.

343
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:45,972
Hey, listen.

344
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:51,372
I think it's okay to cry when you want to, Ran.

345
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:55,372
I won't call you a cry-baby anymore.

346
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:34,871
"I think it's okay to cry when you want to?"

347
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:38,471
That guy is sort of cool although he's only four.

348
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:40,471
You can say that again!

349
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:42,071
I can't help it can't I!

350
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:45,071
She hated being called a cry-baby.

351
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:49,971
Which means he had fallen in first sight with Ran since way back then?

352
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:51,271
No way.

353
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:56,071
I'm sure that his first love was his mom who was an actress.

354
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:57,172
I think so, too.

355
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:01,271
I'll bet Ran doesn't know

356
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,871
that from the first day we met...

357
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:05,271
What's your name?

358
00:23:05,272 --> 00:23:08,572
Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class!

359
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,171
Shinichi...

360
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:14,971
Kudo.

361
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:16,972
Thanks.

362
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:21,372
Here, all done!

363
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:33,272
I was head over heels over that smile of yours.

364
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:39,572
I had no idea that you hated me that much though.

365
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:44,871

366
00:23:44,872 --> 00:23:47,771
Makoto, you're awesome!

367
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:48,871
Yes, yes.

368
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:51,072
Why aren't you wearing that belt?

369
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:54,071
I'm old already.

370
00:23:54,072 --> 00:23:58,072
It's about time I return that black belt and retire.

371
00:24:02,572 --> 00:24:04,071
The belt's gone!

372
00:24:04,072 --> 00:24:06,371
Kyogoku, don't tell me that...

373
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:12,372
