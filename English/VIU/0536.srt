1
00:00:03,523 --> 00:00:04,623
Hey.

2
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:09,223
There's a spooky mansion on 3rd street, right?

3
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:13,123
You mean that abandoned house that no one lives in anymore?

4
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:15,423
Last night, I heard my mom say

5
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:18,823
some strange man came out of nowhere and started living there.

6
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:22,123
What? Is that haunted house?

7
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:26,223
Since it looks so spooky, no one wants to go near it.

8
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:28,623
It seems we need to scout out that house,

9
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:30,523
like the police would.

10
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:32,923
It's our duty as the Youth Detective Squad!

11
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:34,723
Roger!

12
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:39,623
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

13
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,323
Saturday nights are for mystery.

14
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,123
Hidden in the famous painter's masterpiece.

15
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:45,123
What's this astonishing mystery

16
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:46,523
you think you can see but can't?

17
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:47,823
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:49,623
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:52,223
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

20
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:36,911
"The Secret of the Vanished Masterpiece"

21
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:38,711
It's really strange to think

22
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:41,311
someone would purposely move into that kind of house.

23
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,611
I'll say.

24
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:45,811
I'm actually more interested in the one residing in your house,

25
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:49,911
rather than whoever in this haunted house.

26
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,611
You mean Subaru Okiya?

27
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,811
That guy's nothing to worry about.

28
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,411
After all, he's a Holmes fan.

29
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,311
Pretty illogical, aren't you?

30
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,511
It's none of your business.

31
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,911
I can lend my house to whoever I want.

32
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,611
I suppose, but...

33
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:15,411
It's become pretty.

34
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:16,911
Looks like the one who moved in

35
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:19,211
took good care of the landscape, huh?

36
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,811
I'm telling you, you're giving me a hard time.

37
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:28,211
We agreed that today was the deadline, didn't we?

38
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,311
Two or three more days won't hurt.

39
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,711
But we have our own schedules.

40
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:34,811
At any rate, I can only give you until tomorrow.

41
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:36,911
I have my own concerns here!

42
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:39,111
Now, leave!

43
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:44,011
You can't... you had better keep your promise!

44
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,811
Beika Real Estate Company?

45
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,211
Who are you, kids?

46
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,611
What do you want from me?

47
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,411
No, well...

48
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:03,311
Say Pops, what's with your nameplate?

49
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,611
Nothing's written on it.

50
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,211
It's true, there's no name.

51
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,811
I haven't placed a name on it yet.

52
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:11,911
I can't.

53
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:13,611
Not yet.

54
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:18,311
Not putting his name on the plate, it sure is weird.

55
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,111
Yeah, what could he be up to?

56
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:23,311
In such a huge mansion.

57
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,611
However, the next day...

58
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:28,011
What? That guy died?

59
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:29,911
What happened?

60
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:33,011
It seems he wasn't in good health.

61
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,111
He collapsed at home last night

62
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:38,511
and managed to call for an ambulance himself, but...

63
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:43,511
Although he was suspicious, I feel sorry for him.

64
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,111
That's true.

65
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:48,011
But I wonder what he was planning to do after moving into

66
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,411
that haunted mansion.

67
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:51,711
-Let's check it out. -What?

68
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:53,911
Our minds won't be at ease, right?

69
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:56,311
With an unsolved mystery lingering.

70
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:58,811
The neighbors say

71
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,411
they don't know much about that man.

72
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:05,611
Yeah, even though he moved in three months ago,

73
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,011
he didn't acquaint himself with the neighbors.

74
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:10,611
He seldom left the house, too!

75
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,411
Everyone said he would always either stay inside

76
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:15,311
to fix up the house or go out to take care of the yard.

77
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,811
Maybe he didn't have a job?

78
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,711
It's here.

79
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,511
No doubt, it's here!

80
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:24,311
Say, Pops.

81
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,811
Are you an acquaintance of the man who lived here?

82
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:29,611
You mean, you all knew the master, Mr. Wada?

83
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:30,811
A master?

84
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:33,211
He was a master of some kind?

85
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:35,411
Yes, Master Rokuro Wada

86
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:38,511
was a famous Western-style painter representing Japan!

87
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:41,211
So that guy was a painter, huh?

88
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:43,111
Then, you are, too?

89
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:45,611
No. I'm an art dealer that has been handling

90
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,911
Master Wada's masterpieces for a long time.

91
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,011
He said he rented this mansion to use as

92
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:54,111
an art studio for painting a new masterpiece, so...

93
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:57,111
There's no time for that, President!

94
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,611
You're right.

95
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,111
If someone were to steal it, it would be tragic!

96
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:07,911
Looks like this was a mystery easily solved.

97
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,611
About who that person was.

98
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:11,911
And what he was doing here, at least.

99
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,511
If he was painting all the time,

100
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:16,611
it's no wonder he never went out much.

101
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,411
But, I wonder what kind of picture he was painting.

102
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,011
We really wanna see, right?

103
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:22,211
That's true...

104
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,711
Right?

105
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:29,011
Excuse us.

106
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,811
This way!

107
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,511
There's nothing here.

108
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:46,211
It's because it was only rented as an art studio.

109
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:47,811
This house.

110
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,211
Huh?

111
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,511
Conan!

112
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:56,611
Could this boy be that man when he was a child?

113
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,711
Sure, looks like it.

114
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,411
What's going on, children?

115
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,611
No.

116
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:04,511
We just wanted to see that man's paintings.

117
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,711
The thing is, we didn't find any,

118
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:09,611
even after searching the other rooms and upstairs.

119
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:12,211
Could it be that someone stole them?

120
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:16,011
No, we didn't see any art supplies at all.

121
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:19,011
No easels, canvases, paint or brushes.

122
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,911
-What? -Are you sure this really is

123
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,411
his art studio?

124
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,911
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

125
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,511
I finally found it. The perfect place!

126
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:30,611
I'm going to create

127
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:35,111
a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece there!

128
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:37,811
Master did say that.

129
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:40,111
Couldn't it be that he simply put his art supplies away

130
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:43,011
-after he finished painting? -I see!

131
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,911
Let's give it one more careful search!

132
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,911
Excuse me, Mr. Wada?

133
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:50,411
We're about to commence the deconstruction!

134
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,111
What is the meaning of this?

135
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,611
What do you mean by what?

136
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:56,711
This is the guy who was arguing with Mr. Wada yesterday!

137
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,711
Arguing with Master?

138
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,211
Where is Mr. Wada?

139
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:02,311
He passed away.

140
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:03,311
What?

141
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,711
Late last night.

142
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:07,711
Lucky.

143
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:09,411
Wait! What did you say?

144
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,111
Someone has died and you feel lucky?

145
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,911
Oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:20,611
I'm Shishikura, of Beika Real Estate.

147
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,011
In fact, our company

148
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,611
purchased this land three months ago

149
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,111
and decided to demolish the building right away

150
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,411
for other use, but...

151
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,711
That's when Mr. Wada came around.

152
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,911
He said he wanted to rent this place for three months.

153
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:38,811
So, we agreed to rent it to him for just three months, but...

154
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,211
You're not leaving? What do you mean?

155
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:43,611
Something has come up and I've changed my plans.

156
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:45,711
Please give me two or three more days.

157
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:48,111
But that's causing us problems, you know!

158
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,811
We already sold this land to another customer

159
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,711
and agreed to demolish this house immediately!

160
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,711
I just need two or three days more.

161
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:58,211
That's what he said, it really put me in a pickle.

162
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:00,711
So, that's why they were fighting.

163
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:04,911
But, since he's gone, so is the problem, right?

164
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,111
All right, everyone!

165
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,711
Carry out his belongings and start the demolition.

166
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:12,011
Hold it! Please wait until we find the painting

167
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,811
-that Master Wada was talking about. -Oh, no.

168
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:16,911
Don't worry, we'll be quick.

169
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:18,111
You must be kidding.

170
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:20,211
What do we do now, Mr. Shishikura?

171
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:23,211
We'll just have to wait.

172
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:26,111
Let's help them find the painting as well!

173
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:28,711
Sounds like fun, just like a treasure hunt.

174
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,111
Let's, let's!

175
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,511
-But... -Let's go!

176
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:37,311
So, you're not going to look for it?

177
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:45,711
It's Master Wada's final masterpiece.

178
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,511
Just think of the aesthetic value!

179
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:59,811
I'd say it's futile, searching for the painting.

180
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,511
Futile?

181
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:07,111
Conan!

182
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:12,711
Where on earth did Master Wada put his painting?

183
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,011
Conan?

184
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,411
But, it's strange as well, this place.

185
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,611
If painting had been done here,

186
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,411
there should at least be a scent of paint.

187
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:27,611
But I can't smell anything like it.

188
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:29,011
Now that you mention it.

189
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:34,111
It's true just like the boy says.

190
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,011
Perhaps Master Wada didn't paint anything here after all.

191
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:40,211
No painting?

192
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,411
If that's it, the remaining mystery

193
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:45,511
revolves around why he rented the house.

194
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,211
Jeez, you can't even firmly refuse.

195
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,711
So it looks like nothing come out.

196
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:59,111
There was no painting to begin with, I suppose.

197
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:01,811
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:03,211
Now let's get started!

199
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,411
We can finally get to work!

200
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:08,411
Yeah, let's get this over with!

201
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:15,611
Excuse me.

202
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:17,711
Where is Mr. Wada?

203
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,411
He passed away last night.

204
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:22,911
What?

205
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:24,511
Why are you looking for Master Wada?

206
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:29,011
We received a message from Mr. Wada a few days ago.

207
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:32,911
"It'll be completed today, so please come see the painting", it said.

208
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,911
Come see the painting?

209
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,611
Master Wada actually said that?

210
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,211
Yes.

211
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:46,211
Four or five days ago. He mailed this.

212
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:50,211
Due to bad weather, it took longer than expected, but...

213
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:53,411
I believe, it will be completed by this weekend.

214
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:56,111
Please be sure to bring Auntie here to see it.

215
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,911
Rokuro.

216
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:01,011
There is no doubt. This is Master Wada's handwriting!

217
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:05,211
Ms. Eguchi. That's your name, isn't it?

218
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:07,411
Oh, yes.

219
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,411
What's Kafuen?

220
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:12,911
A retirement home. That's where I work.

221
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:15,511
What? A retirement home!

222
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:20,011
Are you Ms. Saeko Takato?

223
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,611
Do you know her?

224
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,911
As I suspected.

225
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,111
It's actually something I heard about from Master Wada.

226
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,511
He said he often visited your place as a child,

227
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,811
and an auntie of his always took care of him.

228
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:34,211
He said that the auntie is now in a retirement home.

229
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:38,911
Master Wada always took good care of me.

230
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:42,311
Ever since Ms. Takato's injury a year ago,

231
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:45,111
she's been suffering from amnesia.

232
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:46,511
What?

233
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:49,911
She doesn't even remember who she is anymore.

234
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,711
Amnesia.

235
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,611
I'm sorry to hear that.

236
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:56,811
But still, Mr. Wada

237
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:59,911
would take time out of his busy schedule to visit.

238
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:02,111
Listen, dear auntie.

239
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:06,911
I'm now working on a masterpiece I drew just for you!

240
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,311
How exciting, Ms. Takato.

241
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,011
Please do bring it here when you're done.

242
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,611
Well, it'd be impossible to bring it here.

243
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:16,311
You'll have to come by.

244
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:19,711
Does that mean it's a big project?

245
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,411
If you feast your eyes on it,

246
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:24,311
I'm sure you will regain your memories!

247
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,911
The gate guarding your memories will swing right open!

248
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,711
I'm certain!

249
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,611
That means Master Wada

250
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,011
actually did work on his final piece in his house!

251
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:40,411
Let's hurry and tear this house apart

252
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:42,211
to make up for our lost time!

253
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:52,716
Hold on!

254
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:54,916
Once more, let's search thoroughly!

255
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,316
Yes!

256
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,016
Hey, you two!

257
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:00,616
You couldn't find it anywhere, right?

258
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,516
It's nowhere?

259
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:04,916
There must be!

260
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,116
Please wait! We can't have you going in there again!

261
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:10,116
What now, Mr. Shishikura?

262
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:14,216
We wait. We can't proceed if there're people inside!

263
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:16,416
We have another construction site to get to!

264
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,116
Let's go grab some lunch!

265
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:21,716
No point arguing with a wimp like him!

266
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:25,016
That good for nothing.

267
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,516
And I thought we could finally get started.

268
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:31,416
Then, Ms. Takato, how about we wait here for a while?

269
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,216
Don't just stay and sit around!

270
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,616
What do you think?

271
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,216
The painting?

272
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:41,316
You're not going to find anything

273
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,816
because he probably didn't draw anything to begin with.

274
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,016
What? What do you mean?

275
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:49,216
Do you mean he lied to his favorite auntie

276
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:52,416
who cared for him when he was little?

277
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,516
I don't want to think that.

278
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:56,216
If it wasn't for working on a painting,

279
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:59,916
what reason did he have for renting this haunted mansion?

280
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,916
So, back to that mystery again.

281
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,916
It looks like all he did was fix the house

282
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,116
and take care of the yard.

283
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,916
That's right.

284
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:13,416
Just up ahead if I remember correctly.

285
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,116
Mitsuhiko?

286
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:22,116
The kids have finally gone home!

287
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:24,116
It's time for us to go.

288
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:26,216
But the painting...

289
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:30,916
It's bright and sunny today,

290
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,416
so let's walk slowly over to the station.

291
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:42,216
-What the heck is it? -Beika Bank.

292
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:44,016
That guy was trying to dig a tunnel

293
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:46,116
from that mansion to here!

294
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:47,616
A tunnel?

295
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:48,916
He tried to steal his way

296
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,516
into the underground deposit vault!

297
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:53,716
As expected, an underground tunnel.

298
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:55,616
From that mansion to this bank,

299
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:58,716
the direct distance is only about 50m.

300
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:00,716
If he were to dig 60cm a day,

301
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:03,016
three months would be enough!

302
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:04,916
He dug away during the night.

303
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,116
And then, during the day,

304
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:09,116
he would bring up the dirt and deposit it in the garden.

305
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:12,316
By doing that, he could make it appear as if he was gardening.

306
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,616
He was fixing up the house too, you know?

307
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:16,116
Merely camouflage.

308
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:18,616
It wouldn't look natural if he only worked in the yard.

309
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:21,216
-However... -Not only that.

310
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,616
Well, it'd be impossible to bring it here.

311
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,516
You'll have to come by.

312
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:28,316
If he were stealing billions of yen,

313
00:16:28,316 --> 00:16:30,416
it sure would be impossible to carry around!

314
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,216
If you feast your eyes on it,

315
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:35,116
I think even you will regain your memories, Auntie!

316
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,416
There's no one out there who wouldn't be shocked

317
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,916
feasting their eyes on billions of yen!

318
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,616
He was referring to shocking her out of her amnesia!

319
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,316
That's what he meant!

320
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:48,316
Perfect, Mitsuhiko!

321
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:52,916
It made my head spin.

322
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,716
Let's find the entrance to the tunnel!

323
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,216
Yes!

324
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,116
The kids are back.

325
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:01,516
So, that man went as far as to fight the real estate agent

326
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:03,516
in order to keep staying here.

327
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:06,216
Don't go in, never again.

328
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:07,816
This is the storage cabinet.

329
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,716
But it's not connected to the basement.

330
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:11,316
That means he could have torn up some of the wooden flooring

331
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:13,516
and dug under there, right?

332
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:16,816
So! We should go check if there's a void under the floor.

333
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,516
Not in this room, it looks like.

334
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,816
Let's try elsewhere!

335
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:25,116
Boy, they sure are noisy.

336
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:27,516
Stop making messes.

337
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:29,116
What?

338
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,716
At Aunt Saeko's House?

339
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:36,416
Could it be...

340
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,716
No, if I think of it this way, it all...

341
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:43,916
Chief! Something strange has come up.

342
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,316
And because of it, we couldn't...

343
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,416
All right.

344
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:55,116
Time's up! We've gotta move to the next site!

345
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,116
But, what about the demolition of this house?

346
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:01,716
Why don't you do it yourself?

347
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,416
Why is it always like this?

348
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,716
This house is to blame for everything!

349
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,916
So, this house really was...

350
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,716
I think it's where you used to live.

351
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:26,616
I wonder if I lived in such a beautiful house like this.

352
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:29,216
Since you lost your husband quite early in life,

353
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:31,616
you apparently had a pretty rough time, but...

354
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:38,116
Before that, I heard you were very wealthy and happy.

355
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,616
Well...

356
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:42,516
Memories from the past when she was happy...

357
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,116
So that's what it was!

358
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:55,216
I'll burn it down to ashes!

359
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,916
What the heck are you doing?

360
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,516
Stop doing foolish things!

361
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:07,216
What if the fire were to spread to the rest of the neighborhood?

362
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:09,916
I'm sorry. But please understand.

363
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,316
I have my reasons!

364
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,816
Just one more day! Wait until tomorrow.

365
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:16,416
Please!

366
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,816
What happened to him?

367
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:32,116
It seems like he's willing to wait one more day

368
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,316
to tear down the house.

369
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:37,016
It's okay to bring the house down immediately.

370
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:40,416
There was no painting anywhere, after all.

371
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,316
And no underground tunnels either.

372
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:44,116
Figures.

373
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,516
Because the reason that man rented this house was...

374
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:49,116
So that he could work on something for his auntie, Ms. Takato,

375
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:52,816
a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece.

376
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,716
Did you find it?

377
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,916
It's still in progress.

378
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,416
I think it'll be completed by tomorrow.

379
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,916
Tomorrow?

380
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,616
It'll be complete?

381
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:06,616
Because the weather's nice today.

382
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:11,316
"The next day"

383
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,216
As I thought, it really is entirely complete.

384
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:22,216
What is this? It's beautiful!

385
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:29,816
It wasn't a painting.

386
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:32,816
A gorgeous sea of flower flooding around the garden.

387
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,716
This is the masterpiece Mr. Wada

388
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:38,016
had worked on for three months.

389
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,216
This view is the masterpiece.

390
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:49,416
Due to bad weather, it took extra time to complete.

391
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,616
So that's why he asked for more days.

392
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:55,316
Ms. Takato?

393
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:58,516
I know this place!

394
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:07,516
Flowers blooming around the garden, and swaying in the wind.

395
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,416
Over there was this mansion.

396
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:16,016
My husband stood beside me and I was always smiling.

397
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:20,416
The always cute Roku, my nephew, often came over to play.

398
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,616
Roku lost his mother when he was still young,

399
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:28,216
so he viewed me as his mother after that.

400
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:30,716
Ms. Takato, could it be...

401
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:33,216
I remember! Everything.

402
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:37,416
The gate to her memories opened?

403
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,716
So that's why it had to be here.

404
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,516
At this house that is very similar to auntie's house.

405
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,516
It couldn't be anywhere else.

406
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,116
I've got it.

407
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:52,916
The nameplate was meant to be his signature.

408
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,416
Signature?

409
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,516
That's why he didn't display his nameplate.

410
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,516
Not until the flowers bloomed.

411
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:01,416
Because the painting of the painter

412
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:05,016
is never signed until after his piece is complete.

413
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:07,416
That's how it is!

414
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,616
I guess it's all gone.

415
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:34,716
The haunted house, and the garden.

416
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:36,616
Such a waste, huh?

417
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:40,316
But, that man's wish finally reached his auntie,

418
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:43,116
-so it's all right! -You're right!

419
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:44,316
That's true!

420
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:47,316
-Well, we're gonna be late! -Yes!

421
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:48,916
Hey, hold on a second!

422
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,916
Don't leave me behind, you guys!

423
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:03,316
It's Kichiemon Samizu's safe.

424
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:16,916
This old man really likes to surround things.

425
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:21,616
Thief Kid?

426
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:23,016
Next Conan,

427
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:27,216
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 1)"

428
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,316
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:46,906
"A warning letter"
