1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:01,602
Connected!

2
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:04,902
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:06,602
Eisuke Hondo is somewhat a suspicious character.

4
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:07,802
The mysterious case that occurred at the Teimusu River!

5
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:09,302
Something has begun to move!

6
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:10,702
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:12,102
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:13,802
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:57,715
"Haido Central Hospital"

10
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,289
Rena Mizunashi hasn't regained consciousness yet?

11
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,189
No.

12
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,089
Memory loss due to exterior injuries

13
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:13,189
usually improve in about a month.

14
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:14,689
But I was told by the doctor in charge,

15
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:17,089
that if this continues on for more than two months,

16
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:19,389
it may take even longer.

17
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,489
That's bad.

18
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,189
The longer this keeps on,

19
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,589
the higher the chance of them finding this place.

20
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,989
I think we should move her to a different hospital after all.

21
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,189
Maybe even to a hospital in the States if we have to.

22
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,989
No.

23
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,689
Doing so will only make things more conspicuous,

24
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:42,689
and we'd be doing exactly what they want us to do.

25
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,689
But...

26
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:49,689
Well, if that happens, we can take things from there.

27
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,289
And I don't think that there'd be a better bait to fish them with.

28
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,089
Bait?

29
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:56,789
By the way,

30
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:59,889
did you get anything on the personal history of Rena Mizunashi?

31
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:04,489
Actually, everything she said on and to Nichiuri TV was fabricated.

32
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,989
And there is no way of knowing where she was born or raised.

33
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:15,689
Which means we can't even tell if she has a family or not.

34
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,089
I'm pretty sure

35
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:21,989
that her crazy name, Rena Mizunashi, is also an alias anyway.

36
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,989
Crazy name?

37
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,989
Mizunashi is zero.

38
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,689
Rena equals zero and seven.

39
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,389
It's 007.

40
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,789
Get it?

41
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,789
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: The Little Witness"

42
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:49,089
But...

43
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:53,589
It may seem that way to you,

44
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:57,289
but it was only because your husband asked me to do it.

45
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:58,889
I'm home!

46
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,489
You should talk to your husband about it.

47
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,989
Is that right?

48
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:07,689
You ruthless rat!

49
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,589
Who was that on the phone?

50
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,389
A man asked me to investigate on his wife's affair, so I did.

51
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,789
And that was his wife on the line just now.

52
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:23,489
She said, "Thanks to you, I ended up getting a divorce.

53
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:26,189
Just what are you going to do about it?"

54
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:28,889
And she's the one that's having the affair.

55
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,289
Gosh.

56
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,789
I really wish I were James Bond or something.

57
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,989
Huh? Why?

58
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,789
What do you mean?

59
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:42,989
Because he gets to wear expensive brand name clothes.

60
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:46,489
He gets to ride super luxurious cars equipped with high tech devices

61
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:49,489
and conduct investigations in glamour.

62
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:06,889
On the other hand,

63
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,389
I work wearing the only suit I have and rent this car.

64
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,689
I was sneakily taking pictures of her having affairs, you know.

65
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:28,689
Moreover, no matter where he goes,

66
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,789
women are head over heels over him.

67
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,989
On the contrary, I get yelled at by a middle-aged woman.

68
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,789
I mean, how different can things get?

69
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,389
This coffee tastes good!

70
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,489
Is this some brand name coffee or something?

71
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:46,289
Nope.

72
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,089
It's drip type coffee that just came out the other day.

73
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,389
I just got it at the supermarket.

74
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:52,989
It said that if I collect enough points,

75
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:56,189
I would be able to get a cute coffee pot so I went out and bought it.

76
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,889
So, drip type coffee is what suits me best?

77
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:03,589
Oh, come on.

78
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,089
-If you want to complain, you don't have to drink it! -Hot!

79
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,789
That's hot...

80
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,489
You're...

81
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,589
Eisuke Hondo.

82
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,589
Hello.

83
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,289
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

84
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,689
Did you get burnt?

85
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,389
No, I'm fine!

86
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,389
I'm the one to blame for just standing there doing nothing.

87
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,589
And what brings you here?

88
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:36,589
I happened to run into him at the supermarket and brought him here.

89
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:40,289
Detective Mouri, you said I could come over whenever I wanted.

90
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:42,289
I guess I did.

91
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:43,889
Let me help you!

92
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,389
I'll take your calls or do whatever!

93
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,789
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

94
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:55,489
Hello? Hello?

95
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:57,889
Hey.

96
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,489
Huh? That's strange.

97
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,489
They hung up.

98
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:08,789
I mean, you went ahead and hung it up yourself!

99
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,789
Listen, don't touch anything!

100
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,089
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,689
I didn't even notice

102
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:24,489
-that he was in this room. -I'll go bring a towel.

103
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:27,089
Don't tell me that he deliberately erased his presence?

104
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:28,089
Or...

105
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:31,789
All right.

106
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,389
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there.

107
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,289
It's okay.

108
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,989
Or maybe he just have a very flimsy sense of presence.

109
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,889
Detectives sure don't have much to do, do they?

110
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:52,989
Yeah.

111
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:56,189
Might be different if somebody hadn't hung up on a client.

112
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:00,989
Huh? This comic is not going to be issued next week.

113
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:04,189
Too bad. I wanted to know how this story was going to continue.

114
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,189
It says that they're taking a rest because of an interview,

115
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:07,489
so I guess it can't be helped.

116
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:10,989
But this could require investigation as well, right?

117
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:12,589
Huh? Why?

118
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,689
Because although it's written that there will be an interview,

119
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,889
you never know, right?

120
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,489
It could be that the writer fled because he got sick of the job.

121
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:26,389
Or he could've come down with a cold that he's unable to write.

122
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,489
Or it could be

123
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,989
that the writer's been kidnapped and is being confined somewhere?

124
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:33,689
No, that couldn't be.

125
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:36,689
Remember the actor six months ago?

126
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:40,089
He said he was recharging himself and stayed away for some time.

127
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:42,089
He turned out to be actually sick.

128
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,889
There was someone recently, too.

129
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:47,289
Let's see...

130
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:49,989
You know, they were on TV a lot,

131
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:52,589
but is taking a rest and now they don't appear anymore.

132
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:59,089
I get it! Roku Itagaki!

133
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,589
Huh?

134
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:01,689
You know,

135
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:05,089
the musician that made a major debut last year and hit the scenes.

136
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:07,089
Isn't he the one you're talking about?

137
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,289
Yes, well...

138
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,489
Just as I thought.

139
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,089
Sonoko also mentioned about it.

140
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,689
It's been less than a year since he's debuted

141
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,389
and he's already taking time off to recharge himself,

142
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:19,989
so something is bound to have happened.

143
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,089
Like so.

144
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:23,789
Was Sonoko his fan or something?

145
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,689
Yeah. From the time he was in an indies band.

146
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:30,189
He probably got rich,

147
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:33,089
so he is fooling around with some ladies somewhere.

148
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,189
Just like 007.

149
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:38,089
That man was killed.

150
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,889
I saw him being thrown off a bridge!

151
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,489
I see.

152
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,089
So Takumi got excited

153
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,289
after hearing the CD of Roku Itagaki playing on a TV commercial?

154
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:55,189
Takumi has been telling you that, right?

155
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,689
Yes.

156
00:09:56,689 --> 00:10:00,289
He said, "Daddy, this man with the saw died."

157
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:02,689
Saw?

158
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:06,189
His head looks like a saw.

159
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:11,189
I guess it's because of his silver haircut, so it does looked like it.

160
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:15,889
But there was no such news on TV or in the papers.

161
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,389
I didn't believe him at first,

162
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:22,189
but I heard that Mr. Itagaki suddenly took time off from work.

163
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,589
I got kind of worried

164
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,889
and decided to come talk it over with you, Detective Mouri.

165
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,889
I actually tried calling you before coming,

166
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:33,289
but for some reason, the phone was cut.

167
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:35,289
Oh, no.

168
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,289
Hey.

169
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:42,289
Takumi, do you know at which bridge you saw it?

170
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:43,889
I saw it the other day.

171
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:46,189
I don't know where, though.

172
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,789
I heard the sound of fireworks.

173
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:50,989
If it was the other day,

174
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,689
isn't it the fireworks that were shot up at the beginning of the New Year?

175
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:59,289
Mr. Hashiratani, do you remember where Takumi was back then?

176
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:05,189
Yes. I think it was in my car on the way to visit a shrine.

177
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:08,789
We were in a traffic jam at the time.

178
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,289
I actually got pretty tired and was dozing off here and there.

179
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,989
So I don't remember which bridge we were crossing

180
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,489
when we heard the fireworks.

181
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:19,189
Can you tell us more in detail about what happened back then?

182
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:21,189
Let's see...

183
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:26,689
He had a big bag beside him and kept looking at the river.

184
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:28,889
But he suddenly got up, picked the bag up

185
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,489
and threw the bag down over the bridge.

186
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,489
Then, Mr. Itagaki was in that bag.

187
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:37,789
But how did you know Mr. Itagaki was in the bag?

188
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,689
I saw him before the bag was dropped.

189
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:41,689
It was sticking out of the bag.

190
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:43,489
There was a lot of blood.

191
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:46,489
The saw headed man's face.

192
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:57,125
I saw it!

193
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,025
That can't be.

194
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:05,925
If something like that were carried around,

195
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,325
somebody is bound to notice it.

196
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:10,725
But it was dark, so I had to take a good look.

197
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:13,025
It was hard to tell.

198
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,725
Then are you saying

199
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,525
that something you had to take a good look at to make out,

200
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:20,625
could only be seen by you?

201
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,825
But it happened so fast!

202
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,725
His head just popped out of the bag.

203
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:30,325
What did the man do after he threw the bag down?

204
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:34,025
He took out stuff from his clothes and dropped them.

205
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,625
I couldn't really see because his body was in the way.

206
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,725
Then he started looking for something,

207
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,825
touching his clothes here and there.

208
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:44,425
Touching his clothes here and there?

209
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:45,625
Before he started looking for something,

210
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,025
did he put something in his mouth?

211
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,325
Yes, he did.

212
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:52,025
I see. It was a cigarette.

213
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:54,725
He had a cigarette in his mouth.

214
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:57,225
Then he must've been looking for a lighter.

215
00:12:57,225 --> 00:13:00,625
And did he found the lighter?

216
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:04,125
Yes. After he lit the cigarette, he threw that away, too.

217
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,625
Did he stay there for a while then?

218
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,825
Nope.

219
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:11,325
He got in a car that was nearby and left right away.

220
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:14,525
Do you remember what he looked like, or what kind of car it was?

221
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:17,325
The car was a dark colour.

222
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,425
But as for his face, since he was wearing a cap...

223
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,225
But he had a drawing on his arm.

224
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:26,925
What? You saw a drawing?

225
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,525
A drawing of a strange nail.

226
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:33,425
A drawing of a strange nail?

227
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:36,825
That's right!

228
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,925
Near the car that I was riding back then,

229
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:44,125
I saw a shiny hammer that was this big!

230
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,925
A shiny hammer?

231
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,425
Yes.

232
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:50,525
A saw,

233
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:53,925
a nail and a hammer?

234
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:58,325
Is this brat playing games with us?

235
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:00,425
Mr. Mouri?

236
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:02,125
Well...

237
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,525
A boy like you shouldn't tease adults, okay?

238
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:19,125
Takumi. Was that your name?

239
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,125
Yes.

240
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:26,425
You're lying, aren't you?

241
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:27,825
No, I'm not.

242
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,225
I'm telling the truth.

243
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,925
My chance.

244
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:56,525
Excuse...

245
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:59,625
If I remove the transmitter and listening device now...

246
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,625
All right, I've got it!

247
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:09,225
Sonny.

248
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:51,125
Don't tell me you followed me here?

249
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,125
Of course not.

250
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,325
It's just a coincidence.

251
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:04,525
I see.

252
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:10,425
Thank you.

253
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:13,125
Thanks for picking up my shoe.

254
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,125
Really, thank you so much.

255
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:46,425
Takumi.

256
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:51,125
I guess he's not lying.

257
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,725
Huh?

258
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:54,625
He's got to be.

259
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,625
Four days have already gone by since he saw it happen, you know.

260
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,325
If it's true, the body should've been found by now,

261
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:03,925
and there would be news about it.

262
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:07,325
We interrupt this program to report special news that just came in.

263
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:11,525
Today at dawn, the body of a man that was found in Teimusu River

264
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:14,125
was confirmed by the bereaved family to be

265
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,325
"Roku Itagaki (22)" -Mr. Roku Itagaki himself.

266
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:23,925
The body was found shoved into a bag

267
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,025
and on his head,

268
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:28,825
there were several traces of assault including those that were fatal.

269
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:31,625
Therefore, the police are investigating the case

270
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,325
as murder through a grudge.

271
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:37,625
It was for real.

272
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,825
This means that

273
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,825
my son saying that he saw someone throw the bag

274
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:45,825
with Mr. Itagaki's body inside it over the bridge...

275
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,925
It really happened, didn't it?

276
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,925
Of course! I'm not lying!

277
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:54,025
Then shouldn't we report this to the police right away?

278
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:55,625
That's right.

279
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,625
This boy is an important witness.

280
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:03,825
But he says that Roku Itagaki's got a saw head

281
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:07,425
and that the killer had a drawing of a nail on his arm.

282
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:11,125
He goes on to say,

283
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,125
when he saw all that near the car he was riding,

284
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:17,425
he saw a big shiny hammer.

285
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:21,725
I don't think the police will believe what this boy is saying at all.

286
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:26,825
Moreover, he doesn't even know where the bridge the body was dropped from.

287
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:29,825
Then why don't we take Takumi in the car

288
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,725
and replay that entire day?

289
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,625
We may just come up with something.

290
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,425
Besides, we already know that it's the Teimusu River.

291
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:37,925
That's right.

292
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:42,425
He witnessed it on a bridge on the way to the shrine on New Year's day.

293
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:46,925
Mr. Hashiratani, do you at least remember what road you took that day?

294
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,825
Yes, sort of.

295
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:51,625
But you're fantastic, Eisuke!

296
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,525
I mean, you could tell whether he was telling the truth or not

297
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,625
just by looking at his face.

298
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,725
Well, it's really no big deal.

299
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:04,225
I just copied what my dad used to do when I was a child.

300
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:06,425
It's similar to a magic trick.

301
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:14,025
And?

302
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:17,425
Which way did you turn at this intersection?

303
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:19,725
If we make a right, it's Haido Big Bridge.

304
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,825
If we go straight, we come out to Haido Central Bridge.

305
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:26,025
If we make a left, we come out to New Haido Bridge.

306
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:27,225
Yes.

307
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:31,525
I'm sure it was the nearest street in the middle.

308
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,925
Then it's Haido Central Bridge?

309
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:35,925
But...

310
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:44,225
I took a right there to avoid traffic.

311
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,325
They usually have checkpoints for drunk driving at the end of the year.

312
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:49,225
Then, it's Haido Big Bridge?

313
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:50,725
Oh, no.

314
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:53,825
There are a lot of traffic lights to the right, so I went left.

315
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,925
But it's the farthest road to take.

316
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,725
Come on, let's be a bit more specific.

317
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,925
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:06,525
I always take this road to work.

319
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:10,425
I took whichever road I felt like taking at the time.

320
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:14,125
So I don't really remember which road I took that day.

321
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,825
I mean...

322
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:17,725
Hey,

323
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:20,525
you said you remembered the way!

324
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,625
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,325
Dad!

326
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,025
It's all right.

327
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,225
Why don't we stop over at all three bridges in order?

328
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:31,325
That's right.

329
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:33,525
In order to cross the Teimusu River from here,

330
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:37,425
we're going to have to cross one of the three bridges anyway.

331
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:38,625
That's it.

332
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,825
Right, Conan?

333
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,125
Conan?

334
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,725
Yeah.

335
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:50,225
What's the matter? You're not your usual peppy self.

336
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:52,025
I'm just fine.

337
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:54,625
I'm fine.

338
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:58,725
Really? Okay then.

339
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:11,325
I just copied what my dad used to do when I was a child.

340
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:13,325
It's similar to a magic trick.

341
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:17,025
No.

342
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,725
It's no magic trick.

343
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,925
What he did a while ago,

344
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:26,325
is what that person did back then.

345
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:29,825
It is a way to detect lies by checking for irregularities in the pulse

346
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:34,125
and breathing as well as for dilation of the pupils.

347
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:38,725
Moreover, his actions are just like that person.

348
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:40,625
They're almost identical.

349
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,925
Just as I thought.

350
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,025
This guy...

351
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,025
He's connected to...

352
00:21:57,925 --> 00:22:00,525
Eisuke Hondo.

353
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,225
You're...

354
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:12,125
And that person...

355
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:15,725
You're connected with that person.

356
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:19,225
Rena Mizunashi.

357
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:22,925
The woman called Kir

358
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,225
of the Black Organization!

359
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,925
"Next Episode" -Look!

360
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:01,725
The thumb tack on the lower right that holds the flag in place isn't there.

361
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:04,225
It's this drawing!

362
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,925
I saw this drawing on his arm!

363
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,425
Are you sure, sonny?

364
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:11,725
Have you given this tattoo to anyone yet?

365
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:16,625
Just as I thought. Look!

366
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,325
I see.

367
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,725
So that's the story.

368
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:27,625
Next Conan, "The Shadow of the Black Organization: Queer Lightning"

369
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,625
Next Conan's Hint:

370
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,225
"Snake and a nail"

371
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:49,825
Do you really want that pot?

372
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:52,325
-I've collected enough points. -That was fast.
