1
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:05,338
This way, this way!

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,338
If it's no big deal, you're treating!

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:12,538
Well, it's no big thing taking the long way at times.

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,938
I guess so.

5
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,139
Over here!

6
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,038
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

7
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,138
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

8
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:46,138
What I wanted to see taking the long way around

9
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:48,638
were beautiful cherry blossom and the memories of Ran.

10
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,238
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,238
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,639
His name is Detective Conan!

13
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,890
"Memories from Sakura Class (Ran Girl)"

14
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:32,188
How beautiful!

15
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,588
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom!

16
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,988
Yes!

17
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,588
Just as Conan said,

18
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:39,988
we were right to take this road!

19
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,188
You did it, brat!

20
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,088
I passed by here with Genta and the others after school yesterday

21
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,589
and it was beautiful, you see.

22
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,089
Just as I thought. Seeing cherry blossoms brings back memories...

23
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,989
of the time I first ran into Shinichi.

24
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,588
I guess Shinichi doesn't know about it.

25
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:03,789
But back then...

26
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,889
I didn't like him at all.

27
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,888
"13 years ago"

28
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,388
Hey, dear.

29
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,788
Have you seen Ran's name tag that was over here?

30
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:31,588
I saw it on the kitchen table.

31
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,588
That's the one for the Tulip Class she was in last year.

32
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,188
I'm going to be in the Sakura Class from today.

33
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,388
Oh, is that right?

34
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,788
I was going to pin it on her when we went to preschool today,

35
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,888
and put in on the shoe cabinet,

36
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,188
but haven't you seen it?

37
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:47,189
Come to think of it,

38
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,389
I thought something dropped when I took the shoe horn.

39
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:54,589
"Sakura Class, Ran Mouri"

40
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,588
Oh, no. I stepped on it.

41
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:59,888
No joke! It's shattered to pieces.

42
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,088
Sorry.

43
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:04,688
I think it'll do if you paste it back on with glue or something.

44
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:08,188
I don't think it can be fixed with something like that.

45
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,788
I'll be going because I start work at MPD headquarters from today.

46
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,788
Oh, wait.

47
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:13,789
Gosh.

48
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,388
I guess we'll just have to ask the nursery school teacher

49
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:20,588
to get you a new one.

50
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,589
Then, what should I do till then?

51
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:24,988
Don't worry.

52
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:28,288
I'll make you a substitute name tag!

53
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,288
Will you please bring colored heavy duty construction paper?

54
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,289
Yes!

55
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,398
Forget it.

56
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:38,797
She's not coming back anymore.

57
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:40,597
No, that's not true.

58
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:42,897
That's not true!

59
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,398
Then, what do you want to do about it?

60
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:50,397
I want reset things.

61
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:52,898
Then, I'm sure everything will work out this time.

62
00:04:55,798 --> 00:05:00,398
There's no time constraint to start over.

63
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:11,197
I was touched, Kudo Sensei!

64
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:12,897
Well, thank you.

65
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:16,897
Especially the last dialogue of the wandering woman detective.

66
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:21,397
"There's no time constraint to start over."

67
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:23,397
I felt like it was being said to me

68
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,997
and it gave me goose bumps!

69
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:26,797
If I remember correctly,

70
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:31,297
you're from Hokkaido who came to the last signing event, aren't you?

71
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,497
You remembered me!

72
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:35,197
Thank you so much!

73
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:38,897
Then, the snow that was falling until just a while ago,

74
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:41,197
did it change to rain already?

75
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,997
Oh, no.

76
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:44,898
This is a habit of mine from before.

77
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:46,998
I see.

78
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:50,497
Excuse me for a moment.

79
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:53,697
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

80
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,498
Thank you very much.

81
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:58,597
Hello?

82
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,497
Oh, Yukiko.

83
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:04,097
What? Shinichi's nursery school name tag?

84
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,797
Right! The one that was shaped like a cherry blossom petal.

85
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:09,097
The one made of plastic.

86
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:11,997
Shinichi is going to be starting his new nursery school from today.

87
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:15,997
So, I wrote his name and put it on the desk of the study last night.

88
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:16,998
Have you seen it?

89
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:18,797
Nope.

90
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:21,697
If it were the pen and glasses case that were on the desk,

91
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:24,998
I rushed to put them in my pocket when I left.

92
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:27,797
Oh, here it is.

93
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:29,097
I thought so!

94
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,397
You took it with you, right?

95
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:34,897
It's because you left it on the desk of the study.

96
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:38,298
But the perfect pen was right here, you see!

97
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:43,297
Then, I'll stop over there on my way to take Shinichi to the nursery

98
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:44,897
so wait there for us, okay?

99
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:47,797
Don't forget to wear your hat and sunglasses when you come, okay?

100
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,597
You'll cause a commotion if people know it's you.

101
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,097
Okay.

102
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:53,398
Let's go then, Shinichi.

103
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,897
Shinichi?

104
00:06:57,898 --> 00:06:59,298
Hey, where are you?

105
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,897
What?

106
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:07,797
Ran, what's wrong your badge?

107
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:09,897
Mother made it for me!

108
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:11,697
Because mine broke.

109
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,597
Fantastic! It look so real!

110
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,997
There's a safety pin in the back.

111
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:18,497
I can put it on and take it off, too.

112
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:19,498
See!

113
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:22,297
You're right.

114
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:24,198
Your mother's a genius.

115
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:27,398
Here.

116
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:29,797
What's this?

117
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:30,997
It's made of paper?

118
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:32,097
Lame.

119
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,597
You're not one of us because yours is different from ours!

120
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:35,997
Right, right.

121
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,697
You're not one of us.

122
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:39,597
Hey, give it back!

123
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:40,897
No way!

124
00:07:40,898 --> 00:07:42,197
No way.

125
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:43,998
Give it back!

126
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:48,597
Sonoko?

127
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:49,898
-Give it back! -Sonoko!

128
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:53,398
Come on! Shake hands.

129
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:00,898
There. Now you've made up.

130
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:06,497
"Ronsuke Efune (39)" -And as for your new name tag,

131
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:09,097
I think it'll be ready by next week.

132
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,297
So can you wait till then?

133
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:12,298
Yes.

134
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,097
I'm sorry, Ran.

135
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,397
I tried to get it back for you,

136
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,198
but it got all wrinkled.

137
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,997
Don't worry.

138
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:30,298
Because I was watching mother make it.

139
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:07,097
First, I fold it in half,

140
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,697
and fold it in half once more.

141
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:11,197
Then I open it once more,

142
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:14,297
and match the edge at the top to the crease in the middle

143
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:16,697
and fold it then back again.

144
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:19,897
Next, I match this edge to the crease in the middle,

145
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:22,797
fold it and back again, next...

146
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:23,798
Next...

147
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:27,697
Hang in there.

148
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,097
Just a little bit more.

149
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:31,797
Just a little bit more to go.

150
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:35,597
You put a line in here like this.

151
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:38,598
Then, all that's left to do is to cut along the line.

152
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:41,197
I finished making it!

153
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,298
Make one for me, too.

154
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:49,097
That's a cherry blossom, right?

155
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:50,597
Am I wrong?

156
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,197
It is, but...

157
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:53,498
How did you know?

158
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:57,097
What do you mean how?

159
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,897
Are you making fun of me, or what?

160
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:03,497
Look at the badges on top of the folded clothes by everyone's head.

161
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:05,598
This row is all cherry blossom, right?

162
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:11,197
Besides, the tags of the row below you are all tulips.

163
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,097
But seeing only that,

164
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:15,197
how did you know I was making a cherry blossom?

165
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,697
Because only your clothes didn't have a tag on it.

166
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,597
Besides,

167
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:25,797
you're folding 10 square colored papers to be the same size.

168
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:29,297
And if that's being cut up like this,

169
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:32,798
when you open it up, it'll definitely be the shape of a cherry blossom.

170
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:36,997
That's how I know

171
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:39,097
that you lost your cherry blossom name tag

172
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:42,998
and was making your tag while crying your eyes out like a cry-baby!

173
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:47,197
You're really something!

174
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:48,997
Like some psychic!

175
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:51,797
Stupid. I'm no psychic.

176
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,097
I'm not a cry-baby either!

177
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,597
But you were crying.

178
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:56,698
I wasn't crying.

179
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:58,997
You were crying.

180
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,098
No, I wasn't!

181
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:06,197
Shinichi, there you are!

182
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:10,197
Don't go running off when I'm filing out your admission papers.

183
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:11,598
Mom.

184
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:15,897
What happened to your name tag?

185
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:18,497
You had it on your chest till just a while ago!

186
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,097
I lost it somewhere.

187
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,797
You gotta be kidding?

188
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:24,598
And we went all the way to the autograph event to get it!

189
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,497
Is she a woman spy?

190
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:31,298
That's why I asked her to make me a cherry blossom name tag.

191
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,197
Oh, you're...

192
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,197
Eri's daughter, Ran.

193
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:37,797
Yes.

194
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,397
You're both in the same nursery school.

195
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,097
Mrs. Kudo?

196
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,897
If you can't find the name tag,

197
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:48,997
we'll get one ready for you together with Ran's by next week.

198
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,297
Oh, really?

199
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:53,097
Hey, if you want a cherry blossom,

200
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:55,197
I'll give you this that I made a while ago.

201
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:56,697
Oh, okay.

202
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:58,398
I'll write your name for you, too.

203
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:00,798
What's your name?

204
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:05,398
Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class!

205
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,397
Shinichi...

206
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:11,098
Kudo.

207
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,698
Thanks.

208
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:17,497
Here, all done!

209
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:19,998
"Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class"

210
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:25,298
I'll give you that so promise, okay?

211
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:29,297
I'm not a cry-baby!

212
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,798
Don't ever call me a cry-baby again!

213
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,699
"Don't call me a cry-baby again!"

214
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,099
Isn't that what you shouted?

215
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,899
You were glaring at him too at that time!

216
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,299
Really?

217
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,799
Because we were both in nursery school

218
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,599
and yet he acted so adult and arrogant.

219
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,199
And when I got the notion

220
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,499
that maybe he thought that all the kids other than him were stupid,

221
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,000
I just couldn't help wanting to tell him off.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,699
I was so angry that the tag that mom made for me was broken

223
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,199
so I was crying.

224
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,299
She was crying after all.

225
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,799
And besides, I didn't know the real reason

226
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,499
why Shinichi made me make that cherry blossom, you see.

227
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,599
So, I was so mad.

228
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,199
The real reason?

229
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,300
Right.

230
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
That cherry blossom was really actually...

231
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,299
"Shut them, open them..."

232
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,199
"Clap your hands and shut them..."

233
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,199
-"Open them and clap your hands..." -What're you looking at?

234
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,899
What?

235
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,299
You've been staring for quite some time at her.

236
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
What?

237
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,199
No, I haven't.

238
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,499
Okay, everyone!

239
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,399
Shall we finish singing

240
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,599
and get ready to go for a walk?

241
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
Yes...

242
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,599
You must be stupid.

243
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,199
He's looking at everybody because he's a teacher.

244
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Really?

245
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:07,599
She's right!

246
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,799
Besides, everybody's looking at Mr. Efune, too!

247
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,599
Mr. Efune's really popular

248
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,999
so there are many girls saying that they want to be his bride

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,099
when they grow up.

250
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,399
Really?

251
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,799
Then, do you like him, too?

252
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,899
Why do I have to tell you something like that, Shinichi?

253
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,499
Stupid!

254
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,899
Really?

255
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,999
Sorry.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,199
Maybe he doesn't like me anymore.

257
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Let's forget about him!

258
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:37,199
Besides, all he does is say strange things.

259
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,600
Wait.

260
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,899
Everybody understands, right?

261
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,799
Raise your hands in the air when crossing the crosswalk.

262
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
Yes...

263
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,200
Come on. Shinichi, raise your hand, too!

264
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,000
"Beika Children's Park"

265
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,299
You finished your turn already.

266
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,199
You did, too!

267
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,999
Hey, stop it.

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,799
Hey, now.

269
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,599
Don't fight!

270
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,899
You're friends so you've got to be nice to each other.

271
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Okay?

272
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
-Yes! -Yes!

273
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,699
Ran, would you like to slide?

274
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,599
Yes.

275
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,799
Excuse me.

276
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
Will you let Ran in?

277
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,199
Hey, Shinichi. Come slide, too!

278
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,399
It's fun.

279
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,600
Hey, Shinichi.

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,799
Mr. Efune, come slide, too!

281
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,900
What? I don't think so.

282
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,099
Okay, everybody!

283
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,699
It's afternoon nap time.

284
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,000
Lay your futons out like always in a straight row sideways.

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,299
I'm sorry, Shinichi.

286
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,899
This is Ran's place.

287
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,600
I'm sorry, Shinichi.

288
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,200
Isn't that sort of strange?

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,999
Why is Ran the only one who lays her futon out in the same place?

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,099
Well, that's...

291
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,699
Other than the futon,

292
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,900
there are three more strange things.

293
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,299
When we go for a walk to the park,

294
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,200
how come you always just hold hands with her?

295
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,199
Even at the sliding board at the park,

296
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,199
some kids were waiting in line

297
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,899
but you let her slide first, too.

298
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,099
Besides, that park is farther than the one that we used to go to!

299
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,899
There are two crosswalks and it's more dangerous.

300
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,699
Why did you change the park we go to?

301
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,799
Mr. Efune?

302
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,699
I'll bet you're trying to win her over

303
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,799
so that she'll listen to whatever you tell her to do?

304
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,200
Spit it out!

305
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,299
What's so funny?

306
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,500
Sorry, sorry.

307
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,099
I hold hands with Ran during the walks

308
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,999
because she got lost one time

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,699
and went in a completely opposite direction towards Haido City.

310
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,399
I let Ran get on the sliding board

311
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,299
because she is a kind girl that let's everyone go before her

312
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,699
and end up not being able to slide.

313
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,899
And Ran sleeps here

314
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,899
because it is closest to the bathroom.

315
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,799
When she was sleeping some distance from the bathroom,

316
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,499
there was a time she couldn't make it in time.

317
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,099
What's with you?

318
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,399
You mean you peed in your pants because you couldn't hold it in?

319
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,299
Don't say that in such a loud voice!

320
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,899
I hate you, Shinichi!

321
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,799
Idiot.

322
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,399
Also, I'll tell you why we switched parks

323
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,999
when we go on a walk tomorrow,

324
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,300
Mr. Detective.

325
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,099
"The next day" -Okay, everyone.

326
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,299
Raise your hands when crossing the crosswalk.

327
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100
Yes...

328
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,899
What's the matter, Ran?

329
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,499
You seem depressed.

330
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,099
Is it because he said something cruel to you yesterday?

331
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,599
No.

332
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,199
Mother scolded me last night.

333
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,499
She told me that I shouldn't bully my friends.

334
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,199
I'm not bullying anybody, right?

335
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,299
No.

336
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,700
Rather, you may be the one that's being bullied.

337
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,900
Okay, everyone. Be careful.

338
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,599
Come on, hurry and say it.

339
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,299
Why did you decide to come for a walk to this park?

340
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,199
Because walking farther will help build your strength,

341
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,899
and crossing a lot of crosswalks will help to learn traffic rules.

342
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,299
Besides, the main reason I chose this park is her.

343
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Her?

344
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,299
You see it, don't you?

345
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,599
On the other side of the cherry blossom tree.

346
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,799
The hospital standing next to the park.

347
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,599
The woman that is looking this way from the hospital.

348
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,499
She is actually...

349
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,700
my wife.

350
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,199
What? Your wife?

351
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,599
You mean she's your bride?

352
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Yes.

353
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:49,099
She's not very healthy.

354
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,499
So she's been hospitalized for some time now.

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,999
Next month, she's moving to a hospital

356
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,800
in the mountains where the air is better.

357
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,299
But all the people who are there are elderlies.

358
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,699
And there are no children like you.

359
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,499
That's why I wanted to show her energetic children like you

360
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,999
until it's time for her transferral.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,399
She really loves children, you see.

362
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,499
That's why as a result,

363
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,699
I guess it was out of my own selfishness!

364
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,999
It's okay if you're selfish!

365
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,099
Why don't we all wave to her?

366
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,199
Right!

367
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,299
Let's wave.

368
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,599
No way!

369
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,499
I don't want to listen to somebody who's wearing a weird name tag!

370
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,599
-Right, right! -Right, right!

371
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,399
Because you're not one of us!

372
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,499
-Right, right! -Right, right!

373
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
That's wrong.

374
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Can't you see?

375
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,899
My cherry blossom name tag.

376
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,400
Mine is made of paper just like hers!

377
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,999
Then, you're not one of us, too.

378
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,299
If there are two of us, we're friends, right?

379
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,099
If we're friends,

380
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
then we're not outsiders!

381
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,299
I see.

382
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,999
He was watching.

383
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,599
Since you're wearing that, you're not one of us!

384
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,799
Right, right.

385
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,899
You're not one of us.

386
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,899
He saw me back then.

387
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,099
That's why he...

388
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,400
The actual truth was...

389
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,599
Make one for me, too.

390
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,999
That's a cherry blossom, right?

391
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,099
What happened to your name tag?

392
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,299
I lost it somewhere.

393
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,599
Mine is paper just like hers.

394
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,999
If we're friends,

395
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,300
then we're not outsiders!

396
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,399
And...

397
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,399
I won't ever be beaten by you.

398
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,600
Remember that!

399
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,099
Come on. Shinichi, wave your hand

400
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,199
to Mr. Efune's bride.

401
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,099
Shinichi?

402
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,799
You're calling me by my first name?

403
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,300
You can call me by my first name, too.

404
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,100
Riding on the cherry blossom petal, I found another friend.

405
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,500
A childhood friend that I really like.

406
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,199
"Next Episode" -Something is really strange about him!

407
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,099
Strange? How?

408
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,499
I'm sure he's trying to win her over

409
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,700
so that she'll listen to whatever he tells her to do.

410
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,199
Shinichi, I'll bet you're jealous

411
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,699
because that teacher favors only Ran?

412
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,899
Are you stupid?

413
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,399
It's nothing like that!

414
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,399
Next Conan,

415
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,400
"Memories from Sakura Class (Shinichi Boy)"
