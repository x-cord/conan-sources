1
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:04,746
Muto Masako-san came to the agency to hire the old man

2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:09,826
to find her missing husband Muto Issei, the president of a trading company.

3
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:13,665
After accepting the job,

4
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,256
the old man and I followed the trail of clues and found Muto.

5
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:24,806
Muto was actually the president of a second-hand shop and not a trading company.

6
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:27,906
And?

7
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,046
What are you going to do now?

8
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:35,146
Muto-san.

9
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:39,426
What should I do?

10
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:45,656
I don't know what to do, so I haven't been able to do anything.

11
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:52,046
If you think it's not too late, then shouldn't you go back to her?

12
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:53,246
What?

13
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:57,546
You don't seem like a bad person.

14
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:02,606
Can't you and your wife get along even after all this happened?

15
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:08,376
Besides, I believe that's what she wants.

16
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:13,515
We do have quite a few problems,

17
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:17,625
but we've decided to start over together.

18
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:20,446
I see. That's good.

19
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:25,536
I really have no idea how to thank you.

20
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:29,355
Yes, thank you.

21
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,296
Goodbye.

22
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:06,365
Find the question that solves the mystery!

23
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,385
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

24
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:10,415
What happened to the happy couple?

25
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,845
What is the face hidden behind the mask?

26
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,455
Always determining the one truth

27
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:16,195
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

28
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:18,666
his name is Detective Conan!

29
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:06,876
The Two Faces (Part Two)

30
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,610
What? What did you say?

31
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,990
Muto-san is dead?!

32
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,860
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

33
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,170
Hey, Mister.

34
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,639
What do you think happened?

35
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,969
Didn't they make up?

36
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,710
Yeah.

37
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,470
Then why?

38
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,119
How should I know?

39
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,720
All we can do is head to the crime scene.

40
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,380
Inspector Megure!

41
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,179
The victim is Muto Issei-san.

42
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,620
He was the president of this second-hand shop.

43
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,620
The estimated time of death is between 2 AM and 6 AM this morning.

44
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,429
We won't know the cause of death until after the autopsy,

45
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,640
but the body was burnt to a crisp.

46
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,059
Furthermore, all the teeth were removed,

47
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,640
perhaps to delay the body's identification.

48
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,249
We didn't find any fingerprints on the stun gun

49
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,390
or gas container left at the crime scene.

50
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,210
Inspector!

51
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,270
Mori-kun.

52
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,930
What are you doing here?

53
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,529
I was actually hired by Muto-san's wife.

54
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,269
Hired?

55
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,790
My husband went missing for a few days.

56
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,580
But Mori-san found him last night, and he returned home safely.

57
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,050
But he ended up like that this morning.

58
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,839
Masako-san, does this mean your husband left the house

59
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,199
and came here after talking to you?

60
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,100
Yes.

61
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:04,810
He said he needed to do something for work and left around 1 AM.

62
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,409
We're checking the security camera footage right now.

63
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,710
Hey.

64
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,030
How did you know the victim was your husband?

65
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,679
He looked the same from behind.

66
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,910
More than anything, those were his clothes.

67
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,170
But the culprit tried to conceal his identity, right?

68
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,039
I see.

69
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,920
When you think of it that way, it is odd that they didn't change his clothes.

70
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,959
I can tell. That's my husband.

71
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,349
I'm sure of it.

72
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,930
If his wife says so, then it must be true.

73
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,470
Mori-san, thank for everything you've done so far.

74
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,749
Now that things have ended up like this, I don't know what to say.

75
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,679
You have my sympathies, ma'am.

76
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,400
I'll deposit your pay in your bank account.

77
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,000
Goodbye.

78
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,629
Hey, Mister. Was it really her husband that died?

79
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,530
Huh?

80
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:18,510
If she made a mistake, wouldn't she be really happy to hear that?

81
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,829
You're right!

82
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,339
Thank you, Mori-san.

83
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,939
I'll never forget what you did for me.

84
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,180
Call me Kogoro, ma'am.

85
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,900
Maybe that could happen.

86
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,900
Let's start by questioning the shop employees.

87
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,160
What?

88
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,829
Someone who's been missing since this morning?

89
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,160
Yes. Is there anyone like that?

90
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,050
Well, there is one.

91
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,210
Who is it?

92
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,090
The president.

93
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,639
Why did he have to die?

94
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,510
What's going to happen to this company?

95
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,319
That's not what I meant...

96
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,999
Anyway, I wonder where he went.

97
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,770
Yeah.

98
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,439
He's not the type of guy to take the day off without notice.

99
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,520
Hey, wait.

100
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,530
What's his name and address?

101
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,739
Excuse me. Nonaka-san.

102
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,590
Are you home?

103
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,790
It's not locked.

104
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,920
Nonaka-san.

105
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,459
Nonaka Sadahiko-san.

106
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,950
The employee who's been missing since this morning.

107
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,220
The place is a mess, but it doesn't look like there was a scuffle.

108
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,640
Did he go out without his wallet?

109
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,770
Hey, mister.

110
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,429
What is it?

111
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,900
This is weird.

112
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,109
There's a cup and toothpaste, but I don't see a toothbrush.

113
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,820
I bet I know why.

114
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,100
He probably left the house while brushing his teeth.

115
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,320
Seriously?

116
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,719
It has nothing to do with the case.

117
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,239
Let's go to the next place.

118
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,579
Wait, Mister.

119
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,830
President's Office

120
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,210
Hello.

121
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,640
Well, Inspector?

122
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,390
Judging by the room's state, it looks like he was in a hurry to go somewhere.

123
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,059
I see.

124
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,640
It certainly does look like he was in a hurry.

125
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,390
Inspector Megure, what's this?

126
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,980
Inside this garbage can.

127
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,249
Looks like something was burned.

128
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,459
Documents...

129
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,740
No, it looks like an insurance certificate or something.

130
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,750
Inspector Megure.

131
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,859
There's no security camera footage of the last three days.

132
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,100
It seems to have been deliberately erased.

133
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,879
We also got the DNA results.

134
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,760
And?

135
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,589
The DNA on the provided toothbrush and body were a match.

136
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,520
Then...

137
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,270
The victim really was Muto-san.

138
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,040
Masako-san's testimony...

139
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,779
The DNA and circumstantial evidence...

140
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,590
They all point to Muto Issei-san being the victim.

141
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,699
However, not only were there signs that the culprit

142
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,789
tried to conceal the victim's identity and the security camera footage was erased,

143
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,050
the employee Nonaka-san is also missing.

144
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,639
If that burnt body isn't Muto Issei-san's,

145
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,759
then where is he now?

146
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,060
And what about Nonaka-san?

147
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,320
Huh?

148
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,490
Three utility poles...

149
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,740
Two utility poles...

150
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,909
This is the odd feeling I got when we first came here.

151
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:31,570
When standing inside the fence, only two of the three poles are visible.

152
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,280
In other words...

153
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,520
It must be here.

154
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,470
There's a space behind the fence here.

155
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,660
A secret door, huh?

156
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,339
I see.

157
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,189
Muto-san may have had a kind face,

158
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,080
but he was an incredible liar.

159
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,490
But now everything's finally coming into focus.

160
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,936
Everything was normal until yesterday.

161
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:29,747
I see. Excuse me.

162
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,397
Hello?

163
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:35,397
Ah, Mori-san. What is it?

164
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:39,397
I'd like to confirm a few things with you.

165
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:47,157
First, are you aware of the missing employee Nonaka Sadahiko-san?

166
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,486
Yes.

167
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:53,056
We actually believe he might be involved in Muto's murder.

168
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:54,216
I see.

169
00:12:54,217 --> 00:13:00,816
Then was Masako-san asked to provide a DNA sample of Muto-san?

170
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:01,687
Yes.

171
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:04,927
She gave us the toothbrush he normally used.

172
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:06,706
I see.

173
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:09,566
Did you figure something out?

174
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,807
Takagi, I'd like you to help me with something.

175
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,537
Yes, got it.

176
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,072
I'll make the arrangements. Bye.

177
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,772
Jeez.

178
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:24,582
Where did that brat go?

179
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,602
Huh?

180
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:34,132
Excuse me.

181
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,731
Are you all leaving now?

182
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:38,492
Yes.

183
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:41,242
We've finished examining the area for the most part.

184
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:46,221
We've already finished investigating your home,

185
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:48,852
so you're free to return.

186
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:51,441
Do you think you'll find the culprit?

187
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:54,372
I promise we'll do everything we can.

188
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:57,492
Thank you.

189
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:02,161
We may contact you again for questioning.

190
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:04,492
We appreciate your cooperation.

191
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:08,252
All right. Anytime is fine.

192
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:09,582
Goodbye.

193
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:01,762
We've been waiting for you, Muto Masako-san.

194
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:13,652
What's the meaning of this?

195
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:16,572
Mori-kun.

196
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:18,022
Yes?

197
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:22,742
You gave us instructions because you knew Muto's wife would come here.

198
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,701
What? I did?

199
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:27,342
But I didn't do—

200
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:36,811
Muto Masako-san, allow me to be direct.

201
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:40,882
Where is your husband Muto Issei?

202
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:44,142
You know where he is.

203
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:47,392
I don't know what you're talking about.

204
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:51,642
Muto's body has been sent for autopsy.

205
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:53,542
No, Inspector.

206
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:56,401
That isn't Muto's body.

207
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:58,131
It's not?!

208
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:02,431
But the body and Muto's DNA were a match.

209
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:06,082
Who provided that DNA sample?

210
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,761
His wife provided the toothbrush he normally used.

211
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,412
You're aware an employee here, Nonaka Sadahiko-san,

212
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,521
has been missing since this morning, correct?

213
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:18,422
Yeah.

214
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:22,811
Nonaka-san's toothbrush was missing from his apartment.

215
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:23,802
Hold on.

216
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:27,841
You're saying the body is Nonaka's?

217
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:28,891
Yes.

218
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:35,691
And he was most likely killed by Masako-san's husband Muto Issei.

219
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,102
What?!

220
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:43,682
He was probably a thief who repeatedly used this second-hand shop as a cover.

221
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:48,372
All the items here are stolen goods.

222
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:50,332
Stolen goods?

223
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:56,321
Mori-san is correct.

224
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:58,711
My husband is a thief.

225
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:01,811
After he and I reconciled,

226
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,882
he said he'd take me with him and run.

227
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:12,592
Because I hired Mori-san, I believe he feared his crimes would be exposed.

228
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:17,051
I gathered everything valuable in our home and came here.

229
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:20,402
While I helped him pack,

230
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:24,932
he said we'd flee overseas and wait for things to cool down.

231
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,331
But that's not all! He—

232
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:35,962
He summoned Nonaka-san here and knocked him out with a stun gun.

233
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,462
He disabled Nonaka-san,

234
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:47,302
dressed him in his own clothes,

235
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:51,662
and used gasoline to murder him.

236
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:11,242
You describe it as if you watched it happen.

237
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:16,551
It's just my deduction based on the evidence and circumstances.

238
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:20,411
Furthermore, when you tried to stop him,

239
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:23,752
you got that scrape under your sunglasses.

240
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:33,012
Nothing gets past you.

241
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:43,702
He wasn't a loyal husband or a simple thief.

242
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:47,782
He was a cold-blooded murderer.

243
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:55,282
So I have to settle this myself.

244
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:11,372
You're correct.

245
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:17,312
The toothbrush I provided was brought here by Nonaka-san when Muto summoned him here.

246
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:21,192
Why didn't you tell us the truth?

247
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:26,971
Probably because if Muto was thought to be dead,

248
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:29,692
then nobody would go looking for him.

249
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:34,972
She could decide what to do about him without any interference.

250
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:39,151
Where is Muto-san now?

251
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:41,212
Is he alive?

252
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:44,212
Who knows?

253
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:48,962
Will you tell us where he is?

254
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:52,512
He deserves to be punished.

255
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:53,981
Punished?

256
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,752
For murdering someone?

257
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,522
Or for betraying you?

258
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:05,402
Muto was trying to kill me.

259
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,652
What?!

260
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:10,222
I saw it while I was helping him organize documents.

261
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:15,162
He took out a life insurance policy on me for an exorbitant amount.

262
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:19,551
So the burnt documents were an insurance certificate.

263
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,542
Masako-san!

264
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:24,582
If he's still alive, please tell us where he is immediately!

265
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:28,592
A man like him doesn't deserve to live.

266
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:30,392
Is he around there?

267
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:31,842
Masako-san.

268
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:35,001
I'll ask one more time.

269
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,092
Where is Muto now?

270
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:46,192
Detective Takagi, he's in the trunk of the silver car!

271
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:47,342
Yes, sir!

272
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,242
He's here!

273
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:58,372
He's still breathing!

274
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:10,382
Masako-san, I promise that man will pay for what he did.

275
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:14,612
Was this really for the best?

276
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:18,971
He betrayed me. He ruined my life.

277
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:20,792
He even tried to kill me.

278
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,892
Still, we must stand strong.

279
00:21:27,862 --> 00:21:30,402
You made the right choice.

280
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:04,471
I'm not looking for missing persons for a while.

281
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:09,791
Seems like even you're over couples' quarrels.

282
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,292
Excuse me.

283
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:14,501
This is the Mori Detective Agency, right?

284
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:15,542
Yes.

285
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,922
Great. I'd like you to find my wife.

286
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:23,762
Whoa! She's beautiful!

287
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:25,541
You can count on me.

288
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:32,911
I promise that I, the great Mori Kogoro, will find this beauty—I mean, your wife.

289
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,491
I thought you weren't taking on any missing persons cases.

290
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,521
We're looking for his wife!

291
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:40,862
I'm sure it'll be fine this time!

292
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:43,962
Ma'am, I'm on my way!

293
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,962
Seriously?

294
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,752
It's not much, but...

295
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,162
What's this?

296
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:55,132
He was supposed to be the guest of honor.

297
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,542
It's a shame that this happened.

298
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:03,512
Toda-san, do you have any idea what happened to Kureno-san?

299
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:08,011
I don't wish to speak ill of my friends,

300
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:10,362
but I do have some idea.

301
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:15,452
The next episode of Conan is "The Company Dissolution Party!"
