1
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:05,347
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:07,247
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:08,947
The scene of the crime is filmed on videotape.

4
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:11,147
Conan's deduction rips off the mask.

5
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:12,847
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,647
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,648
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:58,784
Ran and I accompanied Pops on the job

9
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,284
to go see a professional wrestling match.

10
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:04,084
The main event of the day was

11
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:07,684
the title match between junior heavyweight champion, Wolf Face,

12
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:11,684
and the young ace, Hyota Nagase.

13
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:14,884
However, just before the match...

14
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,984
Hey, Nagase! Hey!

15
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:18,084
Hey, Nagase!

16
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:19,885
Hurry up and come out!

17
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:26,684
Mr. Nagase was killed in the waiting room!

18
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:30,185
Coincidentally, the scene of the crime was videotaped.

19
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,385
This is...

20
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:35,785
Wolf Face?

21
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:44,085
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 2)"

22
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:45,684
"Tohto Kokugikan"

23
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:48,784
Is it true that Wrestler Nagase was killed?

24
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,084
Tell us!

25
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,584
What happened with the police announcement?

26
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:55,984
All right then, from the person on the right,

27
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:57,584
please give me your name

28
00:02:57,585 --> 00:03:00,884
and where you were around 7:20 pm.

29
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:02,884
Yeah.

30
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:05,484
"Iwao Ushigome (36)" -I'm Iwao Ushigome.

31
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,084
At around 7:20 pm,

32
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,784
I was watching the match Mr. Kiba was fighting.

33
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:12,684
Because he gets angry if I don't watch his match closely.

34
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,984
Is there anyone else who was watching with you?

35
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:17,384
No, I was alone.

36
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:21,484
Well, someone in the audience may have remembered seeing me,

37
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:25,984
but they were all absorbed in watching the match.

38
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:30,384
Same here, I was watching Mr. Kiba's match alone too.

39
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,284
"Hiroyuki Sakuma (25)" -My name is Hiroyuki Sakuma!

40
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:35,384
But right after Mr. Kiba's match,

41
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:38,384
I came to this room to get Mr. Nagase!

42
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,584
Because his match was right afterwards.

43
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,984
Are you sure?

44
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,184
It's true!

45
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:48,984
I heard this man say, "Nagase, hurry up and come out!"

46
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:53,484
But it's after the time the murder was committed.

47
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:57,484
Then, next, you, the one wearing the wolf mask!

48
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:59,984
I'd like you to remove your mask and talk to us.

49
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:03,184
Inspector, he doesn't speak Japanese.

50
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:05,584
Because Wolf Face is Mexican.

51
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:06,984
And besides,

52
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:09,884
he can't take off his mask in front of women and children.

53
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:11,785
It's fine, Sakuma.

54
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:19,085
"Takaharu Ogami (27)" -They already know who I am.

55
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:24,284
You're the one with the handsome face

56
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,384
but super weak wrestler, Takaharu Ogami?

57
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:28,184
Yes.

58
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,384
No way!

59
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:35,584
I saw you in the Tohto Sports Newspaper this morning too.

60
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:39,284
See! Here's a picture of you and Wolf side by side!

61
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,884
That's...

62
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:43,084
That's Sakuma!

63
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,384
He plays Wolf Face in my place to deceive

64
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,884
all the reporters and fans who come to the gym and the match grounds

65
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:51,584
trying to reveal the identity of Wolf Face!

66
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:53,984
I see...

67
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:56,884
But the mask that you just removed

68
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,584
and the mask in the picture

69
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:00,684
look somewhat slightly different.

70
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,484
That's the mask I use when I eat!

71
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,884
It's made of thinner material with less decorations on it,

72
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,784
and the opening of the mouth part is made larger to make eating easier!

73
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,884
I see.

74
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:12,284
But what a shock to find out that

75
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:15,884
the identity of Wolf Face is Wrestler Ogami.

76
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,185
Is this all right?

77
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,884
Aren't you the one who lost to Wolf Face

78
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:23,984
at Mascara Contra Mascara,

79
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:26,984
and vanished soon after the match, Leonardo Rossi?

80
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,385
"Leonardo Rossi (30)" -Yes!

81
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:31,584
Mascara?

82
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:33,784
Mascara Contra Mascara.

83
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:35,884
It's a match in which you fight to remove your opponent's mask!

84
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,484
The loser takes off his mask!

85
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:40,984
Well, what a surprise.

86
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,384
I thought that you resigned.

87
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,184
I'm more surprised that you know so much

88
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:47,184
about professional wrestling.

89
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:50,984
Leo had his mind set on resigning when he lost to me,

90
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:53,084
but Mr. Kiba convinced him otherwise.

91
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:55,684
And he debuted once again in Japan

92
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:58,084
wearing a Wolf Face mask with a different color.

93
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:02,484
Then, he gathered popularity as Wolf Face's shadow.

94
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:05,384
He was supposed to be the junior heavyweight challenger

95
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:08,684
after Nagase.

96
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:11,884
But who would've foreseen that anything like this would happen.

97
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:16,884
And? Where were you all around 7:20 pm?

98
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,884
Since it was just before I go out to fight the match,

99
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:20,984
I was alone doing warm-up exercises

100
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:23,384
in the waiting room of the foreign wrestlers.

101
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:25,084
All the other foreign wrestlers

102
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,384
had gone to see Mr. Kiba's match.

103
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:31,984
And were you watching Mr. Kiba's match too?

104
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:34,884
Yes.

105
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:38,884
Which means all four of you don't have an alibi.

106
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,684
No, Inspector!

107
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:45,684
This murder couldn't have been committed without Wolf Face's mask!

108
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:46,884
Which means that the killer is

109
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,484
one of the two who had free access

110
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:51,384
in and out of the foreigners' waiting room.

111
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:56,484
No, Wolf Face's masks are kept inside a bag

112
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:59,984
and hidden in the toilet where only authorized personnel have access,

113
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,684
so that we can wear the mask in secret.

114
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:05,584
If not, people will suspect me for being Wolf Face,

115
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:08,684
because they'll see me going in and out of the foreigners' waiting room.

116
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:10,884
I see...

117
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:14,884
Of course we handed the bag over to the forensic officers already.

118
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:16,384
Darn it!

119
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:20,785
Only if the victim left a dying message or something.

120
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:24,584
What's the matter, Ran?

121
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,884
Remember I said a while ago

122
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:29,884
about the professional wrestling skill that is popular in Karate club?

123
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:33,884
The name of the technique resembles Dying Message.

124
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:37,884
Maybe you're talking about Diving Body Attack?

125
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:40,484
The one that Mil Mascaras used to do!

126
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,784
Oh, well.

127
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:45,884
Then, what about Bruiser Brody's Flying Knee Drop

128
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:48,784
or Funk's Spinning Toe Hold?

129
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,784
If I'm not mistaken, it was the technique of a Japanese wrestler.

130
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:54,585
Then it must be Mr. Muto's...

131
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:03,984
Well, putting that aside.

132
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,984
We'll staying here a while longer and continuing investigations,

133
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:11,285
so I need all of you to wait in another room with Officer Takagi.

134
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,085
Please say something!

135
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:20,484
Ran, take that brat with you and go outside too!

136
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:22,384
Okay!

137
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,184
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

138
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,585
No problem.

139
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:28,784
Is it true?

140
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:30,584
Wait!

141
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:33,685
Amazing. Look at the number of reporters here.

142
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:37,984
It's the wrestler that did the bloody match.

143
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,385
Are you all right, Mr. Kayama?

144
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:44,884
You look like a mummy.

145
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:46,784
It's you.

146
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:49,084
It's nothing.

147
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:52,584
By the way, is it true that Nagase was stabbed?

148
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,385
Yeah.

149
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:06,384
Hey, Officer Takagi.

150
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:09,984
I have two things I want to ask you.

151
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:10,985
What is it?

152
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:13,685
You know the mask man...

153
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:17,384
Yeah, that's right!

154
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:20,084
I heard that they're all that way in the beginning.

155
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:22,284
And all masks are more or less that way.

156
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,785
The same goes for Wolf Face's mask!

157
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:28,784
Conan, where are you going?

158
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,485
I forgot something!

159
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:34,584
What do you want?

160
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:37,184
I forgot something.

161
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:40,085
Now, where did I put it...

162
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:50,684
Inspector! We got a report from the forensic officer!

163
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:53,084
Okay!

164
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:56,084
The blood on the mask that was found in the restroom

165
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,384
was determined to be that of the victim's,

166
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:02,884
and the remnants of hair and eyebrows that were found inside of the mask

167
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:07,384
were the same as those found on the other Wolf Face masks,

168
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:10,984
Which means that the mask was worn

169
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,785
only by its original owner, Mr. Ogami.

170
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,584
And what about the victim's nails?

171
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,884
Although a thorough investigation was made,

172
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:22,884
nothing was found.

173
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:24,384
That's strange.

174
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:27,384
If he tried to tear the mask off,

175
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:32,084
the killer's skin or something should've been found left on his nails.

176
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:34,784
Just as I thought.

177
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,584
There's no mistake about it!

178
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:40,785
It's the one who couldn't become a wolf!

179
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,589
At any rate, Inspector!

180
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,089
It is an undeniable fact that inside of the Wolf Face's mask

181
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,889
that the killer was wearing while killing the victim,

182
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,989
only the hair and eyebrows of Wrestler Ogami were found.

183
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,989
We have no choice but to judge him to be the killer!

184
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,789
But even Mr. Ogami knew that

185
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,389
the TV station had set a video camera up in this room

186
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,089
where the murder was committed, right?

187
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,489
Why would he go out of his way to wear his mask and commit the crime,

188
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,989
knowing that it would draw suspicion to himself?

189
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,689
That's probably exactly what he was after.

190
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,489
He probably figured everyone would think so

191
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,190
and used it to his advantage.

192
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,089
Well, I think that if we call Ogami back here again,

193
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,289
he'll confess what he did!

194
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,389
Because he doesn't seem to be such a bad person to begin with.

195
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,889
What is this?

196
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,189
There's something strange about this mask!

197
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,289
See.

198
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,089
Look in the back of the mask that the killer was wearing.

199
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,990
In the back?

200
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,089
The design of the mask is different

201
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,989
from the one that Mr. Ogami was wearing a while ago.

202
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,389
Design?

203
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,189
You're right.

204
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,989
The mask a while ago had more fur at the back.

205
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,289
The mask in this video doesn't.

206
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,689
Then... Do you mean this mask is an imitation?

207
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,789
Probably a replica or something that was sold at stores for fans.

208
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,389
No, I don't think so.

209
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,989
Wrong!

210
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,289
This mask is the one

211
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,489
that was around when Wolf Face made his debut!

212
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,389
Mr. Ogami said that the old masks were also in the bag,

213
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,789
so the killer probably just happened to pick this old mask.

214
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,889
Hey, I thought I told you to keep an eye on the four suspects?

215
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,289
Well, Ran asked me to come check

216
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,089
because Conan didn't come back so...

217
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,389
Which means that the design of the mask

218
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,489
has nothing to do with the murder?

219
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,689
Yes, probably not.

220
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,889
So, he says.

221
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,090
So, that's...

222
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,889
Then what was that for, kid?

223
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,289
You idiot!

224
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,189
All you ever come up with

225
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,489
are ideas that confuse the investigation!

226
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,089
Understand?

227
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,590
I guess you're right.

228
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,789
No, wait.

229
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,889
I see! So that's what it was!

230
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,889
I'm sorry. After you change this room

231
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,789
according to my directions,

232
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,389
can you bring the four suspects in the other room here, please?

233
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,989
Don't tell me that...

234
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,389
So, shall we peel off the mask of the killer wolf

235
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:47,290
that stabbed Mr. Nagase to death in this room, Inspector?

236
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,589
Hey, look!

237
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,989
The four are going in again.

238
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,589
Just a while ago, Kogoro Mouri also went inside too.

239
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,889
Maybe the Sleeping Kogoro's deduction performance is about to begin?

240
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,890
We can't miss this.

241
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,989
Please let us interview you!

242
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,589
You're putting on a deduction performance, aren't you?

243
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,689
Let us in!

244
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,389
Officer Chiba, don't let anybody in!

245
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,690
Conan is still inside!

246
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,989
Just what is it with you officers?

247
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,389
Summoning us like this again.

248
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,689
Don't tell us you've figured out who the killer is?

249
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,589
Yeah, well sort of.

250
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,589
No, not just yet.

251
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,289
Hey! You just said a while ago that...

252
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,489
But, we'll soon find out.

253
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,989
All I need you to do is

254
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,189
to disguise yourself as Wolf like the killer did

255
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,389
and come walking toward me.

256
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,689
First, let's start with Mr. Ogami, who is Wolf Face himself.

257
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,089
Please wear that mask you are holding.

258
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,789
Please do as you are told.

259
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,590
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,590
Please come towards me.

261
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,489
Come a little more.

262
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,590
Closer.

263
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,389
What next?

264
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,389
Okay, that's fine.

265
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,289
Next, Mr. Sakuma!

266
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,489
Please take the mask from Mr. Ogami and do the same thing.

267
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,990
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,389
Inspector.

269
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,789
Do you notice any difference between the two?

270
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,789
No. Not at all.

271
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,989
Let us in!

272
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,790
Wait.

273
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,790
-Okay? -Yes.

274
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,689
Then, the last one, Mr. Ushigome.

275
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,889
Yeah.

276
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,990
I wear this and walk towards you, right?

277
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,689
Mr. Mouri.

278
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,589
I'm sure you have your reasons.

279
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,189
But unless you tell me where and how to look carefully,

280
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,790
I don't have the slightest idea.

281
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,889
Are you okay, mister?

282
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,989
It's me.

283
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,889
It's you, sonny.

284
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,590
I'm fine.

285
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,489
Will this do, Detective?

286
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,089
Yes. I more or less thought it would come out this way,

287
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,989
but now I'm positive.

288
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,689
That Mr. Ushigome...

289
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,290
You're the one who killed Mr. Nagase!

290
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,889
What?

291
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,789
It's the same

292
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,289
as the killer who was in the video.

293
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,689
He kept looking around!

294
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,489
Looking around?

295
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,889
Yes.

296
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,089
You'll find out when you wear it,

297
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,989
but a wrestler's mask has narrower vision than is actually thought to be!

298
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,689
Unless you're used to wearing it,

299
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,989
you tend to look around,

300
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,789
trying to make out the situation of the surroundings

301
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,089
or trip over things that are at your feet

302
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,489
because it is a blind spot.

303
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,989
In other words,

304
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,789
Mr. Ogami who is used to wearing the mask of Wolf Face,

305
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,489
Mr. Rossi who is used to wearing the mask of Nega Wolf

306
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,089
and Mr. Sakuma who usually pitches in for Mr. Ogami.

307
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,089
They have all been ruled out as suspects.

308
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,290
You're the only one who's not used to wearing the mask!

309
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,189
You mean I'm branded killer

310
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,289
just because I looked around and tripped!

311
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,289
The evidence is right there on the videotape!

312
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,989
Remember what Conan said about behind the mask a while ago.

313
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,189
Do you see that extra something?

314
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,589
There are four strings sticking out from behind the mask?

315
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,789
I get it!

316
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,389
The killer was wearing the thin mask

317
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,489
worn when having meals under another mask!

318
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,490
That way,

319
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:21,289
the hair and eyebrows of the killer won't stick to the inside of the mask

320
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,389
that has the blood splatters!

321
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,289
I see.

322
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,589
That's why although the victim tore half the mask off,

323
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,989
no remnants of skin of the killer

324
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,289
were found in the nails of the victim.

325
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,489
Isn't this the mask for meals that you're talking about?

326
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,789
It was sticking out of your pocket when you fell.

327
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,289
Oh, no.

328
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,089
That's the mask I keep in order to scare the young wrestlers

329
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,689
and not the one that the killer was wearing.

330
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,589
It's strange.

331
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,289
Wolf Face's mask is black and white,

332
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,989
but there's a red spot by the right eye.

333
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,589
Oh, I get it!

334
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,589
The right eye part of the mask that you were wearing on top got ripped

335
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,089
so the blood splattered on here!

336
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,789
You brat.

337
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,089
Okay, that's it!

338
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,789
We'll hear you out at the station.

339
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,889
Shut up!

340
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,489
Hey, Mr. Ushigome?

341
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,390
I'm telling you to shut up!

342
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,089
That's right.

343
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,990
I did it.

344
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,289
I killed the betrayer

345
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,989
who wanted to transfer to the Bankoku Pro Wrestling Team!

346
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,589
Cool it, Mr. Ushigome.

347
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,290
That's not all!

348
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,689
I was going to take the mask away from you by framing you up,

349
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,489
a young wrestler with no name, as the killer!

350
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,689
So that I become Wolf Face!

351
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,590
Didn't you hear a strange sound just now?

352
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,589
Right.

353
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,689
As long as I get to wear this mask I can become...

354
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,290
You can never become the Wolf!

355
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,189
You may be able to hide your face with the mask,

356
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,289
but you can't hide your heart that's full of soot and rotten to the gut,

357
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,090
having no respect for professional wrestling.

358
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,389
Excuse me...

359
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,990
Conan?

360
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,589
Kid, what do you know about me?

361
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,090
Stop it!

362
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,689
Shining Wizard?

363
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,789
Right, that's it!

364
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,989
That's the name of the technique!

365
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,289
I'm glad.

366
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,490
I finally remember the name!

367
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,189
And then after that,

368
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,189
the killer, Mr. Ushigome,

369
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,990
was slapped once in the cheek by a speechless Mr. Kiba.

370
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,189
He was then escorted

371
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,290
from the white mat to a dimly lit jail.

372
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,389
But things are going to get rough for you from now on.

373
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,289
The mass media is going to bash you from now on saying things like

374
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,189
you're a murderous professional wrestler and stuff.

375
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,090
I'll be fine.

376
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,889
We, wrestlers, are tough.

377
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,090
We're used to being bashed and hit.

378
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,689
So, I'll see you all then.

379
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,489
I wish you luck.

380
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,789
Yes.

381
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,490
They're the toughest guys around.

382
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,789
It's no problem for them to overcome difficulties like this.

383
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,389
And, so long as Wolf Face keeps on winning,

384
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,490
his identity will stay undercover.

385
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,689
Then you see, Mr. Ogami from the top rope.

386
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,189
Mr. Ogami?

387
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,490
I thought you were talking about Wolf Face?

388
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,889
So you know wolf! Mr. Wolf! (Ogami is Homonym of Wolf)

389
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,589
Because he's a wolf?

390
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,089
Yes...

391
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,389
Wolf Face's identity will probably

392
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,289
never be revealed.

393
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,790
I think.

This is...

396
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,789
Please move away!

397
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,790
Are you all right, Mr. Umetani?

398
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,389
What? The knife fell out!

399
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,390
What's going on?

400
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,689
This is...

401
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,690
The knife poked into the cigar case!

402
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,389
