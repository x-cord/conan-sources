1
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:23,083
The stage today is Teitan High School.

2
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,783
Stories that may also be heard in your school.

3
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:26,683
How many mysterious stories will there be in this episode?

4
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,283
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:29,983
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:31,984
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:38,946
Nightmare.

8
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:42,446
"Mouri Detective Agency."

9
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,046
What?

10
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,246
The ghost scare at school?

11
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:49,546
Right! I feel really eerie

12
00:02:49,547 --> 00:02:52,746
because there's been a lot of ghost scare in school recently.

13
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:55,246
Moreover, they say that people always see that apparition

14
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:57,246
early in the morning.

15
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,646
Rumor has it that 2 years ago,

16
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:01,046
a student who used to come to school early in the morning

17
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,746
died in an accident,

18
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:05,746
and they say it's the curse of that student.

19
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:09,246
2 years ago is before I enrolled.

20
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,446
So please, dad!

21
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:14,446
Come to school at check things out after school today, okay?

22
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,846
To confirm whether it's really the doings of a ghost or not.

23
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:18,846
Let it be.

24
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,346
It's probably just someone playing a prank

25
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,246
or some natural phenomenon.

26
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:25,646
Besides, if that ghost appears at school early in the morning,

27
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:27,846
it doesn't appear during class hours, does it?

28
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:29,147
I guess, but...

29
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,446
As the daughter of renown Detective Kogoro Mouri,

30
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:33,546
I will not let such unreasonable rumor

31
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,246
of something that doesn't even exist run free!

32
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:40,146
You said you were going to be monitor next week, right, Ran?

33
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:41,546
What?

34
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:42,746
Yes.

35
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:45,746
I see. You're afraid of going to school early in the morning,

36
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,246
so you want me to go check?

37
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:50,446
I can't help it because I don't like ghosts.

38
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:53,046
Get rid of it with your karate!

39
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,846
What makes you think that Karate is going to have any effect on ghosts?

40
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,346
Ran.

41
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:59,546
Do you want me to go with you?

42
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:02,747
I may come up with a hint to at least solve the mystery.

43
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:10,047
"Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 1)"

44
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:13,846
Conan!

45
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:15,546
Over here!

46
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,146
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ran.

47
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:19,746
Hey, Ran.

48
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:21,346
Don't tell me that this glasses kid

49
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:23,846
is the help you called for the ghost scare?

50
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,246
But Dad won't come,

51
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:30,846
saying that a renowned detective can't come to check out such a crazy case.

52
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,646
Well, he may not suffice as an aide.

53
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:37,847
but he can at least serve as me, the deduction queen's, assistant.

54
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,546
You're the last person I'd like to hear that comment from.

55
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,646
This is the shoe box area.

56
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,446
It's a little larger than the one in your school, isn't it?

57
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:47,646
Yes.

58
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:51,646
I know. I've been coming to this school for about a year.

59
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:54,446
I'll put your shoes in my shoe slot, Conan.

60
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:56,947
Thank you, Ran.

61
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:01,746
What's with that boy, Ran?

62
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:03,746
Is he the much rumored about Conan?

63
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:05,346
Yes. Cute, isn't he?

64
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,446
Oh, no! It's blabber mouths Tashiro and Hidaka.

65
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:09,646
You can say that again!

66
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:13,346
He looks like a miniature Kudo and sure looks cheeky.

67
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:16,846
Sonny, don't grow up to be a deduction freak, okay?

68
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,246
None of your business.

69
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,146
Why'd you bring him here?

70
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,846
An assistant for investigation.

71
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:25,146
This glasses kid is pretty sharp, you know?

72
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:27,846
Investigation? You mean that ghost scare?

73
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:29,046
No kidding.

74
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:31,446
Aizawa and Nakamichi of the soccer club.

75
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:33,246
Don't bother.

76
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,446
You're going to be cursed.

77
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:37,946
Hey, will you stop saying things like that?

78
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:41,046
By the way, how'd your re-test go?

79
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:42,146
Just made it!

80
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:43,946
Although we were seriously on the brink.

81
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:45,146
True, very true.

82
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:49,046
I'm sure that one day, you'll run out of bad luck, too.

83
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,946
See you then, but take it easy.

84
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:53,646
If you find out who the ghost is, let me in on it.

85
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:56,246
-Okay. -Sure thing!

86
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:58,046
Is something the matter, Conan?

87
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,647
Nope, it's nothing.

88
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:05,746
Right. If things were the way they were supposed to be,

89
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,646
I would be coming to this school, studying,

90
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:10,146
talking of trivial things with my friends,

91
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:13,646
and leading a normal high school life.

92
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,346
Gin and Vodka...

93
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:18,646
If those men in black didn't force me to drink that strange drug,

94
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:20,747
and if I hadn't shrunk...

95
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:25,046
That woman Vermouth...

96
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:27,746
one of them that disguised herself as Dr. Araide,

97
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:30,746
got away from me just as I was about to corner her,

98
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:33,646
in order to get my body back to normal again

99
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:36,146
and regain my life as Shinichi Kudo.

100
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:40,146
That woman is probably an assassin who was sent out

101
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:42,646
to kill Ai who had betrayed the organization.

102
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:43,946
I remember her saying back then,

103
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:46,746
that she would give up on going after Ai.

104
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:49,046
I wonder if I can really believe what she said?

105
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:51,846
After all, she's a witch that has a thousand faces.

106
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:54,846
She's as good as Thief Kid when it comes to disguising herself.

107
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,746
She may still be around us disguised as somebody

108
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,447
and scheming to do something.

109
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,746
What?

110
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:10,846
Dr. Araide.

111
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,146
I heard that since the trial is over,

112
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,946
you returned to your hospital in Aomori.

113
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:19,846
No. I was planning on doing so, but decided against it.

114
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,246
I'm worried about my patients too, so...

115
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:24,646
And it's not that easy saying goodbye to you all either.

116
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:27,246
Then, you're going to remain being our school doctor?

117
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,847
Yes. I came today to tell the school of my intention.

118
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:34,746
The real doctor?

119
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:37,246
Hey! Conan!

120
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,946
Just what do you think you're doing?

121
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:41,046
Are you all right, doctor?

122
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:44,146
Yes, it's nothing.

123
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:47,646
The FBI agent called Jodie told me all about what happened.

124
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:48,647
Huh?

125
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,746
She told me that a bad person disguised as me

126
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:53,246
tried to do something bad.

127
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:55,846
She said she was sent back to the States for a while,

128
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:58,346
but it seems that Hikaru or her grandmother who accompanied her

129
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:00,746
did not take to the States very well.

130
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,946
Then, I heard that the bad person revealed herself and fled.

131
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:07,047
So, Jodie asked to return back here to Beikacho.

132
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,946
But why are you telling me all this?

133
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:14,946
I was told to tell only you because you'd surely be surprised.

134
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:16,246
That's right!

135
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,546
Let's have Dr. Araide help us with the ghost investigation, too.

136
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,746
That sounds great!

137
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:23,147
What? Ghost investigation?

138
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,847
First, let's start here.

139
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:37,547
The wailing storeroom of the gym.

140
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:41,946
One rainy day, a girl student of the gymnastic club

141
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:44,946
who came here early in the morning to prepare for morning practice

142
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:46,947
heard a wailing voice.

143
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:51,446
The wailing leaked out of the storeroom

144
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,346
where nobody was supposed to be.

145
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:57,146
The horrifying sound of someone wailing!

146
00:08:57,147 --> 00:08:58,847
And...

147
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:03,046
The girl student got scared and left,

148
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:06,446
bringing other people of her club back to the place

149
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,747
but the wailing had stopped.

150
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,346
And the only thing left was this desk!

151
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:15,946
It was the desk of a boy student, Hideaki Hosaka,

152
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:19,547
who died mysteriously at this school 2 years ago!

153
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:23,146
Talk about exaggeration.

154
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,447
It so conspicuous that it would scare no one.

155
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:28,346
Hey, Ran.

156
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:31,046
That's no mystery or anything.

157
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:34,546
He unfortunately tripped on the stairs,

158
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:37,146
"Kazumi Tsukamoto (18)" -and hit the wrong place. That's it.

159
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:39,447
Don't go spreading strange rumors.

160
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,446
Kazumi.

161
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:45,446
Mouri, just what are you doing here?

162
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:47,646
The Karate club is off today, isn't it?

163
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:51,046
A senior and the previous captain of the Karate club.

164
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,246
I'm investigating the ghost case.

165
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,646
You mean the wailing case?

166
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:57,846
If it's that everyone's saying that,

167
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,147
-it was probably the trick of the wind. -What?

168
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:06,246
See? That skylight with the broken lock.

169
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,146
It's said the when the wind blows in from there,

170
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:09,646
the sound of the howling of the wind

171
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,647
was taken to be the sound of someone wailing.

172
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,246
It's amazing that you figured out that

173
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,946
this desk was the boy student's desk.

174
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:21,646
I told everyone about it because there was so much fuss over it.

175
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,846
I was his classmate, besides.

176
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:26,947
Is that so?

177
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:32,747
Why is his desk in a place like this, though?

178
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,846
It started to rain.

179
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,446
No way. I don't have an umbrella.

180
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:43,646
Neither do I.

181
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,746
Then, would you like to take shelter from the rain until it stops?

182
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:46,846
What?

183
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,646
At the cursed library.

184
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,646
I was just about to go there myself, too.

185
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,846
-Shall we go there? -Of course.

186
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,547
What's this? A signature?

187
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:03,446
It's starting to rain cats and dogs.

188
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:04,946
I wonder if it's going to stop.

189
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,446
Don't worry. According to the weather forecast,

190
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:09,246
this is supposed to be rain shower.

191
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:12,746
Dr. Araide, you sure are a push-over like always

192
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:16,046
coming along to investigate a ghost scare by request of a student.

193
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,847
Well, yes.

194
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,046
Huh?

195
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,646
Seko.

196
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:27,746
Where were you? I was looking for you.

197
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:29,846
"Kunishige Seko (18)" -I had an upset stomach,

198
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:33,746
so I cut the afternoon class and was resting in the infirmary.

199
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:36,146
-Are you all right? -Yeah.

200
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,446
Did you want anything? Tsukamoto.

201
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:42,247
It's not anything important, so I guess I'll get to it some other time.

202
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:47,346
Well, I guess I'll rest a while more than, before going home.

203
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:51,747
Before that worried teacher decides to lug me off to the hospital.

204
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,447
"Infirmary."

205
00:11:57,047 --> 00:12:01,246
Was he also a classmate of the boy named Hosaka?

206
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:03,346
No, he was in a different class.

207
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,947
But he seems to have been childhood friends with Hosaka.

208
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:10,246
How unusual!

209
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:13,246
That an athletic person like you would be coming to the library.

210
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:16,846
How rude! I read books too, you know?

211
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,446
Besides, I have the entrance exam of university coming up next year.

212
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,546
Besides, just like you two,

213
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:22,547
I'm also investigating the ghost scare.

214
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:26,646
"Library."

215
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,846
When you came this morning, the books were left out on the table?

216
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:30,847
Yes.

217
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:34,646
And all those books were ones that Hosaka had borrowed before.

218
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,546
Moreover, this happened four consecutive days in a row, you know?

219
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:38,547
No matter how you think of it,

220
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,046
this is none other than the curse of Hosaka

221
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,747
who couldn't read the book as much as he wanted to!

222
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:45,346
Hey.

223
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,846
But if the books are not put away,

224
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:50,846
I think that the librarian would notice when locking the library.

225
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,546
It seems that the 4 books were found, one behind the bookshelf,

226
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,946
another under the desk and so on forth.

227
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:58,146
I think it's somebody whose taking advantage

228
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:01,346
of the ghost scare and playing pranks, though.

229
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,846
If I ever catch the brat that's doing this,

230
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,046
I'm going to get him for sure and bust him up.

231
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,346
So, when the time comes, you help me too, okay, Mouri?

232
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:10,846
Okay.

233
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:14,946
Now, finally for these cursed stairs.

234
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:17,646
When a student came to these stairs early in the morning,

235
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:20,546
the bottom of the stairs was soaked with water, right?

236
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:24,746
Yes. It seems that these are the stairs that boy fell from, too.

237
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:28,746
It's probably the cursed tears of the boy named Hosaka!

238
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,546
Maybe the window wasn't closed tight,

239
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:33,646
and it rained the day before.

240
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,046
I mean, we're not kids, you know?

241
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,746
So the windows would've been closed.

242
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,446
Besides, that's not the only thing.

243
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,346
It's rumored that the number of the steps of these stairs

244
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:42,146
are different each time you count them.

245
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,546
Then, why don't both try counting them?

246
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:46,246
What?

247
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:49,347
Okay, we'll show you!

248
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:53,346
One, two...

249
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:56,746
Three, four, five...

250
00:13:56,747 --> 00:14:00,246
Six, seven, eight...

251
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,447
Nine, ten...

252
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:07,146
Ran, how many did you count?

253
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,746
Twelve.

254
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,846
What? I counted thirteen!

255
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,646
No kidding! Why?

256
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,646
The correct answer is twelve steps.

257
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,346
You probably counted one extra step

258
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,646
when you brought both you feet together

259
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,346
and made it all the way up the steps.

260
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:23,646
That's because you keep thinking that this whole thing is scary.

261
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:27,546
Okay. All I gotta do is count it over again, right?

262
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:28,746
Rather, do you really have the intention

263
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:30,947
of solving the mystery about this ghost scare or what?

264
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:33,946
"Masao Monobe (18)" -Hey, you guys!

265
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:35,746
Will you cut out the noise?

266
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:37,646
I can't concentrate on drawing!

267
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,347
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,346
I'm sorry!

269
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,747
Huh? That student...

270
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:47,646
It seems to have stopped raining.

271
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,046
Well, shall we go home for today?

272
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:51,646
I guess so.

273
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,146
After listening to you, Conan,

274
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,246
I'm starting to feel that no such thing exist,

275
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:56,247
and I feel a bit courageous now.

276
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:59,547
Besides, it's getting kind of dark outside, too.

277
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:04,446
What's that?

278
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,847
What?

279
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:15,817
That desk...

280
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,618
It can't be...

281
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,317
the one we just saw, could it?

282
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:21,517
Conan!

283
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:23,118
There's something on top of the desk.

284
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:36,918
My grudge has not yet vanished.

285
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:42,817
Who could've played a prank like this?

286
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,517
The paper's not wet,

287
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:47,617
so it must've been put here after it stopped raining.

288
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:49,417
If so, something's strange.

289
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:50,817
What?

290
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:52,917
The soil is muddy with rain.

291
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:56,417
The thing that's supposed to be here is not here.

292
00:15:56,418 --> 00:16:00,018
The footprints of the one who brought the desk here.

293
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,617
Just as I thought.

294
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,617
The desk and the chair out there are the ones

295
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:09,217
that were in the storeroom of the gym after all!

296
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,117
Yes. There's no doubt that the desk is the one of the student

297
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:16,417
called Hideaki Hosaka that died here at this high school.

298
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:19,117
Then, somebody put it out there to play a prank?

299
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:22,617
Yes. There was a piece of paper on the desk,

300
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:24,617
which wasn't wet,

301
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:28,917
so it was probably put there after the rain stopped.

302
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,417
But, then it's strange.

303
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:34,217
The ground of the campus where it was, was muddy with rain,

304
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:37,417
but the only footprints left were Conan and mine's that got there

305
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:39,417
when we ran over to the desk.

306
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:40,717
It's a ghost!

307
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:44,817
I'm sure the ghost of that student called Hosaka took it there!

308
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:46,517
It's possible.

309
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:48,317
Because ghosts don't have legs.

310
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:50,617
Come on, all of you...

311
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,717
Hey.

312
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:55,717
The desk and chair are gone!

313
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:57,717
No way! How can they?

314
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:01,517
Dr. Araide and I returned them to the storeroom of the gym.

315
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:02,917
What?

316
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:03,918
We didn't want to entertain

317
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,817
the one who did it by making a big fuss over it.

318
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,217
And besides, something strange was written on the paper on top the desk.

319
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:11,517
Strange?

320
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:14,817
It seems to have been written with a brush and was quite sloppy.

321
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,718
My grudge has not yet vanished.

322
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:23,017
Then, why wasn't that paper wet?

323
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:25,817
Because the ghost was writing his grudge filled sentence

324
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:28,017
with his body over the desk in the rain.

325
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:29,917
You guys... I don't see how you can come up

326
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,218
with one idea after the other like that...

327
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:37,818
Is anything the matter?

328
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:45,717
He... he held a grudge against me, after all.

329
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:50,918
This ghost scare is his curse!

330
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:56,118
By chance, do you happen to know this student called Hosaka?

331
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,118
Yeah.

332
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,817
He was a member of the art club with me.

333
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:05,117
But he fell off those stairs back then two years ago.

334
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,517
Back then...

335
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,118
Don't tell me you were there when this happened?

336
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:12,617
Just as I thought.

337
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:15,018
Back then when the accident occurred, this student...

338
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:18,717
-Please leave. -What?

339
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:22,217
The teacher was nice enough to let me use this art room all by myself

340
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:25,917
so that I would be able to complete my piece for the contest.

341
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:27,217
Go on, quickly!

342
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:30,117
I don't want to waste any time!

343
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,518
Okay.

344
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:46,417
Should we let Kazumi know that the desk was out on campus, too?

345
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,818
Okay.

346
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:51,917
Something's shining.

347
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,418
What is it?

348
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:58,217
Wax?

349
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:00,817
What's the matter, Conan?

350
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:04,817
You said that the bottom of the stairs was soaked with water,

351
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:06,517
but was it this floor that was leaking?

352
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:10,817
Right! The entire floor!

353
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:15,417
The tears of the curse of the student named Hosaka that died here.

354
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:17,817
Who found that?

355
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,217
I heard that it was someone from the art club

356
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:21,718
that came here early in the morning.

357
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:26,217
Hey, is that for real?

358
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:30,317
Is it true that Hosaka's desk and chair were out on campus?

359
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:33,017
Yes. And on the desk was a paper that said,

360
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:36,717
"My grudge has not yet vanished."

361
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,317
I'm really pissed!

362
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:40,517
This is going too far as a prank!

363
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:41,617
If you find the one who's doing this,

364
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:44,217
make sure you grab him and bring him here no matter what!

365
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,917
We'll give him a good licking together!

366
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:50,217
I think your spin kick will suffice, though.

367
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:51,817
Hey.

368
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:54,317
Do you know what kind of books were not put away

369
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:58,817
and borrowed by Hosaka before?

370
00:19:58,818 --> 00:19:59,918
Yes.

371
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:05,117
They're all difficult books that you don't see around too often.

372
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:07,117
It's not at all surprising.

373
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:10,117
See! Take a look at this library card!

374
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:12,717
These four books seems to have been borrowed virtually only

375
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,017
by the student called Hosaka.

376
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:16,517
Hosaka wanted to be a comic wirter.

377
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:18,117
He used to always say that in order to write an interesting story,

378
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:19,817
it was useful to keep in mind

379
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,517
all kinds of things that people aren't familiar with.

380
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:24,617
I see.

381
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:27,817
You saw his signature on the edge of the desk, didn't you?

382
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,517
That's the signature he told everyone

383
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:34,017
that he was going to use in the future when he becomes famous.

384
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:35,717
Then, then...

385
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:38,217
His dream was severed part way too,

386
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:41,517
so he must've felt super attachment to it!

387
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:44,117
He wet the bottom of the stairs with his tears of curse.

388
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,317
At midnight, he re-read the books in the library

389
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:47,517
with his heart full of hate.

390
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:51,317
He finally brings his desk that is in the storeroom of the gym out

391
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:54,017
-into the campus grounds... -Hey, hold it, Sonoko!

392
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,517
Ran.

393
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:57,917
Enough with the drama.

394
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,817
Oh, right. If we ask the principal,

395
00:21:00,818 --> 00:21:04,217
he may know something about it.

396
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:08,217
After you left the library, I got up to go to the restroom

397
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:11,417
and saw a glimpse of him through the window on the 3rd floor.

398
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:15,218
Like always, he was standing in place on campus.

399
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:22,417
The principal was thinking of what tree to plant there?

400
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:25,317
Yes. He'd go out there everyday,

401
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,517
trying to decide what to plant.

402
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:30,417
So, the principal is still undecided.

403
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,717
I remember that the principal said that

404
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:36,017
he discussed it with you, too, Dr. Araide.

405
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:37,117
What?

406
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:39,217
Yeah, right. That's right.

407
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:41,717
Well, it's only natural that he wouldn't know about it.

408
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,017
Because Vermouth was the one disguised as Araide

409
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:48,017
as soon as he became the school doctor of Teitan High School.

410
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:50,817
Come to think of it, Vermouth disguised as Dr. Araide

411
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:54,017
was also in charge of Teitan Elementary School.

412
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:56,218
An 18 year-old just like you.

413
00:21:57,018 --> 00:21:59,217
If Ai, who betrayed the organization

414
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,517
is really between the age of 18 and 20,

415
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:05,017
and if their looking for her in one of the high schools here,

416
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:07,617
looking into high schools and universities should suffice.

417
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,017
If they were thinking that.

418
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:12,417
Ai had shrunk and become a child like me to begin with,

419
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:13,617
why couldn't they find her

420
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:17,017
as soon as Dr. Araide became the school doctor?

421
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:21,017
There is nothing like a new student who catches the eye.

422
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:23,617
So, why didn't it?

423
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:26,617
Gosh! It sure bothers me!

424
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:28,217
Thanks to the ghost scare,

425
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:30,318
I've come up with other things that I've got to work on.

426
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:59,017
"Next Episode" -Which means that

427
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:00,717
the person making up the ghost scare is...

428
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:02,817
Still in the school building somewhere!

429
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,617
Will you all wait for me in front of the art room?

430
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:09,117
I've figured out a way to find out who is doing all this.

431
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:12,118
Let's just wait forever very quietly.

432
00:24:13,818 --> 00:24:15,417
Wait for what?

433
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:16,617
What else...

434
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:21,618
but for the ghost of Mr. Hosaka to come dripping wet down the stairs.

435
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:27,618
Next Conan, "Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 2)"

436
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:46,017
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,817
"Umbrella."

438
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:49,217
The wailing storeroom.

439
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:50,317
The library filled with grudge.

440
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,318
The cursed stairs.
