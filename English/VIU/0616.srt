1
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:07,225
Darn it! I lost again?

2
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:09,725
Talk about a bum day...

3
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:13,525
Geez! Just when I'm imagining basking

4
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,625
in a tropical paradise enjoying my fruit parfait!

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,525
Why don't you go read the derby papers

6
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:20,125
back at the detective agency?

7
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,425
The strawberry looks delicious!

8
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:24,625
I'll eat it if you don't want to eat it!

9
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,325
No! I saved it to eat it last!

10
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:31,025
Oh, come on.

11
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:33,525
-I said, no! -Ouch...

12
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:40,225
Yes, this strawberry was what triggered it.

13
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:43,325
I could never have imagined it at this time.

14
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:45,725
That this would be the start of

15
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,525
a bitter sweet serious case.

16
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,525
The moment you decide what you want to do in life,

17
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,825
you must be true to yourself.

18
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,625
Finally a great leap out of Japan.

19
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,825
A serious case occurs in the most adored city of London.

20
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,525
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:02,625
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,825
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:50,017
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Holmes's Disciple)"

24
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:53,595
Oh boy! I was looking forward to eating it!

25
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,295
What's with this cat?

26
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,595
I didn't know cats ate strawberries?

27
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:03,395
I think it's just rolling it around and playing with it.

28
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:08,795
Who does this cat belong to anyway?

29
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:14,695
Why you!

30
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,695
Oh, Peanuts!

31
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,795
Peanuts!

32
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,595
I'm glad you're unhurt!

33
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:25,195
Thank you so much for finding her!

34
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:27,695
It seems like she saying thank you.

35
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,695
My father is a detective.

36
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:32,395
Really? How admirable!

37
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:35,195
I'm fond of crime novels myself!

38
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:38,195
And I love to hear stories,

39
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:41,895
but I've got a flight to catch. Such a shame.

40
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:45,495
I know, may I invite you to my home

41
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:47,095
in London?

42
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,195
-What's she saying? -I wonder.

43
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:53,895
She talks so fast that I couldn't make it out.

44
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:56,195
Wow, that's great!

45
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,395
Oh, you accept?

46
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:00,895
Then when can you visit?

47
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:04,095
We don't have school next weekend!

48
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:09,895
Oh, good. Then, I'll arrange your trip as soon as I return home.

49
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:12,295
He speaks English?

50
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,895
It seems so.

51
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,695
-Okay? -Sure! All right!

52
00:04:16,695 --> 00:04:18,195
Thank you, ma'am!

53
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,795
You're going to England next weekend?

54
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:26,695
Hey, hey. What about school?

55
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:29,995
Well, Teitan Elementary as well as High school

56
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,995
is anniversary day, and since it falls on a Saturday,

57
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,995
we have four consecutive days off from school.

58
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:36,895
Ran and Pops were all for it.

59
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:38,995
Moreover, the owner of the cat,

60
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:43,295
Diana turned out to be super rich!

61
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:44,695
She says that she's going to pay all of our air fare

62
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,895
and hotel charges, too!

63
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:49,095
Well, aren't you lucky though,

64
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:51,495
getting to go to London where you always wanted to go.

65
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:54,995
Yeah, father took me a lot of places abroad,

66
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:58,095
but I've never been to London yet!

67
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:00,995
First, I'd like to go to Baker Street.

68
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,895
Then next to Hyde Park where Holmes

69
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:05,195
and Watson are said to have had walks in!

70
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,495
And then to the Great Britain Museum

71
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:09,895
where Holmes is said to have frequented whenever looking up reference!

72
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:11,195
And if I still have time,

73
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,195
I want to go to Dartmoor that was the stage

74
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:14,695
for "The Hound of Baskervilles"

75
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:17,395
and Reichenbach Falls where Holmes fell from together

76
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:20,895
with his arch enemy Professor Moriarty.

77
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,295
I've got so many places I want to go to

78
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:23,695
that I don't know what to do!

79
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,895
But...

80
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:29,495
what about your passport?

81
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:34,395
I completely forgot about it!

82
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:37,895
Remember, Conan Edogawa is the child image of Shinichi Kudo

83
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:39,995
who was made to drink the drug!

84
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:43,495
He's actually someone that doesn't exist, you know!

85
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:45,495
What makes you think that you can travel abroad so easily

86
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,595
given the situation you're in?

87
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,195
That's true, but...

88
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,095
Hey, Doc!

89
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:54,195
Isn't there anything you can do about it,

90
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,595
like make a fake passport of something!

91
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:59,395
Don't be ridiculous! That's a crime!

92
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:03,395
Darn it! My chance to go to Holmes' sacred land,

93
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,095
but I have to stay and watch house!

94
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:08,095
That's ridiculous. Darn it.

95
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:11,995
There's one way that you could go, though.

96
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:17,995
That is, if you promise to keep to your word with me, though.

97
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:31,695
Wow, first class is so spacious!

98
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:36,195
How rich is that lady, anyway?

99
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,195
Too bad Conan couldn't come with us too, though.

100
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:43,595
Yeah. Something about coming up

101
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:44,995
with an urgent matter all of a sudden.

102
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:47,095
But I guess he'll be coming

103
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,695
with Dr. Agasa on the next flight, either way so...

104
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,895
To go as far as to pay for Doc's air fare too.

105
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:54,195
Diana's really a nice person, isn't she?

106
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:56,495
But she's not paying for the gifts,

107
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:57,995
so don't go splurging!

108
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:59,395
Huh?

109
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,795
You're going to splurge an entire mountain

110
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,595
on that Holmes freak, aren't you?

111
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:08,195
I... I don't intend to buy an entire mountain, so there!

112
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,395
I'll bet he would've wanted to come,

113
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,095
rather than receive gifts or anything, though.

114
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:17,395
Really. It would've been nice if Shinichi could come too.

115
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:27,095
I think the air conditioner is too strong in this plane.

116
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,895
Hey! You've got to keep yourself from standing out now!

117
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:31,895
We don't want Ran folks finding out

118
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,695
that we're on the same plane, you know.

119
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:38,395
No need to worry, they're flying first class!

120
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:39,995
They won't be coming this way.

121
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,195
You're sure lucky thanks to Ai's great idea.

122
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:47,195
Returning your body to Shinichi Kudo

123
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:49,695
temporarily to pass leaving the country.

124
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:53,295
Yeah, I'm grateful.

125
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,595
I'm only giving you two tablets, understand?

126
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:57,895
One for going and the other for coming back!

127
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,395
And they're effective only for 24 hours!

128
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:02,695
Drink the tablet calculating the time backwards

129
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:04,795
to when you finish going through customs in England

130
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:08,795
to when your body returns to what you look like now!

131
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,495
But, are you sure you'll be okay,

132
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,495
with me taking Doc along?

133
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:18,095
Yes. I'll stay over at the Yoshida's.

134
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,995
Sorry.

135
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:21,895
I'm sure you know,

136
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,595
but if you drink it without spacing the time,

137
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:25,495
the effectiveness of the drug will be reduced to half

138
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:29,695
and on top of that, you won't ever be able to come back!

139
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,995
Yes, yes.

140
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:35,195
"Heathrow Airport England"

141
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,395
Conan and Doc aren't coming out.

142
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:47,295
Their plane should've landed long ago and yet...

143
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:49,795
Ran!

144
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,895
Conan?

145
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,695
When did you come out?

146
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:56,795
Just a while ago. You didn't see us?

147
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:59,295
The drug didn't wear off for a while,

148
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:02,895
so I had to stay confined in the restroom for 30 minutes.

149
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,995
Okay, then. Since we still have time

150
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:09,895
before we meet the rich lady at the hotel tonight, so...

151
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:12,895
Why don't we go on a London city tour?

152
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:15,395
Where do you want to go, Conan?

153
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:17,395
Of course I want to go to!

154
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:19,995
"Sherlock Holmes Museum"

155
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,695
Just as would be expected of the Sherlock Holmes Museum!

156
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:29,595
Awesome!

157
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,195
Can I take this seat?

158
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,895
Of course!

159
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,095
All right!

160
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,195
I'll bet Shinichi would be just as excited.

161
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:50,495
He wrote that he didn't want any gifts in his mail.

162
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:53,095
I mean I'm all out to get him something so!

163
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:55,995
Okay. I guess I'll surprise him a bit!

164
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:03,995
It's Shinichi's cell phone.

165
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:05,795
I wonder who it is?

166
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:08,995
Ran?

167
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:16,095
Hello, Shinichi?

168
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,895
Ran.

169
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:20,395
Where do you think I am now?

170
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:23,795
At Baker Street 221-B!

171
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:26,695
Come to think of it, you wrote in your mail

172
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,495
that you'd be going to London.

173
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,695
What? What's with that indifferent reaction of yours?

174
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:34,595
I wish you would envy me a bit.

175
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:37,295
Sorry. I'm busy right now, you see.

176
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:41,795
Would you like me to take pictures of certain places?

177
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:44,795
I'm not sure what places you'd like pictures of...

178
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:47,795
I told you I don't want anything like that, didn't I?

179
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,395
Besides, I'm already here.

180
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:54,895
Bye then! I'm hanging up.

181
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,895
What's with you, Shinichi, you punk!

182
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,595
Dumb-dumb...

183
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,395
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:08,495
Just what're you doing?

185
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:09,995
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:13,095
Oh no. I got her angry.

187
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:22,195
Are you leaving already?

188
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:25,395
Yeah. I've had my fill

189
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:28,195
and the gift shop is in the house next door.

190
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:31,395
Well, if Holmes were really here,

191
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:33,295
I would stick around for days, though.

192
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:38,095
You're lying to me! I know Holmes is here!

193
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:39,995
Let me see him!

194
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:43,395
I'm sorry, but Mr. Holmes is out on an investigation.

195
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:45,495
What kind of investigation?

196
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,395
Well, he is...

197
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:50,495
See? You're lying! Save the trouble.

198
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:54,395
Someone will be killed if we don't do something right away!

199
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:57,995
And nobody can stop it, but Holmes!

200
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:00,795
Oh no, look at the time.

201
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:03,595
My sister's match is about to start!

202
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:05,395
I have to get back!

203
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,495
Can I be of some help?

204
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:09,995
Never mind already, cheapskate!

205
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:14,495
Japanese...

206
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:16,995
You!

207
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:19,295
Can you speak Japanese?

208
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:22,495
Yeah, because I lived in Japan before.

209
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:25,295
If it's okay with you, will you tell me about

210
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:27,495
the crime you were just talking about?

211
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:30,395
Why do I have to tell you about it?

212
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:35,695
That's because I'm Holmes' apprentice, Mr. Grass.

213
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:37,695
Why do you know my name?

214
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:40,195
Do you know me?

215
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:42,195
It's a simple deduction!

216
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:46,295
The white liquid and powder that is around your mouth...

217
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:48,995
It's the whipped cream and powdered sugar

218
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:50,495
that you put on strawberries, right?

219
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,795
You've got lime, cucumber

220
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:54,695
and mint in the container that you're holding,

221
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:57,195
so the content is a drink called Pimm's!

222
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:58,995
Since you're a child, I guess you had them leave out the liquor

223
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:02,495
and had them put only lemonade inside, right?

224
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:05,195
Yeah. I asked the vendor to do that for me.

225
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:10,395
A sport that you would watch holding a Pimm's and strawberries

226
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:13,495
is the Wimbledon tennis match!

227
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,195
Today is the semi-finals for the women's singles!

228
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,895
The first game is from 13:00 and it's after 14:00 now,

229
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:23,195
so your sister's competing in the 2nd match.

230
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:25,295
One of her opponents is Wang Hai-Li,

231
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,595
who parents are Chinese,

232
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:31,895
but you don't look Asian at all.

233
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,295
So, then it's her opponent...

234
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:37,595
the one who's kept winning the Wimbledon for 4 consecutive years,

235
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:41,895
the world's number one, Queen Grass...

236
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:44,895
Minerva Grass is your big sister!

237
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:49,495
Besides, through your chest pocket,

238
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,195
I can see that you have a badge for the Wimbledon VIP Lounge!

239
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:58,695
Wow! You're really Holmes' disciple!

240
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:01,795
So, now will you tell me your story?

241
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:03,095
Yep!

242
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:05,595
I was watching the winners of the match practicing

243
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,795
in court #15 just after noon, while eating strawberries...

244
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:09,695
A man in back of me suddenly asked me...

245
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,995
So, you like tennis?

246
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:19,295
Oh, yes! It's quite thrilling!

247
00:14:19,295 --> 00:14:22,495
Thrilling you say? Lucky you.

248
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,695
Well, you can expect a greater thrill soon.

249
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:28,195
What?

250
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:31,795
A person is about to be murdered,

251
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:34,495
somewhere in London.

252
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,295
Right before your eyes...

253
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:40,295
Did you see his face?

254
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:41,695
Nope.

255
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:43,495
He was wearing his cap way down to his eyes,

256
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:45,395
so I couldn't see what he looked like very well.

257
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:48,395
But he gave me this strange piece of paper.

258
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,995
Tell Scotland Yard

259
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:54,595
that it's my revelation.

260
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:59,995
If it doesn't make sense, go to Holmes.

261
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:04,695
After he said this, he disappeared off somewhere.

262
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,395
This is...

263
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:10,927
You can read English, can't you?

264
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,227
Yeah.

265
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,627
It looks like a poem of some kind,

266
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:17,127
but I still can't make out what this means yet.

267
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:20,027
Hey, there you are!

268
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:22,027
Don't go running off by yourself.

269
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:24,227
I've been looking for you!

270
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,227
Who is he?

271
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:28,127
Big sister's ex-coach, Ares!

272
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,927
He seems to have been a really strong tennis player before!

273
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:33,527
Since he used to be big sis's coach,

274
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:35,527
he gets along with mom too.

275
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:38,827
He takes care of things around the house for us too now!

276
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:41,227
Sis is busy going on tours

277
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:44,627
and mom's eyes are bad, so...

278
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:46,827
Come on, Apollo. Let's get back!

279
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:48,727
She's about to play!

280
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:49,927
But...

281
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,527
Go on!

282
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:54,527
I'll take this to the police.

283
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,627
Besides,

284
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:59,027
if he told you to take this mysterious sentence to the police,

285
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:01,827
it means that he's giving time for people to think it out.

286
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,327
And the possibility of something happening today is very unlikely!

287
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,327
I guess so.

288
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:10,527
I'll give you my cell phone number then,

289
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:12,927
so make sure you call me if you find out about anything!

290
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:15,527
My name is Apollo Grass!

291
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,527
What's yours?

292
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,427
Conan Edogawa.

293
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:20,927
Conan?

294
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:23,327
There couldn't be a more appropriate name for a disciple of Holmes!

295
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:26,327
See you!

296
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,227
Be sure to call me!

297
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:29,627
Okay!

298
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:31,927
Conan!

299
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:34,427
Who are those people?

300
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,527
Is there some sort of trouble?

301
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:38,427
Don't tell me that you're going to get us

302
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:41,827
messed up in something despite being abroad?

303
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:44,327
Well, it's sort of something like that.

304
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:49,527
What? You received a mysterious coded message

305
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:52,027
from a guy who warned of a coming murder?

306
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,327
Are you serious?

307
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:56,527
Yep! According to what the boy Apollo told me!

308
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,927
And, what's written?

309
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:04,527
Uh, the first sentence reads "A rolling bell rises me",

310
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:08,827
so it's "A ringing bell awakes me."

311
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,127
The second sentence says,

312
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:13,827
"I am a wizard with a long nose that lives in a castle."

313
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:15,127
The third sentence says,

314
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:18,927
"I fill myself up with boiled egg as cold as a corpse."

315
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:20,127
The fourth sentence says,

316
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,827
"All I need is to bite on a whole pickle to finish."

317
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:25,027
The fifth sentence reads.

318
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:28,727
"That's right, I'll have to order the cursed cake."

319
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:30,127
The sixth line reads,

320
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:31,627
"the sound of the bell

321
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,127
that rings again stirs up hate in me."

322
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:37,327
And the final seventh line reads...

323
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:40,027
"Finish everything off, stab the white back

324
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:42,627
and pierce through it with two swords."

325
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:46,527
What're those creepy sentences supposed to mean?

326
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:49,527
It seems that the man who forewarned of a coming murder,

327
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,127
said that this is his revelation.

328
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:54,727
A revelation, in other words,

329
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:57,227
something like a plan to commit murder.

330
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,127
Don't bother...

331
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:02,027
It's probably some prank of a guy gone nuts or something!

332
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,827
But I promised Apollo

333
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:08,227
that I would take this over to Scotland Yard!

334
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:11,327
"The Wimbledon Center court"

335
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:27,627
Yes!

336
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:45,227
What? There are many other people

337
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,727
who received the same piece of paper?

338
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,527
Moreover, you say that it was given only to children?

339
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:54,227
Scotland Yard is filled with

340
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:57,927
children with the paper and their parents!

341
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:01,727
A dark complexioned guy wearing a cap with dreadlocks

342
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:04,727
seems to have been passing the paper out at various places

343
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,427
such as the side of the road or parks!

344
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:08,627
While he passed the papers out,

345
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:12,327
he whispered in their ears that someone in London will die.

346
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:14,527
Wait up!

347
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:16,627
Didn't you say that the boy named Apollo

348
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:20,227
was told that somebody would die before his eyes?

349
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,327
Hey, hey.

350
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:25,127
If the guy said the same thing to the other kids...

351
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:26,927
Don't tell me that...

352
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:28,727
Right.

353
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,527
That someone would be dying

354
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,127
in front of the eyes of all those children.

355
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:34,227
In other words,

356
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:39,327
a lot of people may be killed at once, right?

357
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,727
A massacre?

358
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,927
Here in London?

359
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:50,627
Which mean that the killings are going to occur

360
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:52,527
where there is a large crowd of people.

361
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:53,627
Taking into consideration this time of season,

362
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,827
the Wimbledon tennis game could be a likely target.

363
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,827
Right! Because everyone would be

364
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:00,127
in front of their TV sets watching the game!

365
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,527
No.

366
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:03,627
Among many of the children who were given that piece of paper,

367
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:05,527
there were many who were wearing helmets

368
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:06,827
for the bicycle race too,

369
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:08,827
so I don't think it's the Wimbledon!

370
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:10,627
They said that they were glued to the TV set

371
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,927
every day watching the Tour de France.

372
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:17,427
Tour de... what? What's that?

373
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:20,127
It's a bicycle race that's held in France!

374
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:23,427
That race and the Wimbledon

375
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:24,927
are usually aired back to back

376
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,527
so you can't watch both programs at once.

377
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,727
Then, it could be the Great Britain Museum.

378
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:32,927
Or, the Buckingham Palace.

379
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,827
Let's just try going to places

380
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:36,727
that there may be a large crowd of people!

381
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:38,927
We may find something.

382
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:41,227
I'll try deciphering the code together with Doc!

383
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:43,727
-Hey! -Wait!

384
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:47,127
We're having dinner with Diana at the hotel tonight, you know!

385
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:49,527
We'll be back by then!

386
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,627
We could investigate

387
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,727
while trying to solve the code together, can't we?

388
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,227
The best way is to split up

389
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:01,927
and first try to gather as much information as possible!

390
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,327
Because we don't have the slightest idea

391
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,627
where and what the culprit's planning to do at all.

392
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:10,127
Besides, if we solved the code together,

393
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:13,427
I may have given away that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

394
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:15,427
I think that you're already showing much of yourself anyway.

395
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,727
First, for the sentence,

396
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:22,227
"I awake with the ringing of the bell."

397
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:27,327
Maybe this is indicating an alarm clock?

398
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,627
The next sentence,

399
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:32,027
"I am a wizard with a long nose that lives in a castle",

400
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:34,127
is talking about a castle somewhere.

401
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,627
The key word that has something in common

402
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,627
in the 3rd, 4th and 5th sentences is food.

403
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:40,527
Boiled eggs,

404
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:44,327
pickles and cake.

405
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:46,327
And the sixth line that reads,

406
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:49,227
"The bell rings again" is probably referring to a clock again

407
00:21:49,227 --> 00:21:51,427
and the final, "two swords",

408
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:54,827
if this refers to the murder weapon being a knife.

409
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:56,727
If you think of it simply,

410
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,727
something is going to happen in a place

411
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:00,727
where many different types of shops are lined up,

412
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,327
near a castle where there are two clock shops,

413
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:06,927
as well as food stores and cake shops,

414
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,127
including shops where knives and weapons are sold.

415
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,127
Let's buy a map

416
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:13,227
and check if there is such a place in London!

417
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:14,427
Okay.

418
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:19,827
London, the place where Sherlock Holmes,

419
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:21,427
the one I admire existed.

420
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,527
The mysterious revelation that I received from a boy

421
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:26,527
named Apollo who I coincidentally ran into.

422
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,527
I'll decipher the code no matter what

423
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:32,627
and prevent the crime from happening!

424
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:55,127
"Next Episode"

425
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:57,027
Holmes said it too, that

426
00:23:57,027 --> 00:24:00,927
"Your brain works more when you're hungry!"

427
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:04,527
Oh, no! It's the cell phone that Shinichi uses!

428
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,027
Don't tell me that you're here in London?

429
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:09,527
You're here, aren't you?

430
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:10,827
Oh, no!

431
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:13,227
I won't let you get away!

432
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:15,627
You can't get away from me anymore.

433
00:24:15,627 --> 00:24:18,527
Shinichi!

434
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:23,827
Next Conan, "Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Love is 0)"
