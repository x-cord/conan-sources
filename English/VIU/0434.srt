1
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:02,551
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:04,251
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:05,951
Pets are in trend now.

4
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:07,451
They wag their tails to their masters,

5
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,151
but show their fangs to bad people!

6
00:00:09,152 --> 00:00:10,551
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,251
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:14,252
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,362
"Good Work, Coeur."

10
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:32,017
You lose again, Coeur.

11
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,917
Musashi, you've got to learn to let girls win once in a while.

12
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:38,117
They're cute.

13
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:41,417
-They play fetch and everything, too? -Yes.

14
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:44,317
"Eisuke Tsutsumi (35)" -Golden Retrievers and Irish Setters

15
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,617
are originally improved breeds of hunting dogs

16
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,917
that were made to accompany hunters who shoot down birds.

17
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:52,217
"Hiroshi Yanagisawa (34)" -That's why they're good

18
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:54,417
at searching for and retrieving prey.

19
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:58,917
"Manami Yanagisawa (30)" -They usually play in the yard of the Tsutsumi's,

20
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:02,117
but we came since we heard that a dog-run was built in Beika Park.

21
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:04,317
"Misato Tsutsumi (33)" -It's our first time here,

22
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,217
but it's more spacious than we thought it would be.

23
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:09,017
Musashi and Coeur are delighted, too.

24
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:10,417
You're right.

25
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:12,717
It's spacious and feels great.

26
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:17,917
Are you the Tsutsumi couple with the big house in 4-chome?

27
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:19,417
Yes.

28
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:22,117
He's the president of a company that lives in that big house.

29
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,917
We just happened to get to know each other when we met walking the dog.

30
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,017
That was five months ago.

31
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:30,417
Musashi and Coeur are childhood friends.

32
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,617
Is that right?

33
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:35,117
Childhood friends.

34
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:38,917
I wonder where my "Musashi" is wandering around.

35
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,918
Hey, when did I become a dog?

36
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:44,118
Coeur, what are you eating?

37
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,017
She's always doing things like that.

38
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,417
Musashi does, too.

39
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:53,117
He eats grass, leaves, and even soil.

40
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:56,917
When we brushed his teeth some time ago, we found clay on his teeth.

41
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:58,317
Yes.

42
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,517
You mean dogs brush teeth, too?

43
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:02,117
Yes, after every meal.

44
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,118
After every meal?

45
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,417
They're even better than Pops.

46
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:06,818
Coeur! Musashi!

47
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:10,018
Okay, go for another run!

48
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,617
"Musashi (2)"

49
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:19,618
"Coeur (2)"

50
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,617
It was really fun, wasn't it?

51
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:33,717
Next time, we should take dad with us too, right?

52
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:37,217
But Pops prefers horse, doesn't he?

53
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:39,617
That's true. The ones wearing number bibs.

54
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:41,017
Yeah!

55
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:43,717
Hey, be quiet!

56
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,517
We have a guest.

57
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,317
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:48,917
The dog next door.

59
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:50,417
What was its name?

60
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:51,917
"Yoriko Nakatani (41)" -Musashi.

61
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,718
An Irish Setter named Musashi.

62
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:57,617
Musashi?

63
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:02,117
That dog Musashi barks and growls when he sees you?

64
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:05,117
Yes. He is a very big dog.

65
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,817
I can't help being afraid thinking

66
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:10,017
that I may be attacked by him one of these days.

67
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,217
Please help me, Mr. Mouri.

68
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:14,618
I'd like to help you if I could.

69
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:19,317
I moved into the house together with my husband who works in an office

70
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,917
at about the same time that the couple living next door did.

71
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,117
Both houses were originally owned by the same person.

72
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:30,617
The owner's parents used to live in the house that I live in now.

73
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:32,217
The only thing that separates our house with theirs

74
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,718
is a yard with a low hedge.

75
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,017
That's why even when I'm out in the yard,

76
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:39,917
I can't help thinking that Musashi's going to jump over the hedge

77
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:42,617
one of these days and attack me.

78
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:46,317
Then why don't you change that low hedge to a high fence?

79
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:48,117
I'd like to!

80
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:51,117
But my husband says he likes it the way it is now.

81
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:54,517
Even my mother-in-law who doesn't live with us says so.

82
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:57,817
Musashi is the dog owned by the Tsutsumi couple, right?

83
00:05:57,818 --> 00:05:59,617
What? Do you know him?

84
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,217
Yes, just a bit.

85
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:04,217
It's true that Musashi is a big dog,

86
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:05,417
but he's very friendly

87
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:09,417
and I don't think he would ever bark or growl at people for no reason

88
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:11,517
much less, attack people.

89
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:15,717
Maybe you did something to Musashi that he didn't want you to do?

90
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:17,817
I didn't do anything!

91
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,217
How rude.

92
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:21,717
Never mind. I won't ask for your help anymore!

93
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:23,617
If anything ever happens to me,

94
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:26,217
Mr. Mouri, it's all your fault!

95
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,918
Huh? Well...

96
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,117
Look at what you did.

97
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,617
I'm sorry,

98
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:36,217
but Musashi would never do something like that, right?

99
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:38,117
Yeah.

100
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:42,118
But a little while afterwards, something terrible happens.

101
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:46,717
Are you all right?

102
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:49,217
Yes. I'll go inside the house.

103
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:50,218
Yeah.

104
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:54,418
What was that?

105
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:58,617
Dear, it's Musashi!

106
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,618
Yeah.

107
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:04,318
Stay away! Stay away!

108
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:12,617
Dear, it's the woman next door!

109
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:13,917
Musashi! Stop it, Musashi!

110
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,217
Are you all right, Mrs. Nakatani?

111
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:17,218
My mother-in-law...

112
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,318
My mother-in-law...

113
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:28,718
It can't be...

114
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:37,817
Dear!

115
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:38,818
Yeah.

116
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,018
This is Mouri.

117
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:52,917
What did you just say? Musashi did?

118
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:54,017
Okay.

119
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:55,817
Yes, right away.

120
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:58,217
What about Musashi, dad?

121
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:01,017
He seems to have attacked Mrs. Nakatani's mother-in-law

122
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:02,817
and killed her.

123
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:03,818
What?

124
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:09,217
All done.

125
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:13,217
How many days will it take until I'll be able to walk?

126
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,417
Well...

127
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:15,917
Since you sprained in pretty badly,

128
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:17,617
I think it'll take at least four or five days.

129
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:19,017
Four or five days...

130
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:20,217
Take care.

131
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:21,218
Thank you.

132
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:25,117
Okay, please give me the details.

133
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:26,917
Yes. Yesterday at sundown,

134
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,617
my mother-in-law came over while my husband was out.

135
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:32,017
When I served my mother-in-law coffee,

136
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:34,717
I mistakenly spilled the coffee on her clothes,

137
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:37,817
so I had her wear my cardigan.

138
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,817
After that, I remembered that I hadn't taken in the laundry yet,

139
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:43,318
so I went to get them.

140
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:48,217
But I was careless and ended up

141
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:51,717
dropping one of my husband's shirts in the yard next door.

142
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:54,617
Unfortunately, the people next door seemed to be out.

143
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,917
Even if I wanted to go get it myself,

144
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,017
I was afraid of Musashi that I couldn't go.

145
00:08:58,018 --> 00:09:01,617
Then my mother-in-law offered to go pick it up for me.

146
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:04,517
I stopped her saying that it's dangerous,

147
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:08,818
but she said she'd be fine because she knew him since he was a puppy.

148
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:15,717
Musashi,

149
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:17,218
you're such a good boy.

150
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:22,318
Mother!

151
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:29,318
Mother!

152
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:44,817
Stay away! Stay away!

153
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:48,417
Just then, Tsutsumi came to my rescue.

154
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:49,617
Yes.

155
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:52,617
We were supposed to come home late tonight because of a party,

156
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:55,017
but my wife didn't feel too well,

157
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:57,118
so we ended up coming home earlier than expected.

158
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,917
But thanks to that, I've been saved.

159
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,417
May I ask you something?

160
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:06,917
Why do you have that cane?

161
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:09,817
This is a spare cane that I bought for my mother-in-law

162
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,917
who always uses a cane.

163
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,517
What about those firecrackers?

164
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:17,117
I usually have them on me just in case Musashi attacks.

165
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:20,517
I heard that dogs don't like the sound of firecrackers.

166
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,618
I'll take those.

167
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:26,517
Inspector, my mother-in-law was wearing my cardigan

168
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:28,518
and was mistakenly attacked in my place!

169
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:34,917
That's why I went to seek help from you back then!

170
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:37,218
But even so...

171
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:42,717
Kinue was attacked here.

172
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:44,717
Yoriko fell

173
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,018
just about there.

174
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:50,817
Blood.

175
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,917
Yoriko wasn't hurt to the point where she was bleeding.

176
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:57,618
Which means that this is Kinue's blood?

177
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:01,818
But why in a place like this?

178
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:10,477
The results of the autopsy

179
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:15,777
shows that Mrs. Kinue Nakatani died of shock from excessive bleeding.

180
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:17,577
She died of shock.

181
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,177
The teeth marks found on her throat matched those of Musashi, too.

182
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:24,477
Musashi's saliva was also detected from the wound.

183
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:27,977
Why did Musashi attack Kinue?

184
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,277
He mistook her for Yoriko

185
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:33,777
because Kinue was wearing Yoriko's cardigan.

186
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,077
She said so yesterday, didn't she?

187
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,377
The dog's sense of smell, although it depends of what kind,

188
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:42,077
is said to be a billion times keener than that of humans.

189
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:44,377
So to tell the smell of Yoriko from the cardigan is...

190
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:47,677
If so, he would've also smelled Kinue, right?

191
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:51,077
If his sense of smell is so keen.

192
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,477
Right.

193
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,877
He may have been confused by the smell,

194
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:57,077
but it's unthinkable to think

195
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:59,577
that he would completely mistake Kinue for Yoriko.

196
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:04,777
Besides, why did Musashi suddenly bite at Kinue's throat?

197
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,978
He would usually most likely bite the hands or the feet, right?

198
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,577
And the blood is strange, too.

199
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:12,777
The blood?

200
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:14,877
There were a few drops of blood

201
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:18,677
from where Yoriko was on the ground towards the hedge.

202
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:22,577
The forensic officers have verified that the blood was Kinue's.

203
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:26,277
It's most likely that when Yoriko tried to carry Kinue up,

204
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,677
blood dripped on her hand

205
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:30,277
and when she shook the cane with her blood stained hand, it splattered.

206
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,278
But then, isn't it weird that none of that blood came off near Musashi?

207
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,477
Now that he mentioned it, that's true.

208
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,677
It's just all child talk of this brat.

209
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,677
Don't let him confuse you.

210
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,177
Hey, aren't there other points that concern you?

211
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:46,377
Yeah, right.

212
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:49,277
First of all, we've found out that Yoriko and Kinue

213
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,477
are usually on bad terms with each other.

214
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:56,177
The one who testified is Yoriko's sister-in-law.

215
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:58,477
She explained that the reason for this is despite being 40 years old,

216
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,377
Yoriko's husband is still very dependent on his mother.

217
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:03,177
It seems that the shirt Yoriko dropped

218
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,677
was something that Kinue had bought for him.

219
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,477
So that's why Kinue went to get it herself.

220
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:12,477
Secondly, we found out that Kinue had a weak heart.

221
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:13,877
Her heart was weak?

222
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:18,377
Thirdly, the Tsutsumi couple living next door told us

223
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:21,877
that when they first moved here, Yoriko was very nice and friendly,

224
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:22,977
they can't remember when,

225
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:26,177
but she stopped talking to them even if she saw them.

226
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:30,077
Musashi himself used to like Yoriko at the start.

227
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,077
But from some time ago,

228
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,377
he began barking whenever he sensed Yoriko's presence.

229
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:38,877
By the way, it seems that Yoriko used to be an art teacher

230
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,777
at a junior high school.

231
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:44,177
The couple has no children.

232
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:46,277
But no matter how we look at it,

233
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,077
the circumstances point at Musashi having done it.

234
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,277
No way!

235
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,677
Conan, it isn't Musashi, is it?

236
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,977
Speaking of dogs attacking people,

237
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:57,378
remember John's case some time ago?

238
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:02,877
Listen, it's from your master.

239
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:06,777
The owner of the dog form a combination of certain words,

240
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,078
trained his dog to attack people.

241
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,577
However, in this case,

242
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:19,477
it's hard to believe that the Tsutsumi couple or Yoriko,

243
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:23,077
trained Musashi to attack people.

244
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:25,977
I got it! I've figured it out, Inspector Megure!

245
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:29,177
This is a thoroughly planned case of homicide!

246
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,677
Homicide?

247
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:33,677
The murderer is none other than Yoriko Nakatani.

248
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:36,677
She must've been looking for an opportunity to kill her mother-in-law

249
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:39,277
since she had been on bad terms with all this time.

250
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,777
Moreover, she hated the Tsutsumi couple as well as their pet dog, Musashi.

251
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:45,277
The couple, too?

252
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:46,577
The reason is most likely envy,

253
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:50,577
even though the couple is much younger than her and her husband,

254
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:54,477
they'd succeeded in business, have a spacious yard and a large house.

255
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,277
I see.

256
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,577
So she thought up a way to kill Kinue.

257
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:06,677
First, she buys the same kind of cane that Kinue usually uses.

258
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,777
And while the Tsutsumi couple are out,

259
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:11,377
she probably poked Musashi through the hedge or something

260
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,677
and implanted enmity for her within him.

261
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:19,278
And when she did so, she also popped firecrackers and scared him.

262
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,577
Last night, after making sure that the Tsutsumi couple were out,

263
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:29,077
she called her mother-in-law, deliberately spilled coffee on her,

264
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:32,577
as an excuse to make Kinue wear the cardigan that had her smell on.

265
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:37,177
And for some reason, she decides to take in the laundry at night,

266
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:40,177
drops her husband's favourite shirt

267
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:43,178
and make it so that Kinue goes out to get it.

268
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:49,077
Musashi realizes that Kinue had entered his territory

269
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:52,677
and sees the cane that he hates.

270
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:56,277
On top of that, he smells someone that he hates,

271
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,177
so he must've growled threatening them not to come any closer.

272
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:03,278
Then Yoriko came up from behind.

273
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:17,377
Yoriko took advantage of the sense of sight, smell and sound of the dog

274
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:20,977
to commit a cleverly schemed and daring crime.

275
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:23,477
Kinue who had a weak heart, could've had a heart attack,

276
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:28,377
just by being frightened at Musashi attacking her.

277
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:31,877
But Musashi bit her in the throat,

278
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:35,677
causing excessive bleeding causing death by shock.

279
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:38,977
It turned out better than you expected.

280
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:41,677
Is it true, Yoriko?

281
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:43,978
Famed detective, my foot.

282
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:48,077
I hope you have proof for saying all you did.

283
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,477
I will show you proof now.

284
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:54,777
But before that, could you please lend me the clothes you're wearing now?

285
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:55,978
That cane, too.

286
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:07,877
Listen.

287
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:10,077
Pull the leash and stop Musashi

288
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,577
the instant Officer Sato pops the firecracker

289
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,477
and when he's about to pounce onto her.

290
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:16,977
Yes, sir. I understand.

291
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:19,777
Officer Takagi, I'll leave it to you.

292
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:22,778
Officer Sato, even if I have to risk my own life, I will.

293
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,877
If Musashi gets excited at the sound of the firecracker,

294
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:30,677
then he's the one that did it.

295
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:31,878
Or it could be that...

296
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:37,278
Okay! Let him go!

297
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,277
Okay, come.

298
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:58,977
Good boy, good boy.

299
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,177
It can't be!

300
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,278
See? It's just as I said, isn't it?

301
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,177
I see.

302
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:12,077
I heard about the case on the news and was worried.

303
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:14,177
Is Musashi still at the police station?

304
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:17,777
Yes. Kinue trespassed on private property,

305
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:22,277
so I don't think the Tsutsumi couple or Musashi will be held responsible.

306
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:27,477
I'll have to gather more info to get to the truth.

307
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:31,077
Why don't we go to the Tsutsumi's residence from now?

308
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:32,778
Okay. Sounds good.

309
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:39,977
Huh? You're going to move?

310
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:41,177
Yeah.

311
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:43,177
Although we won't be punished by law,

312
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:47,077
the fact that Musashi attacked Kinue and killed her will not disappear.

313
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:49,177
We can't live here anymore.

314
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,478
Is that so?

315
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:54,577
What did you find this time?

316
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:55,977
What's this?

317
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:56,978
That's...

318
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:58,977
Musashi's toothbrush.

319
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:00,877
Toothbrush?

320
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:05,377
When we brushed his teeth some time ago, we found clay on his teeth.

321
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,977
By the way, it seems that Yoriko used to be an art teacher

322
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:10,977
at a junior high school.

323
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:11,978
Don't tell me that...

324
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,778
Clay. If so...

325
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:46,677
Our deduction that you lured Musashi into attacking Kinue was wrong.

326
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:48,777
Musashi didn't do anything.

327
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:52,077
You're the one who killed Kinue.

328
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:55,278
Just what do you mean by "I'm the one", Inspector Megure?

329
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:04,377
You made Musashi bite clay and took the mold of his teeth

330
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:06,677
and made a mold of his teeth using plaster.

331
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:10,577
You used the experience you had when you used to be an art teacher.

332
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:14,077
That night, you pushed Kinue who went out to the yard next door

333
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:17,178
to pick up the shirt that you deliberately dropped.

334
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:22,977
Musashi was severely agitated by the violence he'd witnessed

335
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,777
and began to bark loudly.

336
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:27,877
You made Musashi pull away using the firecrackers

337
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:30,577
and meant to go back into the house during that time,

338
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:33,377
but you sprained your ankle.

339
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:38,577
After that, you told the Tsutsumi couple that Kinue was attacked.

340
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:40,177
And while the Tsutsumi couple

341
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:43,077
were distracted with their attention on Kinue,

342
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:46,378
you threw the mold of Musashi's teeth towards the yard of your house.

343
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:53,777
This teeth mold made of plaster solved everything.

344
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:56,177
Conan is the one who found it.

345
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:57,277
That's not true.

346
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:59,577
Coeur's the one who found it.

347
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:03,177
Musashi's saliva was on Kinue's wound

348
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,077
because dogs have a habit of licking themselves and others of their pack

349
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:07,777
in order to heal the wound, right?

350
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:11,377
She took advantage of this.

351
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:14,178
Do you have anything to say to it?

352
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:17,277
That woman...

353
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,177
She used to look next door and always sigh and say each time she came here,

354
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:24,477
that one should choose a bride carefully.

355
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:25,478
Just because of something like that?

356
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:27,077
Yes, just something like that!

357
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,977
Since you forever clung to your mother despite your age,

358
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:32,877
you would probably never understand!

359
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:35,977
If only I didn't sprain my leg...

360
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:38,077
Your leg will heal in time!

361
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:39,677
But before that,

362
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:42,478
I think you have something that you should fix, isn't there?

363
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:19,877
Hey, I've been wondering from before.

364
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:23,177
The name Coeur doesn't sound too feminine.

365
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:25,677
Could it be that it's not English?

366
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:28,577
Yes. It's Coeur in French.

367
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:30,377
I had no idea.

368
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:34,077
It means "heart" in French.

369
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:35,477
Heart.

370
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:40,577
I'm sure she had the heart of wanting to save her childhood friend.

371
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:42,877
I wonder if my Musashi feels that way about me?

372
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:45,977
I'm sure he does.

373
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:48,177
Nope, he doesn't.

374
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:52,478
Because when there's a case, his heart's nowhere near here.

375
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:56,177
You've got me there.

376
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,778
Conan, did you say something?

377
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,477
"Next Episode" -If the killer came into the room and battered him to death,

378
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:05,177
the killer is most likely an acquaintance.

379
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:07,378
No. There's no need to call an ambulance.

380
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:10,277
Hey, Ms. Kobayashi.

381
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:14,278
You told Mr. Sugimori that we're going to be interviewed, right?

382
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:18,377
The voices of the four suspects.

383
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:21,377
That person must've loved animals.

384
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,078
This could be...

385
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:29,278
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 1)"

386
00:24:44,978 --> 00:24:47,777
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,577
"Hay fever."

388
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:51,477
Officer Sato, do you have hay fever?

389
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:52,478
Yes.

390
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,678
Then, so do I.
