1
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:06,377
We've safeguarded the plan double and triple fold.

2
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:08,177
All preparations for making it look like an accident

3
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:10,977
have been completed.

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:15,477
I've prepared the poison quite some time ago already.

5
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:20,677
Let's confirm if he has red blood flowing through him too.

6
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:23,877
Fortunately, the museum will be closed next Sunday.

7
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:27,977
None of the staff beside us will show up.

8
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:29,377
Great.

9
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:32,077
The sooner the better.

10
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:34,677
That reminds me, Mr. Seikanji.

11
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:38,977
The deadline for repaying the loan is closing in, isn't it?

12
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:40,377
What...

13
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:41,677
Look who's talking.

14
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:43,977
I heard that you embezzled money, and it was exposed,

15
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,477
so you're going to be fired at the end of this month.

16
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:49,077
I don't want to be told that by a manager

17
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,677
who fell for junk stocks and incurred a huge loss.

18
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,977
So, I'm the only one

19
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:58,377
that doesn't have to rush to finish things off.

20
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,177
Is that so?

21
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:03,677
As his ex-girlfriend, I'll bet you're worried about

22
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:07,277
when your inheritance deed will go down the drain.

23
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:12,577
Come now, there's no use arguing now.

24
00:01:12,577 --> 00:01:17,077
We've got only one common purpose to pursue.

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,777
That is, to murder Jisaburo Izumi.

26
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:25,177
That's why we're gathered here, aren't we?

27
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:29,177
So, I'd like to confirm with you one more time, Moyono.

28
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:32,577
In case we succeed in murdering Jisaburo,

29
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:35,977
we split half the inheritance that is due to you

30
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:38,077
among us three.

31
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:41,877
The one who actually succeeds in killing him gets 80%,

32
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:44,077
and the remaining two gets 10% each

33
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:46,977
to keep their mouths shut.

34
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:50,677
I kind of feel like I'm the only one who's losing out.

35
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,577
But, I guess it can't be helped.

36
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:55,577
Because if I do it alone and fail,

37
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:57,677
everything'll go to pieces.

38
00:01:57,677 --> 00:01:59,977
If all three of us pitch in, the odds of succeeding

39
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:02,477
would be greater.

40
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:08,277
Okay. Then, we'll launch the plan next Sunday.

41
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:22,977
Aim for a 100% solution.

42
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,077
Clear all mysteries and codes.

43
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:26,977
A dangerous conversation at the Noh Mask Museum.

44
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,377
The secret of the threesome hiding behind the mask.

45
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:30,977
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:32,777
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,577
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,710
"The Ogre Dances in the Noh Mask Mansion (Part 1)"

49
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,810
Huh? It seems to be closed today.

50
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,210
Oh, yeah.

51
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,610
Never mind, this is an emergency.

52
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,410
Yes?

53
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,910
I would like to see the director!

54
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,610
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,510
We're closed today so Director Izumi resting today.

56
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,010
Excuse me. I'm Naruya Akaza.

57
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,110
I have an appointment with Mr. Izumi.

58
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,010
Oh, Ms. Moyono Mibu?

59
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,410
Long time no see.

60
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,810
I'll open the front door right now.

61
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,410
I can't let you in.

62
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,210
Like I just told you a while ago,

63
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,410
it's our day off today.

64
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,410
No, please don't bother.

65
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,410
I came to see the director because of an emergency.

66
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,610
The director?

67
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,010
An emergency?

68
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,010
The fact is, I received this letter, you see.

69
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,510
That Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.

70
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,210
Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.

71
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,210
The culprit will soon be carrying out his plan.

72
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,910
I'd like you to take on this case, renown Detective Kogoro Mouri.

73
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,910
The name of the sender isn't written.

74
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,210
What shall we do, Dad?

75
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,110
That man called Izumi is rich, isn't he?

76
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,410
If you prevent the crime from happening, Pops...

77
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,810
Okay! Let's go, Ran!

78
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,710
If I don't go after receiving a letter like that,

79
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,610
I'd be hurting my reputation!

80
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,010
I tell you, and you don't even know for sure

81
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,510
if the letter is authentic or not.

82
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,610
All I really wanted to do is to go see the Noh masks!

83
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,310
So, you see,

84
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,310
I decided to stick my nose in and offer my services.

85
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,210
And, you are?

86
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,610
Oh, pardon me. Here's my business card.

87
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,610
Oh! So, you're that famed detective, the Sleeping Kogoro!

88
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,310
Well, I guess that's what people call me.

89
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,110
I'm a long time acquaintance of Director Izumi.

90
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,210
But to think you'd bring your children along

91
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,210
when investigating a forewarning of murder.

92
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,110
No, this kid is interested in seeing Noh masks.

93
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,310
I see.

94
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,910
Your daughter has refined taste.

95
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,810
Huh? Oh, thank you.

96
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,310
I wonder where the word got out from?

97
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,210
To think that the famed detective would come all the way here.

98
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,710
I guess it'll be better to postpone our plan.

99
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,210
Where's the director?

100
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,510
It's just about time for him to go to worship the "Household God".

101
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,210
That's why Akaza's taking them there.

102
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,210
We can't postpone the plan already.

103
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,910
Huh?

104
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,310
Don't tell me you set a trap up there?

105
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,210
This is bad.

106
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,210
What's a household god?

107
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,710
In houses from the days of old, there is a tradition

108
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,610
of worshipping ancestors on the northwest side of the premises.

109
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,910
Is Mr. Izumi a religious character?

110
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,610
Well, there are many who resent him, you see.

111
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,510
So he certainly has a good reason to pray.

112
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,410
Oh, there he is.

113
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,810
Good morning, Director Izumi!

114
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,210
Mr. Akaza, eh?

115
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,810
You're right on time.

116
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,810
"Izumi Jisaburo (65), Noh Mask Museum Owner"

117
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,110
"Toba Hatsuho (28), Jisaburo's Assigned Nurse"

118
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,610
And? Who are you people?

119
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:45,310
I'm used to blackmail. So, leave me alone.

120
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,110
Somebody took the trouble to send it over to my place, you know!

121
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,910
It's hard to believe that this is a mere threat letter.

122
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,210
Take cover!

123
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,810
Quick, behind there!

124
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,510
If these children weren't here,

125
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,710
I would've been crushed under the lumber.

126
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,310
Hurry and get me a spare wheelchair!

127
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,510
Yes, right away, sir!

128
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,610
Not you.

129
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,110
Hurry it up, will you?

130
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,410
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

131
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,410
Darn! That old fart devil has the devil's luck.

132
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,310
You can't trust anybody these days.

133
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:29,510
But I'll trust you sonny because you saved me.

134
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,210
And, you too, young lady.

135
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,110
Sir, you never know what'll happen in the world today.

136
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,210
Being on guard is top priority.

137
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,710
Yep, that's for sure.

138
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,010
And? What do I have to be on guard about?

139
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,010
For example, what're those things decorated there?

140
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,710
"Ju" and "Odoshi".

141
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,210
"Ju" is a belt like shaped braided rope used for decoration.

142
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,810
"Odoshi" is part of the armor.

143
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,310
Then, they're both strong, aren't they?

144
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,510
What're you getting at?

145
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,910
Huh? A bee?

146
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,110
It's big.

147
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,610
I'm going to be killed!

148
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,410
No need to get so overly excited.

149
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,510
That's not it. It's a hornet.

150
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,110
Director Izumi's been stung once before.

151
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,110
Bad! He may die of allergic shock!

152
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,310
There's another one?

153
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,210
Why, you! How about this? And this?

154
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,110
Hey, that's my jacket...

155
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,910
What do you think, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro,

156
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,210
of my prized collections?

157
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,210
Well, they're all fantastic masks.

158
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,310
Do you think it matches me too?

159
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,010
In order to create a quiet Noh atmosphere,

160
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,910
the staff as a general rule, wear Noh masks.

161
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,910
This is called the "Kuwaemen".

162
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,910
You can wear this mask just by biting on this

163
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,910
and holding it in your mouth.

164
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,510
You can't talk when wearing it, though.

165
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,210
That's why the director says

166
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,210
you can maintain a quiet Noh atmosphere.

167
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,210
The maker of the mask was a man

168
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,110
called Kodo Matsumoto, my best friend.

169
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,110
He repeated marrying and remarrying several times.

170
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,310
And, I eventually ended up taking care of him until he passed away.

171
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,610
The director has an eye for good artists.

172
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,210
In return for that, he entrusted

173
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,810
the exhibition of his posthumous works to me.

174
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,710
The accident that occurred, and the hornet that came flying.

175
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,010
The content of the letter was authentic, wasn't it?

176
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,610
This museum was a mansion that originally

177
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,810
belonged to my grandfather, you see.

178
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,010
The only thing that is left even now

179
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,610
is this Japanese hearth that is in the center of this mansion.

180
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,710
This called "Yokoza",

181
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,510
the place where the head of the household sits.

182
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,710
Sonny, do you know?

183
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,410
Huh? Know what?

184
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,510
It's uncooked.

185
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,210
That in the reflection of the light of the fire

186
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,110
from the Japanese Hearth, the entire family enjoy chatting.

187
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,310
Then, see!

188
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,910
In the light of the fire the mask looks white, right?

189
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,810
The word 'omoshiroi', meaning 'interesting',

190
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,110
evolved from that.

191
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,910
Oh, that's interesting.

192
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,310
Originally there was a grid called Hidana (rack)

193
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,810
in which a pot hanger was hooked onto.

194
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,710
But, since it's not of much use now, it's stored.

195
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,210
That wooden fish attachment

196
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,110
was thought to be a magical object that prevented fires.

197
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:11,036
Darn! Not again!

198
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:20,336
Darn that chestnut, for exploding at a time like that!

199
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:23,536
We all goofed together, didn't we?

200
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:26,236
Darn! Let's start from scratch!

201
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,336
Oh, so this is what we're having for lunch?

202
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,836
As a token of my appreciation for you having saved my life,

203
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:38,336
I catered all this.

204
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,336
Thank you so very much. Here goes...

205
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:43,436
It wasn't meant for you.

206
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:46,236
The ones who saved me are the children!

207
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:51,936
This is just a little gift for you.

208
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,136
It's washed-rind cheese from Bourgogne.

209
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,236
You just got back from France, didn't you?

210
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:00,836
I guess I'll open wine too, then.

211
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,136
Wow, it looks so delicious.

212
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:14,136
It's so smelly that it's known as "God's stink feet".

213
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:18,136
But, when you eat it, it tastes like rich milk.

214
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:22,136
It's good manners to just scoop it with a spoon this way.

215
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:24,936
Chief, Manager, all of you,

216
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,436
come and get a taste of the gift too.

217
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:28,336
No, thank you, not for us.

218
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:31,636
Or are you confessing to being the culprit

219
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:34,236
behind those three pranks?

220
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:36,236
No way.

221
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,336
Then, we will do as you wish.

222
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,436
Yes, come, come.

223
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:42,736
Choose to sit wherever you like.

224
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,336
If you eat it together with us,

225
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:46,736
you couldn't possibly poison it, could you?

226
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,436
Hatsuho, will you act as a taster?

227
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:50,536
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:02,536
It's delicious!

229
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:05,736
I'm sure it is.

230
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,436
What do you think, Mr. Akaza,

231
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:10,136
which wine would go better with it?

232
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,236
I've got to taste it first to know.

233
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:15,436
Then, go on and take a bite too.

234
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:17,636
Thank you.

235
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:27,636
Yes, it has a deep taste to it...

236
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:48,736
This smells obviously of poison.

237
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:50,636
It can't be.

238
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,436
Who and when was it laced with poison?

239
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:59,536
Everybody, don't move.

240
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,636
Chief, where are you headed?

241
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,636
I'm going to call the police.

242
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:10,136
I'll take care of that, so you all stay here.

243
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:11,636
-Ran! -Yes.

244
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:15,736
Don't touch the cheese.

245
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,136
Dad, no good.

246
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:21,036
This area seems to be out of service range.

247
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:23,336
The phone is in the kitchen over there.

248
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:25,236
I'll go make the call.

249
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:27,136
Then, will you call Inspector Megure of MPD

250
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:29,136
and tell him that you're calling for Kogoro Mouri.

251
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,136
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,736
Hello, is this the police?

253
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:36,436
One of our customers died an unnatural death.

254
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,436
Please rush over here.

255
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:41,936
Even if the police cars were to speed over here,

256
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,736
it would take them at least 20 minutes.

257
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:47,936
Do I have to stay sticky like this until then?

258
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,436
I guess you wouldn't want to be.

259
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,836
Was your name Ms. Toba?

260
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:53,236
Yes.

261
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:55,136
Can you just wipe the place around Mr. Izumi

262
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:56,736
and leave the rest as is?

263
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:58,036
All right.

264
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,536
They say they'll be right over.

265
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:02,236
Moyono Mibu...

266
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:05,336
She couldn't have put the poison in.

267
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:08,636
Chief Seikanji, Manager Nagata.

268
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:11,636
Those two didn't go near the cheese either.

269
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:15,136
Ms. Toba was the taster, so at the time she tasted it,

270
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,936
there probably wasn't any poison in the cheese.

271
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:19,636
If so, was it after that?

272
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:23,236
No, nobody had time to do something like that.

273
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:27,336
If so, maybe the poison wasn't in the cheese,

274
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:30,736
but rather, on the butter knife?

275
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,436
Miss, where was this butter knife?

276
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:38,536
Huh? On each guest's plate.

277
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:41,736
And without knowing who would sit where,

278
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:44,736
it would be impossible to target someone specifically.

279
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,136
Hey, kid, we're moving to different place!

280
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,436
This is much safer.

281
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:01,536
Don't you agree, Mr. Mouri?

282
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:04,536
Very true.

283
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:08,136
Please bear with me until the police get here.

284
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:09,836
Huh? Ran.

285
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,536
Where's the brat?

286
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:14,436
Huh? I thought he was just there.

287
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,936
I'll go get some coffee to serve Mr. Izumi.

288
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:19,236
I'll go look for the boy while I'm at it.

289
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:21,436
Oh, thanks so much.

290
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:27,336
Something about the call she made to the police a while ago

291
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:29,636
was strange.

292
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,936
This is an extension phone!

293
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:35,936
Sonny.

294
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:38,636
Are you there?

295
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,736
Sonny?

296
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,536
Sonny?

297
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,136
That woman...

298
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:52,636
That's?

299
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:01,236
Mouse! There's a mouse!

300
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,836
Did you spill the coffee?

301
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:07,336
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:12,236
Mr. Izumi's asking if his coffee's ready yet.

303
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:14,036
Oh, right away!

304
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:15,736
I'll help you!

305
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,236
No, thanks!

306
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,936
I guess you had no time to put in the poison this time.

307
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,336
Which means that Mr. Akaza

308
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:31,336
had a reason for being murdered?

309
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:34,136
He used to enthusiastically flatter me,

310
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:36,836
but it seems he was doing evil business.

311
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,636
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

312
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:43,036
I'm not ready to die like Akaza.

313
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:45,636
Please don't joke like that.

314
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:47,236
Don't worry.

315
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:50,436
There's nobody who'll want to poison anyone to death

316
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:52,836
when the police is on their way.

317
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,936
Well, that's true too.

318
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:03,136
Hey, Conan, that's an extension phone for sure.

319
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:06,936
I tell you! That father of mine

320
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,636
believes that the police'll be here any minute soon.

321
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,936
At any rate, let's go look for a phone.

322
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,236
Yep! I found it, Conan.

323
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:20,836
What seems to be the matter, Miss?

324
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:24,736
I've got to call the police right away.

325
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:28,036
Huh? I'm sure that Ms. Mibu made the call already.

326
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,536
She was just acting it out.

327
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,036
Ran, run away!

328
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:41,436
Don't you move either, Miss.

329
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:50,536
So I said, aren't you gonna drink the whole thing?

330
00:21:57,736 --> 00:21:58,836
I'll bet it never dawned on you that

331
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:00,636
all three of us were accomplices.

332
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:04,036
You stay put right there until we finish off the director.

333
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:06,636
So, you mean that person called Nagata is also one of them?

334
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:07,836
Darn!

335
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:11,736
Director Izumi s life's in danger!

336
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:41,436
They sure are late, aren't they?

337
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:42,836
The inspector and his men.

338
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:45,636
I'll go check the front door.

339
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:47,036
So, it's you.

340
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:50,436
And, we almost made it, but too bad.

341
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:58,136
Dad, hang in there!

342
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:01,536
Next Conan,

343
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,136
