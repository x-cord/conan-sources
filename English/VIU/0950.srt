1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:04,272
Nichiuri TV and Radio Production Unit Producer,

2
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:08,072
Teruomi Manda, is a superficial man

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:10,072
who's been living off his glibness alone.

4
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:13,572
And Mr. Manda secretly murdered his estranged wife, Towako,

5
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:16,672
because she wouldn't agree to a divorce.

6
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:21,572
Furthermore, he used the radio show that he produces

7
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:27,072
to frame Towako's upstairs neighbor, Mrs. Kumi Kijima.

8
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:31,872
However, he couldn't deceive the eyes of the police.

9
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:34,572
Isn't this a premeditated murder?

10
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:36,572
Could Mr. Manda really have come up with this

11
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:39,072
if he's all talk?

12
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:43,172
He was just that desperate to divorce his wife.

13
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:45,472
Hey, Ms. Yashiro.

14
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:49,972
Those two seem to really hate Mr. Manda.

15
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:54,472
-What? -Are you saying one of them did it

16
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:57,072
and is trying to frame Mr. Manda?

17
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:00,073
I just thought it might be a possibility.

18
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:10,473
"Even if the boy suspects something, it's too late."

19
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:14,473
"Everything has gone according to plan."

20
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:17,372
You underestimate me.

21
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:20,573
I'll definitely expose the truth.

22
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,272
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

23
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:26,272
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

24
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:28,372
A strange case takes place at a radio station!

25
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:30,272
The grinning culprit stands above the law!

26
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:31,672
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:33,372
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:35,673
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:22,763
"The Radio Questions and Concerns Show (Solution Arc)"

30
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:27,469
"Nichiuri TV."

31
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:40,873
You still think they did it?

32
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:44,973
They really seemed to hate Mr. Manda.

33
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,773
"Ninosuke Inuyama (38)" -I know all about you, Mr. Manda.

34
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:50,673
You're secretly scheming to prevent me

35
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:54,373
from becoming independent.

36
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:56,773
"Mamoru Kujirai (35)" -You don't love radio!

37
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,673
You never have.

38
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:02,273
You only think of your programs as tools to make yourself rich.

39
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:04,873
You misappropriate them for your personal use!

40
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,373
I suppose.

41
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:09,273
It's clear that they found him disagreeable.

42
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:12,273
But remember what Ms. Kaede Yashiro said?

43
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:16,273
"Kaede Yashiro (32)" -It's true that they don't get along with Mr. Manda,

44
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,573
but I can't believe they'd kill his wife

45
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:21,073
just to get at him.

46
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,573
Yeah, but...

47
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,673
Hurry up and eat your food.

48
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,474
Then we're leaving.

49
00:04:29,774 --> 00:04:32,973
Hey, wasn't that Yoko Okino?

50
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:35,773
What? Yoko's here?

51
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,474
Where?

52
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:39,673
This way? That way?

53
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:40,774
What?

54
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,074
Miss!

55
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:51,473
"Rie Abe (24)" -It's true that Mr. Manda

56
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:54,873
was trying to prevent Mr. Inuyama from becoming independent.

57
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:58,173
But I doubt he'd be able to stop Mr. Inuyama

58
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,273
if he really wanted to quit working for the station.

59
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:01,373
Right?

60
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:05,674
Mr. Kujirai didn't get along with Mr. Manda either, right?

61
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,473
Mr. Kujirai's such a serious person.

62
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:12,873
He'd never get along with the slick Mr. Manda.

63
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:16,173
Honestly, he was disgusted with him.

64
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:20,673
That incompetent fool shouldn't be working in radio.

65
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:22,173
Incompetent?

66
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:24,673
It's apparently about a drama Mr. Manda put on

67
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,373
while he was a director.

68
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:30,574
But it's an old story so I don't know much about it.

69
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:32,973
Oh, I remember now.

70
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:34,073
Huh?

71
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:38,873
I think that old drama was Ms. Yashiro's debut work.

72
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:40,174
What?

73
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,073
You can read it in this reception area.

74
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:47,673
-I'll be right over there. -Thank you.

75
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:48,773
"He Disappeared Without Saying Goodbye."

76
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:51,273
This single drama made Ms. Yashiro think

77
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:54,273
she owed Mr. Manda everything

78
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:58,673
while also making Mr. Kujirai think he was incompetent.

79
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:00,873
How can that be?

80
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:02,073
She's not here either.

81
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:04,673
Where are you, Yoko Okino?

82
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:07,674
Yoko Okino! Where are you?

83
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:10,873
Isn't this...

84
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:13,374
"Radio drama" "He Disappeared Without Saying Goodbye."

85
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,273
Miss.

86
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,573
What is it?

87
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:21,973
Pops said he'd like to hear a recording of this drama.

88
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:25,674
Sure. I'll submit a request to the records department.

89
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:28,674
Yoko!

90
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:38,573
So that's how it is. Anyway...

91
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:39,973
"Cast - Towako Adachi as Kiko Isaka."

92
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:43,673
This name, Towako Adachi...

93
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:46,573
No, that's not possible.

94
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:49,474
They wouldn't have said that.

95
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:53,274
"Producer - Yoshitaka Kamio."

96
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:57,573
I see. So that's how it is.

97
00:06:57,574 --> 00:07:00,773
No, that's all I need to know.

98
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:02,074
Goodbye.

99
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,673
Which means...

100
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:07,973
Oh, so that's why?

101
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,073
That's why he drank

102
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:12,173
even though he was about to go on the air.

103
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:16,173
And someone said during the post show meeting

104
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:19,773
that they wished Mr. Manda's wife's upstairs neighbor

105
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,073
could've heard the show, right?

106
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,173
Yes.

107
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:26,173
Do you know who said that?

108
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,674
I think it was...

109
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,373
I knew it.

110
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:35,973
They used the concern that was submitted by coincidence

111
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:37,373
in their plan.

112
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,674
Where are you?

113
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:43,274
Why can't I find you, Yoko?

114
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:46,173
Coincidence?

115
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,673
It can't be coincidence that such a convenient concern was submitted.

116
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:56,273
The listener, TM, isn't the victim, Towako Manda.

117
00:07:56,274 --> 00:08:00,474
It's someone completely different named Tsugumi Mourikawa.

118
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,673
Could it be?

119
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:05,373
Hello?

120
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:08,473
Yes, I'm Tsugumi Mourikawa.

121
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:11,973
"Tsugumi Mourikawa (32), Housewife" -What? The famous detective?

122
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:16,173
What does the famous Kogoro Mouri want with me?

123
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:18,373
Thank you.

124
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:22,373
Once I get the results of the investigation I requested.

125
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:25,473
"Nichuri TV" -You darn brat!

126
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:26,773
Take a look.

127
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:30,873
Yoko couldn't possibly be here.

128
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:33,073
She's in Hawaii?

129
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,174
We're leaving.

130
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:37,373
I need to use the bathroom first.

131
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:38,973
Hey, wait!

132
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:40,874
That darn brat.

133
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,873
Hello?

134
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,173
Ah, Inspector.

135
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,573
What?

136
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:49,673
I see.

137
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:54,373
I'm actually still at Nichiuri TV.

138
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:56,273
What?

139
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,474
But why?

140
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:01,473
Hello...

141
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,773
Hello, Inspector?

142
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,273
I feel better now.

143
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:06,473
Should we go?

144
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:07,673
We can't leave.

145
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:08,873
What?

146
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,973
I don't know why but the Inspector told me

147
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:13,173
to wait because he was on his way.

148
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:17,273
And he told me to gather all the staff again.

149
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:18,674
I wonder why.

150
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:25,273
What do the police want now?

151
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,173
The situation's become complicated

152
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,674
since they found out the victim was Mr. Manda's wife, right?

153
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:34,073
Inspector.

154
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,473
What is it, Mouri?

155
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:39,973
I heard you asked my officers

156
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:42,273
to bring Mr. Manda here.

157
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:45,874
What? You told me to wait...

158
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,273
Told me to wait for you here...

159
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:53,173
Is this the rumored Sleeping Kogoro?

160
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:54,573
Inspector,

161
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,873
about the case of Towako Manda's murder

162
00:09:56,874 --> 00:10:02,273
by her husband and suspect Teruomi Manda.

163
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:04,573
The plot lurking behind it

164
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:07,773
most likely began a month ago.

165
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:13,174
When Mr. Manda was brought here as the new producer.

166
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,170
When Mr. Manda was assigned

167
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,170
to be the new producer of the show,

168
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,870
Mr. Inuyama,

169
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:33,970
he told you about his wife then, correct?

170
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:36,270
Yes, well...

171
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,770
At the welcoming party,

172
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,570
we were socially obligated to throw.

173
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,270
Gosh.

174
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:47,070
I wish my awful wife would just disappear.

175
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:49,370
I met her the other day about the divorce,

176
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:52,570
and she wouldn't stop complaining.

177
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,370
Something about her obnoxious upstairs neighbor

178
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:56,970
at her apartment.

179
00:10:56,971 --> 00:11:00,571
That's not my problem, you know?

180
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:02,970
Right?

181
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,170
When they heard that,

182
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:08,770
the culprit came up with their plan.

183
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,370
They'd murder Mr. Manda's wife

184
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,070
and frame him for it.

185
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,970
Isn't that right, Ms. Kaede Yashiro?

186
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,071
What?

187
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,970
Why would I frame Mr. Manda

188
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:27,770
when I owe him everything?

189
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,370
Mr. Mouri!

190
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,671
You were right.

191
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:35,870
When we showed this photo you sent us

192
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:39,470
to the residents of Towako Manda's apartment building,

193
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:42,670
several of them remembered you.

194
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:45,870
They said half a month ago, you were asking around

195
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,870
about Towako Manda's upstairs neighbor, Mrs. Kumi Kijima.

196
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,170
They said they told you that.

197
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:55,470
Mrs. Kijima goes bar-hopping every Friday night.

198
00:11:55,471 --> 00:12:00,070
That's why you decided to do it on a Friday, isn't it?

199
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,770
Just because I asked about Mrs. Kijima,

200
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:06,470
that doesn't make me the culprit.

201
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:10,570
There's also the radio show submission.

202
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:13,771
You forged that, didn't you?

203
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:16,171
What?

204
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:24,070
I checked in with your friend, Tsugumi Mourikawa.

205
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:29,570
I heard from Ms. Yashiro that she asked you to do it.

206
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:32,270
What?

207
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:35,170
Oh, Kaede admitted it herself?

208
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,871
She made me promise not to tell anyone.

209
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:44,070
We don't get enough interesting submissions.

210
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:47,970
I can write the submission myself,

211
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:49,070
but if it's chosen,

212
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,470
the station calls the listener.

213
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,170
So you want me to pretend I wrote it.

214
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:57,470
Sure. You can count on me.

215
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,870
Thanks.

216
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:02,070
You asked Tsugumi Mourikawa

217
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:04,170
because her initials are TM.

218
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:07,470
The same as Towako Manda's.

219
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:12,670
It was necessary to involve Mrs. Kumi Kijima.

220
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,570
Using Mrs. Mourikawa's name,

221
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:17,070
you wrote a fictitious submission

222
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:19,170
that would make Mrs. Kumi Kijima

223
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:22,270
believe it was Towako Manda.

224
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,270
Nothing will happen

225
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,570
if this doesn't get picked up first.

226
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:30,670
I hope they decide to use it.

227
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:33,970
Once the submission arrived at the station,

228
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:37,270
you selected it for Friday's show.

229
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:40,070
As the show organizer,

230
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:42,270
it was your responsibility

231
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,370
to select submissions for the show.

232
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:46,470
Yesterday, on the day of your crime,

233
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:49,470
you gave a plausible excuse to make me drink.

234
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:51,570
They said Mr. Mouri performs better

235
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:54,770
when he's had a drink or two.

236
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:55,870
You got me drunk.

237
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,770
"Mr. Mouri, you're the best!" -and worked up.

238
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:01,070
After inciting me to make rude comments during the show,

239
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:03,670
during the post show meeting...

240
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:08,670
I wish the woman living above Mr. Manda's wife

241
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:11,070
listened to todays show too.

242
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:14,170
That's when I realized something interesting might happen.

243
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,171
You've gotta strike when the iron's hot.

244
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:21,570
You incited Mrs. Kumi Kijima

245
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:25,370
to fight with Towako Manda.

246
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:27,770
They don't even know they're being manipulated.

247
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:30,470
It's all going exactly according to plan.

248
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:33,271
And after all that scheming, you...

249
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:36,370
What do you want?

250
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,871
It's the middle of the night.

251
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:51,270
But, Mouri,

252
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:54,770
even if she plotted to frame Mr. Manda

253
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,570
for his wife's murder,

254
00:14:56,571 --> 00:15:00,870
why did she need to involve Mrs. Kumi Kijima?

255
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:02,970
Because even though he has a motive,

256
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:06,570
not having an alibi wasn't a compelling enough reason

257
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,270
to suspect him.

258
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:13,870
Inciting Mrs. Kijima to attack his wife

259
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:18,170
guaranteed suspicion would fall on Mr. Manda.

260
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:22,870
Naturally, Mrs. Kijima would be suspected for a while,

261
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:25,270
but her alibi would be verified

262
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:29,270
since she spent her Fridays bar-hopping.

263
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:33,070
But the police were struggling to verify her alibi.

264
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:35,970
That's when you asked me.

265
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:38,370
Mr. Mouri, I have a request.

266
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:42,770
Please prove Mrs. Kumi Kijima's innocence.

267
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:46,570
You wanted suspicion to be shifted

268
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:50,171
from Mrs. Kijima to Mr. Manda was quickly as possible.

269
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:55,070
You had me come on as a guest,

270
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:57,070
in case the police took too long

271
00:15:57,071 --> 00:16:00,970
to verify Mrs. Kijima's alibi, didn't you?

272
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:04,170
So everything was calculated?

273
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,870
But I didn't need to do anything.

274
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:09,570
Mrs. Kijima's alibi was verified.

275
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:12,670
And we suspected Mr. Manda.

276
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,870
Just like Ms. Yashiro wanted.

277
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:21,170
However, Conan suspected Mr. Inuyama and Mr. Kujirai,

278
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:25,370
so you hastily denied that possibility.

279
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:27,370
That's not possible.

280
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:32,470
It's true that they don't get along with Mr. Manda, but...

281
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:37,470
Because you were desperate to frame Mr. Manda.

282
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:42,470
Everything you're saying is just speculation.

283
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:45,370
I doubt you've noticed,

284
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,471
but you keep repeating a certain action.

285
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:54,270
When suspicion fell on Mr. Manda because of the CD.

286
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,670
Inspector Megure.

287
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:57,470
How did it go, Takagi?

288
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:59,971
Yes, sir. About that...

289
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,770
When we learned Mrs. Kijima was innocent.

290
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:10,570
When Mr. Manda was the only suspect.

291
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:15,070
And when Mr. Manda was taken away.

292
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:18,071
You touched the band-aid on the back of your neck.

293
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,871
Every time things went according to plan.

294
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:26,370
You must've been unconsciously worried

295
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:30,470
about the mark left there by your crime.

296
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,770
That's it.

297
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,970
The sample sent for DNA testing.

298
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,170
Left under the victim's fingernails...

299
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:37,770
The blood.

300
00:17:37,771 --> 00:17:40,470
In her final struggle,

301
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:43,570
Towako Manda scratched the back of her killer's neck.

302
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,671
Am I wrong, Ms. Yashiro?

303
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:53,670
I thought I'd won.

304
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:56,771
I never stood a chance against the great detective.

305
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:02,670
Ms. Yashiro.

306
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:06,270
But why?

307
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,770
I thought you owed me everything.

308
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:11,070
It was hate, wasn't it?

309
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,171
For Mr. Manda and Mrs. Towako.

310
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:16,670
Hate?

311
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:17,671
Over what?

312
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:19,971
When I asked about it...

313
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:24,270
She was a rising artist?

314
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,770
It seems that way.

315
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:29,370
But your answer was strange.

316
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:31,870
Conan, the script.

317
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:33,171
Okay!

318
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:39,870
Mr. Manda's wife's maiden name was Towako Adachi.

319
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,370
Seven years ago,

320
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,370
"Cast - Towako Adachi as Kiko Isaka" -she played the leading role

321
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:46,570
in your debut work.

322
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:49,470
But you tried to hide that,

323
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,871
which means it must have something to do with the crux of this case.

324
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:56,870
"He Disappeared Without Saying Goodbye".

325
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:59,170
It's a very good script.

326
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,570
It's a masterpiece.

327
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,770
It's a masterful depiction of a person's feelings

328
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:04,470
for the lover they suddenly lost.

329
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,370
Truly a rare masterpiece.

330
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,570
But once it became a drama,

331
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:11,770
you couldn't stand to listen to it.

332
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,770
Because the director didn't understand any of it.

333
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:16,070
And...

334
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:20,070
Towako Adachi's infantile performance.

335
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,870
It was truly awful.

336
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,470
Worse than a school play.

337
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,570
Right?

338
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:31,470
I told the producer from the start

339
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,070
that she couldn't do it.

340
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:36,270
You're lying.

341
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:37,970
I checked with Kamio Yoshitaka,

342
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:41,370
the producer at the time.

343
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:43,270
You're the one who ignored the opposition

344
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:46,770
and cast her in the lead role.

345
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:52,570
You were already dating Towako Adachi,

346
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,270
and intended it to be a present for her.

347
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,970
Am I wrong?

348
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:59,471
That's a true misappropriation of a show!

349
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,570
But everyone does it!

350
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:08,170
Ms. Yashiro must've been frustrated.

351
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:11,770
Not because it was her debut work,

352
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:16,170
but because this work depicting the loss of a loved one

353
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:18,371
is your own experience, isn't it?

354
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:25,871
You wouldn't have been able to write it otherwise.

355
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,670
Mr. Manda,

356
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:34,870
your and Towako's selfishness

357
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:39,070
ruined a work that was important to Ms. Yashiro.

358
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,970
But, Mouri,

359
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:44,770
why would she act on a seven years old grudge now?

360
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:49,270
Ms. Yashiro probably hadn't been holding a grudge.

361
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:50,770
But one month ago,

362
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:54,571
Mr. Manda was assigned to be the show's producer.

363
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,970
It had been seven years,

364
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:02,070
but nothing had changed.

365
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,070
His superficial glibness

366
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:07,371
and misappropriation of programs had only increased!

367
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:11,870
That old frustration returned,

368
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:16,370
and she decided to seek revenge on the couple.

369
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:20,970
She used a sedative at the staff drinking party last night

370
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:24,570
to make Mr. Manda tired so he'd go home,

371
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:26,770
in order to ruin his alibi.

372
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:30,671
After that, she headed to Towako Manda's place.

373
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:33,570
What do you want?

374
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:35,071
It's the middle of the night.

375
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:52,271
I poured my soul into it.

376
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:56,671
It was so awful.

377
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,370
Boy, I'm beat.

378
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:30,170
I don't think I'm fit for radio.

379
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:33,471
After all, I'm too handsome.

380
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:40,871
This old man doesn't have a concern in the world.

381
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,570
"Next Episode."

382
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:47,170
Let me take a look.

383
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:50,670
Excuse me, but are these book yours?

384
00:23:50,671 --> 00:23:53,570
No, they belong to my husband.

385
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,870
You stole these from Mizutani's house, didn't you?

386
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:58,370
No!

387
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,170
Mr. Yujiro Tamaki,

388
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:02,770
could you come down to the station with us?

389
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:03,870
No way!

390
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:05,470
Hand cream?

391
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:06,471
Yes.

392
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:12,571
