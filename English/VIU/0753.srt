1
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:07,488
You mean you're the strongest in the Karate club?

2
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:09,688
Yes, Yasuko!

3
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:12,388
She easily kicks over the guys too!

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:15,188
Hey, Yayoi. That's taking it too far!

5
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:18,388
-"Yasuko Kawakami (25)" -Wow! A master of Karate!

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,288
No. I'm not.

7
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:22,688
-"Yayoi Yajima (21)" -Well, as a superior in the same Karate club

8
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:24,388
that's something I can really boast about.

9
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:27,788
Oh, no. It's already this late.

10
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,588
I've got to take a bath.

11
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:31,688
I guess I'll be going too, then.

12
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:35,788
Stay a while longer now that you're here.

13
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:37,388
They're coming to pick you up too, aren't they?

14
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,088
Yes. Well...

15
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:40,688
If so, why not?

16
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:42,588
After all, we got to know each other too.

17
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:43,888
That's true.

18
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:44,888
I'm back.

19
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:47,388
Oh, Welcome back, Mr. Suzuki.

20
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:48,588
Thanks.

21
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:51,588
She's Ran Mouri, an underclassman.

22
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:53,188
-"Hidehisa Suzuki (26)" -Hello.

23
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:55,588
Hi. I'm Suzuki.

24
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,788
That's right. Would you like some cake too, Mr. Suzuki?

25
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:01,388
Is it okay if I have some?

26
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:04,688
I'm a Peeping Tom, you know.

27
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:07,488
Nobody thinks you are.

28
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:10,388
It's better to eat it 15 minutes after it's taken out of the refrigerator,

29
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:11,988
so hold on a little while more, okay?

30
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,388
I'm home.

31
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:15,988
Welcome back.

32
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:21,788
My...

33
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:23,688
-"Katsuko Kano (25)" -Mr. Suzuki, you're still here?

34
00:01:23,688 --> 00:01:27,588
The landlord told you to move out as soon as you can, right?

35
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,688
You're the one who lied and told him,

36
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,388
I was peeping at you guys.

37
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:34,488
Well, but it's much easier to do things with only girls around.

38
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:35,588
The nerve!

39
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:37,988
Hey! A guest is here!

40
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:40,288
Katsuko, please cut it out already.

41
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:42,188
Oh, Yayoi.

42
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:45,088
What makes you think you can say such things to me?

43
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:46,688
Well... It's fine.

44
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,388
I've got to practice tap dancing before taking a bath.

45
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:51,588
Katsuko...

46
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:52,788
What?

47
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:54,288
Like I've been telling you from before,

48
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:57,388
will you please lessen your tap dancing practice?

49
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:00,388
My room's right below yours, you see?

50
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,088
That's why...

51
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,888
Oh... Your cake...

52
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:07,188
You like cake, don't you, Katsuko?

53
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:08,788
What? Trying to humour me?

54
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,088
-No... -I guess later then.

55
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:21,888
I'm going to take a bath then.

56
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,188
Okay.

57
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,188
I'm sorry, Ran.

58
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,388
For making you feel uncomfortable.

59
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:30,388
Oh, don't be.

60
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:32,688
Oh, it's okay.

61
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:35,788
Mr. Suzuki is not a Peeping Tom.

62
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,888
Katsuko's just going around saying that.

63
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:41,488
Never mind that already.

64
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:46,288
I'll have a talk with her and settle things later.

65
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:47,688
Thank you for the cake!

66
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:49,188
I'll eat it in my room.

67
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:51,288
Make yourself at home.

68
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:53,288
Oh, thank you.

69
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,588
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

70
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:02,588
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

71
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:04,288
A shocking incident at a share house.

72
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:06,288
What is the premeditated alibi trick?

73
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:07,788
He sees through the one and only truth.

74
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,488
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

75
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,888
His name is Detective Conan.

76
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:58,221
"The Blind Spot in the Share House"

77
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:01,921
It's not all that easy living in a share house, is it?

78
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,621
When I first came here, I thought it was quite fashionable.

79
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:09,421
Because the door of this shared space is made of glass

80
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:12,421
and a foliage plant is decorated here too.

81
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:15,421
It's been renovated so that anyone can come in here

82
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:17,221
and feel at home.

83
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:20,521
Well, after all, we're strangers living under the same roof.

84
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,821
So, we've got our worries too.

85
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,721
We've got a lot of rules to follow too.

86
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:25,821
Rules?

87
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:28,921
Yes, take a look at the back of the chair.

88
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:31,021
"Guest"

89
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:34,721
Like posting seals on all our belongings.

90
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:38,121
-"Guest" -True.

91
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,021
It was a nice bath.

92
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:41,921
I'll go take a bath too then.

93
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,321
Okay.

94
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,721
And? What were you talking about?

95
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:51,221
About you, Yayoi, like you forget to throw out the garbage.

96
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,621
I don't mean to though.

97
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:57,221
You seem to have fixed schedules for cleaning chores and bath time.

98
00:05:57,221 --> 00:05:59,521
There's even a whiteboard for messages too.

99
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,721
It seems like a lot of work.

100
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:05,521
Yes, but, compared to the average rental, it's much cheaper.

101
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:08,121
That's why nobody wants to leave.

102
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,721
Oh, Yasuko.

103
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,321
Katsuko's cake?

104
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,121
Okay.

105
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:21,721
Okay, if she doesn't come down in 15 minutes,

106
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:23,621
I'll put it back in the fridge.

107
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,921
I'll help you, Yayoi.

108
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,921
Don't worry about it. I'm just doing the dishes.

109
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,721
You're a guest, you know.

110
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,021
Is something the matter?

111
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,021
No. Not really.

112
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:47,621
Did something happen to that person called Katsuko?

113
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:51,221
Maybe, she didn't come to eat it.

114
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:02,021
I borrowed money from her...

115
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,721
Money?

116
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:09,121
Is that right?

117
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,821
Since your father suddenly passed away...

118
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:15,721
My brother is still in Junior High School, so finances are needed.

119
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,621
I didn't want to burden anyone to fend for me.

120
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,321
But, no problem.

121
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:24,021
I'm making do with my scholarship and part-time job, you see.

122
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,221
Katsuko didn't come.

123
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:30,321
Is that so?

124
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:33,021
She really does whatever she feels like, doesn't she?

125
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,621
Maybe it's them.

126
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,121
The two that came to get you, right?

127
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,121
Yes!

128
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,621
Sorry.

129
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,421
I couldn't get here any earlier.

130
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,421
Let's go home, Ran.

131
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,521
Yayoi, Yasuko, thank you very much.

132
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:49,021
Please come again.

133
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,221
Sure.

134
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,821
What's wrong? What happened?

135
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:58,121
Mr. Suzuki?

136
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:01,421
Inside. Katsuko's...

137
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:14,921
The victim is Ms. Katsuko Kano, age 25.

138
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:19,021
The murder weapon is unmistakably the knife that was found on the site,

139
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,421
but there were no prints found.

140
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:27,421
The estimated time of death is between 7:15 pm and 7:45 pm.

141
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:28,521
And...

142
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:32,021
sleeping drug was found from the contents in the PET bottle

143
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:34,421
that was on the floor of the site.

144
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:38,821
I see. Putting her to sleep and then stabbing her to death.

145
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:41,921
Mr. Suzuki, since you were the first to discover the body,

146
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,421
please explain how you ended up finding it.

147
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:45,721
Oh, yes.

148
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:48,221
This morning there was a message

149
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:52,021
written on that message board from Katsuko to me.

150
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:55,521
I'll go over to your room before 8:00 pm tonight.

151
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:58,621
Let's get things settled.

152
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,621
There's nothing like that written anywhere.

153
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,721
Has anyone else seen that message?

154
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:07,621
It was written on the message board to keep it a secret!

155
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:10,721
That's why I erased it.

156
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:14,521
Besides, I'm always the last one out of the house,

157
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:19,521
so Katsuko probably wrote it knowing that I was alone in the house.

158
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,021
And?

159
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:22,321
Just as was written,

160
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,321
I was waiting in my room all the while,

161
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:28,921
but, Katsuko didn't come even after 8:00 pm so...

162
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:31,821
I went to her room

163
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,921
and found Katsuko on the bed.

164
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,321
I see.

165
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:39,021
It's true. Please believe me!

166
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,921
No!

167
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:53,221
I didn't do it!

168
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:56,421
Right, Yayoi, Yasuko?

169
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:05,021
Do you both have something in mind?

170
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,521
The fact is, recently Katsuko and Mr. Suzuki were always at each other.

171
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:14,621
Even tonight, before going back to their rooms had a slight argument.

172
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:16,421
Ran, is that right?

173
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,621
-Yes. -Not only me!

174
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:22,921
Neither of you guys like Katsuko, did you?

175
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,521
Please wait!

176
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:27,221
I don't think they're involved with the case.

177
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:30,121
Ran, what makes you say that?

178
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,121
From between 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm,

179
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:35,121
both of them either took a bath as scheduled

180
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:37,921
or was taking with me here.

181
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,221
As scheduled?

182
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,621
It's fixed, isn't it?

183
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:45,321
Your bath time because this is a share house.

184
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:49,521
Right. Besides, I only got up once to use the restroom,

185
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:52,421
but sitting here right through otherwise.

186
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:56,521
From here, I can see the corridor through the glass door.

187
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,021
The sliding glass door...

188
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:01,121
It's true that you can see right through it.

189
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:03,521
In order to go upstairs from the bath tub...

190
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:06,821
You can't go there unless you walk along that corridor.

191
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:09,621
I'm sure that no one walked by

192
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:12,221
while Yasuko was taking a bath.

193
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:16,421
I see. So the two girls have alibis.

194
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:18,421
Then, Mr. Suzuki,

195
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:21,421
I hope you don't mind going upstairs once again

196
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:26,021
to explain how you found the corpse at the scene?

197
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,821
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:32,321
Names must be written on all personal belongings.

199
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:33,321
Come to think of it,

200
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:37,621
there's a name written on the PET bottle found on the floor of the site.

201
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,421
Would you like something to drink?

202
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:41,421
Oh, well, no thanks.

203
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:43,521
No need to be hesitant.

204
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:46,621
Is that cake Katsuko's?

205
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:47,921
That's right.

206
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:51,121
I took it out of the fridge and got it ready for her.

207
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:54,021
Because Yasuko asked me to...

208
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:55,921
I was naked, you see.

209
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:59,721
But, she didn't come to eat it after all.

210
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:02,921
So I put it back in the fridge.

211
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,721
It's best 15 minutes after it's taken out of the fridge.

212
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:10,621
We wanted her to eat it when most delicious.

213
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,521
I get it.

214
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:14,621
What's up, Conan?

215
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:16,121
Nothing.

216
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:18,621
Was there anything else out of the ordinary?

217
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,621
Out of the ordinary?

218
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,721
Oh, now that you mentioned it.

219
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:26,621
Yayoi, you tilted your head

220
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,321
when you were washing dishes, didn't you?

221
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,121
I'll help you, Yayoi.

222
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,221
Don't worry about it. I'm just doing the dishes.

223
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:37,121
You're a guest, you know.

224
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:41,521
Oh... Usually when someone's taking a bath

225
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:44,221
the water doesn't flow as much but...

226
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,121
the water was flowing out as usual at that time.

227
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,221
The bath tub's that way, right?

228
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,421
Wait. Conan.

229
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:05,221
Over here too.

230
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:07,821
It's been wiped off and traces of it being stepped on?

231
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,521
What's the matter?

232
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:13,521
What's this?

233
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,321
Oh, darn it.

234
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:17,721
It's shampoo.

235
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:21,721
When I poured a new one in today, I spilled some.

236
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,721
I thought I wiped it clean

237
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,721
but I guess not.

238
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,721
A window.

239
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,521
The dining room's in clear view.

240
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:40,421
So that means...

241
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:43,021
Why is this area lighter than others?

242
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:46,121
Because there was a picture there before

243
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:49,621
but the landlord took it away yesterday.

244
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,021
This is?

245
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:52,421
Inspector Megure!

246
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:54,421
Please come here! Quick!

247
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:04,312
From inside Mr. Suzuki's shoe box,

248
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:07,312
we found this towel.

249
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:10,912
I see, so that's the story.

250
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:14,212
So as I thought. Mr. Suzuki, you are the killer!

251
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:18,912
You were on bad terms with Katsuko to begin with.

252
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:24,612
But, tonight you blew your top and killed Katsuko upstairs.

253
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:27,912
At that time, you wrapped the handle of the knife with this towel

254
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:30,412
to avoid getting your prints on it!

255
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:34,912
I'll bet you meant to keep this hidden and get rid of it later.

256
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,812
This is it, no, Inspector?

257
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:39,412
Yes. Mr. Katsuhiko Suzuki.

258
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:43,312
I would like you to come to the station with us as a prime suspect.

259
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:44,712
I didn't do it!

260
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:46,812
It's not me.

261
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:50,012
Wrong! He's not the killer!

262
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:52,712
The killer is one of these two.

263
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,212
So, that's it!

264
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:10,512
Please wait, everyone!

265
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:13,312
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me...

266
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:17,412
I think it's too early to conclude that Mr. Suzuki is the killer.

267
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:20,612
But, Mr. Mouri you just...

268
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:23,612
I'm totally ashamed of myself.

269
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:28,012
It's more than apparent just looking at Mr. Suzuki and yet...

270
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:30,612
Please recall the scene of the crime.

271
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:33,712
Katsuko was killed by a slashed artery

272
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:37,012
and there was blood splattered everywhere.

273
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:38,712
And yet please look at him.

274
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:42,212
Mr. Suzuki's sweatshirt is stark white.

275
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:46,012
Could the killer get away without any blood splattering?

276
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:50,012
Maybe he pretended to find the corpse after he changed?

277
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:54,312
If so, those clothes should've been found by now.

278
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:56,512
He didn't have time to get rid of them you see.

279
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:58,212
True.

280
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:01,412
If so, who on earth's the killer?

281
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:03,612
This what the killer did.

282
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:06,112
First, the killer pretends to be Katsuko,

283
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:10,312
and writes a message to Mr. Suzuki on the message board.

284
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:14,312
In order to nail Mr. Suzuki in his room during the time of the crime,

285
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:17,312
and get rid of his alibi.

286
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:18,812
Then the killer,

287
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:23,412
at the time of the crime sneaks out of the bath tub and goes upstairs.

288
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:25,512
Wait a minute there, Mr. Mouri.

289
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:27,012
According to Ran,

290
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:30,912
nobody passed the corridor during the time of the crime.

291
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:32,212
Conan!

292
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:35,112
Yes! Officer Takagi!

293
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:38,812
There's a large planter in front of that door over there, isn't there?

294
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,612
Try looking below, will you?

295
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,512
There's a trace of it having been moved, right?

296
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:47,612
-Yes. -Can you move it a bit over towards the door?

297
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:48,612
Like this?

298
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:51,612
Then, will you go out to the corridor and close the door?

299
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,212
Roger.

300
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,612
Ran, please go over to the fridge

301
00:16:56,612 --> 00:17:00,312
and open the door of the fridge when Pops signals you to.

302
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,912
Okay, I got it.

303
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,912
Please come here, everybody!

304
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:09,812
Please watch Officer Takagi closely.

305
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,412
Okay, Ran. Open the door of the fridge.

306
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:13,712
Okay.

307
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:17,112
This is...

308
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,412
How about it?

309
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,412
Officer Takagi disappeared from view

310
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:24,012
from where Ran was sitting.

311
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:27,712
I heard from Conan that during the time of the crime,

312
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:31,012
the fridge door was opened twice.

313
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:36,812
In order to take out and put back Katsuko's cake.

314
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,712
Before committing the crime,

315
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:43,512
the killer moved that planter when Ran got up to go to the restroom.

316
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:46,812
Then, snuck out of the bath tub.

317
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:49,512
I've got evidence of this too.

318
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:54,612
The killer stepped on the spilled shampoo in the bathroom.

319
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:57,812
Traces of this were left in the corridor.

320
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:01,612
Then during this short time that the fridge door was opened,

321
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:05,012
the killer head for Katsuko's room.

322
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:08,312
There, Katusko who was drugged with sleeping medicine,

323
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:10,612
was fast asleep.

324
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:12,912
The killer who snuck in.

325
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:18,412
After committing the crime

326
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:19,512
and putting the blood smeared towel

327
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:22,012
into Mr. Suzuki's shoe box.

328
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:27,412
Then the killer ran again when the cake was put back into the fridge.

329
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:31,312
All you had to do was put the planter back in place.

330
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:34,112
Wait, Dad, are you saying that I...

331
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:38,912
Ran, you were used to establish an alibi.

332
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:41,912
Because guests will always sit where you did.

333
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,312
Wait. I'm the one who opened the fridge door.

334
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:47,412
Which means that the killer is...

335
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:48,912
Yasuko?

336
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,712
I'm the killer?

337
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:54,312
Don't be ridiculous! Wrong!

338
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:56,012
Huh? Miss...

339
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,112
Did you hurt your shoulder?

340
00:18:58,112 --> 00:18:59,912
Blood's coming out.

341
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:04,612
That is indeed the evidence

342
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:07,612
that proves you went up and down the stairs.

343
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:11,112
Take a look at that window facing the stairs.

344
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:14,112
Although it's situated in a high place,

345
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,312
when Yasuko committed the crime,

346
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:18,912
she didn't want to be seen.

347
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:20,612
That's why she sank down low

348
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:23,812
and when she tried to straighten up again.

349
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,512
Right.

350
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:28,312
On the wall right beyond the window,

351
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:30,412
there was a nail sticking out

352
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,512
just where her shoulder was.

353
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:33,912
Wait!

354
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:38,012
You said that Mr. Suzuki had no blood splattered on him, didn't you?

355
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:42,912
But, Katsuko's blood wasn't on my clothes either!

356
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:46,312
It dawned on me as soon as I saw that wound.

357
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:49,212
Your body was injured because of the nail.

358
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:52,012
But, your T-shirt now isn't torn.

359
00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:56,812
The clothes that you were wearing before probably isn't torn either.

360
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,612
What is the meaning of this?

361
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:04,912
After going to the bath tub you took off all your clothes

362
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,112
and killed Katsuko naked!

363
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:16,912
After that,

364
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:21,412
you wipe of the blood using the towel that you wrapped the knife with,

365
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:25,012
then being very careful not to leave traces on the floor,

366
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:29,012
you return to the bath tub and shower everything off.

367
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:31,412
You're wrong! I...

368
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:35,612
If so, let's have the drain of the bath tub checked!

369
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:39,212
I'm sure that Katsuko's blood will be detected!

370
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,912
Yasuko. Why?

371
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:50,312
Tap...

372
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:51,612
All the time!

373
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:54,112
It comes echoing every night!

374
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:56,612
The sound of her shoes tap dancing!

375
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:59,812
She wouldn't stop no matter how many times I asked her to.

376
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:02,912
I couldn't take it anymore!

377
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:06,312
For something like that.

378
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:08,512
Then she said...

379
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:11,212
In fact, I feel really good.

380
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:15,112
It's like I'm stepping on the top of your head.

381
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:17,512
So, just put up with it.

382
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:21,112
Because a third rate, plain woman like you

383
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:25,512
can only be of use to me by doing so.

384
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:55,712
-"Mouri Detective Agency" -Hey, Dad!

385
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:59,212
I thought up something good!

386
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,412
Why don't we turn our house into a share house?

387
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:03,112
It'll help make ends meet too.

388
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,112
Don't be silly.

389
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:06,412
I see.

390
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:09,312
Too bad when I know this beautiful, money-making career woman

391
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,312
that could do us good.

392
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:14,412
Really too bad.

393
00:23:14,412 --> 00:23:17,212
Well, if it's going to help make ends meet.

394
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:19,412
Really? All right!

395
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:23,012
-"Eri Kisaki" -I'll attach this on the vacant room then.

396
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:25,712
So now, we can live as a family once again.

397
00:23:25,712 --> 00:23:27,312
I've got to call Mom.

398
00:23:27,312 --> 00:23:29,312
Hey, Ran, don't!

399
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,412
-Give that to me! -Hello, mom.

400
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,912
Give it to me I said!

401
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,112
Wait a second.

402
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:37,912
Her cooking is...

403
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:42,012
Wait, Ran! Please wait!

404
00:23:46,412 --> 00:23:48,912
These are the pictures I printed out.

405
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:50,212
We're counting on you.

406
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:53,012
Well, it was 15 years ago.

407
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:56,112
At a different rental villa near here.

408
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:59,512
By the time a police officer who heard of this incident got to the room...

409
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:01,912
Red...

410
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:03,312
Red?

411
00:24:03,312 --> 00:24:05,212
Red...

412
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,812
The bath tub is filled with...

413
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:09,687
Next Conan,
