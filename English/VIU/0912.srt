00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:13,003
Dad! I told you to wait until after dinner to drink beer.

3
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:14,803
You always fall asleep when you drink.

4
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:16,703
You never help clean up.

5
00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:19,003
Shut up. I need more than one drink

6
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,803
after all the unbelievably hard work I did today.

7
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,603
Hold on. Dad.

8
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:27,503
You may not understand

9
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:32,703
but this is my only joy right now.

10
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:36,203
Yeah... Wait until after dinner, though.

11
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:43,903
Hello, Mouri residence.

12
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:45,403
Officer Takagi.

13
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:48,803
Yes, Conan's here.

14
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:50,203
The truth is...

15
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:57,303
What? Conan is a witness in a murder case?

use your detective skills to produce an answer!

18
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:09,303
A shocking phone call from Officer Takagi!

19
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,303
What do I have to do with the case?

20
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:12,903
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:14,803
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:17,203
His name is Detective Conan!

"The Youth Detective Squad Become Models"

24
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:08,365
I'll summarize the case.

25
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:10,265
Please do.

26
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:13,865
"Seiho Kitasono (72)" -The victim is Mr. Seiho Kitasono, 72 years old.

27
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:16,365
He died when he was struck in the back of the head.

28
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:19,765
We believe the weapon was the plaster bust over there.

29
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:23,865
Mr. Seiho was famous in the world of Japanese painting.

30
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:26,165
He acted as the chairperson on judging committees

31
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,165
for various exhibitions.

32
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:31,265
His estimated time of death is around 3:30 pm.

33
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:36,365
His body was found by his apprentice, Mr. Kengo Higashio.

34
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:39,465
It was around 3:50 pm when Mr. Higashio entered the studio

35
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:42,665
and found Mr. Seiho on the ground,

36
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:45,765
bleeding from his head.

37
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:49,865
Mr. Higashio then left the studio and returned to the house,

38
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:53,165
where he reported what he found to housekeeper Ms. Shizu Minamida.

39
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:57,665
At the same time, Mr. Seiho's wife, Mrs. Kinuko, returned home.

40
00:03:57,665 --> 00:03:59,865
They confirmed Mr. Seiho was dead,

41
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:04,965
and Ms. Shizu called the police at 3:58 pm.

42
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:10,665
Later, his other apprentice, Mr. Daiki Nishiyama, arrived.

43
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:14,765
He arrived after us around 5 pm.

44
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:16,165
I see.

45
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:21,465
Then why is Conan a witness in a murder case?

46
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:22,565
Well...

47
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:25,765
It's already finished.

48
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,565
It's Conan and his friends.

49
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:31,665
This is the painting that Mr. Nishiyama, the artist who came late,

50
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:34,365
was working on at Okuho Lake today.

51
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:39,665
We had Conan come to confirm the time.

52
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:45,665
I think we met Mr. Nishiyama around 11 am.

53
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:49,765
But we left after about 15 minutes of sketching,

54
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:54,865
so I don't know how long Mr. Nishiyama was painting there. But...

55
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:58,065
But he finished this painting.

56
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:02,365
He must've been there for a while.

57
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,565
He's right.

58
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:08,065
Well, officer. How is it going?

59
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:10,065
Have you figured anything out?

60
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:13,165
We're still gathering information.

61
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:14,865
Nothing so far.

62
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:18,265
"Kengo Higashio (33)" -In any case, Mr. Kitasono wasn't someone

63
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:20,065
anyone would've hated enough to kill.

64
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:23,065
Oh, my. So you say.

65
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:26,165
"Kinuko Kitasono (60), Kitasono's Wife" -But, Higashio,

66
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:28,665
aren't you the one who killed my husband?

67
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,965
Why would you say that?

68
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:35,565
You resented him for not recommending you

69
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:37,865
for the teaching position at the Beika Art School.

70
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,065
This is ridiculous.

71
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:45,665
In that case, weren't you fighting with your husband

72
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:48,565
over the money you were throwing at a young host?

73
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:52,265
You're more suspicious than I am.

74
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:55,965
Let's not discuss this right now.

75
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:58,965
"Shizu Minamida (55)" -Mr. Kitasono just died.

76
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,565
Seriously, Nishiyama?

77
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,465
You're suspicious as well.

78
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:08,065
My husband told you he'd select your piece

79
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:10,065
to win an exhibition if you paid him.

80
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,765
"Daiki Nishiyama (26)" -Maybe you killed him

81
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:13,565
because you couldn't afford it.

82
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,665
I would never!

83
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:20,365
Let me ask again.

84
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:25,065
When Mr. Higashio arrived, the door wasn't locked, correct?

85
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,965
Yes. Normally it's locked,

86
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:31,365
but on days like today when he knew we were coming,

87
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,265
he sometimes left it open.

88
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:37,865
According to forensics, the windows were unlocked.

89
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,165
Yes.

90
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,965
He did sometimes work with the windows open.

91
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,165
Working with oil paints

92
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:46,165
will fill a room with the smell of paint and oil.

93
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:50,165
I see. But he would've noticed immediately

94
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:54,365
if a stranger entered through the door or windows.

95
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:56,665
Not necessarily.

96
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,565
When he was caught up in his work,

97
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:03,965
he'd forget to eat or use the bathroom.

98
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,565
By the way, was there anything valuable in the studio?

99
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:10,965
I'm not sure if they were valuable,

100
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:13,865
but my husband kept a few of his paintings there.

101
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:17,765
Even if anything's missing, I wouldn't know.

102
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:22,065
At the very least, they'd probably sell for a few million yen.

103
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:24,465
One million yen?

104
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,265
Sorry.

105
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:30,965
To be accurate, a few million.

106
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:34,565
His larger pieces are worth close to ten million.

107
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:40,065
Which means it may have been a robbery.

108
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:41,765
Once again,

109
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:46,065
during the estimated time of death between 3:10 pm and 3:40 pm,

110
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,865
where were all of you?

111
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:52,365
I was at home all day today.

112
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:56,465
I left after 3 pm and drove here.

113
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,765
I went out before noon.

114
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:01,265
I ate at the Beika department store

115
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:04,565
and visited two other department stores after that.

116
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:09,665
I was on the train from Okuho Lake to Beika City.

117
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:16,065
I left just before 3 pm to go shopping at the nearby supermarket.

118
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:19,765
I returned about five minutes before Mr. Higashio arrived.

119
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:24,665
I see. Do you have anything or anyone

120
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:27,465
to verify your alibis?

121
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,065
-Verify? -Our alibis?

122
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:33,165
But how can we verify...

123
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,765
You were there this afternoon.

124
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,665
Yeah. You already finished the painting of us.

125
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:41,765
Yeah. I was arrived late because I was working on that.

126
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:43,965
I'd like to show the others.

127
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:46,165
Can I take a picture?

128
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:49,065
Of course. Oh, right.

129
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:51,465
That reminds me.

130
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:55,665
Officer, this is a picture I took at Okuho Lake Station.

131
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,365
Does this verify my alibi?

132
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:02,765
It's certainly clear that you took it at Okuho Lake Station, but...

133
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:07,065
If it'd included the time, it would've verified your alibi.

134
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:08,665
I see.

135
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,865
Let me see.

136
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,265
Sure.

137
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:18,565
Huh? Look at this.

138
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:23,465
If you enlarge the sign

139
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:26,265
"Train Departure Time" -behind Mr. Nishiyama... See?

140
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:32,465
That's right. I took the 2:02 pm train back.

141
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:34,965
From Okuho Lake Station to here...

142
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:38,065
It takes close to two hours.

143
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:41,865
So he's probably got an alibi.

144
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:43,065
In any case,

145
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:47,265
we're also considering the possibility of theft as we investigate,

146
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:48,365
but to be on the safe side,

147
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:52,865
we're checking everyone's alibi.

148
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:55,365
We appreciate your cooperation.

149
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:04,365
I can't believe you four are tagging along.

150
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:06,265
Tagging along? How rude.

151
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:09,765
We're helping you with your investigation.

152
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:13,565
We remember when he asked us to be his models.

153
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:16,365
Since he has the painting and photos of the station,

154
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,365
Mr. Nishiyama's alibi is as good as verified.

155
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:20,965
It won't take long.

156
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:23,665
Yeah, but...

157
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:28,065
Why are you suddenly dropping in?

158
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,065
We appreciate your cooperation.

159
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,065
What do you want?

160
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:36,965
After canvassing the Mitsuboshi and Marukawa department stores

161
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:41,165
you claimed you visited,

162
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:44,865
we found no one who said they saw you there.

163
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:48,865
Naturally, we checked the security camera footage as well,

164
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:53,365
but we couldn't find you anywhere during that time.

165
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:59,465
Between noon and 4 pm yesterday,

166
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:00,765
why don't you tell us

167
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:04,465
where and what you were actually doing?

168
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,465
Aohata Station. For Okuho Lake Station, transfer to...

169
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:12,165
-Look. -So many mountains.

170
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:17,765
Who is it?

171
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:24,765
Mr. Higashio. You said you were at home yesterday at 1 pm,

172
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:26,865
but the deliveryman who came to your place said

173
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:30,165
no one answered the door.

174
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:32,865
Oh, please. I was here.

175
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:36,565
I don't like to be seen in my pajamas,

176
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,865
so I didn't answer.

177
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,265
I see.

178
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:43,565
We'd like to ask you more about that.

179
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:45,665
Could you come down to the station with us?

180
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,065
"Okuho Lake Station"

181
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:52,765
See? It's just like we said.

182
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:55,165
That sign that shows the destinations changed

183
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:58,065
the moment the train started moving.

184
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:01,865
He only could've gotten on at 2:02 pm.

185
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:04,665
The station attendant said the same thing.

186
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:10,565
Sir, when does the sign switch to showing the next destination?

187
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:15,465
It changes automatically when the previous train departs.

188
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:20,165
After all, Japan has the most punctual trains in the world.

189
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:23,265
The man who made that painting is a good person.

190
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:25,665
You got that, Officer Takagi?

191
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,365
This is Takagi.

192
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:31,965
It's me.

193
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:33,465
Where are you?

194
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:36,565
Well...

195
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:40,465
Sorry, Inspector. We just arrived at Okuho Lake.

196
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:44,965
I see. We were able to confirm the housekeeper Ms. Shizu's alibi.

197
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,665
We learned his wife, Mrs. Kinuko,

198
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:51,465
was visiting a male host around that time, too.

199
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:55,965
We're just waiting for confirmation on Mr. Higashio and Mr. Nishiyama.

200
00:12:55,965 --> 00:13:00,065
Got it. I'll let you know the moment I learn anything.

201
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:04,565
That's where we got the drawing done.

202
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:08,065
It's right here.

203
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,565
Let's see.

204
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,365
It certainly looks exactly the same.

205
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:17,465
Of course it is. It's only been a day.

206
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:20,465
Genta wouldn't lose weight

207
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:23,665
or Conan wouldn't grow in a single day.

208
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:28,065
By the way, I've been wondering since yesterday.

209
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:31,465
How did you end up being his models?

210
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:34,265
There was a dog here.

211
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,465
How cute.

212
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,965
What's your name?

213
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:43,865
Are you kids in grade school?

214
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,865
Yes!

215
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,765
We're first-years at Teitan Elementary School.

216
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,365
Are you on a field trip today?

217
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:53,665
That's good! Would you like to model for me?

218
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,565
I see. So that's what happened.

219
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:58,365
Do you get it now?

220
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:02,665
The four of us can verify his alibi.

221
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:05,965
Okay...

222
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:09,065
Since his alibi's been verified, we can go now.

223
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:13,165
What? We came all the way here, and we're leaving already?

224
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:15,365
Let's have some fun first.

225
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,965
We can't. We didn't come here to play.

226
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:24,865
"Train Departure Time. 14:02 - Aohata"

227
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,465
I see. You're sure, then?

228
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:32,065
Yes. Mr. Nishiyama has an alibi.

229
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:34,765
That just leaves Mr. Higashio's alibi.

230
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:37,465
Officer Sato's talking to him now.

231
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:38,665
I see.

232
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:45,165
I'm hungry. I can't take another step.

233
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:46,865
Okay...

234
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:50,365
I'll buy you something while we're waiting to transfer.

235
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:53,565
That's not good enough. I want eel.

236
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:57,565
Since we're in the mountains, they'll have wild eel.

237
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:00,765
Wild eel?

238
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:03,865
Lucky me.

239
00:15:03,865 --> 00:15:08,665
I get to be interrogated by a beautiful officer.

240
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,365
Hurry up. The train's leaving.

241
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:18,665
This and this and I don't need this, but I do need this.

242
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:30,865
I'm sorry!

243
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:34,365
I lied!

244
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:39,565
Wait...

245
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,965
Are you all right?

246
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:43,065
Thank you.

247
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:45,465
"Train Departure Time"

248
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:48,065
Officer Takagi, look!

249
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,065
Huh?

250
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:52,865
This is...

251
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,965
Why are we going back?

252
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:02,065
Are we going to play?

253
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:06,165
There's something I need to check again.

254
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,765
Something you need to check?

255
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:11,465
You didn't notice?

256
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,865
Notice what?

257
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:15,965
The sign at Aohata Station changed,

258
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:19,265
even though the train hadn't left yet.

259
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,265
What?

260
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:23,665
In other words, if the same thing happened

261
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:26,765
when Mr. Nishiyama took that photo,

262
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:31,265
then Mr. Nishiyama could've boarded the previous train.

263
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,165
This is Takagi.

264
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:39,265
We confirmed Mr. Higashio's alibi.

265
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:43,165
He was with a married woman at the time.

266
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:45,665
Could it have been an intruder?

267
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:47,165
Forensics is saying

268
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:52,065
there are no signs someone entered from outside the house.

269
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:56,265
What? Yesterday?

270
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,865
Yeah. Were there any trains that departed late?

271
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,865
Yeah, there was one.

272
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:04,065
What time?

273
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,465
It was the 1:17 pm train to Aohata.

274
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:09,065
Why was it delayed?

275
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:12,865
It tried to leave on time,

276
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,165
but the gates at the crossing just outside the station wouldn't descend.

277
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,165
When the conductor examined it,

278
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:21,065
he found someone had vandalized the crossing gate.

279
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:25,465
Earlier you said the sign changes automatically

280
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:28,165
when it's time for the previous train to leave.

281
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:30,465
Does that mean the sign changed to 2:02 pm

282
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:33,665
while the previous train was late?

283
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,465
Yeah, that's right.

284
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:39,365
Could you look up what time the delayed train arrived

285
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:40,765
in Aohata Station?

286
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,365
Let's see.

287
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:45,465
It departed five minutes late,

288
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,965
but it made up some time on the way.

289
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:52,265
The train scheduled to arrive at 1:50 pm arrived at 1:53 pm.

290
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,665
So, what?

291
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:58,065
If you arrive in Aohata Station at 1:53 pm,

292
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:01,765
you can get on the 1:55 pm special express.

293
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,565
But the question is...

294
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,965
They're the same.

295
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,465
There's no mistaking it.

296
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,765
He made this painting here.

297
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:15,665
But we met Mr. Nishiyama around 11 am.

298
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:22,065
He couldn't have painted this in the less than two hours

299
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:24,765
between when he started and when he got on the 1:17 pm train.

300
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:26,765
Huh? What's this?

301
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:30,165
He probably accidentally got some paint on it.

302
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,865
It's yesterday's dog.

303
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,965
Mister, this dog was tied to this tree yesterday, right?

304
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:43,265
Yeah. I was fishing down there.

305
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:45,265
There's good fishing here.

306
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:47,565
Do you live nearby?

307
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:48,665
Yeah.

308
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:52,365
Could you take a look at something?

309
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,765
Do you know what this is?

310
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,865
Yeah, it's barricade tape.

311
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:00,665
Barricade tape?

312
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:03,965
They were worried about a dead tree falling,

313
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:06,565
so a crew from town hall cut it down last week.

314
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:08,265
Last week?

315
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:12,065
Around what time did you take your dog home yesterday?

316
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:16,165
I went home to eat lunch, so it was around 12:30 pm.

317
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:19,065
There was someone painting here then, right?

318
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:21,765
No, I didn't see anyone painting.

319
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:24,465
-What? -He wasn't here?

320
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:25,965
Really?

321
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:30,465
Thank you.

322
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:34,765
We solved it, Officer Takagi.

323
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,465
Yeah.

324
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:40,365
What? Mr. Nishiyama's alibi fell apart?

325
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:45,365
Yes. This is how Mr. Nishiyama fabricated his alibi.

326
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:50,165
First, he made that painting last week.

327
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:54,065
But that's not enough to prove an alibi.

328
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:57,565
That's why he asked us to model yesterday

329
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:01,365
and painted us on top of the scenery he'd already painted.

330
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:05,565
But there was something there that shouldn't have been,

331
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:09,365
the tree that was cut down last week.

332
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,165
Then Mr. Nishiyama returned to the station,

333
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:16,965
vandalized the crossing gate, and delayed the train.

334
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,865
He waited for the sign to change and took a photo.

335
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:26,165
But since he actually boarded the 1:17 pm train,

336
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:31,365
he was able to board the 1:55 pm special express at Aohata Station.

337
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:34,365
That train would let him arrive at the studio in time

338
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:37,465
to commit the murder.

339
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:39,765
We don't know his motive,

340
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:43,765
but if he did all that work beforehand,

341
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:49,965
then Mr. Daiki Nishiyama definitely killed Mr. Seiho Kitasono.

342
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:55,965
It...

343
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,465
It wasn't my fault!

344
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,565
It's...

345
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,665
It's Mr. Kitasono's fault!

346
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:10,265
He made people pay in exchange for selecting them as winners.

347
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:12,765
I couldn't afford it,

348
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:15,065
so I always lost.

349
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:20,565
Mr. Nishiyama, why did you decide to become a painter?

350
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:23,265
Because you loved painting?

351
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,365
Didn't you become an artist

352
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:29,265
so the children who saw your paintings would smile?

353
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:35,065
But you betrayed the children who modeled for you.

354
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:40,765
You deceived your audience and stooped to using them to commit a murder.

355
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:44,765
You've been betrayed as well

356
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:47,865
by the paintings you used to love.

357
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:17,265
Genta, no fair.

358
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:20,265
You guys said you just wanted drinks.

359
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,465
You didn't say you wanted any.

360
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:25,665
Officer Takagi, we want ice cream, too.

361
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:28,465
Yeah, we wanted you to know without us telling you.

362
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,865
You kids are hopeless.

363
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,365
Japan has the most punctual trains in the world.

364
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:42,165
-Ice cream! -Ice cream!

365
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:46,365
"Next Episode" -This is The Metropolitan Police Department!

366
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,465
Iwao Takatori!

367
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:51,565
You're under arrest for robbing a jewelry store!

368
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:53,465
You're a bunch of uncultured fools.

369
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,965
How dare you interrupt my coffee time.

370
00:23:57,365 --> 00:23:59,065
There's a checkpoint up ahead.

371
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:00,665
What will you do?

372
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:03,065
You can't just keep going forward.

373
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:13,065
