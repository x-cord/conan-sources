1
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:22,895
"Takeuchi Construction Company's Bribery Case."

2
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,095
What?

3
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,295
Attorney at law Kisaki is here.

4
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:58,595
Please let her through.

5
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,095
-This way. -Thank you.

6
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:04,995
Ms. Kujo.

7
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,295
May we go out somewhere?

8
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:09,395
Yes, sure.

9
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:13,795
Thank you for the other day.

10
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:16,395
Did you get information about Mr. Takeuchi?

11
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:17,795
Yes.

12
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:21,295
I heard charges have been dropped due to the death of the suspect.

13
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:25,295
I'm sorry for all the inconvenience I caused you, Ms. Kisaki.

14
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,395
By the way,

15
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:32,695
I heard you submitted an informal resignation,

16
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:34,295
but is it true?

17
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:40,795
Don't tell me that you're planning on quitting your job as prosecutor.

18
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:43,295
I pressured the suspect who turned himself in,

19
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:46,195
to the point of committing suicide

20
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:48,895
that I'm ready for whatever may happen to my job.

21
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:51,395
What are you going to do about the hit-and-run incident?

22
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:52,895
Another prosecutor

23
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:57,095
is preparing to set up evidence that his wife committed the crime.

24
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:00,095
You mean that's okay with you?

25
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:01,195
If under the law,

26
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:04,095
the truth is brought into the light,

27
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:07,795
my individual position is of no concern!

28
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,695
Even if that means letting the killer go free?

29
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:11,695
Huh?

30
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:20,095
-Killer? -Yes.

31
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,295
There is suspicion that maybe Mr. Takeuchi was murdered

32
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:24,795
under the pretense of having committed suicide.

33
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,695
That... that can't be

34
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:28,895
because I saw him with my own eyes.

35
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,895
What did you see with your own eyes?

36
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:38,395
Mr. Takeuchi! What're you doing?

37
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,195
What was his wife doing at that time?

38
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:52,495
I don't know.

39
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:55,795
I was so absorbed in stopping Mr. Takeuchi back then,

40
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:58,195
that my attention was not on her at all.

41
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,295
Don't tell me that...

42
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:04,295
His wife had a motive of wanting to kill her husband.

43
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:07,395
You mean it was all planned out?

44
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,295
Setting an incumbent prosecutor up as eye-witness,

45
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:11,695
would ensure that investigation will follow through

46
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:14,095
with just a matter of procedure.

47
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:15,495
They would never perform an investigation

48
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,495
that would go right against the testimony of a prosecutor.

49
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:20,795
That's true.

50
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:22,495
Oh, my goodness.

51
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:25,295
That possibility didn't even cross my mind.

52
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:26,695
So, what are you going to do?

53
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,195
If you quit now,

54
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,095
it'll be exactly what the culprit wants you to do.

55
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:31,695
Are you sure you want it that way?

56
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:33,895
Ms. Kisaki, I'm sorry,

57
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:35,595
but if you'll excuse me, I must go!

58
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:37,795
I have to get back to work.

59
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,995
Hello, Mr. Sasaki,

60
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:44,295
will you please get together

61
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,395
the investigation reports of Mr. Takeuchi's case right away?

62
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:49,295
Yes. And, please contact the local police

63
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,995
and make an appointment with the police detective in charge too.

64
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,195
The defendant, Mariko Takeuchi,

65
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,395
on the same day late at night at around 23:00,

66
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:59,595
drove her own car,

67
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:02,495
and when she got to the Toriyacho intersection,

68
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:05,495
collided into the bicycle

69
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,695
driven by victim, Yasuyuki Matsukawa, who was crossing the street,

70
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:12,595
then hit-and-ran.

71
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:14,395
She then tells her husband,

72
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:18,195
Hiroaki Takeuchi to turn himself in to the police, in her place,

73
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:20,495
and attempts to free herself from the crime she committed.

74
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,095
After her husband commits suicide,

75
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,195
next they bring charges against her.

76
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,595
Maybe Madonna's upset at the mass media getting down on her,

77
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:30,195
that she's just trying to push her way through?

78
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:34,595
Hey, Conan. Wasn't the one who hit-and-ran, his wife?

79
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:37,195
Then, why is mom acting as her attorney?

80
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:40,295
I'm sure she has something in mind.

81
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:45,395
I wonder what she has in mind.

82
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:53,795
Is the defendant admitting the charges?

83
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,295
I am innocent!

84
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,895
She had the nerve to pressure my husband into committing suicide,

85
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:01,195
-and now, she dares brings charges against me too. -Order!

86
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:02,395
If you have any counterargument,

87
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:05,695
you will be given a chance to make a statement, so please do so then.

88
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,195
Please present your evidence,

89
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:11,595
Prosecutor.

90
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:13,295
Yes, Your Honor.

91
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:14,795
The evidence I'd like to submit

92
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:16,995
are the analysis report of the vehicle that collided,

93
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:19,895
the dactyloscopy report of the fingerprints left on the steering wheel,

94
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:22,095
the pieces of shattered glass collected from the site of the accident,

95
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,295
bits of the coating of the car,

96
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,395
and the result of the analysis report of the traces of paint

97
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:27,895
found on the victim's bicycle.

98
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:31,395
The dinner party ended at around 22:00,

99
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:34,495
and the president drove her own car home.

100
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:35,695
Thank you.

101
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,395
That will be all.

102
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:38,695
All right.

103
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:41,395
Will the attorney for the defendant cross-examine?

104
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:43,695
Yes, Your Honor.

105
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:46,795
Mr. Yajima, I'd like to just ask you one question.

106
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:50,995
Did you see the defendant drive her car?

107
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:54,695
No, because I was talking to one of our business partners.

108
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:58,095
Please answer only whether you saw or did not see the defendant.

109
00:05:58,095 --> 00:06:00,295
I didn't see her.

110
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:01,595
That will be all.

111
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:06,695
Now I know why your fees are so high.

112
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:11,695
Your Honor!

113
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:15,395
The defense counsel would like to request a special witness.

114
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:16,595
Prosecutor.

115
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:20,195
A request was submitted today, just before the hearing,

116
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:21,995
anything on this?

117
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,495
I accept.

118
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:26,995
Will the special witness for the defense counsel,

119
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,795
Kogoro Mouri, come to the witness stand.

120
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:35,495
Prosecutor, is it really okay?

121
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,795
Yes, no problem.

122
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:39,695
Dad is taking the stand.

123
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,295
I guess I'll sit and watch what Pops is going to do.

124
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,655
Now, Mr. Mouri,

125
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:54,655
I hear you were an acquaintance of Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi.

126
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,955
Yeah, although it was just that I used to see him

127
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:59,855
off and on at the pub I used go to.

128
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,555
At those times,

129
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:05,655
did Mr. Takeuchi ever drink and drive himself home?

130
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:09,455
No, not that I know of, not even once.

131
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:14,755
That's why when I heard that he got into a car accident after drinking,

132
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:18,255
an inspiration flashed through this seven-colored brain cell of mine!

133
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:22,255
After doing some investigation,

134
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:27,455
I started to suspect that maybe he turned himself in to protect his wife.

135
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:29,855
What made you think so?

136
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,755
Well, there were many reasons,

137
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:35,255
but the question here is why he took the blame in her place.

138
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:39,055
I've heard that he wasn't getting along with his wife.

139
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,155
He must've had a darn good reason for admitting

140
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:43,655
to have committed a crime he didn't do, in place of someone else.

141
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:46,455
Why did he do what he did?

142
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:49,155
The reason he did what he did was for freedom.

143
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:50,655
Freedom?

144
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:52,755
Yes, freedom.

145
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,755
He was already in a humiliating position

146
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:58,355
being that he married into the president's family.

147
00:07:58,355 --> 00:07:59,955
But, after his father-in-law fell ill

148
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:02,755
and his wife took over the presidency,

149
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,755
he had to face her day in and day out every single day

150
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,655
at home as well as at the company.

151
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,055
I mean, that's like being thrown into jail.

152
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:14,555
Well, what I mean is...

153
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:16,155
In exchange to taking the blame for his wife's crime,

154
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:19,455
he wanted to divorce his bickering wife, and start a new life.

155
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:24,355
Will the defense counsel come here for a minute?

156
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,455
Prosecutor too, please.

157
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:31,955
Defense counsel, what are you trying to prove anyway?

158
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:37,955
Mr. Mouri's testimony sounds more in favor of the prosecution.

159
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:39,555
I would like to make clear

160
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:43,655
the emotional entanglement that existed between the couple.

161
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,655
Prosecution, any comments?

162
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:49,355
If that's what it takes to substantiate the murder case...

163
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:50,655
A murder case?

164
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:58,855
I see that there is a need to hear about this in more detail.

165
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:01,155
We will suspend eye-witness testimony for now

166
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:03,755
and court will be adjourned for 30 minutes!

167
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,355
Come with me, both of you.

168
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:12,155
Conan, where are you going?

169
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:13,555
To the restroom!

170
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:29,455
Please explain what is going on.

171
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:32,055
I'm sure you both understand that this court hearing

172
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:36,655
is only to pass sentence on a hit-and-run case.

173
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,755
Yes, of course.

174
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:42,355
However, this case and the case involving Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi

175
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:44,555
are very closely connected.

176
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:46,255
And solving that case

177
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:50,255
will very importantly influence the hearing of this case.

178
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,555
Okay.

179
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:02,655
If the prosecutor feels the same way,

180
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:06,555
let's have Mr. Mouri continue his testimony.

181
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,455
However,

182
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:11,555
if there is anymore commotion in court,

183
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:14,055
the court will be adjourned immediately.

184
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:15,455
Understood?

185
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:17,055
You, especially, Ms. Kujo.

186
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:20,755
Because you seem to be personally involved in this case.

187
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,355
I understand.

188
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,455
It's about time for Pops to go off the scene.

189
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,155
Order in the court!

190
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:35,355
We will resume the hearing.

191
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:38,555
I wonder where Conan went.

192
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,855
Will the witness resume testimony?

193
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:43,055
All right.

194
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,855
Okay, it's time we get down to business.

195
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:53,155
Like I said a while ago,

196
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:54,655
Prosecutor Kujo was waiting for Mr. Takeuchi,

197
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:59,355
who turned himself in to the police, in place of his wife.

198
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:02,255
And, five years ago when he was pressed

199
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:06,055
to tell the truth about the construction fraud,

200
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:09,555
an idea flashed through his mind.

201
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,955
What kind of idea was that?

202
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:16,255
If the prosecution hasn't forgotten about the incident in the past,

203
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:19,155
he could use it to blackmail and make money.

204
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:21,755
In other words, not only would he be able to get a hold of freedom,

205
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:26,055
but also could maybe make a huge sum of cash.

206
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:28,755
One billion yen?

207
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,155
Just what do you mean?

208
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:34,255
The contract was for divorce and 30 million yen palimony, right?

209
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:37,455
I was in jail for a while, so I raised the price.

210
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:41,355
I could never dish out such a large sum of money!

211
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:42,755
If you don't want to, it's fine with me.

212
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:47,055
All I need to do is tell the prosecutor the truth.

213
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:51,055
I guess you can spend time in jail together with your sick father.

214
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,755
So, the will of wanting to kill

215
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:01,255
sprouted in Mrs. Takeuchi's mind.

216
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,155
Hey! Just what do you mean the will to kill?

217
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,255
Defendant! Order, please!

218
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:08,755
Witness, are you saying that the defendant

219
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:13,255
may be involved with the death of Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi?

220
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,655
Exactly.

221
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,255
Your Honour!

222
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,255
I would like you to consider this as a testimony

223
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,755
in relation to bringing into light the truth of the matter.

224
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:22,055
Just what're you talking about?

225
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,155
Aren't you supposed to be my lawyer?

226
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:28,055
Prosecution, any comments?

227
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:32,055
I agree as to bring to light the truth of the matter.

228
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,955
The witness may proceed.

229
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,855
Wait! Why would I do something like that?

230
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:43,255
Defendant! I will hear you out later.

231
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:44,755
Please proceed.

232
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:49,355
That day, Mr. Takeuchi calls Prosecutor Kujo and tells her

233
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:51,755
to come over because he wants to tell her everything.

234
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,855
Of course, I think it was just

235
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:56,855
a bluff to assure he gets the money he was after.

236
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:04,055
Talk about way from enough.

237
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:06,155
Do you think that I get to move

238
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:09,455
a large sum such as a billion yen just like that so easily?

239
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,755
Then, write me an I.O.U.

240
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,655
What?

241
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:16,555
The prosecutor will be here in two hours.

242
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:19,355
I wonder what I should tell her.

243
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:21,855
First, the truth of the hit-and-run case.

244
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:24,555
Then the trick behind the construction fraud

245
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,755
that occurred five years ago.

246
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:29,755
That's when Mrs. Takeuchi executed her scheme.

247
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:50,155
But, Mr. Mouri,

248
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:52,655
I heard that Mr. Takeuchi jumped off

249
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:54,855
right before the eyes of the witness.

250
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,855
When Mr. Takeuchi jumped from the veranda,

251
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,755
he was wearing a suit.

252
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,055
However, the pants he was wearing were jeans.

253
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,855
That's where the secret lies.

254
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:08,755
After killing her husband,

255
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:10,955
Mrs. Takeuchi put the top of a suit on him

256
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:14,255
and rigged a wire hanger on his back.

257
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:17,555
She then carried his dead body to the veranda

258
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:20,555
and tied a rope to the tip of the wire hanger that was rigged to him.

259
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,655
The other end of the rope

260
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,455
was hooked onto the hook of the clothing pole of the ceiling

261
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:27,855
and pulled into the bedroom.

262
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:28,855
All she had to do later

263
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:31,455
was hide in the bedroom and pull the rope.

264
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,855
Then the body would be suspended from the ceiling

265
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:36,155
and looks as if it is standing on its own.

266
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:38,155
That's a lie! How can you say such things?

267
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:40,155
Defendant!

268
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,155
You will be given an opportunity to speak your mind later.

269
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:46,455
However,

270
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:49,555
even if would be possible to make the dead body stand in that situation,

271
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,955
wouldn't it be impossible to make it jump off?

272
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,455
Exactly.

273
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:57,055
In order to do so,

274
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:58,755
she would've had to not only suspend him from above,

275
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:02,455
but also pull him simultaneously from the front.

276
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:05,555
So, in order to pull the body from the front,

277
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:09,555
she used the BS antenna that is set up outside the veranda

278
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:13,255
and tied a rope around the chest of the body.

279
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:15,655
Then, she leaves the suicide note that was prepared beforehand

280
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:16,955
in the living room,

281
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:20,055
and waited for Prosecutor Kujo to come.

282
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:21,255
Hold on!

283
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:25,155
She pretended to have just come back from outside,

284
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:28,155
and went back into the room with Prosecutor Kujo.

285
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:30,555
Dear? Where are you?

286
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,755
Dear?

287
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:35,055
Dear? What're you doing there?

288
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,355
Please, don't!

289
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:43,055
Mr. Takeuchi! What're you doing?

290
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:51,555
It is most likely that because of the darkness of the veranda

291
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:53,855
and the shock of what was happening before her,

292
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,655
Ms. Kujo did not realize

293
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,155
the unnatural movements of Mr. Takeuchi,

294
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:02,155
or the suspicious way Mrs. Takeuchi was acting.

295
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:03,655
Cut out all that bull!

296
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:05,855
Where do you have such evidence?

297
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:08,555
The rope that was supposed to come off smoothly

298
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:10,855
probably got stuck to something.

299
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:15,255
Only the BS antenna of your room is bent downwards.

300
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:17,755
You can't tell when it got bent, can you?

301
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:19,255
It could've been bent before the incident.

302
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:21,555
A wire clothes hanger that was bent out of shape

303
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:24,255
was found in the closet of the bedroom.

304
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:26,655
It got bent, so I was planning on throwing it away.

305
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,655
Blood stains and hair

306
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,255
were found on the brick under the outdoor unit.

307
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:32,655
Don't be ridiculous!

308
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:35,055
I'm sure I got rid of the brick.

309
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,855
You switched it with the brick that was in the garden.

310
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:44,955
The brick that was used as the murder weapon

311
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:46,455
has already been confiscated

312
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:49,055
and is with the forensic officers right now.

313
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:50,155
Come on!

314
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:51,755
How dare you all pick on me?

315
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,655
-Order! -But...

316
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:55,755
Order! Defendant!

317
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:02,455
Court is adjourned for today.

318
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:06,255
The date of the next hearing will be decided upon discussion.

319
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:08,255
Prosecution is required to submit a petition

320
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:12,155
as to the separate murder case.

321
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,455
That will be all.

322
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,655
Hi, Ms. Kujo.

323
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,055
Thank you so much the other day.

324
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,555
I've gotten a pay-cut

325
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:51,755
and one month suspension from duty because of the case.

326
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,955
Oh, I'm sorry.

327
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:56,655
I was bawled out by my boss too.

328
00:18:56,655 --> 00:19:00,155
But, I think it's a good chance for me to relax,

329
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:02,755
since I haven't had time off for quite a while.

330
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:05,055
Then, I guess you should forget all about work

331
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:07,255
and rest to your heart's content.

332
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:08,355
Yes, I will.

333
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,055
Prosecutor Kujo, where are you going

334
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:13,455
with a suitcase like that?

335
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,155
To Tottori.

336
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,455
It's been three years since my previous boss passed away,

337
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:23,555
so I thought I'd go visit his grave.

338
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:27,455
I see. Take care.

339
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:29,155
Goodbye, then.

340
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:35,555
I'll see you in court again.

341
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:38,155
You won't beat me next time!

342
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:39,655
The same here.

343
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,155
Goodbye.

344
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:47,055
I'm glad.

345
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,555
She seems to have returned to her normal self.

346
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,555
Yes.

347
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:55,055
The Madonna of Prosecution...

348
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,955
rises again!

349
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:20,755
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:22,655
"Lift".

351
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,755
The next episode is about my sweet naive love story with Shinichi

352
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:26,655
in our intermediate school days.
