1
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,240
Let's get right down to business.

2
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:12,140
Will you show it to me?

3
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:15,140
"Masako Fukuhara (53), Yuka Fukuhara (26)" -That mysterious Buddha statue.

4
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,141
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,341
This way, please.

6
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:27,140
It's the 11-faced Kannon inside this miniature shrine.

7
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,540
And you're saying that although no one touches it,

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:33,540
it turns sideways and backwards on it's own?

9
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,541
Yes.

10
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,440
If it's true, that's really mysterious.

11
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:39,140
It's true.

12
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:44,341
And after that happens, something bad actually happens.

13
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,640
Well, let me take a look at it.

14
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:50,141
Please.

15
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:56,940
Oh, no. What shall I do?

16
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,341
Don't tell me something bad is going to happen again.

17
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:09,540
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

18
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,940
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

19
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,740
The image of the Buddhist statue that turns it's back on it's own

20
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,940
causes a very queer case.

21
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:17,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:22,041
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:07,513
"A Mysterious Prophetic Statue of Buddha"

25
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:20,012
There's nothing strange about it.

26
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:23,412
There's nothing to worry about.

27
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:27,413
If something does happen, I'll be here this time.

28
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,712
I don't want to see your face!

29
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:36,813
Get out of here!

30
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,912
"Eizen Fukuhara (23)" -All you ever do is play around everyday

31
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:44,212
without even working.

32
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:47,012
"Eikyo Fukuhara (56)" -And now you're stealing like a thief?

33
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:48,212
How wretched!

34
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,112
I just borrowed it!

35
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:53,212
Either way, it's easy money that you got from the temple supporters, right?

36
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,012
You don't have to act so big shot.

37
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:57,812
If you borrowed it, give it back!

38
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,712
So long as I give it back, right?

39
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:02,313
I don't want to see your face either.

40
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,413
That fool...

41
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:16,012
I'm sorry that you had to see that shameful sight.

42
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:18,012
They are my father and younger brother.

43
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:21,712
He mentioned that your brother was playing around everyday?

44
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:24,112
He went to head temple

45
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:26,512
so that he could take over for father,

46
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:29,812
but he came back in less than a month.

47
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:33,812
After that he didn't go back to school or work

48
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:36,713
and all he does is play around with bad friends.

49
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:46,012
"Junkoh Wakuda (28)" -He's undergoing ascetic practices here.

50
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:47,413
His name is Junkoh.

51
00:04:56,913 --> 00:05:00,212
Junkoh. This is Detective Mouri, Ran

52
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:04,712
and Conan who came from Tokyo.

53
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:06,113
How do you do?

54
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:09,412
I'm Junkoh.

55
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:11,712
Welcome.

56
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:16,612
Junkoh, we just looked and the Kannon statue was facing backwards.

57
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,913
I hope nothing bad happens.

58
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:21,813
I sure hope so.

59
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:32,312
I'm sorry that I'm drinking before the head priest.

60
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:35,712
Father will eat alone, after he finishes chanting the sutras,

61
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:37,713
so please make yourself at home.

62
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:43,412
You cook too, Junkoh?

63
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:46,212
That's part of training too.

64
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:50,312
Junkoh is a much better cook than I am.

65
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:51,712
What's this?

66
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:53,913
That's nothing to brag about.

67
00:05:56,613 --> 00:06:01,512
Oh, Father, this is Mr. Mouri who has come from Tokyo.

68
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:04,912
He's going to investigate the 11-faced Kannon.

69
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:08,312
The Buddha letting the living know

70
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:11,012
that something bad is going to be happening.

71
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:14,112
It's not something that a detective can handle.

72
00:06:14,113 --> 00:06:16,412
You'd better hurry on and leave.

73
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:19,412
Yuka, Junkoh,

74
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,913
your weddings are going to be held in September.

75
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,912
I'm going to say my nightly sutra.

76
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:31,312
Let me go with you, then.

77
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:32,612
It's fine.

78
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:35,313
Discuss the wedding or whatever with Yuka.

79
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:38,812
Come...

80
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:41,312
Ran and Conan, eat your dinner.

81
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:42,912
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:46,313
He's not a bad person but he's stubborn.

83
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,713
This is delicious!

84
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:57,112
Our temple supporter gave this to us.

85
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:58,812
Please help yourself to it, Conan.

86
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,012
Thank you.

87
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,812
How about you, Ran?

88
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:06,212
I don't want to eat at this time because I'll get fat.

89
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,712
That's how girls your age are.

90
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:11,313
I used to be that way too, when I was young.

91
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:18,412
Don't you have to feed it, mother?

92
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,212
I'll go later

93
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:22,712
because we have guests tonight.

94
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:24,712
Do you have a pet?

95
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,812
No.

96
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,912
But you'll find out when you come with me later.

97
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:32,412
I wonder what it is?

98
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:37,513
What is the bad thing that the Buddha told you about?

99
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,212
Last year, a person, who went to pick edible plants in the mountains,

100
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:43,112
was attacked by a bear.

101
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:46,812
Yes, although his life was spared.

102
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,812
They were saying that when the bear got out of hibernation,

103
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:52,812
there was still snow left and it probably couldn't find food.

104
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:57,312
Before that, we were all relieved that the typhoon went by,

105
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,912
but there was a landslide and a house collapsed.

106
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,613
You mean that statue had it's back turned both times?

107
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:12,012
I guess I'll go get your mattresses ready for you then.

108
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,812
Dad, why don't you stop drinking already

109
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:16,612
and eat dinner?

110
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:19,412
Don't worry, why don't you watch TV or something?

111
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,112
Come to think of it, Father sure is late.

112
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:24,912
Maybe he's praying with all his might

113
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:28,213
for the happiness of both of you?

114
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,513
Dad.

115
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:37,712
Come on, it's bath time.

116
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:38,913
What're you going to do?

117
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,312
I guess no bath for me tonight.

118
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,312
That's why I told you not to drink so much.

119
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:48,112
The priest is still chanting his sutra.

120
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,813
How embarrassing.

121
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:54,613
What?

122
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,712
Everybody stay back.

123
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:10,913
Pops!

124
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:18,912
It's not long since he's been stabbed.

125
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:20,912
Only a few minutes have passed.

126
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,612
Ran, call the police.

127
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:24,613
Okay.

128
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,713
There are no signs of struggle.

129
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:34,013
Pops!

130
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:36,612
This...

131
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:38,613
It looks to have been moved recently.

132
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,213
What's this scratch?

133
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,512
"Officer Shimokawa (48), Officer Hayashi (32)" -Which means,

134
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:07,412
after the priest came here to chant the sutra,

135
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:10,312
you were all together right through?

136
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:13,312
Yes, until the 8 pm bell rang,

137
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,012
we were all together.

138
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:20,212
It's probably the doings of someone who came from outside.

139
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:24,512
We had the forensics check the doors and windows in front

140
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:28,712
but there are no traces of anyone having come in from outside.

141
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,712
I see.

142
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,512
Well, if a stranger had come in,

143
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,312
the priest wouldn't continue chanting the sutra

144
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:38,512
without doing anything about it.

145
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,512
Inside that golden chandelier like thing,

146
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:43,312
there's something stuck to it.

147
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:44,812
I'm telling you,

148
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:47,913
stop getting in the way of investigation!

149
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:51,012
It's cellophane tape.

150
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:53,913
It was on the inside of the canopy on the left side.

151
00:10:56,313 --> 00:10:57,812
Who are you?

152
00:10:57,813 --> 00:11:01,013
What're you guys? What're you doing at my house?

153
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:04,112
Tell me your name.

154
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,612
I'm the son of the owner of this house.

155
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:07,912
Eizen!

156
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:10,212
What's up? A robbery or something?

157
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:13,513
Father's...

158
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,612
What's going on?

159
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:24,712
Your father has been murdered by someone.

160
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:28,012
Where were you until now, Eizen?

161
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:29,812
I was with my friends.

162
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,912
Who the heck are you anyway?

163
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:35,212
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

164
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:38,612
Could you give us the name of your friend?

165
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:41,212
Why do I have to tell you?

166
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:44,612
You were scolded by your father this afternoon, weren't you?

167
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,312
He told you to give back the money,

168
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:49,512
and you shouted back that you would, then left.

169
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:51,212
If you can't return the money,

170
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:55,212
that would be a motive for you to kill your father.

171
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,712
You got to be kidding.

172
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:59,512
It's true that I borrowed money but just a measly 300,000 yen!

173
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:03,112
Do you think I'd kill somebody for such chicken feed!

174
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,912
And, what's your friend's name?

175
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:09,012
Manami Sakurai. She's a hostess for a shop called Romance.

176
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:12,112
Debt's built up after I kept going there for sometime

177
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:13,612
so I borrowed some money from the reception hall in the temple

178
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:15,412
that was supposed to be used for repairs.

179
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:19,412
The cellophane tape was on the left of the canopy.

180
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:20,813
And on that side...

181
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,112
What was that?

182
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,112
What's wrong, Conan?

183
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:33,412
An animal fled just now.

184
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:35,512
That's a tanuki (Japanese racoon dog).

185
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,312
I told you a while ago, right?

186
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:41,012
Mother feeds it so it comes around at night.

187
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:42,212
Really?

188
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:44,112
It seems to be living in the thicket in back of the mountain

189
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:46,813
around the road that leads to the waterfall.

190
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:00,012
What a surprise that was!

191
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,612
It surprised you, didn't it?

192
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,512
It's an automatic bell hammer.

193
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:05,813
Father and Junkoh...

194
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:13,513
go off to see the temple supporters sometimes.

195
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:40,713
This is...

196
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:50,037
Yes, thank you.

197
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,737
If you will excuse me.

198
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:54,137
It has been confirmed that Eizen

199
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:57,237
had been at a shop called Romance until 30 minutes ago.

200
00:13:57,238 --> 00:14:00,837
See, I told you. I got an alibi.

201
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:03,537
How dare you suspect me.

202
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:06,037
Pops. Take a look at this.

203
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:09,337
This was found near the tanuki's den.

204
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,837
What is it at a busy time like this?

205
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:14,237
Conan, don't get in their way.

206
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:17,437
But, it's important.

207
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:18,538
Please come with me.

208
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:26,238
The tanuki got it's food every night at this bell tower.

209
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:29,537
So what?

210
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:33,237
This bell is hammered automatically.

211
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:37,237
The bell rang when we were in the dining room too, right?

212
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:39,237
So, what?

213
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:41,937
I think the tanuki found this salami here

214
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:44,137
and took it back to it's den.

215
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:45,637
Here?

216
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:49,037
I see, so that's what it was...

217
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,037
The one who killed Eikyo

218
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:54,537
didn't come to the main building at all.

219
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:58,337
So, in this case, the alibi is meaningless.

220
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:02,338
Eizen, you could've committed the crime too.

221
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,537
Just what do you mean?

222
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,437
Let me explain.

223
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:10,637
The salami was placed on this side of the chain,

224
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:13,737
in other words, on the side where the wooden hammer move when it rung

225
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:15,638
and pulled the string through the hole of the chain.

226
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:19,037
Then, the string was stretched over to the window

227
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:22,437
all the way into the main building of the temple.

228
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,137
After that, the tip of the string was pulled through the space

229
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:26,637
in the canopy and into the main building.

230
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:30,437
The tip string was pasted onto the knife using cellophane tape.

231
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:34,637
When the time came and the hammer is pushed forward,

232
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:37,337
the string that are connected to the knife is pulled

233
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:39,638
and the knife falls.

234
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:48,037
After that, the tanuki takes the salami back to it's den

235
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:50,838
without leaving a single trace of the trick behind.

236
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:53,138
By this method,

237
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:56,837
the perpetrator didn't have to be here to kill Eikyo.

238
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:59,537
Therefore, everybody who was at this temple back then,

239
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:03,737
including Eizen is a suspect.

240
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:06,637
Right, he's right.

241
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,337
However...

242
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:12,737
However, the one who killed Eikyo...

243
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,537
is none other than you,

244
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:15,838
Junkoh!

245
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:20,337
What makes you so sure?

246
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:22,137
The one who could've done this

247
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:24,537
has constant access to the main temple building,

248
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,137
like preparing books for sutras giving offerings.

249
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:29,738
Therefore, no one else except Junkoh.

250
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:34,037
I did it!

251
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:36,937
I did it exactly as Mr. Mouri had explained.

252
00:16:36,938 --> 00:16:39,737
Darn it! Why'd you kill Father?

253
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:44,337
The fact is I have a fiancee.

254
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:49,037
But, the priest insisted that I marry Yuka.

255
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:51,837
At first I was hesitant to answer

256
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:53,937
but thinking of all the things he did for me,

257
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,837
I just couldn't make myself refuse the offer.

258
00:16:55,838 --> 00:17:00,837
So in time, the priest believed that I had approved

259
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:04,137
and even planned the wedding date...

260
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:06,837
Then, this was all because of me.

261
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:09,637
All because I didn't reject what Father said.

262
00:17:09,638 --> 00:17:14,237
I sort of had an idea of how Junkoh felt.

263
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:18,037
But I didn't want to get Father angry so...

264
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,437
You should've just said no!

265
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:21,837
Even if the old man got angry,

266
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,337
all you had to do was leave this temple!

267
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:27,037
I had no intention of wanting to kill him.

268
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,637
I just wanted to scare him

269
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:32,337
and tell him that bad things happen in this temple,

270
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:35,938
so I would like to quit training here.

271
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:45,737
So I made the Kannon statue inside the miniature shrine turn it's back

272
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:49,237
and moved the desk slightly to the side

273
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:52,038
so that the knife wouldn't touch his body when it came falling.

274
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:56,537
Excuse me.

275
00:17:56,538 --> 00:17:59,237
Pops Kogoro told me to tell you.

276
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:00,837
Detective Mouri?

277
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:02,837
He said that he wants you to try dropping a knife

278
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:06,437
from the same height as where the cellophane tape was.

279
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:09,237
I guess I've got to do it

280
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,338
if it's a request from Detective Mouri.

281
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:16,438
Here goes!

282
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:21,237
I thought so...

283
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:24,038
It's impossible to kill him with this trick.

284
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:33,337
Forensic officer, is this white powder from taking fingerprints?

285
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,837
No, it's not.

286
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:37,538
It's plain rice powder.

287
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:48,837
Junkoh, we'll hear the rest of your story at the station.

288
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:50,837
Junkoh.

289
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:55,137
Were you the one who moved the Kannon all this time?

290
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:59,538
No, the only time I turned it backwards was today.

291
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:09,338
Please wait.

292
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:15,237
It's most likely that Junkoh used that trick to try

293
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,137
and scare Eikyo.

294
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:20,237
However, he's not the one who killed Eikyo.

295
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:21,937
What?

296
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:26,037
Rather, it's impossible to kill someone using that method.

297
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,537
Even if he were hit, at most, he would only end up hurt.

298
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:32,337
So, who is the actual killer?

299
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,738
That's you, his wife, Masako, correct?

300
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,537
You saw Junkoh setting up the trick, didn't you?

301
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:45,437
So you tried to frame him for the murder.

302
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:48,637
Just what do you think you're saying, detective?

303
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:50,837
By the corpse on the side of the desk,

304
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:53,937
some rice powder was found.

305
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:55,137
After dinner,

306
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:59,537
the only ones who ate sweet mochi rice were you and Conan.

307
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:02,837
If it were before the victim started chanting the sutra,

308
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,737
he would've wiped it off.

309
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,637
In other words, the perpetrator is the only one

310
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,538
who could've left the powder there!

311
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,437
That's right.

312
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:15,637
I was fed up already!

313
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:19,037
I didn't even want to see his face!

314
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,938
That's why I killed him.

315
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:52,537
He shouts when things don't go his way.

316
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:55,537
He has to have a say in the littlest things.

317
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:57,838
He complains as if he's some big shot.

318
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:01,737
He thinks his children and I are his slaves

319
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,538
and tries to take complete control over us.

320
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,138
I'm so glad he's gone, good riddance!

321
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:15,837
Mother.

322
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,138
Mom.

323
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:45,637
I'm sorry to have gotten you messed up in all this.

324
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:49,137
Rather, I'm more worried about you.

325
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:53,237
We couldn't solve the mystery of the statue that faces backwards

326
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,237
so we weren't of much help.

327
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:58,238
I knew about it from the start.

328
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:00,637
What?

329
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:03,237
You said that it would always turn backwards

330
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:06,637
after a heavy rain or when there's a lot of water after snow melts, right?

331
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:10,637
It happens when the water of the waterfall in the backyard increases

332
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,237
and the low frequency sound wave,

333
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:14,737
resonates with the air in the miniature shrine

334
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:17,538
making the statue turn little by little.

335
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:20,537
Is that so?

336
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:24,337
You really know odd things, don't you?

337
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:26,437
I called Shinichi

338
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,537
and he told me what to say.

339
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:32,137
Why won't Shinichi just come here

340
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:35,038
and solve the case instead of calling?

341
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:39,238
I am solving the case.

342
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:44,637
"Next Episode" -This is our lab.

343
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:45,837
I see.

344
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:48,837
This is my robot.

345
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:51,438
God knows why he made something like that.

346
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:54,837
Who looks most suspicious?

347
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:57,538
I think it's Mr. Tanizaki.

348
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:04,037
Isshiki, turn off the main gas switch.

349
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:05,637
Horiuchi, call the ambulance.

350
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:07,137
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

351
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:12,538
