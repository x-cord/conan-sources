1
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:13,942
Beware of fire!

2
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:17,996
happy new year!

3
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:21,696
On behalf of the Conan family,

4
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:25,896
I would like to thank you the viewers out there

5
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:28,696
from the bottom of our hearts for your support,

6
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:32,496
which has enabled us to make it to 2016.

7
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:37,196
This year also marks the 20th anniversary

8
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:40,996
since the first airing of Detective Conan.

9
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,596
As a token of our appreciation for these 20 years,

10
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:47,296
we have prepared many special plans.

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,696
Our first,

12
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:54,096
is bringing you one-hour specials over a period of two weeks!

13
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:58,096
We're sure that you'll enjoy both part one and part two.

14
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:00,296
Most appropriate for this program,

15
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:05,697
a super duper fantastic special guest is here.

16
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:12,096
I am Ebizo Ichikawa.

17
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:16,696
"Ebizo Ichikawa XI"

18
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:22,196
And now, for the first part of our two-part New Year Special,

19
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:27,996
which we present to you

20
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:34,997
for your enjoyment.

21
00:01:40,497 --> 00:01:42,196
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

22
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:44,296
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

23
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:46,096
In the gorgeous world of Kabuki,

24
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:48,296
the legendary mask attracts a case.

25
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:49,896
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:51,696
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:53,897
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:35,962
"Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery (Part 1)"

29
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:39,161
Over here, Mitsuhiko!

30
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:40,461
There!

31
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:42,061
Hey!

32
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:43,661
Watch where you kick the ball!

33
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:45,261
You darn!

34
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:48,661
What? That was my best shot today!

35
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,861
You're supposed to pass! -What are you doing?

36
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:54,761
I wonder why boys love to play with balls so much.

37
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:55,862
Beats me.

38
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,361
Mitsuhiko! No trap! Volley!

39
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:04,962
Here goes!

40
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:14,462
You never fail to amuse me.

41
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,061
Brake oil.

42
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:28,862
There's a railroad crossing up ahead!

43
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,761
Contact them!

44
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:34,262
Yeah.

45
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:45,162
Idiot!

46
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:51,262
Oh, no.

47
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:29,762
"Toto Paper Recycling Plant"

48
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:45,661
The brakes have apparently been rigged.

49
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,461
"Takuya Hosoo (47)" -I understand,

50
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,061
"HO Trading President" -but I'm busy today.

51
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:55,261
Let's go to the station so we can hear you out, shall we?

52
00:05:55,262 --> 00:06:00,161
I'm sorry, but I really don't have the time.

53
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:02,362
May I open the trunk?

54
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:07,661
-Hey, brat! -Conan!

55
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:11,861
Why the heck!

56
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:15,061
I'm so sorry that something like this happened

57
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,061
all because I wasn't watching.

58
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:19,561
I'm always telling him to live his life

59
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:22,861
without causing trouble to others,

60
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:26,161
but he doesn't listen, you see. This brat...

61
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:30,661
I mean, this boy. Please forgive him.

62
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,461
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

63
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,161
He dashed out to the street on his skateboard,

64
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,061
that's why the car got into an accident, right?

65
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:43,361
No. This boy stopped my car that went berserk.

66
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,361
Is that so?

67
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:48,961
But Sonoko told me she happened to be watching,

68
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:51,261
so she called me.

69
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,561
Sonoko! Where are you, Sonoko?

70
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:57,761
The car was in fact rigged so that the brakes wouldn't work.

71
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:01,061
What? That's attempted murder.

72
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,861
We've got to preserve the crime site

73
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:04,561
and call forensics immediately.

74
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:07,161
We're doing that now.

75
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:08,961
Oh, I see!

76
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,961
Sonoko!

77
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:13,661
Brat! You did it!

78
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:16,861
Jumping to conclusions again.

79
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:20,261
Well, right after he dashed out,

80
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,761
I heard the crash.

81
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:25,561
So I thought he finally showed his true self.

82
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,861
I wonder how she sees me.

83
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:31,161
You're President Suzuki's daughter?

84
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:32,561
Mr. Hosoo?

85
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,061
You know each other?

86
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,661
My dad's a great fan of Kabuki,

87
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:40,161
so I've met him many times at the closing party after the show.

88
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,561
He's from the world of Kabuki?

89
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,561
You don't look to have any connection with the world of Kabuki.

90
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:50,361
I've had meals with Ebizo several times for that matter, you know?

91
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:51,861
-No joke. -Together?

92
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:54,861
Ebizo? Is that sushi shop good?

93
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:55,862
Talk about ignorant.

94
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:57,461
What're you talking about, Dad?

95
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:59,961
She's talking about Mr. Ebizo Ichikawa.

96
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:02,461
The Sushi Shop is in Ichikawa?

97
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:05,262
Pops Kogoro, cut it out already.

98
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,661
Pops Kogoro?

99
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,761
Are you by chance, Mr. Kogoro Mouri,

100
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,261
the great detective?

101
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:17,061
Yes. I am the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

102
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:18,361
Can I be of help?

103
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:19,661
What a coincidence.

104
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:23,561
Ebizo actually is a great fan of yours, Mr. Mouri.

105
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,161
Is that so?

106
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:27,361
But you see,

107
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:30,862
I've never been to that Sushi Shop.

108
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:39,261
The brakes?

109
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:42,261
It wasn't broken?

110
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:45,161
The police are investigating it now.

111
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:48,661
I'll probably have to go over later too.

112
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,061
But I've got to deliver this first.

113
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,561
"Hitoshi Takahashi (40), Hosoo's secretary" -You were the last one

114
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:56,361
-in the garage last night, weren't you? -Yes.

115
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:59,361
Didn't you notice anything strange back then?

116
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:01,161
Like what?

117
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:05,161
Like seeing a suspicious character and such.

118
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:08,362
No, I would've noticed if there were.

119
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:12,062
"There is no performance today"

120
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,261
"Yoshiyuki Yabusaki (57), President"

121
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:36,061
Mr. Hosoo, I've been waiting for you.

122
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:38,661
I've brought an acquaintance along with me.

123
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,261
I hope you don't mind.

124
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:41,861
Sure, of course.

125
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,561
I'm Yabusaki, the president.

126
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:46,461
Hi. Nice meeting you.

127
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:49,061
The president... You mean of a bank?

128
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:51,961
In the world of Kabuki,

129
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:55,261
the person who manages all the actors is called the president.

130
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,161
Wow, little lady knows a lot.

131
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:01,561
-This seems a bit off. -All right.

132
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:04,961
I need to do a voice check.

133
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:08,061
Everyone's gathered here.

134
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:12,062
Oh, how joyous!

135
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,761
Ebizo!

136
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:20,161
What's this performance called?

137
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,761
-Kabuki Juhachiban Nanatsunomen (Seven Masks). -Is the lighting too bright?

138
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,961
-I think it's good. -Seven Masks?

139
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:28,461
In 1742,

140
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,661
Ebizo the Second performed in,

141
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:33,961
but it wasn't shown to the public much.

142
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:35,861
What kind of story is it?

143
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:39,861
In recent years, it was performed in 1893 and 1983.

144
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,261
And seven years ago,

145
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:43,761
Ebizo himself performed it, you see.

146
00:10:43,762 --> 00:10:46,261
The setting is at General Major Yoshida's residence.

147
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:49,361
The mask maker Akaemon Gagoze.

148
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:51,461
That's Ebizo's role, by the way,

149
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,761
is being awaited by Princess Sakura.

150
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:54,861
Who's Princess Sakura?

151
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,561
Before that, who's Akaemon?

152
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,461
Akaemon arrives and...

153
00:10:58,462 --> 00:10:59,561
Answer me.

154
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:01,361
He takes the masks out of the five boxes,

155
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:03,561
and dances a dance that corresponds to each mask.

156
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,061
The five masks?

157
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:07,261
What? Oh, found it.

158
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:09,761
The old man, (Shiofuki) the clown,

159
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:11,561
(Hannya) female demon, (Uba) the old woman,

160
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:13,461
and lastly, (Buaku) looks like a man from India.

161
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:15,061
These all symbolize evil.

162
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,961
And, the Kumehira... Whatever.

163
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:19,161
In any case, he's the enemy.

164
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:22,161
When that guy goes in to steal the family heirloom,

165
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:25,061
Akaemon who is wearing the mask of Buaku appears.

166
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:27,361
Whatever saemon is surprised

167
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:30,861
and the box with the masks closes and doesn't open.

168
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,761
That's what's written there, right?

169
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:34,761
Shut up, kid.

170
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,061
At any rate, it's an incredible play, right?

171
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:40,261
If it's called Seven Masks, why are there only five boxes?

172
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,761
Yes, I wish you'd be quiet too, Pops!

173
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:45,561
Seven Masks is a difficult play.

174
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:47,161
Difficult?

175
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:49,461
Yes. I heard that the only script left

176
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:52,261
was burned in the Edo Era.

177
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:55,361
"Seven Masks" -There were no such things as copy machines back

178
00:11:55,362 --> 00:11:58,161
and neither are there any handwritten copies left.

179
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:01,461
Which means the story that exists today is...

180
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:04,561
It's what's been handed down by word of mouth,

181
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:06,761
so it's probably a bit different from the original.

182
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:08,961
Who cares, so long as it's good.

183
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,761
It's not like anybody saw the first performance, right?

184
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:14,061
I mean it was the Edo period, you know.

185
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:18,561
That's why Ebizo decided to create a modern version of the Seven Masks.

186
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,662
And I'm really putting my all into it.

187
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:26,161
My god. I won't bite you.

188
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,461
Mr. Hosoo, I've been waiting for you.

189
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:30,761
Ebizo! I'm Sonoko!

190
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:32,961
Sonoko... Which one?

191
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:36,961
Sonoko Suzuki.

192
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:39,661
Oh, yeah.

193
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:41,961
No way.

194
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,061
I'm sorry, I'm late.

195
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,261
Here it is.

196
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:46,461
-Ebizo... -Let's go over there.

197
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:48,661
-Will you all come too, then? -Sonoko.

198
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:49,861
This is it?

199
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:51,161
The two-faced mask.

200
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:52,562
The genuine?

201
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:56,061
Gets me nervous.

202
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:57,661
Who will open it?

203
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:59,661
Of course, who else

204
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,462
"Shinnosuke Iwami (29), Playwright" -but you, Ebizo.

205
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,761
"Eiji Kaneko (37), Cameraman" -Hold it. I want to change the angle.

206
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:09,761
Hey, be careful.

207
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:11,661
Yes.

208
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:13,062
I'll open it.

209
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:20,261
This is...

210
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:21,861
It's very beautiful.

211
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:23,262
It's a miracle.

212
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:27,562
Beautiful.

213
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:36,062
This angle.

214
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:42,962
This two-faced mask is...

215
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:50,536
Depending on what angle you look at it from,

216
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:53,335
its facial expression changes.

217
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,735
It sure is fantastic.

218
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,835
This mask was made in the Kamakura Era,

219
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,235
but it's unknown who made it.

220
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:02,835
However, it was found that this was created

221
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:05,135
with the exact same lumber that was used

222
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:09,035
during the reconstruction of the Great Buddhist Hall in Todaji Temple

223
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:11,935
between 1185 to 1195.

224
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,135
In other words,

225
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:15,635
it was made from the wood that was left over

226
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:18,135
after making the Great Buddhist Hall.

227
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:20,335
So wood has DNA.

228
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:24,635
The president bought back what had crossed over to a collector abroad.

229
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:27,335
How... how much did you buy it for?

230
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,635
Billions.

231
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,335
Takahashi!

232
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,335
Who cares about the price?

233
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:36,335
Japanese cultural assets going overseas is a problem.

234
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:40,535
Mr. Hosoo showed me the two-faced mask some time ago,

235
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:43,935
so I decided to use it in my play this time.

236
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:48,035
The program is Kabuki Juhachiban The Seven Masks, right?

237
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:52,035
Ebizo, why did you decide to do the Seven Masks?

238
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:53,435
Conan!

239
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,935
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,535
I'm Ran Mouri.

241
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:01,335
Trying to get him to get to know you!

242
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:03,535
Quiet, Dad!

243
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,835
Conan? Ran Mouri?

244
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:09,735
Dad?

245
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:13,935
Which means, you must be Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

246
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:17,135
I brought him here because I heard that you were a big fan of his.

247
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:19,735
I'm delighted!

248
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:21,435
Why...

249
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:25,635
It's hard to believe that Ebizo is a fan of Pops.

250
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,535
There...

251
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:31,235
I'm a super mystery fan.

252
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,935
When I went to perform in London,

253
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:36,135
I went to Baker Street every chance I had.

254
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,535
I've always respected and admired

255
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:42,335
the deductive skills of the Sleeping Kogoro.

256
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:45,935
Yes. All the admiration is quite a problem, you see.

257
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:48,735
Pops, your Japanese doesn't sound right.

258
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:50,735
Conan.

259
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:53,435
-I know about you too. -Yes?

260
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:57,636
I remember clearly when you beat Thief Kid!

261
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:02,035
I'm sure you'll be a great detective in the future too.

262
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:05,235
Wow! I hope so.

263
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:07,035
About your question a while ago...

264
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:09,735
Of why I chose the Seven Masks.

265
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:10,835
Yes.

266
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:14,335
People possess many aspects, don't they?

267
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:20,335
I want to express kindness, anger, envy and so forth.

268
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,835
In other words, I guess the mystery human beings.

269
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:25,235
That's wonderful.

270
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:27,935
We'll be going over to the practice hall now.

271
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:31,335
Mr. Mouri, would all of you like to come too?

272
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:33,935
We'd like to excuse ourselves.

273
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:35,635
We'd really love to.

274
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:38,835
Okay...

275
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:42,236
Ran, he's going to faint.

276
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,336
Interesting!

277
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:54,836
Let me take this, then.

278
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:58,635
Is the practice hall in another building?

279
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:02,136
No, it's in this Kabukiza on the upper floor.

280
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:04,736
It's here.

281
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,035
"Practice Hall"

282
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:08,835
The floor is sparkling.

283
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:11,535
-Good morning. -Good morning...

284
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:14,435
I'm going to go put this in the locker.

285
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:16,136
Yeah, thanks.

286
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:23,536
-Good morning. -Good morning.

287
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:34,035
Are there guests over today?

288
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,035
It's the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

289
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:40,135
Kogoro Mouri, you mean the Sleeping Kogoro?

290
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:42,535
What brings the great detective here?

291
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:44,235
Was there a murder?

292
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:47,336
Cut it out. He's just here to watch.

293
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,835
Turn towards me, then stand up.

294
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,935
Yes, sir. Do I say my lines after that?

295
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:55,835
Yeah, after you've braced yourself standing up.

296
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:57,835
And this line here.

297
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:00,135
I'd like you to threaten me a bit more.

298
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:02,135
You were kind just now, weren't you?

299
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,735
Yes, sir. I'll think about it.

300
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:09,135
Does the story of Kabuki keep getting newer?

301
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:11,635
Do you know the star system?

302
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:13,035
The most important thing in Kabuki

303
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:16,035
is to bring out the actor's skill and attractiveness

304
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:19,035
to make it a true Ebizo performance.

305
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:22,035
We work on the script and performance together too.

306
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:24,235
So, everything is always new.

307
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,835
Brand new.

308
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:27,235
Of course, it's done by

309
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,535
maintaining the traditional ways of the Ichikawa school.

310
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:31,036
President.

311
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:36,235
Don't get in the way of the actors.

312
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:38,336
I'm no amateur.

313
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:43,735
Hey... It's too late for that.

314
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,035
I'm already this involved.

315
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:48,635
Don't be stingy and tell me.

316
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:51,335
Oh, boy. Like always,

317
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:54,135
it's not for me to decide.

318
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,135
Is it Mr. Mouri?

319
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,235
Megure here.

320
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,035
In... Inspector!

321
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,235
I just got it from forensics.

322
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:04,535
There were several prints found in the car.

323
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:06,335
-Are you sure it's okay? -Shouldn't I?

324
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:09,336
No, please go on ahead.

325
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,835
So the brake hose was...

326
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,035
If it was deliberately tampered with,

327
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:17,835
it was to commit murder.

328
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:20,535
It's most natural to think so.

329
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,435
I'd like to check the garage of his residence.

330
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:25,435
If you're with him, please bring him over.

331
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,236
Roger, boss.

332
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:31,835
Mr. Hosoo. I was contacted by the police.

333
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,235
And they told me they'd like to talk to you at your residence.

334
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,535
-Hurry, to the hospital! -Are you all right?

335
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,835
Iwami? What's the matter?

336
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,835
He suddenly started suffering.

337
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,935
Anyway, we'll rush him over to the hospital.

338
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:45,735
Good. Takahashi, take our car.

339
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:46,736
Yes, sir.

340
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:49,535
Maybe it was too much of a burden for Iwami.

341
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:53,135
He may be an up-and coming playwright,

342
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:57,336
but it's impossible for him to rewrite a new Kabuki version of Seven Masks.

343
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:01,335
I'm the one who chose Iwami.

344
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:05,035
I believe in his gift.

345
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:08,335
I see. I'm sorry.

346
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:10,935
As you can see, let's call it a day.

347
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:11,936
-Yes, sir. -Yes.

348
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:13,235
-Good work. -Have a nice day.

349
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:15,135
Conan.

350
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:17,136
Did you become interested in Kabuki?

351
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:20,635
Yes, I'm really interested.

352
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,335
Won't you like to come again, Conan?

353
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,335
Yes, I'd like to come again.

354
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:26,436
Is it okay, Ebizo?

355
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,135
Sure.

356
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:31,836
Come over again.

357
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:37,635
He is indeed Ebizo the 11th.

358
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,636
He's in a class of his own.

359
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:47,236
I was at the office last night

360
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:50,635
finished talking over arrangements and went home.

361
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:52,935
Did you ride the same car, back then?

362
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:56,336
Yes, my secretary Takahashi drove, though.

363
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:08,135
I'll stop over at Ebizo's before going to work tomorrow.

364
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:11,935
So, use the van, will you?

365
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,835
Okay.

366
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:16,135
Whenever I go home by car,

367
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:19,635
it's Takahashi's job to clean the interior and then leave.

368
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:22,735
How long did Mr. Takahashi stay after that?

369
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:24,635
I was in my study,

370
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:27,235
so I have no idea when Takahashi left.

371
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,135
No goodbyes?

372
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:30,635
How about the security camera?

373
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:34,435
The camera over there shows this place.

374
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:37,335
-Everything's recorded? -Of course.

375
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:39,135
May we take a look at it?

376
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:40,936
Please come this way.

377
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:43,235
It's saved on the hard disk,

378
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:46,535
so there are 72 hours left on all 10 cameras.

379
00:21:46,536 --> 00:21:48,035
Conan.

380
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:51,335
Let's go home because we should keep out of the way.

381
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,836
I thought so.

382
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:59,435
This is sure a gorgeous house.

383
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:00,835
I'd like to live in it.

384
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:03,635
Cleaning up will be hassle, Ran.

385
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:04,735
Right.

386
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:07,836
I know nobody'll be around to help me anyway.

387
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:15,335
A convenience store.

388
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:17,535
If over there...

389
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,835
If I were to live there,

390
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:21,335
I would need a maid to help me clean.

391
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:23,536
You're still thinking about it?

392
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:30,135
Hello? Yes, I'm awake.

393
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:33,735
You called because you thought I was, right?

394
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,335
Yes. I got it.

395
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:38,035
I'll check on it for you.

396
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:41,735
I'll be fine. I got ways to do it.

397
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,935
Stop bugging me.

398
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:46,835
Don't you want the information?

399
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:48,535
I've already done that.

400
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,836
What about the cameraman?

401
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:54,435
Okay.

402
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:57,735
Got it. The playwright too.

403
00:22:57,736 --> 00:23:00,035
I'll send it to your smartphone by morning.

404
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:01,935
Just what're you talking about?

405
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:03,735
I'm not interested.

406
00:23:03,736 --> 00:23:05,536
Yes, goodnight.

407
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:09,536
"Ebizo"

408
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:13,136
What shall I wear?

409
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:19,835
Good morning.

410
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:23,435
President, good morning.

411
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,636
You're early.

412
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:27,835
We've got practice from morning today,

413
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:30,935
so I've got a lot to do before the props come in.

414
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:33,535
Pretty tough day then.

415
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:35,035
What the...

416
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:37,536
What... what's wrong?

417
00:23:38,536 --> 00:23:39,735
It's gone!

418
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:44,336
The two-faced mask that I left in here is gone!
