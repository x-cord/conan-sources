1
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:03,813
Hello?

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:07,812
Thanks for today. Yeah.

3
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:12,962
Yeah, that's right. I only went because I was told they were all hot doctors.

4
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:16,073
But it was like, where are all the hot guys?

5
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:19,772
What? Oh, sorry.

6
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:21,543
I can't. I'm busy doing something else tomorrow.

7
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:24,622
No, it's not like that.

8
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:26,772
Yeah, something like that.

9
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,282
Yeah. I'll call you later.

10
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:31,233
Good night.

11
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:08,583
Man, what was up with today's game?

12
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:13,593
Seriously. Why'd they get so many hits off during the final inning?

13
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:19,592
There was that, too, but why'd they have him pinch hit at the very end?

14
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:20,993
Oh, that?

15
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,343
Hey, there's something lying on the ground.

16
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:28,583
Hey, miss! If you sleep out here, you'll catch a co—

17
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:31,573
Sh-She's dead!

18
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:46,702
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

19
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:48,662
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

20
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,122
The witness is a shut-in!

21
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:52,202
What is the truth they won't reveal? Why can't they leave their home?

22
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:53,782
Always determining the one truth

23
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,372
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

24
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:58,063
his name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:32,583
"The Wordless Witness!"

26
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:42,202
The murder victim is Shinozaki Himeno-san, 26 years old,

27
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:45,063
a domestic helper who lived in the area.

28
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:49,032
According to the friend she was speaking with on the phone before her death,

29
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:52,703
the victim was coming home late after a mixer.

30
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:55,892
We believe the weapon was a hard rod-like object,

31
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:58,073
but we still haven't identified it.

32
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,663
Another random attack?

33
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:05,723
C-Conan-kun? Mori-san and Ran-san, too?

34
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,723
You already got wind of the case?

35
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:13,983
They say every detective has his case.

36
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:22,992
I believe there were two similar incidents in this area last week.

37
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:28,453
Yes. Young women dressed in flashy clothes are being struck over the head at night

38
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,232
with the same rod-like weapon used in this case.

39
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:34,083
It's safe to assume the same person is responsible.

40
00:04:34,503 --> 00:04:38,742
Fortunately, in the previous two cases,

41
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,583
the victims were only injured, but this time...

42
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:44,213
You mean their crimes are escalating?

43
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:46,042
Yes.

44
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:49,223
In any case, we need to arrest the culprit as soon as possible.

45
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:54,223
But this area is totally deserted at night.

46
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,492
There aren't any security cameras nearby.

47
00:04:57,493 --> 00:05:01,922
Just like the previous two times, I doubt we can count on any eyewitness testimony.

48
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:05,613
We didn't find anything notable among her belongings either.

49
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:09,613
Did the previous victims say anything about the incidents?

50
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,993
Well, actually...

51
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:16,442
Perhaps because they were drunk like this victim,

52
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:19,372
neither of them remembered the incidents.

53
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:20,642
I see.

54
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:21,133
Hey!

55
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:24,963
Kids should stay out of this.

56
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:28,383
Behave yourself and wait over here.

57
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:32,332
Anyway, this seems like it'll be a difficult investigation.

58
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,283
Yeah.

59
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:43,273
Hey, kid.

60
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,532
Do you know those police officers?

61
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:49,533
What? Uh, yeah. Sort of.

62
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:53,952
The random attacker left that body behind, didn't they?

63
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,533
Uh, well...

64
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,872
Oh, come on. I can keep a secret.

65
00:05:58,873 --> 00:06:03,302
More importantly, who lives in that house?

66
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:05,713
That's Komori-san's place.

67
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:07,902
A mother and her son live there.

68
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:12,342
Her son Hikaru-kun lives on the second floor.

69
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:15,723
Apparently Hikaru-kun failed to find a job.

70
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:18,762
He's been cooped up in there forever.

71
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:21,483
I believe it's been about three months.

72
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:23,482
I think they're called idol otakus?

73
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,302
Apparently he was following Okino Yoko around.

74
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,493
That's probably why he failed to find a job.

75
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:32,833
I'm telling you, kids these days...

76
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:33,863
Huh?

77
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:36,423
Where are you going, son?

78
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:38,743
That brat!

79
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:41,753
You're looking for Hikaru?

80
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:44,253
Come in. He's up here.

81
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:49,003
But I don't think there's any point in asking him questions.

82
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:54,513
He stayed in his room when the police came here earlier.

83
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:55,882
You heard her.

84
00:06:55,883 --> 00:07:00,432
But maybe he'll talk to a great detective.

85
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,643
Well, yeah.

86
00:07:03,743 --> 00:07:06,303
This is Hikaru's room.

87
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,693
Whoa!

88
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:10,722
Wow...

89
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:14,363
He's been a fan since her Earth Ladies days. Outstanding.

90
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:18,373
Hikaru.

91
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:22,072
A detective wants to speak with you about the incident.

92
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:24,753
I'm the great detective Mori Kogoro.

93
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:30,323
Hikaru-san, I'd like to ask you some questions.

94
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,223
"I didn't see anything."

95
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:40,813
"Leave."

96
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,342
This is how he's been recently.

97
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:46,443
He won't even speak to me.

98
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:48,463
Hikaru-san.

99
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:51,663
Hikaru-san, open the door.

100
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:53,743
This is hopeless.

101
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:57,363
But why did he say he didn't see anything?

102
00:07:57,703 --> 00:07:58,663
Huh?

103
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:00,123
What do you mean?

104
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,622
Regardless of whether or not someone is the culprit,

105
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:06,492
wouldn't their first concern be becoming a suspect?

106
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:08,633
Generally, yeah.

107
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:13,852
I'd understand "It wasn't me" or "I don't know anything,"

108
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:17,383
but the first thing Hikaru-san said was "I didn't see anything."

109
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:21,893
Maybe Hikaru-san did see something.

110
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:28,442
In the same way that the crime scene can be seen from that room,

111
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:30,653
that room is visible from the crime scene.

112
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:36,153
Even if Hikaru-san didn't see anything, maybe the culprit saw Hikaru-san.

113
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:57,862
This is taking too long!

114
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:59,772
Hey, open this door!

115
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,202
Hey, Dad!

116
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:05,022
That's enough, please.

117
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,432
I just need to talk to him for a little bit.

118
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,423
I'm sorry, but...

119
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:17,033
Make sure you lock your windows and doors, just in case.

120
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,583
I will.

121
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:23,413
Are these Hikaru-san's leather shoes?

122
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:26,663
What? Yes, probably. Why?

123
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:30,293
They're dirtier than you'd expect for someone looking for a job,

124
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:33,052
and they have a different feel from the other shoes here.

125
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:34,293
You're right.

126
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,593
They've been here since last week.

127
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,692
That's when the random attacks started.

128
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:44,042
What do you mean by that?

129
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:45,432
What? Nothing.

130
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,463
In that case...

131
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,523
What happened to the shoes that were here?

132
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:53,903
What? There should be some Okino Yoko sneakers there.

133
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,622
They seemed so important to him.

134
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:57,533
Where did he put those?

135
00:09:58,393 --> 00:10:02,873
Maybe he gave up on following her so he could focus on finding a job?

136
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:05,763
I hope you're right.

137
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:10,913
Come to think of it, we started communicating via text last week.

138
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,043
I see.

139
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:14,892
Did you figure something out?

140
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:16,572
No, not at all.

141
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:17,423
Jeez.

142
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:28,433
Well, we got nothing out of that.

143
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:32,192
Do you think Hikaru-san really didn't see anything?

144
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:35,193
It wouldn't be odd if he witnessed something,

145
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:37,773
but it doesn't matter if he won't talk to us.

146
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,823
How'd it go?

147
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:44,672
Is that boy connected to the case somehow after all?

148
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:47,943
I knew he seemed suspicious.

149
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:50,913
Huh?

150
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:53,173
Hey, wait!

151
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:58,173
Come on, tell me. Here's my address and phone number!

152
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:01,473
I'd do anything to help!

153
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:20,742
The series of random attacks have finally resulted in a death.

154
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:24,152
The police have not yet found any convincing evidence,

155
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:25,519
and the investigation's progress is expected to be slow.

156
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,203
Random attacks like these are the most challenging cases to solve.

157
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:34,352
I'm certain Hikaru-san saw something.

158
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:38,213
The question is why does he so stubbornly refuse to testify?

159
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:41,093
Here's our next story.

160
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,222
The Okino Yoko-san dome tour that began last week

161
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:50,603
concluded last night amidst tremendous excitement.

162
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:53,733
Yoko-tan!

163
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:59,763
The old man can hardly criticize others.

164
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:03,993
Wait a minute. Could it be?

165
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:07,783
Coffee Poirot

166
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:10,533
The truth is starting to become clear!

167
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:05,093
I'll be back late. You can microwave your dinner. Mom

168
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:19,603
Ow...

169
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:22,233
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

170
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:24,963
Yeah, sorry.

171
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,092
You're that kid from this afternoon.

172
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:30,913
What?

173
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,933
Nothing.

174
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,923
You're Hikaru-san, right?

175
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:42,883
Did you run away from home?

176
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:44,083
What?

177
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,242
Your suitcase.

178
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,402
Yeah, something like that.

179
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:49,952
You shouldn't do that. Your mom will be worried.

180
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:50,513
What?

181
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:51,903
Come on, let's go home.

182
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,133
Hey, wait.

183
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:00,523
Seriously?

184
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,023
What is this?

185
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:06,783
What's going on?

186
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:13,883
We were too late.

187
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,623
What's going on here?

188
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:26,923
The random attacker took him away.

189
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,923
The real Hikaru-san.

190
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,663
Ow...

191
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:55,953
Where am I?

192
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,122
Wh-What are you talking about?

193
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:00,903
Hikaru is... I'm right here.

194
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:07,093
If you assume he swapped places with someone, it explains everything.

195
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:10,593
Why he stopped speaking last week,

196
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,132
why his favorite sneakers vanished around the same time,

197
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:17,353
why those out-of-place shoes appeared in their place.

198
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:22,983
And why the bottoms of those shoes were worn down differently from the others.

199
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:28,733
The real Hikaru-san is a hardcore Okino Yoko chaser.

200
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:33,243
Naturally, he wanted to go to her dome tour that started last week.

201
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:40,443
But Hikaru-san was a shut-in. His mother would never allow him to go to a concert.

202
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:45,543
So Hikaru-san asked you, his friend, for a favor, right?

203
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:51,583
He asked you to take his place while he was at the concert.

204
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,513
Who are you actually?

205
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:06,023
I have to get out of here.

206
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,343
He escaped.

207
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:37,123
I'm Hikaru's friend Kageyama Shinobu.

208
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:40,553
Everything you said is correct.

209
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:45,543
I got to eat and live here for free, so it was a great deal for me.

210
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,703
I never thought something like this would happen.

211
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:50,872
Your identity's been discovered.

212
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:53,443
There's no reason for you to refuse to testify anymore!

213
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:55,963
Tell me. What did you see last night?

214
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:58,453
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:02,563
I'm not getting any more deeply involved in trouble!

216
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,123
Are you sure you're okay with that?

217
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:11,043
Hikaru's life is in danger in your place.

218
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,893
If you make the wrong choice here,

219
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,903
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

220
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:36,163
I don't want anyone to go through that.

221
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,363
Who are you?

222
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:48,373
You're right. I saw the culprit.

223
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,853
But it was dark.

224
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:06,853
I only caught a glimpse of their face.

225
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:10,513
The only thing I saw clearly was...

226
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:13,643
Thanks.

227
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,113
That's plenty.

228
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:19,273
Let's go. We're going to rescue Hikaru-san!

229
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:21,363
All right!

230
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,783
Why, you...!

231
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:53,783
You brat!

232
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,992
It's no use. He's not answering the phone.

233
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,082
Then he's already—

234
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,163
Don't give up!

235
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:13,163
Please let us make it in time.

236
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:19,803
Someone—

237
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:33,693
This is your fault...

238
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,023
for seeing something you shouldn't have.

239
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:39,193
Something I shouldn't have?

240
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:41,662
You saw me last night.

241
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,193
Doing what?

242
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:48,473
You saw me kill that woman from your room.

243
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:51,953
Last night, from my room?

244
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:57,463
I've got nothing to do with this anymore.

245
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,023
I see.

246
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:10,283
He didn't want to get involved in any trouble.

247
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:15,363
I suppose that's how friends are.

248
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,733
I guess I got what I deserved.

249
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:22,363
Hikaru!

250
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:27,482
What are you muttering about?

251
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,503
It's fine. Kill me.

252
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:36,753
I failed to find a job, and my friend abandoned me.

253
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:41,253
There's no point in me living anymore.

254
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:47,263
That's right. Because kids like you keep screwing around,

255
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:50,763
the world's going to hell!

256
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,643
Listen to me, lady!

257
00:20:56,893 --> 00:21:00,403
He's not the one who saw you last night! It was me!

258
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:01,653
What?

259
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:05,533
He didn't see anything!

260
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:09,923
I'm the one you have to kill!

261
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:11,533
Kageyama—

262
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:14,043
What the hell's going on?

263
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,083
Now!

264
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,883
Take this!

265
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,353
Hikaru!

266
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:33,763
Are you okay?

267
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:36,273
Kageyama...

268
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:39,603
I'm so glad you're okay.

269
00:23:04,613 --> 00:23:06,773
Look at this.

270
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:11,283
Apparently those two are establishing a start-up company together.

271
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:15,462
They're bound to fail.

272
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:17,783
You can't know that unless you try.

273
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:20,893
I'm sure they'll be fine.

274
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:24,543
By the way, what's he doing?

275
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:31,053
Apparently he's searching online for a Mori Kogoro double.

276
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:36,273
While he's working, I can take it easy.

277
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:42,383
I'll use my double to make money.

278
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,863
Call the police immediately!

279
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:52,582
Excuse me, I'm with the police.

280
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,942
Could I have a few minutes of your time?

281
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:57,283
What do the police want with me?

282
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,033
Conan-kun.

283
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:03,472
So you witnessed the incident through the curtains,

284
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:07,082
but the police wouldn't take you seriously?

285
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,043
I really did see something!

286
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:12,943
The next episode of Conan is "Beyond the Curtain!"
