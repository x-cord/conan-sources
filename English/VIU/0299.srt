1
00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:02,476
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,477 --> 00:00:04,176
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:05,976
Travel mysteries are so popular,

4
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:07,876
mystery churns in the ocean.

5
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,576
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,476
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,877
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,444
You two should thank me.

9
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:04,244
I've got a golden arm.

10
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:06,244
Alright already.

11
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:08,044
You're so persistent, dad.

12
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,444
You know, Pops...

13
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,044
You really are kind of talented.

14
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:12,944
In lotteries, at least.

15
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,844
I can't believe you won the first prize again

16
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,644
which was this trip.

17
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:18,444
What do you mean "kind of talented"?

18
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:19,945
I'm a genius.

19
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:25,244
What? You want to kill yourself?

20
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,644
"Seiji Hario (30)" -Go ahead then, go on, I dare you.

21
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:32,044
I've always done things this way, that's my style.

22
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:35,045
I get rid of anything I don't like.

23
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:42,144
Next stop, Shin-Shimonoseki.

24
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,544
Shin-Shimonoseki.

25
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:45,745
You may exit through the left.

26
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:52,745
"Friendship and Murder at the Kanmon Strait (Part 1)"

27
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:55,845
"The Strait Dream Tower."

28
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:57,944
"The Strait Dream Tower" -Conan, look.

29
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:58,945
You can see...

30
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,344
"Observatory on the 30th floor" -the entire city of Shimonoseki.

31
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:02,944
Wow, this is great.

32
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:04,344
Look over there,

33
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:06,144
"Ganryu Island" -that's Ganryu Island,

34
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,144
that's where Musashi Miyamoto and Kojiro Sasaki fought that famous battle.

35
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:10,844
It's smaller than I expected.

36
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:14,244
Hey, Ran. Isn't that Kyushu over there?

37
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,544
Yes, it is.

38
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:19,744
The Kanmon Strait is pretty narrow, isn't it?

39
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:23,744
Says here the narrowest area's only 700 m.

40
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,344
If you ran across it, you'd reach Kyushu in five minutes.

41
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:29,545
Oh for goodness sakes, how are you going to run across the ocean?

42
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,145
Really?

43
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:37,644
Dad, you're so embarrassing.

44
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:40,845
He's right, you can run across.

45
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:45,744
Are you talking about that bridge?

46
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:49,444
No, that's the Kanmon Bridge, it's only for cars.

47
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:51,944
But there's an underwater tunnel.

48
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:55,044
"Keisuke Otsubo, Toru Akitaya" -directly under it for human traffic.

49
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,944
It's nicknamed "The People's Tunnel".

50
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:00,844
Gee, you sure know a lot.

51
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:02,944
We grew up in this neighborhood.

52
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:04,244
No wonder.

53
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,844
It can't be.

54
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,645
"Eiko Nojima, Akane Isaka" -Aren't you Kogoro Mouri?

55
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,244
Yes, I am.

56
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:15,844
I knew it.

57
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:19,045
He's that famous private detective.

58
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,644
My name's Akitaya.

59
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:24,944
I'm Keisuke Otsubo.

60
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:26,544
I'm Akane Isaka.

61
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:28,144
I'm Eiko Nojima.

62
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:30,744
We're all fans of yours, Mr. Mouri.

63
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:31,944
Aren't we? Aren't we?

64
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:34,044
-We sure are. -Yes.

65
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:36,145
Really?

66
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,544
Yeah, everyone knows Kogoro only for his name and his face,

67
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,244
which means...

68
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:46,544
If it's not an imposition,

69
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:49,144
would you join us for dinner?

70
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:52,744
Great idea. We'd really like to hear your stories.

71
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,344
I knew it.

72
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:56,144
Well...

73
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:58,044
They were nice enough to offer,

74
00:04:58,045 --> 00:04:59,744
shall we accept?

75
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:01,444
Besides, they're locals so they probably know

76
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:03,744
where the good restaurants are.

77
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:05,244
We were raised here

78
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:08,644
but she and I have been living in Tokyo since college.

79
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,244
How do you all know each other?

80
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,644
We were all in the same class in high school.

81
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:18,144
High school classmates?

82
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,944
That's so nice.

83
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,744
12 years have passed since you graduated

84
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:23,544
but you're all still so close.

85
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:25,244
"Strait Dream Square" -I guess it's because

86
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:27,844
we all have such different personalities.

87
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:30,144
I am confident of my ability

88
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:32,344
but not very smart.

89
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:35,044
Otsubo's smart but he's a coward.

90
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:36,844
You've got some nerve.

91
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:40,644
Akane's smart too but she's pretty mean.

92
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,745
You've got some nerve.

93
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:46,445
Eiko's sweet but shy.

94
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:50,644
Actually, there used to be one more in our group.

95
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:52,844
Another close friend of ours.

96
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:54,344
Another member?

97
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:56,044
His name was Hondo,

98
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:59,944
he could draw really well, he wanted to go to an art college.

99
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,145
But...

100
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:06,044
In our senior year of high school,

101
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,344
he went to the Kanmon Bridge

102
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:09,845
and killed himself.

103
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,745
He committed suicide.

104
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:16,144
I see, he was talented but he probably felt

105
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,044
he'd already given it all he had and nothing left.

106
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,345
You're wrong.

107
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:22,945
His dream...

108
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:26,444
His dream was taken from him.

109
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:28,444
His dream?

110
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:30,844
He broke his arm.

111
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:33,845
And it didn't heal right.

112
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:39,044
I see.

113
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:43,444
Yesterday was his 13th memorial service.

114
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,244
So that's why you all came from Tokyo.

115
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:47,544
Well, that was part of the reason.

116
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:50,344
These two wanted to make an announcement to Eiko and me.

117
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:53,145
It seems they've gotten engaged.

118
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:58,044
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

119
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:02,544
Well, I realized one day that she was the only single one left.

120
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:03,844
How dare you!

121
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,745
I'm marrying you only because I feel sorry for you.

122
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:09,944
I think you two make a great couple.

123
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:11,444
So do I.

124
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,045
-You've got to be kidding. -You've got to be kidding.

125
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:15,845
Hey, come on.

126
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:25,844
Conan, look over there. It's so cute.

127
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,545
It's a cetacean.

128
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:34,445
Well, I see you're all together.

129
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:39,645
-Hario. -Hario...

130
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:44,244
Akitaya, I want to talk to you alone,

131
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,445
but I guess this is a bad time.

132
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:50,244
I'll be here for three to four days,

133
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,745
I'll see you later.

134
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:56,044
Who was that man?

135
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:57,544
That's Seiji Hario.

136
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,744
He was also one of our classmates.

137
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,044
Him too?

138
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,944
I wonder what he came back for anyway?

139
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:06,444
Probably for the memorial service.

140
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,444
Maybe he feels responsible?

141
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,244
What do you mean?

142
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,544
It's that creep's fault.

143
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:15,144
He's the one who broke Hondo's arm 12 years ago.

144
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:17,345
He's the one?

145
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:22,744
I'm sorry, I have to excuse myself.

146
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:24,745
I think I've worn myself out. I'm going home.

147
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:27,244
I'm terribly sorry.

148
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:30,344
I promise to be there for dinner though.

149
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:31,845
Excuse me.

150
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:39,244
I hope she's alright.

151
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:40,944
She didn't look very good.

152
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:43,945
Hondo was Eiko's boyfriend.

153
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,044
I guess she can't forget him.

154
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:50,444
She's still in love with Hondo.

155
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:53,144
That's why she's still single.

156
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:55,445
It's been 12 years already.

157
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,944
Is Akitaya married?

158
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,144
No.

159
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,344
Why?

160
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,645
I just was just curious.

161
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:16,344
So we'll see you all later for dinner.

162
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:18,645
Yes, please enjoy yourselves.

163
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,844
Since the olden days,

164
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:24,844
"Port of Shimonoseki International Terminal" -Shimonoseki has a history

165
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:26,844
of being a port city open to foreign ships.

166
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,444
Really?

167
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:29,644
Look, Conan.

168
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:32,544
Doesn't this place look like the Dragon King's palace?

169
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,145
"Akama Shrine" -Yeah, you're right.

170
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,144
"Kanmon Bridge."

171
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:44,545
Boy, this sure is a big bridge.

172
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,744
"Entrance Human Tunnel" -Look, that must be the tunnel.

173
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:49,744
"(Shimonoseki side)" -Mr. Akitaya told us about.

174
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,745
-Let's go inside. -Okay.

175
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,844
"Human Tunnel B3 (Shimonoseki side)"

176
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,644
"Moji"

177
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,644
I wonder if there's a possibility this place might spring a leak.

178
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,744
I mean, we are underwater.

179
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:08,645
Oh for goodness sakes, dad, don't worry.

180
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:16,445
"Yamaguchi Prefecture" "Fukuoka Prefecture."

181
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:23,544
Look at me. I'm standing in two prefectures at the same time.

182
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:24,745
Peace.

183
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:31,445
"Shimonoseki."

184
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,844
Can you believe this?

185
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:38,544
We just walked across the Kanmon Strait.

186
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:39,645
Yeah.

187
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:45,545
"Moji Retro Town."

188
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:50,045
"Moji Harbor Train Station."

189
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:55,844
This ferry takes only five minutes

190
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:58,444
and even if you go through that tunnel we took and walked slowly,

191
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,444
it takes only 15 minutes one way.

192
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:04,544
Honshu and Kyushu are very close, aren't they?

193
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:08,844
This is one of those things you can't tell just by looking at maps.

194
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:09,945
Yeah.

195
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:19,544
The locals call balloon fish "fuku" instead of "fugu"?

196
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,944
Yes. Fuku, not fugu.

197
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,944
I see.

198
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,945
"Fuku" for happiness.

199
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,744
Your father's so funny.

200
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,245
Excuse me.

201
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:36,245
Hario.

202
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:42,344
Akitaya, give your company up.

203
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:43,744
You tell me to give it up?

204
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:48,444
I'm a consultant for a food manufacturer now.

205
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:52,645
They told me they want to buy your company.

206
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:57,244
They'll pay good money.

207
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:59,444
Sounds like a fair deal, don't you think?

208
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,344
You've got to be kidding.

209
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,744
My father started the company and he worked hard for it.

210
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:07,045
I'm not letting go of it so easily.

211
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,044
I could crush your company right now if I wanted to.

212
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,844
You're nothing, you're just garbage.

213
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,144
What'd you say?

214
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:19,844
Enjoy yourself tonight.

215
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:22,145
I'll contact you tomorrow.

216
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,345
Hario, wait.

217
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:30,444
Did you come back to Shimonoseki to tell him that?

218
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:34,045
Didn't you come for Hondo's memorial service?

219
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,145
Who's that? I don't know anyone named Hondo.

220
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:48,544
Hario!

221
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:51,144
Hey! Wait, Hario!

222
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,644
Have you no heart? Answer me, Hario.

223
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:55,644
Apologize to Eiko.

224
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,845
Don't touch me with your filthy hands.

225
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,744
Otsubo.

226
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:04,544
I don't know what you're talking about.

227
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:05,844
Are you alright?

228
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:07,145
Darn.

229
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:14,744
He's so mean... so mean.

230
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,045
Eiko.

231
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:29,510
"Next day."

232
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,810
They're all such nice people, that's why...

233
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,711
"Former Akita Company" -I kind of, feel sorry for them.

234
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:37,310
You mean Mr. Akitaya and his friends?

235
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:42,110
Yes, but there's nothing we can do to help.

236
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,810
Hey, you two!

237
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:47,810
I just found out it's a 15 minute bus ride to Chofu from here.

238
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:50,710
Do we have to go to that "Mouri Residence"?

239
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,110
Of course we do.

240
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:55,010
The famous Motonari Mouri is my ancestor,

241
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:56,810
his descendant lives there.

242
00:13:56,811 --> 00:14:00,710
Are you really related to the famous Motonari Mouri?

243
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:03,011
I heard this the first time today.

244
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,411
I thought so.

245
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:12,711
I wonder if there was an accident or something.

246
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:20,111
I guess my ancestor will have to wait.

247
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:33,610
The victim's driver's license.

248
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:37,210
Seiji Hario, 30 years old, the address is in Tokyo.

249
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,210
Did you say Hario?

250
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,510
-It can't be... -It can't be...

251
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,610
Who are you?

252
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:46,410
The name's Kogoro Mouri, I'm a private detective in Tokyo.

253
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:48,810
Mouri, the famous private detective.

254
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:50,010
Yes, I suppose I am.

255
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:52,010
I've heard all about you.

256
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,610
I'm Kusuda with the Yamaguchi Prefectural Police.

257
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:57,111
I'm Anzai with the Shimonoseki Police Department.

258
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,910
You seem to recognize the victim.

259
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,210
Yes, sort of...

260
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:10,610
He died of a cerebral contusion caused by a blow to the back of the head.

261
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,810
The murder weapon appears to be this rock

262
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,310
but we may not be able to get any fingerprints off of it.

263
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:20,611
Approximate time of death is between 9 am and 1 pm or thereabouts.

264
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,510
They've been scraped on the ground pretty hard.

265
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,111
I wonder why?

266
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,410
You again.

267
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,910
Keep out of the way.

268
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,010
There're no signs of a struggle

269
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:39,810
and nothing's been stolen.

270
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:43,010
Which means the murderer is someone who knew him and held a grudge.

271
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,610
Yes, we think so too.

272
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,010
Whoever did it must have hated him a lot too,

273
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:49,010
he was hit twice.

274
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:52,710
I've got it. I know how he got those marks.

275
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,710
There's four people I think we should talk to,

276
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,510
can you get them here?

277
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:59,710
Do you have an idea who the killer might be?

278
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,110
Dad, you can't be serious,

279
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:03,710
you don't think one of them did it, do you?

280
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:06,010
I don't want to suspect them either.

281
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:10,610
But this guy had a lot of enemies, he would've been very, very careful.

282
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:16,410
I'm sure he came back to Shimonoseki without telling anyone.

283
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:18,210
Which means he got someone mad

284
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,110
after he arrived in Shimonoseki yesterday

285
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:23,510
and then remember the scene we witnessed last night,

286
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,910
put them together and those four start to look pretty suspicious.

287
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,311
No way.

288
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,910
"Shimonoseki Central Police Station"

289
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,910
I see.

290
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,310
So that's what happened

291
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:39,810
between you people and Mr. Hario last night.

292
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:43,710
Sure, we were all mad at him, but not enough to kill him...

293
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,310
Alright...

294
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,310
But for the record, I need a statement from each one of you

295
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:52,010
as to what you were doing this morning.

296
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,110
Mr. Akitaya, let's begin with you.

297
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:55,910
At nine this morning,

298
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:58,110
I went to the office for awhile

299
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,310
but I was worried about what Hario told me yesterday

300
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,710
about the buy-out

301
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:03,210
so I went to the beach alone

302
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,910
and sat in my car thinking about what to do.

303
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:07,710
After that, I went to Karato Ichiba,

304
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,511
which is one of our customers.

305
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,410
I'm pretty sure I got there a little before 11 am.

306
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:19,710
I was out for a drive in my car all morning, alone.

307
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:22,910
Then I got a call from Akane

308
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:24,610
and I went to meet her at Kaikyokan.

309
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,011
I think that was about 10:50 am.

310
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:32,610
The two of us went to see the performing seals show at 11 am.

311
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,010
I was with Akane until 10 am,

312
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,511
"Moji Retro Town" -we were shopping in Moji.

313
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:41,510
Then we parted company,

314
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:44,110
I came back to Shimonoseki

315
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:46,410
but I realized I'd forgotten something

316
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:50,211
so I headed back to Moji on the 11 o'clock ferry.

317
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:56,410
I remember seeing Akane and Eiko at Kaikyokan.

318
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:58,583
-Right? -Yes.

319
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,079
We were in a hurry because the show was going to start though.

320
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,678
Look, it's Otsubo.

321
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,578
Over there, at the ferry landing.

322
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:10,079
Let's see.

323
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,378
Keisuke Otsubo,

324
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,878
we're always keeping an eye on you.

325
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:22,979
If you don't believe me, look over at the Kaikyokan.

326
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:27,079
You're right, he's waving.

327
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,479
Right?

328
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,378
I see, according to your statements,

329
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,378
at the time of Mr. Hario's estimated time of death

330
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,278
which is somewhere around 9 am and 11 am,

331
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,878
Mr. Akitaya, until past 9 am to 11 am

332
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:46,078
and Ms. Nojima, until you got to Kaikyokan at 10:50 am,

333
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,178
and Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka,

334
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,878
you parted company at 10 am, so for that one hour,

335
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:54,978
you all have no alibis for a short span of time.

336
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,478
Dad.

337
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,578
Now wait a minute.

338
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,178
Did you say between 9 am and 11 am?

339
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,978
At 11 am, Hario was still alive,

340
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:05,778
he called me on the phone.

341
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,378
What did you say?

342
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,978
He called you at 11 am?

343
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:11,978
-Yes. -It can't be.

344
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:14,678
Are you sure, Akitaya?

345
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,078
It was a weird call.

346
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,378
He said Hondo's ghost was after him

347
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:20,878
and he wanted me to help him.

348
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:23,578
A ghost was chasing him?

349
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,478
Hondo's ghost.

350
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,978
Yeah.

351
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,278
He sounded like he was crying.

352
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,978
What do you mean his ghost?

353
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,879
I've heard enough nonsense.

354
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:35,978
What's the matter?

355
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:38,578
Nothing, it was just a prank call.

356
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,278
I hadn't been with the customer very long when the call came

357
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,878
so it must've been about 11 am.

358
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,778
No mistake.

359
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:48,778
I wonder where he called me from though?

360
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,779
The sound of his footsteps and his voice seemed to have a strange echo.

361
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,178
A place near the murder scene which would produce an echo...

362
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,478
The pedestrian tunnel.

363
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:02,378
There's supposed to be a surveillance camera there.

364
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:03,679
I'll go check.

365
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:08,478
Mr. Mouri, if the victim did indeed make the call at 11 am,

366
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:11,578
then that means he was killed after that.

367
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:14,779
And that means...

368
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:21,779
They all have alibis for that time.

369
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:27,678
Yeah, I remember this guy.

370
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,278
He was running all around the place inside the tunnel.

371
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,478
I thought somebody was chasing him

372
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:37,578
but I didn't see anyone.

373
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:40,578
So I just figured he was strange.

374
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:43,079
Do you remember what time it was?

375
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:48,578
I'm pretty sure it was about 11 am.

376
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,178
He's sure about that?

377
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,878
Yes. He said it was so strange,

378
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:55,878
he checked the time so he could make a report.

379
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,178
The call he claims he got, must've been from there.

380
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,278
So the murder took place after that,

381
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,779
after 11 am.

382
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,078
That's right. I understand.

383
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,678
We've verified Mr. Akitaya, Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka's alibis.

384
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:25,078
Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka saw Mr. Otsubo at the ferry landing.

385
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,279
So you're all in the clear, so to speak.

386
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,078
Sorry to have kept you here so long.

387
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,778
We've verified your alibis so you're all free to go now.

388
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:37,979
I apologize for the inconvenience.

389
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:42,478
I'm so happy, they've been cleared.

390
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:43,879
Me too.

391
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,279
See you later, Eiko.

392
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,479
See you later.

393
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,978
I'll call you later.

394
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:55,979
Okay.

395
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:24,078
I've got it.

396
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,679
I know how to break their alibis now.

397
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:02,678
"Next Episode" -Hey listen, that surveillance camera you mentioned,

398
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,378
is it the ceiling type?

399
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,178
Ceiling type?

400
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,478
But Mr. Mouri, what if this man wasn't really Mr. Hario?

401
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,578
You're right.

402
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:16,678
He might have been killed way before this

403
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,279
which means, anyone of those four could have committed the murder.

404
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:25,378
