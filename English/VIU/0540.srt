1
00:00:00,844 --> 00:00:05,244
That day, I got up after being haunted by a nightmare.

2
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:06,444
Come to think of it,

3
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:10,544
it could've been a warning for the worse to come.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:14,544
"Mouri Detective Agency."

5
00:00:14,544 --> 00:00:16,644
It's okay, isn't it?

6
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:20,244
"Sayuri Tokomae (40)" -Mr. Mouri, pretty please.

7
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:23,944
If you're worried that a robber's after you,

8
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:27,944
why don't you take off all that expensive looking accessory and run?

9
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,944
But, I want to show my accessories off.

10
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:33,944
Please keep me company an hour every day

11
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:36,244
when I go jogging to keep me from getting fat.

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,044
Mr. Mouri...

13
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:42,044
She says Pops looks like her late husband.

14
00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:45,444
That's no job for a detective.

15
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:50,344
Dad really can't handle it, can he?

16
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:54,344
Please, please, pretty please, keep me company.

17
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:56,844
Yes, yes, yes.

18
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:59,444
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

19
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:01,944
I'm Ryozo Gamo.

20
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:04,844
I want you to look for a witness who can prove my alibi.

21
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:09,044
Yes, this is indeed the kind of job for a detective.

22
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:11,744
Yes. Tomorrow at 7 pm,

23
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:13,244
at Fugu Taisho.

24
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,244
Okay!

25
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,144
Let's talk of the details then.

26
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:21,344
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tokomae.

27
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:23,944
I have urgent business to attend to.

28
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:26,744
I was here first.

29
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:28,844
Frightening.

30
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:32,844
I don't think she needs a bodyguard.

31
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:36,044
See, talk about bad things happening.

32
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,644
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

33
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:42,044
Saturday nights are for mystery.

34
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:44,344
A mistaken deduction finally brings destruction.

35
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:46,644
Is it truly the end for Detective Mouri.

36
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:48,244
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:50,044
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,044
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:36,622
"The Day Detective Kogoro Mouri Goes Out of Business (Part 1)"

40
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:38,422
"Fugu Taisho."

41
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:41,422
He's going to be late because of an emergency?

42
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,322
Yes. Mr. Gamo called and told me to tell you

43
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:46,622
that he's sorry he's going to be late,

44
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:49,222
but to start without him.

45
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:51,122
Balloon fish!

46
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,122
Delicious!

47
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:03,922
Sir, he's here.

48
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:05,722
It's that man over there.

49
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:06,922
Here you go.

50
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:08,422
Thank you always.

51
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:09,922
Mr. Gamo.

52
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:12,522
"Ryozo Gamo (70)" -I'm sorry for being late.

53
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,222
I'm Ryozo Gamo.

54
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,522
I'm Mouri.

55
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,522
"Inside the antique shop 'Isado'."

56
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,422
"Sakae Isado (56) is found stabbed to death" -What is this?

57
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:22,722
Of course I know about this case.

58
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:24,222
About half a month ago,

59
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,422
the owner of an antique shop at Tsukimicho,

60
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:30,822
Sakae Ikasa was killed.

61
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:34,822
The police suspect me as being the killer.

62
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:37,322
I've got a motive too.

63
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:41,122
Five years ago, he deceived me and took a lot of money from me.

64
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:44,622
When an officer came to check my alibi,

65
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:49,622
I inadvertently answered that I was home.

66
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,622
But, the fact is...

67
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:54,722
"Akebonocho Station" -I was walking around Akebonocho.

68
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:57,922
But I was alone so I have nobody to prove it.

69
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,522
I thought that they would suspect me

70
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:02,822
if I told them that I was out so I lied.

71
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:08,222
If the police find out that I lied,

72
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:10,222
the more they'll suspect me.

73
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,022
So, Mr. Mouri...

74
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:15,422
I would like you to find somebody who can testify

75
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:18,122
that I was at Akebonocho on the day of the crime.

76
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:21,722
You can count on me to find a witness to prove your alibi.

77
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,322
I can do that hands down.

78
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:28,122
You're sure dependable just as you're reputed to be.

79
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:31,922
Since I go out a lot and don't carry a cell phone,

80
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:35,822
I'll call you to find out what you come up with.

81
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:39,022
So, let's drink and eat!

82
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:46,522
Thank you.

83
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,922
Mr. Gamo, I hope to be seeing you again soon.

84
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:52,622
Mr. Gamo, thanks for treating me the other day.

85
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:54,822
Mr. Gamo, won't you drop by.

86
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:58,622
You're sure popular, Mr. Gamo.

87
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:03,622
Would you like to go to another shop?

88
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:05,722
Yes. Let's go, let's go.

89
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:07,222
Let's drink up.

90
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,922
"Akebonocho Station" -I started working from the next morning.

91
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:19,322
But investigation turned out to be quite difficult then I first thought,

92
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:23,122
and I got a call from Mr. Gamo every night pushing me for results.

93
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:29,922
Give me a break.

94
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,822
Then, on Friday night, the sixth day.

95
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,322
Did you find it?

96
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:38,622
Dad?

97
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:42,022
Yoko Okino is appearing from 8 pm.

98
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,822
It's like regular courier service.

99
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:48,022
Talk about bad timing.

100
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:50,222
-Yes. -This is Gamo.

101
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:52,622
I was asking around all day today too, but...

102
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:54,822
You got no results?

103
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:58,222
You, the renown detective is my only hope and yet...

104
00:06:58,222 --> 00:06:59,822
I'm doomed.

105
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:03,322
What do you mean you're doomed?

106
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,322
Talk about exaggerating.

107
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,022
The estimated time of his death

108
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,522
is between 7 pm to 9 pm last night.

109
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:24,422
It seems that there are no traces of the corpse

110
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:25,722
having been moved after death.

111
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:28,722
Inspector Megure,

112
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:30,522
I've brought Mr. Mouri with me.

113
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:32,222
Thank you for the trouble.

114
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:35,922
What did you want with me, Inspector Megure?

115
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:38,722
Well, although it looks to be suicide,

116
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:43,422
at the feet of the corpse, this was found crumpled up.

117
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,922
The phone number of my agency.

118
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:49,822
I'm going to take a peek at his face.

119
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,422
Mr. Gamo?

120
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:00,722
Then what he said about him being doomed

121
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:04,122
to you on the phone yesterday was true?

122
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:06,522
What do you mean by that?

123
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,822
I brought him here to confirm the corpse.

124
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,222
"Kyosuke Arai (42)" -He's Mr. Gamo's nephew,

125
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:15,322
Mr. Kyosuke Arai.

126
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:18,922
What did he mean when he said he was doomed?

127
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,022
I see.

128
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,122
So, that's why.

129
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:31,722
Now, we've grasped Mr. Gamo's tracks of what he did last night.

130
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:34,722
Mr. Gamo who was a suspect for having killed Mr. Sakae Kinugasa,

131
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,722
owner of the antique shop

132
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:39,322
called Mr. Mouri at 8 pm last night

133
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:42,322
and was depressed to find that

134
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,322
there had been no progress regarding his request,

135
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:46,722
drove over here with his car and committed suicide.

136
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:50,722
It takes approximately an hour from the Gamo residence to here,

137
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:53,122
so he committed suicide at 9 pm.

138
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:55,522
It also matches the estimated time of death.

139
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:58,922
But inspector, if he was really innocent,

140
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:01,122
I don't see any reason as to why he would have to get depressed

141
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:03,222
over not being able to find someone who witnessed his alibi.

142
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:04,322
"Police Detective Hisamoto (50)" -Mr. Gamo...

143
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,022
went through a bitter experience

144
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:07,822
of being arrested despite being innocent.

145
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,322
Mistakenly arrested?

146
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:15,022
Five years ago,

147
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,722
the victim of this incident, Mr. Kinugasa was attacked in the dark,

148
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:21,022
and through eye-witness reports,

149
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:24,222
an officer of the Josai Police Department,

150
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:26,522
in our jurisdiction arrested Mr. Gamo.

151
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,122
However, several days later,

152
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:30,522
it was found that Mr. Gamo had an alibi.

153
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:32,322
I remember.

154
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,622
Uncle told me that he was taken away

155
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:37,322
by the police against his will and really scared.

156
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:41,322
He feared that he was going to have to go through what he did before,

157
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:42,822
therefore, felt doomed.

158
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:46,422
We tried to be as careful as possible

159
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:49,322
with the investigation so as not to repeat Takeoka's mistake.

160
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,722
Takeoka?

161
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,722
You mean, Isao Takeoka?

162
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:57,422
Yes, he felt responsible for his mistake back then and quit.

163
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:59,622
Is it the Mr. Takeoka I know?

164
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:00,922
Do you know him?

165
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:04,522
He used to come over sometimes to spend time with dad.

166
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,022
You mean that Takeoka that entered police school

167
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,422
together with you.

168
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,022
It's me.

169
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,422
Okay, I'll head back right away.

170
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:20,922
It seems they just arrested the murderer who killed Mr. Sakae Kinugasa.

171
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:21,922
What?

172
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,422
I'll report back on the details later.

173
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:29,322
If the killer was arrested a bit earlier,

174
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,822
uncle didn't have to take such rash action.

175
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:35,722
This place sure is spooky at night

176
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,322
because there aren't any lights anywhere.

177
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,622
True.

178
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:43,622
This area is supposed to be pitch dark at night.

179
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:47,322
Yes, that's why there was a flashlight

180
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:48,722
at the feet of Mr. Gamo's body.

181
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,322
Why would he prepare something like that

182
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:51,422
and bring it along with him,

183
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:53,622
coming all the way out to a place like this?

184
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:56,022
He could've committed suicide at home.

185
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,822
True.

186
00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:01,422
There was a reason that it had to be here

187
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:03,022
for the killer that is.

188
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,922
The killer?

189
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:07,622
Inspector, this is a homicide case.

190
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:09,722
Homicide?

191
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:15,322
In the last phone call I received from Mr. Gamo

192
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,722
saying that he was doomed,

193
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:20,222
I'm sure that the killer decided to use those words to his advantage

194
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,722
to make Mr. Gamo's death look like suicide.

195
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,722
It's no use doing something like this.

196
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,022
But, we can't totally disregard the possibility of homicide.

197
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:35,322
But, if it's as Mr. Mouri deduced,

198
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,722
it would mean that the killer was here last night.

199
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:42,922
It seems that Mr. Gamo complained to a bread manufacturer.

200
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:44,222
Complained?

201
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,122
We received a complaint call from him the other day

202
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:49,322
regarding our Smiley black bean bun.

203
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:54,022
Receiving a complaint about a black bean bun

204
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:58,722
is no motive for murder, is it?

205
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:00,622
Mr. Mouri, how long do you insist on

206
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:02,722
saying that this is a case of homicide?

207
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,822
Until I'm totally convinced it's not.

208
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:07,022
Uncle committed suicide!

209
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:11,422
Of course, I don't mean to rush to conclusions but...

210
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:12,522
Inspector Megure.

211
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:20,322
I hear that you've been having arguments with Mr. Gamo recently.

212
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,422
Oh, no.

213
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:23,622
It's just a little something over trivial matters.

214
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:25,422
Something like you asked him to lend you money,

215
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:27,922
but refused you flatly?

216
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,922
-Mr. Mouri! -Mr. Mouri!

217
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,822
It seems that you fantastically saw through a homicide

218
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:41,922
that was set up to look like suicide.

219
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:44,122
You already know who the killer is, don't you?

220
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:47,022
I solved the case a bit too fast, in spite of myself.

221
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:52,022
"Yamane (30)" -I think you're running from your responsibility

222
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,022
by insisting this case of suicide a case of homicide.

223
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:55,022
"Toyo Sports Newspaper."

224
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,722
You were asked by him to search for a witness to his alibi

225
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,022
but you couldn't,

226
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,722
and your client who felt doomed committed suicide.

227
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:03,722
Where did you get that story from?

228
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:06,122
Who cares?

229
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:08,622
Why does he know about it?

230
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,022
The police would never tell him about it either.

231
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,722
Please tell me.

232
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:14,222
How do you intend to take responsibility

233
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:17,222
for cornering your client to kill himself, Mr. Mouri?

234
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:19,722
Mr. Gamo did not commit suicide!

235
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,122
It's homicide!

236
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:23,722
I'll find the killer no matter what it takes!

237
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,322
"I'll find the killer!"

238
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:28,622

00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:47,322
I saw it but what about it?

243
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:49,722
Dad really hit it big.

244
00:13:49,722 --> 00:13:52,122
So, why don't you two make up already?

245
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,122
Go tell him that if he doesn't watch his head from bloating,

246
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:55,922
he'll fall into a pitfall.

We'll get a lot of cloents at this rate.

250
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:11,722
Before that, please allow me to watch some horse-racing.

251
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:16,022
Maybe mother's right.

252
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:23,322
Oh, no. The jockey fell off the horse. Dark horses...

253
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,122
-I'm finished. -I won. It's a big win.

254
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:27,522
I won, I won!

255
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,622
I did it!

256
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:32,022
Mouri?

257
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,922
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Hi, dad.

258
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:38,322
I happened to run into him.

259
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,922
Mr. Takeoka.

260
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,922
"Isao Takeoka (40)" -Ran, you've grown so big.

261
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:47,822
Here, this is for you.

262
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:51,422
So he's the man who arrested Mr. Gamo five years ago by mistake

263
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:52,922
and quit the police force.

264
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:54,722
Just as I thought.

265
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:01,989
Since way back,

266
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:04,389
every time he brought me something it was this.

267
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,589
"Animal Cookies."

268
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,489
Animal cookies.

269
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,489
What do you think, Takeoka?

270
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:13,089
Gamo didn't commit suicide.

271
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,589
The feeling that I got when I interrogated him five years ago, was...

272
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,389
he's not that type of guy.

273
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:19,589
Let me help you.

274
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,189
You're not the type to leave things as is,

275
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,289
after your client's been killed either.

276
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,389
It could be a grudge

277
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,489
or someone who was in conflict with him that killed him.

278
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:30,689
If it's somebody that hated him, I know one.

279
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:32,489
Who is it?

280
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:35,089
The guy right in front of you.

281
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:38,189
I know, I wasn't being sensible, but I did hate him.

282
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:39,789
I have a motive.

283
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:42,289
Where were you the night before yesterday?

284
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,489
What's the estimated time of death?

285
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:46,389
Just around 9 pm.

286
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:48,689
Too bad.

287
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:51,289
I met an acquaintance at 8:30 pm

288
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,789
and stayed with him till midnight.

289
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,889
Immovable alibi.

290
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,189
Okay. Let's go, Takeoka.

291
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,189
Yes.

292
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:03,689
It's just like the old days.

293
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:09,389
Kogoro.

294
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:13,489
So, it seems that you finished the work that you were asked to do.

295
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,389
Nothing's finished at all.

296
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,889
Things are just starting.

297
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:24,089
So, the guy Gamo disappearing doesn't work.

298
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:26,789
What've you been doing for these five years?

299
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:29,089
You didn't contacting me at all.

300
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,389
I was dead.

301
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,389
A man who only knew how to be a police detective

302
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,289
threw what he had away.

303
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,889
You could've become a detective too.

304
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,089
You'd be of use right away.

305
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,189
I'll think about it.

306
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:44,989
Although we worked in different jurisdiction

307
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:46,989
and sections back in the old days,

308
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:50,989
we used to work as partners during investigation.

309
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:55,989
Although he used to sometimes be hated unreasonably by his customers,

310
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,589
but the owner, Mr. Gamo...

311
00:16:57,589 --> 00:16:59,889
"Reiji Tsuchida (43)" left everything up to me,

312
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:02,089
the hired president of this company.

313
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,889
Has he ever been hated aside of work?

314
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:07,889
He didn't talk to me about personal things.

315
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:10,589
Why don't you ask his nephew?

316
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,389
He seems to be the only one with blood ties with him.

317
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,389
Are you intending to make me the killer at all cost?

318
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:25,889
I would just like to confirm some things.

319
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:27,189
The night before last,

320
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,689
I was drawing pictures for a series

321
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,289
that is published in a weekly magazine.

322
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,189
Any witnesses?

323
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:35,289
There isn't any because I live alone.

324
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:39,689
You sure seem to have loans here there and everywhere, don't you?

325
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:42,889
I heard an interesting story about you at a neighborhood bar.

326
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:45,489
You were wasted and babbling away saying,

327
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:50,589
"I would get inheritance if only uncle dies!"

328
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,889
I mean, I was drunk back then.

329
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:56,189
Mr. Arai, let me just say one thing.

330
00:17:56,189 --> 00:18:00,389
There is not one criminal who escaped the hands of me,

331
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:02,789
Kogoro Mouri, the renown detective.

332
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:05,989
Go home!

333
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:17,389
"Mouri Detective Agency."

334
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:18,589
And?

335
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:20,489
So, you got nothing after all?

336
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:23,589
Yes, only for today.

337
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:25,689
Come to think of it, that man called Mr. Arai

338
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,989
seemed to want the case to be a suicide, didn't he?

339
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:30,789
If it turns out to be a homicide,

340
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,789
he would be investigated from head to toe.

341
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:35,389
Then, all his shortcomings may be exposed.

342
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:40,289
Hello.

343
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,589
Takeoka.

344
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,489
What? Something crossed your mind?

345
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,889
"Toyo Newspaper Agency" -You know that I can't tell you

346
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:51,589
where I got information about Mr. Gamo calling you to work for him.

347
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,289
So, you can't give me info on the news source.

348
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:57,189
Well, it's not that I have no idea.

349
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:59,189
If it's not the police,

350
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:01,989
the only person left is his nephew, Mr. Kyosuke Arai.

351
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,889
If you know, why come ask?

352
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,889
Prepare an article of apology for this fake info!

353
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:13,889
Just as you deduced,

354
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:16,189
Arai was the one who let the info out.

355
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:19,589
He gets the entire estate to himself.

356
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,289
He has zero alibi.

357
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:24,889
Moreover, he uses the press to interfere with investigation.

358
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:26,689
I'll make him spit it out.

359
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,689
Don't tell me he got away.

360
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:37,889
"Arai."

361
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,789
Arai.

362
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,889
It seems that Mr. Arai's estimated time of death

363
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:55,389
is around 9 pm to 10 pm last night.

364
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:57,089
It's suicide.

365
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:02,889
And, it's also proof that he's the guy who killed Mr. Gamo.

366
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:04,989
I totally agree too.

367
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,889
Inspector, this is his neighbor.

368
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:12,589
On the night that Mr. Gamo passed away,

369
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:14,689
she says that Mr. Arai was at home in his room.

370
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:15,789
What?

371
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,089
Just what do you mean?

372
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,289
Since he was making a lot of noise,

373
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,689
I was going to complain to him.

374
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:22,889
I looked into his room from the veranda,

375
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,889
and saw him walking around in his room,

376
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,389
screaming something at the top of his lungs.

377
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:29,289
But, he cooled down in no time,

378
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:31,089
so I didn't say anything.

379
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,489
What time was it?

380
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:35,389
A little before 8 pm.

381
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:36,589
8 pm?

382
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:38,189
It'll take at least an hour

383
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:40,889
and a half to get from here to the murder site.

384
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,289
If he was in his room at 8 pm,

385
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:45,689
he wouldn't have made it there at the estimated time of death

386
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:46,889
no matter how much he rushed.

387
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,689
Mr. Arai is innocent.

388
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:51,889
If so, there's only one possible reason

389
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:54,789
why he committed suicide.

390
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:57,189
I suspected him despite him being innocent

391
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,489
cornered him and lead him to kill himself.

392
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:01,489
Thanks to your one-track mindedness,

393
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:05,289
I guess you did something that cannot be undone, Mr. Mouri.

394
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,789
I have no words to defend myself.

395
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:09,689
No, I'm the one who asked him

396
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:12,089
to go look for the killer together against his will.

397
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,789
I'll take responsibility for the outcome.

398
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,289
Mouri.

399
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,089
There're a lot of them again today.

400
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,589
I'm sorry, Mouri.

401
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:28,389
Don't worry about it.

402
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:33,689
I was happy just to be able to pair up with you like old times.

403
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,189
See you again, someday, then.

404
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:42,789
Mr. Arai who was falsely accused by you,

405
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:46,789
tried to prove his innocence by killing himself, didn't he?

406
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:47,989
Answer me, Mr. Mouri!

407
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:51,689
You lead an innocent person to his death!

Inspector, this is Mouri.

413
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:37,289
I'm going to remove the sign of my detective office from today.

414
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,589
Dad.

415
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:40,889
Dad.

416
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,789
Mr. Mouri is...

417
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,489
Going to resign?

418
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:49,489
He's going to resign his job as a detective?

419
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:51,289
Please, dad.

420
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,489
Think it over.

421
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:54,889
Dad!

422
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,489
After all, you've kept going for the past ten years.

423
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,189
I'm sure you're exhausted.

424
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:03,889
Mother.

"Saturday, 7 pm, Fugu Taisho, Mr Gamo" -Everything began

when he got a job request from his client.

427
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:09,089
It can't be...

428
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:10,789
But, if I piece them together that way...

429
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:13,489
I got it.

430
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:16,889
I guess I cannot resign my job as a detective.

431
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,689
Moreover I'm not tired!
