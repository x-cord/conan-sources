1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,370
Memories!

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,470
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,770
The last page of a book and a stone disappears.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,570
Where will everyone's deduction turn to?

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,070
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,070
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:55,641
"Library"

9
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:06,043
Bummers, how long has it been since I wrote my last book report?

10
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,443
Hey, Conan.

11
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:08,943
You don't look like you want to write your book report.

12
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:10,443
What? Not really.

13
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:13,143
What do you mean by not really?

14
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:16,043
Haibara has gone home long ago.

15
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:19,843
Ayumi and Genta are both working seriously on it.

16
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:22,843
I can understand that Ayumi is working hard, but Genta?

17
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,543
What a thing to say.

18
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:28,143
Conan, you're the only one that's not taking it seriously.

19
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:29,743
See, look at Genta.

20
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:34,543
This looks delicious!

21
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:37,743
Hey, Genta.

22
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,343
Hey, hey.

23
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:43,643
Okay! I've decided this is what it's going to be.

24
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:45,143
Hey, Genta!

25
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:48,043
Do you know what a book report is?

26
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,143
Oh, come on.

27
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:51,843
Huh?

28
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:53,343
What's the matter?

29
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:55,243
Something's strange.

30
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,343
What?

31
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,443
Conan, look at this.

32
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,543
See!

33
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:05,843
Maybe somebody's just playing a prank?

34
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:07,543
Why would someone do something like this?

35
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:09,343
Why don't you choose another book then?

36
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,443
No!

37
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:13,043
I want to write a book report on this book.

38
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,243
But...

39
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:17,843
Conan, you'll help me look for it, won't you?

40
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:20,343
There's a hint.

41
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:24,343
Maybe if we ask this kid, we'll find out something.

42
00:03:25,343 --> 00:03:27,743
"Tsukasa Naito, 1st grade class A"

43
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,843
You mean, I have to go, too?

44
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,243
I think it's very wrong to rip a page out of a school book.

45
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:37,543
Give me a break.

46
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:44,943
"The Missing Page"

47
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:48,543
What's wrong? I mean it looks so good.

48
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:51,943
That's why I've been explaining from a while ago.

49
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,443
Listen, Genta.

50
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,543
A book report is...

51
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,043
That hurts.

52
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:00,343
Ouch!

53
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,343
Hold it, mister!

54
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:07,243
Are you all right, Genta?

55
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:09,443
How rude can he get?

56
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:12,143
He didn't even apologize after bumping into you.

57
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:13,743
I've never seen him before.

58
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:14,843
No.

59
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:18,043
What's going on over there?

60
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:22,643
-Let's go and see. -Huh?

61
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,943
"1st grade class A"

62
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:28,243
I wonder which one he is.

63
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:30,943
Maybe he already went home?

64
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:33,743
Is there a Tsukasa Naito here?

65
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:36,343
Tsukasa is absent today.

66
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,143
I guess it can't be helped then.

67
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,843
Let's go home, too.

68
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:42,543
He's absent without calling in sick,

69
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,843
so the teacher's worried about him, too.

70
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,543
You mean nobody called from his house?

71
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:53,243
I'm not sure because he just transferred to our school since autumn.

72
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:54,643
I see.

73
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:58,143
It looked like he wasn't too happy though.

74
00:04:58,143 --> 00:04:59,843
I wonder if anything happened?

75
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,243
"The Adventures of Aleck" -I wonder...

76
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:05,243
if it has anything to do with this book?

77
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:06,943
Oh, that book!

78
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,243
Do you know about it?

79
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:11,143
Yes. Tsukasa told me about it.

80
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:12,743
Tsukasa did?

81
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:15,743
Even though school was over, he was still reading it.

82
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:18,343
So I was kind of curious

83
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:20,843
and asked him what he was reading.

84
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:22,043
It's about Aleck.

85
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:26,343
Oh, Aleck is the name of the main character.

86
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:30,143
One day, he lost the harmonica that he cherished.

87
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:33,043
So he finds a knowledgeable turtle,

88
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:35,543
who tells him that if he can find the "Again Stone",

89
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,943
he can get back what he lost.

90
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,543
But in order to find that stone,

91
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:43,743
one must have a kind and courageous heart.

92
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,843
Aleck tries everything he can and finally found the stone.

93
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:50,143
When he raises that stone in the air,

94
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:53,043
the harmonica that he lost comes falling from the sky.

95
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:57,443
I said that it would be nice if such a stone really existed,

96
00:05:57,443 --> 00:06:00,943
and Tsukasa answered, "Yeah" with a smile.

97
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,143
Hey, let's go there.

98
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:05,643
Go where?

99
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:07,243
Where else?

100
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,943
To Tsukasa's house, of course.

101
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:10,643
What?

102
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,543
Excuse me, excuse me!

103
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:14,243
Is this a case or something?

104
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:16,843
Of course not.

105
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,043
Hey, did something happen?

106
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:21,743
The precious stone that was inside was stolen.

107
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,643
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

108
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,543
-The guy we saw just a while ago. -Huh?

109
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,243
Don't you get it?

110
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:30,243
I'm sure that he's the stone thief!

111
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:32,443
What? Are you sure about that?

112
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:35,543
That's why he fled the way he did.

113
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:39,043
All right, it's time for Youth Detective Squad to get to work!

114
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:40,043
Genta!

115
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:41,543
Here goes!

116
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:43,143
Hey, Genta!

117
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:47,843
We've got the map too, so I guess we have nothing to worry about.

118
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:48,843
Yeah.

119
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,143
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

120
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:54,243
Conan.

121
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,543
Actually, something troublesome happened.

122
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,243
Troublesome?

123
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,843
Yes. The truth is...

124
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:02,743
a stone was lent to us from Beika Museum

125
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:05,743
for a limited period of a week to be put on exhibit.

126
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:08,243
It has been stolen.

127
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,543
It's a very valuable stone.

128
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:13,543
And today is the day we promised to return it.

129
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:14,843
Ms. Kobayashi.

130
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:17,043
May I look inside the science room?

131
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:25,243
It was definitely there during yesterday's class.

132
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:28,343
This is pretty audacious.

133
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:31,343
It doesn't look like something a professional would do.

134
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:35,343
"Advent Stone"

135
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:37,043
Advent Stone?

136
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:38,843
That's right, the book.

137
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,743
Ayumi, will you please show me that book?

138
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:42,043
Huh?

139
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:43,243
Yes.

140
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,243
Here you go!

141
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:45,943
Thank you.

142
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,143
A stone is definitely here, too.

143
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:54,243
The Again Stone and the Advent Stone.

144
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,343
"Again Stone"

145
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,343
"Advent Stone"

146
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:01,643
I see.

147
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:05,643
The one who stole the stone probably read this book.

148
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:10,043
Tsukasa returned this book yesterday.

149
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:12,843
And there's probably no doubt that the stone was stolen

150
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:15,543
between after school yesterday and today.

151
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:18,043
What's the matter, Conan?

152
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:19,543
All right.

153
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:21,143
Let's go, Ayumi.

154
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:22,843
To look for the stone thief?

155
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:25,743
To Tsukasa's house.

156
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,043
I'm starved.

157
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,343
We lost him.

158
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:36,943
He was just in front of us a second ago.

159
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:37,943
What is it?

160
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,243
That's the stone thief.

161
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:42,343
Let's go, Mitsuhiko!

162
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:43,343
Okay!

163
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:52,543
We lost him again.

164
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:55,543
No, I'm almost certain he went this way.

165
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:59,643
"Yakitori Naito"

166
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:02,343
It could be over here.

167
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:03,543
Okay!

168
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:05,843
Hey!

169
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:15,343
Who are you guys?

170
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:16,443
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:17,843
Please spare my life!

172
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:21,543
Are you saying that Tsukasa is the one who stole the stone?

173
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:23,743
If Tsukasa is the one who ripped the page off the book,

174
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:26,743
the probability is high.

175
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:29,243
If so, Tsukasa's a bad boy.

176
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:32,343
Like I said, I'm not sure yet.

177
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:33,843
Here it is.

178
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:35,043
"Yakitori Naito"

179
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:42,043
Excuse me.

180
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:51,843
What are you guys doing here?

181
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,443
Conan?

182
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,643
If you like, why don't you guys have some, too?

183
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:06,543
Excuse me, sir.

184
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:09,643
You found out that Tsukasa didn't go to school

185
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,243
after Ms. Kobayashi called you, right?

186
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:16,643
Don't you have any idea where he could've gone?

187
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:21,743
Aren't you worried about Tsukasa?

188
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:23,743
I am, but I'm still going to eat.

189
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:29,543
It's true that we ended up here by mistake

190
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:31,943
and is eating thanks to you,

191
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:35,443
but now that things are out in the light, it's another story.

192
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:38,643
I'm going to have to open the shop soon, so I'm busy.

193
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:40,643
Isn't your wife helping you?

194
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:42,443
It's none of your business!

195
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:43,643
Hey, sir.

196
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,243
May we take a look at Tsukasa's room?

197
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:48,343
We may be able to get a clue or something.

198
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,443
Why would you want to do something like that?

199
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,843
Because we're worried about Tsukasa.

200
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,443
What are you doing, Tsukasa?

201
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:08,543
Nothing.

202
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,743
You're a boy, why don't you go play soccer with your friends or something?

203
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:16,943
I don't have any friends.

204
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,243
You're Tsukasa's...

205
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:28,143
Friends.

206
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:35,043
If my deduction is correct,

207
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:38,943
after reading that book, Tsukasa found the stone in the science room

208
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:43,043
and believed that the stone on exhibit was the "Again Stone."

209
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:47,443
He came to school this morning, stole the stone and disappeared.

210
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,243
But why?

211
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:52,943
What on earth is Tsukasa trying to get back?

212
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:54,343
Conan.

213
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:57,043
Maybe this is...

214
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:04,243
Tsukasa's mother?

215
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,943
She passed away.

216
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:12,143
She looks kind.

217
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,443
But now she's no longer around.

218
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,743
Maybe...

219
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:33,905
How was it?

220
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:37,405
His father doesn't seem to know where this beach is.

221
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:40,105
Something about it being a secret place that he shared with his mother.

222
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:41,405
I see.

223
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:44,105
Could Tsukasa be at this beach?

224
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:45,605
We still can't know for sure.

225
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:47,005
Hey, Conan.

226
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:48,305
Did you find anything?

227
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,205
There were a lot of things.

228
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,705
Ayumi, bring me the book.

229
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:00,205
Okay.

230
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:01,805
Flipped to the ripped page.

231
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:02,805
Okay.

232
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:07,405
All right.

233
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,305
There's no mistake that Tsukasa is the one who ripped the page off.

234
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:16,705
He brought this page home and cut off the unneeded parts.

235
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:20,905
Which means that Tsukasa is the one who stole the stone, too?

236
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:22,905
Yeah. You did it, Genta!

237
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,705
The stopper's been removed.

238
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:28,805
Let's open it.

239
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:34,505
What's this memo about?

240
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:35,805
Something's written on it.

241
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,105
What does it say?

242
00:13:37,105 --> 00:13:38,705
Crab is scissors, scissors.

243
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,005
The orange is paper.

244
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:41,505
The green caterpillar is rock.

245
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,305
Paper scissors.

246
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,305
What do you think it is?

247
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:47,805
It looks like some kind of code.

248
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:48,905
Sure does.

249
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:51,705
Genta, you should think about it, too.

250
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,705
This could be a hint.

251
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:55,805
Crab scissors, scissors?

252
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:56,905
What is this?

253
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,705
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

254
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,605
Genta, keep it up.

255
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,305
Keep it up, please.

256
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:05,805
Keep it up? You mean this?

257
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:10,705
Crab scissors, scissors.

258
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:12,005
I've figured it out.

259
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,705
I know what that code means.

260
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:17,105
This ocean is a secret place that Tsukasa shared

261
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,005
only with his mother, right?

262
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,905
And a code is written on a paper inserted behind the picture.

263
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:23,305
That code means map.

264
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:26,705
In other words, it shows what direction to go.

265
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,705
That's right, Mitsuhiko.

266
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:31,105
Therefore, well...

267
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,105
You see...

268
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,805
You mean he rode a crab to get there?

269
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:36,905
That's right.

270
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:38,705
A crab is red, isn't it?

271
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:41,905
This stands for the TR Tohto Line.

272
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:43,205
Keep going.

273
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:45,205
To make scissors, scissors, you use four fingers.

274
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:46,905
Therefore...

275
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:48,005
Station.

276
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:50,405
I think it stands for the number of stations.

277
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,405
-Okay! -What do you plan to do?

278
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,505
Let's hurry and go before it starts to get dark!

279
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:55,705
All right.

280
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:01,705
Four stations on the Tohto Line from Beika Station.

281
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:05,405
Hey, that could work for either inbound or outbound.

282
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,305
The next is orange.

283
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,205
The colour of the train is orange.

284
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:12,605
The Sakaimachi Line and Minato Line are both orange.

285
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:13,605
Wait a second.

286
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:15,805
Why did he put the honorific "san" on the crab?

287
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:17,605
Maybe because the crab is a big shot?

288
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:19,205
It's platform number 3.

289
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:20,805
The super express leaves from platforms 1 and 2, right?

290
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:21,805
So if it's platform 3...

291
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:22,905
It's the train going up.

292
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:23,905
Yeah.

293
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:29,705
We transfer to the Minato Line from the next station

294
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:32,305
and since it's paper from there, we ride five stations.

295
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:34,305
The problem is after that.

296
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:35,305
Yes.

297
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,005
"Yakitori Naito"

298
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,105
Yes.

299
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:45,805
Yes, all right.

300
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,605
Thank you for your help.

301
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:11,505
I'm home!

302
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:16,105
I really had a lot of fun, Daddy.

303
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:21,005
Mommy was really funny.

304
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,905
When the wave came...

305
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:25,005
I keep telling you to come in from the back!

306
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:27,605
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:29,605
This is a gift for you.

308
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:32,105
Next time, let's go together, Daddy.

309
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:40,705
"Ohama"

310
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,005
We're in trouble, Conan.

311
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:52,505
There seems to be no train we can transfer to from this station.

312
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:54,305
Stone stands for zero, right?

313
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,005
But there's no such thing as a platform zero, is there?

314
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:58,505
That's true.

315
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:00,505
I wonder what the green caterpillar stands for?

316
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,905
A bus terminal.

317
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,105
Bus stop Number 0.

318
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:11,105
If the green caterpillar stands for a bus, it's possible, right?

319
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:12,205
That's right!

320
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,205
Let's go.

321
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:14,905
So it wasn't a real caterpillar...

322
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:15,905
Wait up!

323
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,905
Isn't this the green caterpillar?

324
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:22,305
I'm sure it is!

325
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,805
I'll go ask.

326
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:27,305
Are you sure this is right, Conan?

327
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,805
What if Tsukasa isn't there?

328
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:32,105
Don't worry about it.

329
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:33,305
How was it?

330
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:34,805
No doubt about it.

331
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,605
We go paper, then scissors on that bus.

332
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:39,605
That is, we ride seven stations to Ohama Beach!

333
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,205
That settles it, then.

334
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,505
I'm sure that Tsukasa is at that beach.

335
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,505
The ocean's come into view.

336
00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:59,505
Okay, we're almost there.

337
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:08,705
It's the ocean, the ocean!

338
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,105
We didn't come here to have fun, you know!

339
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:13,005
Let's split up and look for him.

340
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:14,505
Let me know as soon as you find him.

341
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:16,405
-Okay! -Let's go, too.

342
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:17,405
Okay.

343
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,305
Please! We've got to find him!

344
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,005
Tsukasa.

345
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:48,505
We've finally found the last page.

346
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:50,805
Tsukasa?

347
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,505
You're Tsukasa Naito from 1st grade class A, right?

348
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,805
Who are you two?

349
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,305
We're from Teitan Elementary School, just like you.

350
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,905
I'm Conan Edogawa.

351
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:03,205
I'm Ayumi Yoshida.

352
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:04,205
We...

353
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:05,405
The ocean, the ocean!

354
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,805
So there you are, Tsukasa!

355
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:12,005
We've come all the way here, so let's play here for a while.

356
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:13,005
Why not?

357
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:14,105
You too, Tsukasa!

358
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,205
-Huh? Okay. -Let's sumo wrestle!

359
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:21,905
Okay. Let's play sumo!

360
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:25,405
You're not going to get me!

361
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:26,805
He's fired up!

362
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:30,805
Bring it!

363
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:31,905
I'm ready when you are!

364
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,405
Tsukasa looks to be having fun.

365
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:35,905
Yeah.

366
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:39,005
But how did you figure out he was here?

367
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:40,605
The ocean in that picture

368
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:42,605
looked just like the padded cloth page in the book.

369
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:44,805
Is that all?

370
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:46,105
I thought that there must a reason

371
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:49,705
for Tsukasa to rip a page off the book and steal the stone.

372
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:54,405
So I thought of what he might want back despite doing all that he did.

373
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:56,305
The conclusion was...

374
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,505
His mother?

375
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:59,205
Yes.

376
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:04,605
Tsukasa wanted to use the power of the stone to get his mother back.

377
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,705
I guess all the rest was thanks to Mitsuhiko's deduction.

378
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:10,605
-Hey. -Tsukasa!

379
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:15,705
Daddy?

380
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:18,905
What about the shop?

381
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,605
It's okay.

382
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:21,905
How?

383
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:24,005
How did you know I was here?

384
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:26,105
This led me here.

385
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:30,105
"Ohama Beach"

386
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:33,005
I'm sorry, Daddy.

387
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:37,005
I thought that I could see Mommy if I came here.

388
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:54,005
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,105
Tsukasa.

390
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,505
Now that I'm here, I'm hungry again.

391
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:19,005
Mr. Naito, will you make me some grilled chicken again?

392
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:21,005
Come on, Genta!

393
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:22,105
It's okay.

394
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:23,905
Be friends with Tsukasa from now on too, okay?

395
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:26,805
Yeah, you can count on me!

396
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:58,005
Did you find this, Tsukasa?

397
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,005
Ms. Kobayashi.

398
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,505
-Well... -Thank you.

399
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:05,805
We were all looking for it too, but we couldn't find it anywhere.

400
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:17,105
Ms. Kobayashi, I took the stone.

401
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:23,505
I'm happy you decided to tell the truth.

402
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:26,005
But don't ever do something like this again, okay?

403
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:29,405
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:36,105
Ms. Kobayashi, please look through my homework.

405
00:23:36,105 --> 00:23:38,405
How fast.

406
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:39,605
"Delicious!"

407
00:23:39,605 --> 00:23:42,205
Is this your book report?

408
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:43,905
Doesn't it look good?

409
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:45,905
Come on, Genta!

410
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:48,205
Our homework is to hand in a book report.

411
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:51,205
That's more like a picture diary.

412
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:52,705
Just as would be expected of Genta.

413
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:56,005
I mean, is eating all he has in mind?

414
00:23:57,605 --> 00:23:58,805
"Next Episode"

415
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:03,105
A popular musician is found dead by a river.

416
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:05,205
"Roku Itagaki (22)"

417
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:10,105
Then suddenly, a father and child shows up at Pops' detective agency.

418
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:13,705
The boy says that he witnessed the killer.

419
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:18,105
He says that he saw the picture of a nail on the killer's arm, but...

420
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:27,605
Next Conan, "The Shadow of the Black Organization: The Little Witness"

421
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:45,205
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:47,805
"A hammer that flashes"

423
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:49,005
The Black Organization appears!

424
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,605
Each and every colour is mixed.

425
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,505
That's the colour of the organization.
