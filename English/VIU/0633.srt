1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:04,267
The timekeeper sends a threat letter.

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,967
The contents warn that Mrs. Rukako Hoshina,

3
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:08,567
owner of the Building of Clocks,

4
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:12,567
will be killed during her birthday.

5
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:16,167
We were invited to the party

6
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,767
along with Pops who was asked to protect her.

7
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,567
But at the ring of the 6:00 chime,

8
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,267
she ended up being killed by someone.

9
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:30,167
The culprit seems to have stabbed Rukako's chest

10
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:32,467
with a sharp object like an ice pick

11
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:35,167
and fled from the balcony.

12
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,267
However, the weird thing was that no footprints

13
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:42,367
were left on the ground that was wet with rain.

14
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:45,067
A life was also lost at her birthday party

15
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:47,867
that was held at the Hoshina residence four years ago.

16
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:50,967
A clock technician who was repairing the grand clock fell,

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,067
but the search for his body was delayed because of her party.

18
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:56,667
Ran is terrified

19
00:00:56,667 --> 00:01:00,267
that the Timekeeper is the ghost of the clock technician that died,

20
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,167
but she's wrong.

21
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:05,567
I'll reveal the true identity of the culprit at all cost!

22
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,867
Like the fog clears.

23
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,767
Let's see through love and crime as well!

24
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,767
A blackmail warning that time will be stopped is delivered.

25
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,867
Fear sweeps through the birthday party.

26
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,467
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:20,267
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,667
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:06,632
"The Blade of the Timekeeper (Part 2)".

30
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,332
So you're an architect.

31
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,632
I'm Karube,

32
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:15,932
the one who designed this building.

33
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:20,332
Your hands and sleeves have blood on them.

34
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:21,932
It probably got there

35
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:24,832
when I ran over to Mrs. Hoshina who fell to the floor.

36
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:28,532
But there's no blood anywhere else is there?

37
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:29,732
No.

38
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:31,732
And? Is there anything

39
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:34,132
that you noticed at the time of the crime?

40
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:35,732
Come to think of it,

41
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:37,132
"Karube Teigo (45)" -I think I heard something like cloth

42
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:39,732
"Architect" -being rubbed against something approaching,

43
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:43,132
so the culprit could be a woman who is wearing a dress.

44
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:47,332
By the way, the mouthpiece of your pipe

45
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,732
also looks long and sharp.

46
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:52,332
Is it all right if I check it?

47
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,932
Hey! Enough already!

48
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,932
It's true that the clock technician who died four years ago

49
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:00,232
was my older brother,

50
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:03,232
so I have the most motive to be the killer

51
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:05,632
but that was an unfortunate accident!

52
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:08,532
I had no grudge against Mrs. Hoshina.

53
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:13,132
But you were given charge of decorating the interior of this building.

54
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:16,432
Therefore, you could've rigged this place any way you wanted to.

55
00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:19,632
"Suou Chiaki (39)" -As to that, Mr. Karube the architect,

56
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:21,632
"Interior Designer" -as well as Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

57
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:23,132
would also be in the same boat.

58
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:27,532
But I guess Mr. Furugaki who is quite aged shouldn't be included.

59
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:29,132
Why not?

60
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:31,732
The culprit after stabbing Mrs. Hoshina,

61
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:36,032
went pass my left side quite swiftly!

62
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:41,032
So, see, there is a smear of blood on my left arm, isn't there?

63
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:44,232
By the way, the thing that you're wearing in your hair...

64
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:48,932
This is a hairpin that my older brother bought for me some time ago.

65
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:51,532
May I check it, please?

66
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:53,932
You can check it all you want!

67
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,332
I mean it's not a samurai movie or anything,

68
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,332
so I couldn't possibly have a sword or the like on me.

69
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,632
I guess not.

70
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,332
It was you, wasn't it?

71
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:09,632
The clock technician that made that grand clock.

72
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:11,732
Yeah, I'm Furugaki.

73
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:13,532
Your right shoulder

74
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:15,732
seems to have a bit of splattered blood on it.

75
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,132
"Furugaki Rinsaku (64), Clock Technician"

76
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:21,932
It seems that woman was stabbed to my right, so...

77
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:23,532
I could care less,

78
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,632
but I think the culprit is someone who is quite fat.

79
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:30,332
Just before that woman screamed,

80
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:34,732
I was pushed by a soft resilient body.

81
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:39,132
It... it's true that I'm 78 kilograms,

82
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:40,932
and a little plump,

83
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:45,132
but does that have anything to do with the incident?

84
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,732
No, this is just in case.

85
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:50,832
By the way, Mr. Oume,

86
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:54,332
about this knife beside the cake...

87
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:57,132
Your fingerprints have been detected on it.

88
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,132
"Oume Gakumichi (42)" -Of course!

89
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:00,632
"Hoshina Family Butler" -As a steward,

90
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:03,932
my job is to cut the cake, you see.

91
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:05,832
After the candle lights went out,

92
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,632
the lights weren't turned on immediately,

93
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:09,232
why?

94
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:12,632
That's because Mrs. Hoshina didn't signal for the lights to be turned on.

95
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,932
If as usual, after she blows out the candles,

96
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:17,432
the 6:00 bell would ring.

97
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:18,932
After it rings,

98
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,632
Mrs. Hoshina snaps her fingers to signal the lights to be turned on,

99
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,332
and that's when they're turned on.

100
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:25,032
But back then,

101
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:28,332
the clock didn't ring right away either, did it?

102
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:29,632
No.

103
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,632
Although the three who were glued to the clocks

104
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,432
that were about to be delayed,

105
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:37,032
all said that the clocks rang on time.

106
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:38,532
More than that,

107
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,732
you seem to have been close to Mrs. Hoshina

108
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,932
and yet, no blood is splattered on you.

109
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,832
Maybe it's because the culprit was a big person?

110
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:50,832
That's why no blood is splattered on me.

111
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:58,732
A person wearing a dress who can move swiftly, but is hefty and big...

112
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:02,032
Was there such a person among the guests?

113
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,132
No.

114
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,232
65 guests came to the party.

115
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:08,232
We checked them all, but there was no such person.

116
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:10,232
Besides, there were no guests that had anything

117
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:12,332
that looked to be a weapon on them either.

118
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,532
Yes.

119
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:15,532
Well, it seems that no luminol reaction was found

120
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:18,432
from the belongings of the four.

121
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:21,132
In other words, just as the threat letter put it,

122
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:25,032
it was an "invisible blade" that committed the murder.

123
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:26,932
I guess so.

124
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,232
The blood that was on the railing and the window frame

125
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:34,932
was Mrs. Hoshina's, right?

126
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:36,132
Yeah.

127
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:39,032
I don't know how the culprit got Mrs. Hoshina's blood on the railing

128
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:40,432
before committing the crime,

129
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:43,232
but if he wanted to make it look like he fled from the window,

130
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:46,632
there's no mistake that the blood was smeared on beforehand.

131
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,332
But isn't it strange?

132
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:51,932
If the culprit's going to make it look like he fled from here,

133
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:56,632
it would look more real if he put an obvious bloody shoe print behind

134
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:59,432
than this smeared trace of blood.

135
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:01,032
True.

136
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,832
Maybe he thought if something more obvious was left behind,

137
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:05,832
it would be disclosed before the crime was committed?

138
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:09,932
Hey, hey! It's already 12:00 midnight?

139
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:13,632
I see. That room's right below the grand clock.

140
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,232
No, wrong!

141
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:23,632
The blood wasn't put there beforehand!

142
00:08:23,632 --> 00:08:26,432
The Timekeeper really passed through here at the time of the crime.

143
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:30,032
Just as his planned!

144
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:35,132
As a result of checking you all,

145
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:38,332
there was no one with a hidden weapon on them

146
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:42,832
nor was there anyone with a large amount of blood on.

147
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:45,232
So, you may leave for today,

148
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:48,632
and tomorrow we will be performing a detailed interrogation.

149
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:52,232
And,

150
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,632
you have nothing to say about this, do you, Mr. Mouri?

151
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:56,232
No.

152
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:59,032
It seems that more than the mystery of the murder weapon disappearing,

153
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:02,332
it would be better to consider and figure out

154
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:04,532
the trick of how the culprit got away from the balcony

155
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:06,432
without leaving any footprints behind.

156
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,932
Dad?

157
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:14,032
I'm spinning around and around.

158
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,832
I spin around!

159
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:18,132
-Watch out! -Oh, no!

160
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,532
Just what do you think you're doing?

161
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:25,332
You'll fall!

162
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,632
Right.

163
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:30,732
I was almost about to fall

164
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:33,632
for the scheme that the culprit set up

165
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:35,832
while snickering inside this room!

166
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:40,232
So, the culprit is in this room after all?

167
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:42,532
Mr. Mouri.

168
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:43,632
It bothers me

169
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:47,332
that the culprit's footprints aren't found below the balcony,

170
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:51,832
but it's unthinkable that the culprit is in here.

171
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:53,332
All right then,

172
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:56,832
I shall show you by means of evidence now!

173
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:59,232
-Prove by evidence? -Yes.

174
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,632
It'll take some time to make preparations, though.

175
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:05,132
So, will you Inspector, and the guests go outside the room?

176
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:14,432
I wonder how long they expect to make us wait.

177
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:17,032
It seems that a young officer and the steward

178
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,432
are going in and out of the room from a while ago.

179
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,732
I wonder if he's really going to be able to prove it.

180
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:23,832
To kill a person without getting blood on himself

181
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,532
and get rid of the murder weapon at the same time?

182
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:30,632
How dare he locks me out of the room too?

183
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:33,432
He better have a darn good deduction or he's going to get it.

184
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,332
Thank you for waiting!

185
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:36,932
The room's ready.

186
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:39,732
Please enter the room, everyone!

187
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:43,132
Inspector!

188
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:46,432
Please hang this around your neck, Inspector.

189
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:51,832
Is this the wristwatch light that Conan always has on him?

190
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:53,132
Yes.

191
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,932
We're going to have you play the role

192
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:57,132
of the victim who was killed, Inspector.

193
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:58,532
That's to be used in place of the necklace

194
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,632
that had fluorescent paint on it.

195
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,132
Nothing seems to be all that different.

196
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:10,232
True.

197
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,932
The only thing difference if anything is that

198
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,432
the boy with the glasses

199
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:17,432
is standing in front of the window that is closed.

200
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:22,332
I have no idea what you're planning to do,

201
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,132
but please hurry it up, will you?

202
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:26,732
Hey, what?

203
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:30,132
We're replaying the scene of the crime.

204
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:32,232
First, the lights of the room go out.

205
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,332
And the cake was brought in, correct?

206
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:35,832
Yes, sir.

207
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:38,332
Okay, Inspector, when I signal you,

208
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,932
please blow out the candles just as the victim did.

209
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:45,832
3, 2, 1.

210
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:47,232
Okay!

211
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:54,332
Who is it that just hit my head with a stick?

212
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:02,432
Hey, hey, what's with this experiment?

213
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:06,132
It's no use making believe to open the window and flee outside!

214
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:09,032
I saw the stick that hit me!

215
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:11,732
So, the one who's still holding the stick

216
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,532
-is surely the one who hit me! -I'm sorry.

217
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:18,332
I'm the one who hit you just now, Inspector.

218
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:20,832
Don't be ridiculous, Conan!

219
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:23,632
You don't even have a stick on you in the first place.

220
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:25,932
Of course I don't have one.

221
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:27,632
Because the stick I hit you with

222
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:29,832
flew out the window and disappeared.

223
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,932
What?

224
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,323
Is it true,

225
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,523
that the stick came flying?

226
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:40,623
Yes, sir!

227
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:43,223
But the thing that came flying wasn't a stick.

228
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:45,523
It was an umbrella that was pulled by a string.

229
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:46,523
An umbrella?

230
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:50,423
Hey, is it true?

231
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:53,123
Yes, sir! It's this umbrella!

232
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:56,523
Well, it took a while to get everything ready.

233
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:59,123
I had to have the steward get a long string ready

234
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:00,823
and ask a clock technician

235
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:06,723
to advance the hands of the grand clock to 6:00 the time of the crime.

236
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:09,223
The clock?

237
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,823
Just what do you mean?

238
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,223
Here's the trick.

239
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:15,223
First, you get a long string

240
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:17,523
and tie a weight part way of it,

241
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:21,923
and hook on a ring that slides easily to one tip of the string.

242
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,223
Then you hook the ring onto the decoration

243
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:24,723
at the tip of the short hand of the grand clock

244
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:27,923
by pulling the string through.

245
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,423
As for the side with the weight on it,

246
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:33,523
you hang it over the railing of the balcony.

247
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,923
And the tip on the other side of the string

248
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:39,223
is pulled into the room from the space between the window.

249
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,523
The culprit waits for the room lights to go out and it gets dark

250
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:43,923
so the candles on the cake can be blown out.

251
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,123
After the string that is pulled into the room

252
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:47,523
is tied to the handle of the umbrella,

253
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:49,923
all is ready.

254
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:52,223
All that's left to do is for Conan to hit the Inspector on the head

255
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:55,723
a few seconds before it becomes 6:00.

256
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:57,123
A few seconds afterwards,

257
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:59,823
the short hand of the grand clock will face straight down,

258
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:00,823
and the ring with the string on it will come out

259
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,423
from the space of the decoration, and the ring will slide off.

260
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:05,823
The weight that was hanging falls

261
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,623
and the umbrella that is pulled pushes the window open

262
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:11,323
and falls below the balcony.

263
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:13,823
That's how it disappeared from the room.

264
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:15,623
Mr. Mouri,

265
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:19,123
there was no murder weapon or weight on the ground, you know.

266
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:21,523
Besides, if such a string were to be hanging,

267
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:24,523
wouldn't somebody has noticed it?

268
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:28,323
What if the string were to be a thin fishing line that is barely visible,

269
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:30,523
and the weight that was tied part way of the string

270
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:36,823
is inside the grid of the well that is right below the grand clock?

271
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:38,023
I see!

272
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:39,823
The murder weapon that was pulled by the weight

273
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:42,623
is sucked in as is into the well!

274
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,923
Yeah,

275
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:47,123
and since that well is scheduled to be gotten rid of week after next

276
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:51,023
that the culprit figured the murder weapon would be buried forever.

277
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:55,323
Why wasn't blood splattered on the culprit, then?

278
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:56,623
Come to think of it,

279
00:14:56,623 --> 00:15:00,123
there were a lot of testimony about the image of the culprit, no?

280
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:02,023
The culprit is big, fat,

281
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:05,323
and moves swiftly, a woman wearing a dress.

282
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:06,523
The fact is,

283
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,123
all this was pointing to the murder weapon!

284
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:10,823
The murder weapon?

285
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,023
You thought the culprit moved swiftly

286
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:18,323
because the murder weapon with blood on it blew out of the window.

287
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:21,923
The umbrella was thought to be huge when it's opened,

288
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:25,423
it covers quite a large area.

289
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,323
And the testimony about the culprit being fat

290
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:29,523
was because when the murder weapon was pushed against the body,

291
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:32,023
it feels bouncy.

292
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:34,823
Since the murder weapon was covered with cloth,

293
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:38,523
the sound of the cloth of the dress rubbing against each other was heard.

294
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:41,523
What on earth is that murder weapon anyway?

295
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:48,123
This, the same one that I hit you with, Inspector!

296
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:49,123
Umbrella?

297
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:52,123
See, if you attach a sharp murder weapon

298
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:55,223
on the tip with a screw or something,

299
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:58,223
even if the culprit stabbed Mrs. Hoshina with this and pulled it out,

300
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,823
no blood would splatter, right?

301
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:02,623
Right, Pops?

302
00:16:02,623 --> 00:16:06,123
But, the party was being held.

303
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:08,423
Bringing an umbrella in would be conspicuous, wouldn't it?

304
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:12,023
No, not if it was secretly hidden in his pocket or something.

305
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:14,323
Mr. Karube,

306
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,423
like the folding umbrella you have!

307
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:25,023
But Mr. Mouri,

308
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:29,023
although it's true that you can avoid blood being splattered...

309
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:33,423
After that, wouldn't it take time to fold the umbrella?

310
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:35,223
True.

311
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:37,723
When Mrs. Hoshina screamed,

312
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:39,723
it wasn't a long time before the bell of the grand clock

313
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:41,723
was heard, was it?

314
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:45,423
The umbrella can be folded in an instant.

315
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:48,623
If he didn't care about the blood that would get on his hands,

316
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:49,723
and narrowed the umbrella

317
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:52,123
and use the rubber band or whatever he had on his wrist to hold it down.

318
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:54,023
I see.

319
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:57,923
That's why Mr. Karube had quite a lot of blood on both his hands!

320
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:59,323
Yes.

321
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:00,923
If you, the one who was the last one

322
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:03,323
to close the door of the face of the clock,

323
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,523
you could've hooked the string onto the short hand of the clock.

324
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:09,923
After that, you said you were going to pray before the well,

325
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,123
so you could've pulled the string

326
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,723
that was hanging to the ground over to the well

327
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:15,823
and attach the weight, while pretending to pray.

328
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:19,423
Since you're the one who designed the building,

329
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:24,023
it would've been easy for you to tell how long the string should be.

330
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:28,723
You were touching Mrs. Hoshina's flashlight wristwatch before the crime,

331
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:30,523
so you could've moved the clock a few seconds fast

332
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,723
and after Mrs. Hoshina blew out the candle,

333
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:35,523
you could've used the few seconds before the grand clock rang

334
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:38,623
to commit the murder!

335
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:40,623
But Mr. Karube was the one

336
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:43,823
who said that he heard the sound of cloth being rubbed, right?

337
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,123
If he were the culprit, I wonder if he'd say anything

338
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:48,023
that would make people imagine an umbrella?

339
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,623
He deliberately said it.

340
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:54,123
He deliberately mixed some truth in his testimony to mislead us.

341
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:57,623
That is, that the culprit could be a woman who was wearing a dress.

342
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:58,823
If he lied about everything,

343
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:01,923
he would be the only one saying something different from all the others

344
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:04,523
and would be suspected.

345
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:05,623
But...

346
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:09,323
But when all the others didn't want to cooperate

347
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:11,723
and wanted to leave, Mr. Karube stopped them, didn't he?

348
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,523
He said let's cooperate with the police

349
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,423
for the sake of the late Mrs. Hoshina!

350
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,723
I think he would've gone home then, if he were the culprit.

351
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,223
True.

352
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:23,723
He couldn't leave even if he wanted to.

353
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:27,223
Because it suddenly began to rain again.

354
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,123
The umbrella that he brought when he came here

355
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:30,423
was used as the murder weapon,

356
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,323
and is in the well right now.

357
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:34,423
If he left at that time,

358
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:38,923
we would find out that the umbrella he was supposed to have is gone.

359
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:40,823
Too bad,

360
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:42,623
if you had assumed it may turn out this way

361
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,623
and prepared another umbrella...

362
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:49,623
No, I actually had another umbrella ready in my bag.

363
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:56,923
It seems that my wife took that extra umbrella out of my bag.

364
00:18:56,923 --> 00:19:01,723
There was a memo written, "One umbrella will do, won't it?"

365
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,523
Well, it was the rain that I had been waiting for some time too,

366
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:07,623
so I failed to double check because I was so pressed

367
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:09,323
to carry out what I wanted to do.

368
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:11,023
That's where I went wrong too.

369
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:13,023
You were waiting for some time?

370
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,223
Does that mean that you've been planning this murder since two years ago

371
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,823
when the threat letter was first delivered here?

372
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,823
Yes. If it rains,

373
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:23,223
I could deceive everyone about the footprints of the culprit

374
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:24,723
not being there,

375
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:27,023
and none of the guests would go out on the balcony

376
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:28,323
where there is no roof either.

377
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:31,423
So, I didn't have to worry about my trick being disclosed.

378
00:19:31,423 --> 00:19:35,723
Well, I was a little flustered when it stopped raining

379
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:37,323
before I committed the crime.

380
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:40,323
You're admitting that you committed the crime, then?

381
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:41,623
Yes.

382
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:44,723
Mrs. Hoshina's blood and my fingerprints

383
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:49,123
are probably all over the umbrella that I dropped into the well.

384
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:50,623
But, why?

385
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,423
Why did you kill her?

386
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:56,723
Doesn't my wanting to avenge

387
00:19:56,723 --> 00:20:02,923
the death of my childhood friend clock technician suffice?

388
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:07,123
But, wasn't you who said at my big brother's funeral

389
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,623
that it was an unfortunate accident?

390
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:14,123
That is, until that funeral day,

391
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:18,423
when I heard her voice.

392
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:21,923
Hey, just what do you mean?

393
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:26,123
Why hasn't a clock technician to take his place been found yet?

394
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:28,323
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:30,923
Thinking of the clock technician who passed away,

396
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:33,323
I just couldn't get myself to look for someone else yet.

397
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:34,623
I've said time again, haven't I?

398
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:36,323
That a broke clock needs to be disposed of

399
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:37,923
and a new one needs to be bought to replace it!

400
00:20:37,923 --> 00:20:40,623
The same goes for clock technicians!

401
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:42,923
Oh, my...

402
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:46,123
He loved clocks more than anyone else.

403
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:50,223
So, you're a clock technician here?

404
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:51,723
Yeah!

405
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:53,323
Are you going to do okay, though?

406
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:56,223
I hear the lady here is really strict when it comes to time.

407
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,323
Sure, I'll be just fine!

408
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,523
Being around someone strict like her makes my work even more worth it.

409
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:04,223
Besides, not one clock had been disposed of since I came!

410
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,423
After all, my heart and soul

411
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:10,623
are in all the clocks here and are like family!

412
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:12,923
I'm really all for this job!

413
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:16,523
Brother...

414
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:26,823
Maybe rather than wanting to avenge his death,

415
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:30,323
what I really wanted to do was save them

416
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,523
from the ruler of time.

417
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:34,823
His so-called family.

418
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:57,923
Clocks...

419
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:00,823
They are indispensible partners for people

420
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:03,323
who need them to live every day.

421
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:05,723
Though they may sometimes be late.

422
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:08,723
Genta, you're late!

423
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:09,823
Sorry!

424
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,523
My alarm clock wasn't working right.

425
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:17,123
Don't tell me you're still using that old clock.

426
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:18,123
Yeah!

427
00:23:18,123 --> 00:23:20,523
My late grandma gave it to me,

428
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:23,923
so if I dispose of it, I'll be cursed.

429
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:26,023
If that clock is precious,

430
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:27,923
I guess we'll overlook you being late.

431
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:31,523
After all, clocks keep ticking away and working

432
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:35,123
even while we're sleeping.

433
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:39,123
Geez, Conan sure is late.

434
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:41,223
We've got to get going soon,

435
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:44,823
or it'll be night by the time we get to the camping site.

436
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,923
Maybe he's still asleep.

437
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:53,223
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...

438
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,423
"Next Episode" -Ma'am!

439
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:56,923
Bring everybody one drink each, will you?

440
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:58,323
My, my.

441
00:23:58,323 --> 00:24:00,723
Aren't you generous, sir?

442
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:04,023
I think Dad recently frequents this area to get his drink fix.

443
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:08,123
Amazing how they can drink with all this smoke.

444
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:14,223
Which means, one of the customers killed the woman owner.

445
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,223
Next Conan,

446
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:22,623
"The Scene of the Crime is a Super Cramped Shop".
