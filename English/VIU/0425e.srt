1
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,263
You shot the sprinkler and broke it

2
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:23,063
to make them think that it started to rain,

3
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,963
and prevented those guys from going through with their plan

4
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:30,364
by making the crowd as well as the target to use their umbrellas.

5
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:35,963
It's no wonder you respect this boy.

6
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:38,864
I'd like to scout him to the bureau myself.

7
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:45,363
He's James!

8
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:47,563
You've met him once before, haven't you?

9
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,563
Conan.

10
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:52,363
The last I saw you was that Panda car incident?

11
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:55,263
You were a life saver then!

12
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,463
Panda?

13
00:00:57,464 --> 00:00:58,963
What?

14
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:00,063
It's true!

15
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:02,263
James left behind for us.

16
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:06,763
I'm telling you that the code "P&A" means police car!

17
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:10,663
So, why does "P&A" mean police car?

18
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:15,063
Try changing the "&" in "P&A" into the alphabet!

19
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:16,763
Let's see.

20
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:19,463
P&A.

21
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:21,763
P and a, n, d and a.

22
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:24,263
Panda?

23
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:26,863
I see! Panda!

24
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:28,163
I see.

25
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:31,463
The color of a police car is black and white.

26
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:32,663
Hey! Hurry!

27
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:34,763
Use the hostage as a shield and run for it!

28
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:36,064
Okay!

29
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,863
Help!

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,263
What the...

31
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,963
Officer!

32
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,864
Please help us!

33
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:51,363
Excuse me!

34
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:53,063
I'm Officer Takagi from headquarters!

35
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:56,163
Please help us arrest the kidnapper!

36
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,663
Darn it, that almost scared me.

37
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:02,564
Okay, after keeping them company for a while, take a side road!

38
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:06,763
Okay, got them!

39
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:10,264
Okay. It's about time we take a side road.

40
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:14,463
If there's no road to the left, take the right!

41
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:17,363
But...

42
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:19,563
There's another police car to the right too!

43
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:21,063
Then, reverse!

44
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:22,963
Slow down and reverse.

45
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,863
There's a police car behind too.

46
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:26,963
What?

47
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:29,763
Hey, we're completely...

48
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:32,264
surrounded by cops!

49
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:43,363
So, this James guy is also an FBI agent.

50
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:49,463
But why are they going after Yasuteru Domon who's not even a Dietman?

51
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:52,663
Probably because his father used to be a famous government official,

52
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:54,263
he's well known in the world of politics.

53
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:56,063
He's got charisma

54
00:02:56,064 --> 00:03:00,063
and is a solid clump of righteousness.

55
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:03,963
Rumor already has it that he's a candidate for the future Prime Minister.

56
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:05,063
I see.

57
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:07,563
They want to get rid of anyone that is bound to resist against them

58
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:09,563
while still a bud.

59
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,663
That's how they work.

60
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,763
Besides, if they kill him now,

61
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,863
they can make it look like Kiriko Busujima did it.

62
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,363
Kiriko Busujima?

63
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:25,263
Yes. A woman executive of the Deisan Organization

64
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:29,563
that is suspected of having sent out a sniper to kill him.

65
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:31,064
I see.

66
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:38,363
Take a left at the next intersection.

67
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:41,263
Well? Anything from them?

68
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,464
No. Still too early for anything.

69
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:47,163
By the way,

70
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:49,563
do you know where Shuichi is?

71
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:54,063
Yeah. I'm looking for him too.

72
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:57,063
You explained this to him, didn't you?

73
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:58,263
Yes.

74
00:03:58,264 --> 00:04:02,063
Including info about the transmitter and wiretap that this boy set up.

75
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:04,464
This is what he said over the phone.

76
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,263
I see.

77
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:10,963
That's it.

78
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:14,563
I haven't heard a word from him since.

79
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:17,363
Ever since he lost his girlfriend,

80
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:19,963
it seems he's got a tendency to close up like a clam.

81
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:23,264
Not that he had an open heart to begin with, though.

82
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:26,963
I hear him.

83
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:28,064
This voice is...

84
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:35,163
At about 16:00, DJ will pass over and cross a bridge.

85
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:37,663
That's where he's going to be assassinated.

86
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:39,064
Gin!

87
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:47,661
Chianti and Korn, you both go around to support this time.

88
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,761
What? Support?

89
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:52,261
I want to shoot.

90
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:54,761
Well, think about it.

91
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,761
He's riding a specially ordered bulletproof car.

92
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:00,261
It's not the same as killing him in the park.

93
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:01,761
But...

94
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:04,861
Besides, he's tightly guarded on both sides by bodyguards

95
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:08,361
who have been trained in the Self-Defense Force.

96
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:12,261
The 7.62 mm bullet may pierce though the thinnest part of the car.

97
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:15,361
Though the thinnest side window.

98
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:18,161
But will not reach DJ.

99
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:20,561
Then, how do you intend to kill him?

100
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:24,961
Do you might me to stand on the bridge stark naked and hitchhike,

101
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:28,361
then get myself in his car or something?

102
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,361
My, Chianti. That's pretty good thinking.

103
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:32,961
Vermouth?

104
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:33,962
I'm going to ride this motorbike

105
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:37,961
and fall right in front of DJ's car and stop him.

106
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,361
When he comes out of the car,

107
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:43,261
I'll come from behind

108
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:45,061
and get him.

109
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:50,061
The job of you both is to get rid of the two bodyguards

110
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,461
that come out of the car together with DJ.

111
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:59,261
But I wonder if that cautious man will come out of the car that easily.

112
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,961
Don't worry.

113
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,761
If a woman bleeds from her head

114
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:07,161
after her helmet flies off and is lying on the ground.

115
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:11,261
A man of justice such as he is will probably come dashing over, no?

116
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,362
What?

117
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:17,161
Cut out the joke!

118
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:19,661
There are going to be other cars on the bridge too.

119
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:22,861
If a famous actress like you expose your face.

120
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,261
Idiot.

121
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:26,161
I'm going to be exposing...

122
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,662
This face!

123
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:32,461
Kiriko Busujima of the Deisan Organization!

124
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:34,061
Just as would be expected of you, Vermouth.

125
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,961
You're a complete duplicate.

126
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,261
I see.

127
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:40,661
That's why you've come out front.

128
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:42,961
Where's the place?

129
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,161
Gin.

130
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:48,162
We're going to kill DJ at Vane B.

131
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:52,062
Bein B?

132
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,461
Bein B?

133
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:06,661
Is that the next assassination site?

134
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:09,261
Yeah. The time is 16:00.

135
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,961
It seems that they're going to kill Mr. Domon

136
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:14,361
when his car passes over a bridge somewhere.

137
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:19,061
In other words, the "B" of Bein B means bridge?

138
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:22,161
But if we can't specify which bridge it is,

139
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,561
we can't stop the assassination.

140
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:25,361
Quiet!

141
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,861
They're checking the map now.

142
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:31,661
Maybe they'll say the name of the place.

143
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,461
Korn, you position yourself here.

144
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:36,361
Chianti, you go here.

145
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:40,161
We're counting on you both!

146
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:43,261
Where's my motorbike?

147
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,361
Oh, yes.

148
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:46,561
Behind that container.

149
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:47,562
Thank you.

150
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:51,261
Let's get together in the foreground of Vane B.

151
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,262
Hey, Kir.

152
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,562
Don't tell me that you...

153
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,762
I hope you're not. Are you?

154
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:05,761
Idiot.

155
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,662
Of course not.

156
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:13,262
What is it?

157
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,061
Well, I'll go on ahead.

158
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:22,661
Make sure you back me up if something comes up.

159
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:24,761
I have a bad feeling

160
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:27,661
about this assassination scheme.

161
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:29,261
Leave it to me.

162
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:32,961
If things start looking bad and you're in danger of falling in their hands,

163
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:36,661
I won't hesitate firing a bullet right through your head.

164
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:40,861
Yes. If such time comes, make sure you aim at my face, okay?

165
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:43,061
You don't want the world to know that

166
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,961
I was part of the assassination scheme, do you?

167
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:46,662
Things will turn out badly, right?

168
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:51,261
Is there something bothering you, Vermouth?

169
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:52,361
No.

170
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:54,961
It's just this feeling I have.

171
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,362
Don't worry about it.

172
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:05,861
Okay.

173
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:08,362
Let's get going too.

174
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:15,861
Okay, I don't know how much you know.

175
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:18,562
But I wonder if you can stop me?

176
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:23,061
My dearest...

177
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,462
Silver Bullet?

178
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:30,961
So, we don't know where the location is.

179
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:32,061
Yeah.

180
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:35,561
The sound is getting worse from a while ago.

181
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:39,161
The only clue we have is that it's on a bridge somewhere.

182
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,961
Maybe we can find out by calling Mr. Domon's election office

183
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,861
and asking them

184
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:47,061
where he's headed for now

185
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:49,261
and what bridge he'll be crossing.

186
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:51,361
I called them several times but...

187
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:53,461
They won't tell me.

188
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:54,961
Since I was quite persistent,

189
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,661
they seem to suspect me of being up to no good.

190
00:09:57,662 --> 00:09:58,861
Well...

191
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:01,761
Unless we find out what the "Bein" of Bein B is.

192
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:04,561
This bad direction of the wind won't change.

193
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,161
Direction of the wind?

194
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:09,761
Bein sounds a lot like V. A. I. N.

195
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:14,461
Which means useless, worthless, and conceited.

196
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:18,061
I wonder if there was a place with that sort of name in Tokyo?

197
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:19,761
No, that's not it.

198
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:22,061
It's not V. A. I. N.

199
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,761
But V. A. N. E. As in Vane!

200
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:28,761
What? You mean the vane as in weathervane or a windmill?

201
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,861
Yeah.

202
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,861
A word that at the same time means the arrow feather of a bow.

203
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:36,961
The name of a place around here that suggests an arrow feather is.

204
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:38,261
Toriya-cho!

205
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,061
In other words, Vane B is Toriya Bridge!

206
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:43,161
That is Toriya Grand Bridge!

207
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:44,761
That's good news!

208
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:47,461
We still have two hours till 16:00,

209
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:49,361
the scheduled time of the assassination!

210
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:52,361
We finally get to take the lead!

211
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:55,261
There are a total of six of them,

212
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:56,661
three women and three men!

213
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:59,161
The two women will be riding motorbikes

214
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:01,861
and the remaining four will come on two different cars.

215
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,161
One of which is a Porsche 365A.

216
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:08,761
Let's send the investigator's vehicle to the bridge on the double

217
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:12,561
and block off all the roads leading to the bridge for now.

218
00:11:12,562 --> 00:11:14,561
We're going to round them up, right?

219
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:18,361
No, we're going to stay low and sneak up from behind.

220
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:21,262
And make sure we fish them all without fail, one by one.

221
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:27,761
Geez!

222
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,961
Why do I, the Famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri,

223
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:33,861
have to play a TV game at your house, Dr. Agasa?

224
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:35,762
Well, no big thing, is it?

225
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,462
You didn't have anything to do anyway, did you?

226
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:40,961
Besides, that's a deduction game

227
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:43,161
that I developed that I'm quite confident of!

228
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,761
And there's no one else than you to be the first to try it out.

229
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:49,761
This game is filled with a lot of cases, isn't it?

230
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:51,661
This is already the third case.

231
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,461
Who cares?

232
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,961
Nobody's dying for real.

233
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,361
And if a bit of the painful feeling is felt by the player,

234
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:00,961
it's served its purpose.

235
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:04,061
Well, I wish people would keep homicides confined

236
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:06,261
to games and TV dramas.

237
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,861
The grief that one goes through when someone really dies

238
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:12,361
can't be compared to the one felt through games and TV dramas.

239
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:14,661
By the way, where's Conan?

240
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:17,261
Wasn't he with you, Dr. Agasa?

241
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:18,661
Oh, yes.

242
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,561
He went on home before us.

243
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:23,262
Because it started raining quite heavily.

244
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:26,561
I guess I'll start heading on home too, then.

245
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:29,561
I don't want Conan to be starving.

246
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,561
Well...

247
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:33,062
Don't go home!

248
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,361
Edogawa will be fine.

249
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:39,062
Don't worry about him.

250
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:44,262
So, don't go! Please!

251
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:52,662
-Ai. -Ai.

252
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:58,361
Okay, if you say so.

253
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,762
Then I'll stay.

254
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:11,144
Okay!

255
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:13,345
The vision's great here!

256
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:22,144
How about where you are, Korn?

257
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:24,345
Clear view.

258
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:29,044
Yes.

259
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,144
I'm already in position.

260
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:34,144
Okay! All we need to wait for is Kir.

261
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,244
Hey, Vodka.

262
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:38,945
I keep hearing static on your side.

263
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:42,245
No.

264
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:46,245
It's nothing.

265
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:59,944
Yes. Only a few minutes until we get there.

266
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:03,044
Let us know when you get there, Kir.

267
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,145
Roger!

268
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,444
Excuse me.

269
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:29,845
I'd like to ask you something.

270
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,245
Will you please stop your motorbike?

271
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,345
That is bad!

272
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,444
She's still breathing!

273
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:45,844
Rush her to the hospital!

274
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,045
Okay!

275
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:55,944
Rena Mizunashi?

276
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:58,745
What's Rena Mizunashi doing here?

277
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,244
According to your story,

278
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:02,344
wasn't the woman riding this motorbike

279
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:05,744
supposed to be Vermouth in disguise?

280
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,244
I thought so

281
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:08,944
because she was quite some distance away from the transmitter.

282
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:11,444
I thought for sure that was the case, but...

283
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,844
She changed into leather overalls and boots somewhere.

284
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:19,444
The transmitter and wiretap that are on her loafers are probably there.

285
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,445
But where did she change?

286
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:26,244
Not yet?

287
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,544
Gin.

288
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:30,044
Men who keep people waiting are not liked!

289
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,944
Hold your horses, Chianti.

290
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,144
We haven't got word from Kir yet.

291
00:16:34,145 --> 00:16:37,844
Besides, DJ's car is still...

292
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:39,244
This might not mean anything

293
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:42,344
but I can't hear a thing because your voice is full of static!

294
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:43,645
Static?

295
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,644
What's up?

296
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:48,045
Quiet.

297
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,844
What?

298
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:09,444
You're playing the game, Ran?

299
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,644
Yes.

300
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:13,544
And I don't see Mouri around.

301
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:17,944
Oh. He went home saying that

302
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,845
the main derby is going to start pretty soon.

303
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,344
What's the matter?

304
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,144
The transmitter switched off.

305
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:30,344
How? About the noise?

306
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:32,844
I can hear something faintly.

307
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:36,044
But the sound is muffled.

308
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:37,045
What?

309
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:38,544
Cancelled?

310
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:41,244
You telling us to quit after coming this far?

311
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:44,944
Yeah. I got boss' approval just now too.

312
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:48,244
To change the target.

313
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:50,244
Change?

314
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:52,644
Change the target?

315
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:54,245
And, where is it?

316
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,444
The next target.

317
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:02,444
The place is Beika-cho, Gochome.

318
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,445
Mouri Detective Agency.

319
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:08,244
Mouri Detective Agency?

320
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:10,744
The horses have turned the fourth corner

321
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:14,044
and are running the straight course!

322
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:16,344
What's this?

323
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,544
I'm hitting the bull's eye left and right today!

324
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:23,044
What? Two black cars together?

325
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:26,344
They are pulling away from Toriya Grand Bridge?

326
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:29,844
Are those cars really theirs?

327
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:33,044
Yes! One of it is a Porsche 356A.

328
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,844
And the other one is a Viper!

329
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:37,044
The Harley was abandoned.

330
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:40,044
So that who was riding the motorbike is probably also in the car.

331
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:42,344
It can't be!

332
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:43,345
I mean...

333
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:46,144
The car that Mr. Domon, their target is on,

334
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:50,544
is speeding right before our eyes at this moment.

335
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:52,645
It's not even on the bridge yet.

336
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:58,544
In which direction did the two cars head for?

337
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:00,345
Where are those cars headed?

338
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:05,144
They turned left on the intersection of Toriya Yonchome

339
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,544
and headed towards Haido-cho?

340
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:08,744
Strange.

341
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,644
They're headed back to where they failed to assassinate their target?

342
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:16,644
No. Those guys are probably headed for Beika-cho!

343
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,645
What?

344
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:21,144
They found the transmitter and wiretap!

345
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:24,444
Leave Mr. Domon's car up to the FBI agents car pursuing from behind,

346
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,344
and head for Beika-cho!

347
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:27,845
Pops is in danger!

348
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,344
What's going on with the car behind?

349
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:38,344
I was thinking it strange that they were tailing us close for some time.

350
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,644
Let them be!

351
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,844
If you get too nervous,

352
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:44,244
you won't be able to handle things when you'll really need to.

353
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:47,644
I'm really grateful for all you're doing for me.

354
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:51,344
Well, I, myself have become a man worthy of being protected by you two,

355
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:53,844
and overcome the fix that I'm in now too.

356
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:55,344
A fix?

357
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:58,344
I just got word about that.

358
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:00,045
It's bad news.

359
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:04,744
But is it really true?

360
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,044
But is that story about Kogoro Mouri

361
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:11,044
setting a transmitter and wiretap on the sole of Kir's shoe true?

362
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:13,044
Yeah, no doubt about it.

363
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,244
According to the info we got,

364
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:18,744
the one that Kir was in touch with before meeting us today

365
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,044
was that guy.

366
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:22,944
But that's not enough to suspect him.

367
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:24,944
I don't know what he set it there for but...

368
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:27,044
He's the one that did it.

369
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:30,144
If it had been set some days ago, even more so.

370
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,644
Kir would've realized.

371
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,944
If it was that famed detective.

372
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:39,944
Are you saying that Kir disappeared because of that detective?

373
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:41,544
Keep your voice down.

374
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,444
The wiretap is still going.

375
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:46,744
What? Didn't you crush it along with the transmitter?

376
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,344
I have it hidden in my coat, wrapped heavily in cloth

377
00:20:50,345 --> 00:20:52,644
so that it won't pick up what we say.

378
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:55,544
This way, we can throw him off a bit too.

379
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,644
I have something I want to ask that detective

380
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:02,544
while he's still here in this world with us.

381
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:05,444
What? Pops went home?

382
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:07,244
Right.

383
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,044
Ran's still here,

384
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:12,244
but Mouri left the minute we took our eyes of him.

385
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,044
Would you like me to go his detective agency

386
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:15,644
and bring him back here again?

387
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:18,544
No! Don't!

388
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:23,144
It seems that he left before the FBI arrived at Dr. Agasa's place!

389
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:24,644
What's up?

390
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:26,044
I'll explain later!

391
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:27,544
And until I contact you,

392
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,645
don't step an inch out of the house until you hear from me!

393
00:21:31,745 --> 00:21:33,244
Please, Pops.

394
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,644
Please...

395
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:36,345
Please be okay!

396
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:44,778
This... This is scary.

397
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,278
Too scary.

398
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,678
I've already won 11 races in a row from the first race!

399
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,579
The God of Horse Races must've finally descended upon me?

400
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,778
Hey. Come on...

401
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,978
Darn it! This clunker of a TV!

402
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:01,579
This always happens at the wrong time!

403
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:05,279
Geez!

404
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:11,879
Hey! Pops?

405
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:12,879
Pops?

406
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,278
Gosh!

407
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,878
I've a 12 races straight win on my shoulders now!

408
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,978
Now for the odds of the final race...

409
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:23,778
I can't be answering the phone at a time like this!

410
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:24,979
Seriously!

411
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,178
What a simpleton.

412
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:32,978
I blew up the TV antenna and he shows his face.

413
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,978
His ear. He got...

414
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,878
Something and...

415
00:22:37,879 --> 00:22:40,778
He's probably just listening to the wiretap that he set up

416
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:43,278
with all his might.

417
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,378
Then, let's make him hear our voices just as he wishes.

418
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:51,578
Do you hear me, Kogoro Mouri?

419
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,579
Gin!

420
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,978
Don't you dare to move.

421
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:56,578
We've target locked your back.

422
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,578
I have something I'd like to ask you before we open a ventilation hole

423
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,378
in your suit.

424
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,878
The relationship between you and Sherry.

425
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:05,678
The transmitter and wiretap that you set up.

426
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,378
Looks a lot like the ones that woman set up previously.

427
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:12,578
I won't take coincidence for an answer.

428
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:14,378
I'll give you 10 seconds.

429
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:16,278
If you decide to answer,

430
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:20,178
take your left hand away from your earphone and raise it up.

431
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:21,578
Earphone.

432
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:24,478
If the horse makes it, it'll be my win!

433
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,678
I see!

434
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,579
Pops is listening to the horse races on the radio.

435
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,878
There, I see it!

436
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,278
Mouri Detective Agency!

437
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,278
Ten.

438
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,978
Nine.

439
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:40,378
Eight.

440
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,278
The roof of the car! Quick!

441
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,978
Seven.

442
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:46,378
Six.

443
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:47,479
Five.

444
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:49,978
Four.

445
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:51,578
Three.

446
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,678
Two.

447
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,679
One! Go for it!

448
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,378
A soccer ball?

449
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:11,278
Hey! Who the heck are you?

450
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,878
I'm sorry, I kicked the ball a little too hard!

451
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,478
Why you...

452
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:18,278
By the way, how did the horse race go?

453
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:21,078
You were listening to it through the earphone, right?

454
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,379
Horse race?

455
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:27,079
Thanks to you, I goofed it!

456
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:31,578
It seems that he had nothing to do with this.

457
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,978
Get rid both of them.

458
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:36,278
Okay!

459
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,478
Punish when in doubt, right?

460
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,278
Wait!

461
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,778
We don't even conclusive proof,

462
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:46,079
and yet if we kill this man who has deep connections with the police...

463
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:50,079
Enough, Vermouth!

464
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,178
Gin.

465
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,978
Do you have something going with that detective?

466
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,178
So?

467
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:04,079
What if I do?

468
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,778
Never mind.

469
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:10,978
The one who set this up seems to have carelessly left fingerprints behind.

470
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,178
After we get rid of him,

471
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,278
if we check his surroundings

472
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,479
we'll eventually be able to figure out who set it up.

473
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,079
What?

474
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:26,079
Behind you at 8 o'clock.

475
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,778
It's from that building!

476
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,778
It can't be! It's 700 yards away.

477
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:34,779
Give it to me!

478
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,779
Shuichi Akai?

479
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,478
We've finally met.

480
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:58,278
My dear and dearest arch-enemy.

481
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,579
My dear.

482
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:06,378
The FBI. So that's the story.

483
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:07,878
Gin.

484
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:08,978
We're splitting!

485
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:11,378
But what about the detective and kid?

486
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:12,379
Never mind!

487
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,579
Get out of here, quick!

488
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:26,478
Their car is headed west from Beika-cho Gochome.

489
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,778
Please pursue.

490
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,379
Well, they may throw you off track part way, though.

491
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:40,878
That gun fire a while ago was shot by an FBI agent?

492
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,378
Yeah, we fell into their trap.

493
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:48,778
If they didn't know that we were going there from some time ago,

494
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,478
they couldn't have positioned themselves on that building.

495
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:55,078
Then, you mean that Kogoro Mouri and the FBI joined hands and...

496
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,878
I don't think so.

497
00:26:56,879 --> 00:27:02,478
To the FBI, he's no more than just a bait to lure us out.

498
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:06,879
I wonder if they would risk the life of one of their comrades.

499
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,478
They probably got info that he was going to have contact with Kir,

500
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:15,178
and after the two parted,

501
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,878
the FBI probably set the transmitter and wiretap onto Kir's shoe.

502
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,878
That way, just in case we all get caught,

503
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:27,079
we would all suspect him because of it.

504
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,178
Let's say that's what happened.

505
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:35,179
Kogoro Mouri seems to be your favorite detective after all.

506
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:38,078
Thank you.

507
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,978
The problem for now is Kir.

508
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:42,878
Don't tell me, the FBI...

509
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:44,078
Yeah.

510
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,078
There's probably no doubt that she fell into their hands.

511
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,178
Well, but I don't think Kir is the type to spit things easily.

512
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,478
I'll search her out no matter what it takes.

513
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,378
Do you have an idea where she is?

514
00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:00,678
Hints are everywhere.

515
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,078
It's not that I believe that Kogoro Mouri

516
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,779
is completely innocent yet, either.

517
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:13,978
Did you see the TV program on this morning?

518
00:28:13,979 --> 00:28:16,978
Yeah. The news about Mr. Domon passing up

519
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:20,078
being a candidate for election this time, right?

520
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,278
The reason is suspicion of his father, a government official,

521
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,878
having an extra-marital affair.

522
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:26,978
Which was 20 years ago.

523
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:30,778
Mr. Domon seems to have agreed to a special interview with Nichiuri TV,

524
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,578
under the condition that they keep this affair thing a secret,

525
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,778
but it was found that Rena Mizunashi had made up on her own.

526
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:41,479
Which means she was not commuting to work to the TV station.

527
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,978
Well, if they had known that he was such a righteous guy

528
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:48,678
that would give up candidacy for something like that.

529
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:51,878
They wouldn't have had to go through all the trouble.

530
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:56,878
Only if we could arrest two or three of those guys.

531
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:59,478
I could've blown off his leg,

532
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:03,678
but I fired through his bullet proof jacket and left it at that.

533
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,278
I didn't want to stop them carelessly

534
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,578
and start a gunfire battle in the middle of town

535
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,878
while risking the general public falling prey to bullets.

536
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:11,978
Besides, in this case,

537
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:13,778
it was our top priority to make them think that

538
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:18,078
it was the FBI who set up the transmitter and wiretap.

539
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,878
Right?

540
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:21,378
That's true, but...

541
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:23,679
Besides, it's not only that.

542
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,079
All ties have been severed with them either.

543
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,378
Although her life is not in danger,

544
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:34,178
she seems to be still unconscious.

545
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:36,878
I guess all we can do is wait for her to recover.

546
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:40,478
I've asked them to keep the fact that she's been hospitalized hidden.

547
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,578
But if an announcer suddenly disappears,

548
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:48,478
the TV station will not overlook it, will they?

549
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,578
That boy said don't worry.

550
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:53,378
He'd work something out.

551
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:55,678
That boy again.

552
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,278
Who is he, anyway?

553
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,878
A detective.

554
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:01,079
He's my favorite.

555
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,478
Personnel manager?

556
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:06,078
This is Rena Mizunashi!

557
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,178
I'm very sorry to say this,

558
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:10,079
but I'd like to take time off for a while.

559
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,378
How lucky you are.

560
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:42,778
Detective Mouri who was hanging around you was suspected,

561
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,378
and escape being killed by them by a hairsbreadth.

562
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:47,778
But he was saved at the very last moment.

563
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:52,278
That guy foresaw what was going to happen and ambushed them

564
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,678
to make those guys think that it was the FBI who schemed all this.

565
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:59,578
Well, you'd better thank that Akai guy.

566
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:02,178
Yeah, I really appreciate what he did.

567
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:06,078
As well as Dr. Agasa and you for sheltering Ran at Dr. Agasa's place.

568
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:08,178
By the way, is everything all right?

569
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:12,178
It seems that nobody's keeping guard over Detective Mouri since then.

570
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,178
It's safer not to have anybody guard him

571
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,678
so I refused the FBI's offer to guard him.

572
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,778
I mean this is the chance to show them that.

573
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,478
Pops has nothing to do with the FBI.

574
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,378
If I carelessly ask the FBI to guard him,

575
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:26,478
and they suspect that Pops is involved after all.

576
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:28,478
That would be more dangerous.

577
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,978
True, but...

578
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:34,878
Besides, we got a card that they left behind for us.

579
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:38,478
Announcer Rena Mizunashi, right?

580
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:41,678
I hear she's unconscious and in the hospital.

581
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,078
Yeah. I hear that the FBI are on guard around the clock

582
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:47,878
waiting for her to get up.

583
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:51,278
But if those guys find the hospital...

584
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,478
Don't worry!

585
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,878
I called the TV station using her voice and told them that

586
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:57,178
she'll be going on a long leave of absence.

587
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,978
So, I'm sure those guys won't think that she's in the hospital either.

588
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,678
At any rate, always keep on your guard.

589
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,678
I'm sure that those guys are frantically looking for

590
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,078
her whereabouts right now, too.

591
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:14,679
Yeah. Those guy would do anything to achieve their purpose.

592
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:19,041
"Next Episode" -Don't tell me that this is?

593
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:21,067
"Next Conan's Hint: Wooden sword" -A love letter?

594
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:22,567
"Next Conan's Hint: Wooden sword" -Maybe...

595
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:25,667
the culprit felt the same way we did.

596
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:28,867
Did you have anything else written in your diary?

597
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:33,067
That man called Nagai had a wooden sword, didn't he?

598
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:37,767
Ran was saying that she's going to tell the guy how she honestly feels.

599
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,968
I wonder if she's going to tell him about me...

600
00:33:41,368 --> 00:33:47,068
Next Conan, "Love Letter to Ran"
