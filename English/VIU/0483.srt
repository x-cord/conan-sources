1
00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:03,988
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:05,788
After the tears is "A Ramen Shop Owner".

3
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,388
He was definitely there, but has disappeared.

4
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:10,188
What is the identity of the outrageous police officer?

5
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:11,588
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:13,288
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:14,988
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:58,127
It was in the morning, the first Monday of the month.

9
00:01:58,127 --> 00:01:59,927
Where are those guys?

10
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,527
Man! They're late.

11
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:03,227
Genta!

12
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:05,227
Hey! Hurry up!

13
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:06,527
Genta!

14
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:07,527
What is it?

15
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:11,427
What's this about some great information you have for us?

16
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:17,127
So, did you guys see the Saturday Drama last night?

17
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:21,127
You mean, "Run! The 100 Police Officer Dragnets"?

18
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:22,727
Yeah! That's the one!

19
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:23,927
Well, I saw it, but... So?

20
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:26,527
What's up with the show?

21
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,927
As soon as I saw it, I came straight here.

22
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:33,127
Here, Beika Park, is where they shot that show! No doubt about it!

23
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:36,227
That's it? Anyone could have told you that!

24
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:38,727
Yeah, I knew it was this park as soon as I saw the show.

25
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:42,127
-What? -"There's some case in the park!"

26
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:45,527
As soon as I heard the main character

27
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,427
say that lame line.

28
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:49,927
I knew the show was shot right there.

29
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:54,127
It was just a bud when it was filmed.

30
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:57,227
So they shot the show about a couple of weeks ago, perhaps.

31
00:02:57,227 --> 00:03:00,527
So, Genta saying he had something great to tell us was true after all.

32
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,127
Yeah.

33
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:06,027
I thought I was the only one who knew that they shot the show here!

34
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:14,227
You know, turning it all into a drama is just the worst, you know?

35
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,127
Really.

36
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,927
They were just trying to make things look cool

37
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:19,227
by having a scene with a whole bunch

38
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:23,427
-of uniformed officers. -Enough. No more about that show.

39
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:25,127
Hey, Yasuyo!

40
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,827
Ayumi, how's everything?

41
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:29,027
Good.

42
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:30,527
This is Yasuyo Akimoto.

43
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,727
"Yasuyo Akimoto (24)" -She is living in 3-chome now,

44
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:35,727
but before, she lived in an apartment close to me.

45
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,427
So, Yasuyo, you were out shopping?

46
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:38,827
Oh, this?

47
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,227
They're just some sweets I had sent that my hometown is famous for making.

48
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:44,027
I was thinking of giving some to this police officer.

49
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,927
A police officer?

50
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,227
I don't know his name,

51
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:56,427
but he seems like a really decent guy.

52
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:58,227
Even if he does have a beard.

53
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,727
So, he's got a beard?

54
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:08,227
I'd like to see this guy.

55
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:11,327
-Right, Conan? -Yeah.

56
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,227
"Komehana Station"

57
00:04:13,227 --> 00:04:14,827
"Komehana Station Police Box" -You've never seen that kind

58
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:17,027
of police officer?

59
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:19,127
He has a beard and wears glasses.

60
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,527
Yeah, there's no such police officer

61
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,127
in the Komehana Police Department, and of course this police box.

62
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:28,227
But I, when you were on patrol, we would see each other all the time.

63
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:31,327
But, that's when I'm not at the station.

64
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:32,927
What's going on?

65
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:34,027
Hard to say.

66
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:37,727
-Just what is going on here? -Just as I thought.

67
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:42,327
There's no way a beard is allowed under the police dress code.

68
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:45,327
Therefore, this guy is only posing as a police officer.

69
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:53,427
"The Police Officer Who Disappeared"

70
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,927
Man, oh man!

71
00:04:57,227 --> 00:05:00,027
Do you have to call on me so often?

72
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:02,427
Yeah, but you're the only one we can depend on.

73
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,427
What with officer impersonators in the police department.

74
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:05,827
Isn't this a big deal?

75
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:08,027
Officer impersonators?

76
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:13,127
Impersonating an officer of the law,

77
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:18,027
even for a con artist, is the lowest of the low.

78
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:21,327
Ms. Akimoto, you've seen this man a number of times before, right?

79
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,027
Yeah.

80
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:26,527
Things were busy at work, and I had been staying late this whole week

81
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:31,127
up until yesterday, I was coming home every night on the last train.

82
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:35,427
I first met that police officer the first night I stayed late at work,

83
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:37,827
it was late Monday night.

84
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:39,127
I had just gotten off the last train home,

85
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:41,527
and was heading towards my house in the third chome.

86
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:44,727
It's not safe for a woman to be walking outside alone so late, you know.

87
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:48,327
You take care, OK?

88
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:52,527
Then, the next day, and the next.

89
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,627
Well, at any rate, for the week, every night

90
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:58,527
when I was coming home from work,

91
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:01,327
I ran into this officer one of the nights,

92
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,327
he was helping this elderly couple.

93
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:07,327
You know, it's not safe. You really shouldn't be walking around at night.

94
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:10,327
Well, she was the one who up and said that she wants some soda.

95
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,727
You were the one who said you could go for some custard.

96
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:16,027
Good evening!

97
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,027
Good evening, ma'am.

98
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,627
Last night, he was helping a drunk guy.

99
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:25,327
Hey, watch it, watch it. Your house far from here?

100
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,327
You know, you'd better take a cab home.

101
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:31,827
I'm fine! I can make it home on my own!

102
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:35,727
But you're not fine. Oh, here we go. Let's get you up.

103
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,927
You always seem to have your work cut out for you.

104
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:40,127
Well, it's just that... It's my job, ma'am.

105
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,727
You be careful yourself, OK?

106
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,327
Yes, sir!

107
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:46,027
Listening to all of this, he sounds like an absolute dream.

108
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:50,127
No kidding, right? How can this guy not be an officer?

109
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,827
Yeah, but, why did he go through all of the trouble

110
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:56,427
of pretending to be a police officer?

111
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,427
Yeah, why'd he do it?

112
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:01,227
I think he was pretending to be a police officer

113
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:04,527
and planning some sort of bad thing!

114
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,327
What do you mean, 'bad thing'?

115
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:09,127
Well, I'm not quite sure yet.

116
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:13,427
Hello. This is...

117
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:16,227
So you say you had a break-in the other day.

118
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,427
No, we still haven't caught the guy yet.

119
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:19,427
Considering the MO,

120
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:21,127
it looks like the work of the same guy

121
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,127
committing all of the other break-ins

122
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:24,427
that have been going on for about a week.

123
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:27,427
So it's a break-in crime spree?

124
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:30,827
So, someone must have seen this guy.

125
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:33,527
Like the old couple, or perhaps the drunk guy.

126
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,527
That's it!

127
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:37,227
One of them might help shed some light on all of this!

128
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:38,327
Ms. Akimoto,

129
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,227
do you know where any of these people might be?

130
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,627
I don't know about the drunk guy from last night,

131
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,327
but as far as the elderly couple goes,

132
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:47,027
I've seen them a number of times at Tetsuryu.

133
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:48,527
Tetsuryu?

134
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,427
"Tetsuryu"

135
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:52,227
"Tetsuji Odawara (33)"

136
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:53,827
Police officer impersonator?

137
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:57,027
-He looks really upset, right? -Totally.

138
00:07:57,027 --> 00:08:00,127
I'm not upset! It's nothing.

139
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:02,327
The guy who runs the place isn't the most easy-going person in the world,

140
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,727
but he does make great ramen, for sure.

141
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:07,427
So that's why I always come here to eat.

142
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:09,927
See, right here.

143
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:12,527
You're right.

144
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,527
So this is it. The secret ingredient!

145
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:19,527
Hey, you can't do that.

146
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,327
No.

147
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:25,527
Oh, my goodness. Genta, you got it all over me.

148
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,227
The sauce spilled out?

149
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:32,127
It's like I've been swimming in ramen.

150
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:35,827
-Genta! -It's not like I did it on purpose!

151
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:39,827
So, do you think you might know anything

152
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,527
that might help us find this officer impersonator?

153
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:45,127
Sometimes I see that old couple in here.

154
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,227
They seem to really like you.

155
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,827
The Takayanagis?

156
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:51,527
Yeah, they live...

157
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,627
That's them.

158
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:58,327
Police officer impersonator?

159
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:01,527
There has to be some sort of mistake? Right?

160
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:04,427
Yes, you're right.

161
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:07,527
He was such a kind and gentle police officer.

162
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:08,927
Is that so?

163
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:10,927
So he has a good reputation in this place.

164
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,927
I don't think what people say could get any better.

165
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:16,927
Who on earth is this guy?

166
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:18,027
Detective Takagi.

167
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,827
Just now, I heard of another burglary

168
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:24,727
at a home late last night in the second chome.

169
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:28,527
There was some talk earlier about a spate of burglaries?

170
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,727
Yes. So this officer impersonator seems to be showing his true colors.

171
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,227
Pretending to be on patrol,

172
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:35,427
he's looking for houses that he can break into,

173
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:38,227
then robbing people blind.

174
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,527
You mean...

175
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,727
A burglar?

176
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:45,727
There is a possiblity that that's what is happening.

177
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,027
No, it can't be.

178
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:50,027
I just cannot believe that he would be doing such terrible things!

179
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:53,927
Then, for what reason do you think he posing as a fake police officer?

180
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,527
Officer Arai.

181
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:59,527
No, I think the one who broke into the house is someone else.

182
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,527
I'm going to the scene of the crime.

183
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,527
Excuse me.

184
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:15,327
I thought you were a really nice police officer.

185
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:17,427
Yasuyo.

186
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:20,127
It's no wonder people lose trust in others.

187
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:23,327
Good luck looking for the fake police officer.

188
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:24,527
What about you, Haibara?

189
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,727
I pass.

190
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:33,027
So the fake police officer was a thief.

191
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,927
No, he somehow doesn't fit the profile

192
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,827
that Yasuyo and the others are giving us.

193
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,927
-Right! -We've got to look for the person

194
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,327
who witnessed the fake police officer.

195
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:44,227
We've got no choice but to gather whatever information we can.

196
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,727
I guess you should find out

197
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,327
where he got the police officer's outfit from, too, right?

198
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:52,327
Right, but that's strange, too.

199
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:53,527
If a police officer's outfit were to be stolen,

200
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,427
there should already be a big fuss, but...

201
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:58,627
It's hard to get hold of the real thing,

202
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:01,127
but if it's one that was used to shoot a drama or something?

203
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,627
Something used for a drama?

204
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:05,827
-That's it! -That's it!

205
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:07,527
What do you mean?

206
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:12,127
The 2-hour drama that you broadcasted last night.

207
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:14,827
Yes, "Run! The 100 Police Officer Dragnets".

208
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:16,627
Could you please check to see

209
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:19,927
if a set of one of the police outfits used back then is missing?

210
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,527
While waiting for the TV station to get back to us,

211
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:27,327
we gathered eye-witness information on the bearded police officer.

212
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:28,927
As a result...

213
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:33,027
That fake police officer first appeared a week ago,

214
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:36,427
from Monday last week, right?

215
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:40,427
Last Monday is when Yasuyo began working over-time, right?

216
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,127
Yeah, now that you mentioned it.

217
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:45,827
Besides, there are no witnesses who saw that fake policeman during the day.

218
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:48,027
He only appears late at night.

219
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:50,327
Just when the last train pulls into Beika Station.

220
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:51,927
Does that have any meaning?

221
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,827
One person said that

222
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,227
he saw the policeman in front of the Beika Station.

223
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:57,327
There are 5 eye-witness reports in 2-chome.

224
00:11:57,327 --> 00:12:00,227
Moreover, there are three reports in 3-chome.

225
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:03,027
If we trace all the eye-witness reports.

226
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:06,827
It's the road that Yasuyo who lives in 3-chome takes to walk home.

227
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:07,927
True!

228
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,927
In other words, the period of time and place

229
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,627
that the fake police officer started appearing...

230
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:15,627
Is connected to Yasuyo Akimotos over-time work?

231
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:16,627
That's right.

232
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:18,927
And do you remember what she said?

233
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:22,027
At any rate, I've seen that police officer every night

234
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:24,727
on my way home from work this past week.

235
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:27,427
It can't be coincidence that she saw every day for a week...

236
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:31,427
The fake police officer appeared before Yasuyo deliberately?

237
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:33,727
I don't know for what reason though.

238
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,127
But, if so,

239
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:37,727
it's understandable why he wore a beard and glasses.

240
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:39,627
I see! He disguised himself!

241
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:41,627
Does that mean that the Yasuyo Akimoto

242
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,727
knows the real face of the fake police officer?

243
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,527
You mean the fake police officer is someone who is intimate with Yasuyo?

244
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:48,427
And just who could that be?

245
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:52,327
-What makes you think I would know? -Oh, you don't know.

246
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:55,127
Oh, come on! Not again, Genta.

247
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,727
-Did it get on your dress? -Where's my handkerchief?

248
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,127
Did you drop it?

249
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:01,027
It could be at that ramen shop.

250
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:03,627
Im afraid to go to that shop alone.

251
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:05,427
We'll all go with you.

252
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:07,527
Right, Conan?

253
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:10,627
"Preparation"

254
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:16,027
Maybe he's not in after all?

255
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:18,027
Yes.

256
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:19,727
Of Nichiuri TV.

257
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,127
And, how was it?

258
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,927
Yes.

259
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,727
It seems he went out a while ago.

260
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,227
Maybe he went home for lunch or something?

261
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:30,327
He seems to live very close to Beika Park.

262
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:32,427
What do you want to do? Do you want to wait?

263
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,227
I found it.

264
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:38,227
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:39,627 --> 00:13:41,527
Thank you so very much.

266
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,327
About the police officers outfit,

267
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,927
they checked on it and found one missing.

268
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:49,127
So, he got hold of the fake police officers uniform

269
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,427
when they were shooting the film at Beika Park after all.

270
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:52,527
Most likely.

271
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,927
It was on a Sunday a half a month ago, yeah.

272
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:58,627
Was that film shot on a Sunday a half a month ago?

273
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,627
That's what they said, but what about it?

274
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:04,027
It was the 3rd Sunday last month, wasn't it?

275
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:07,527
It just so happens to be the day this shop is closed.

276
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:11,427
You said that the man who works here lives near Beika Park, right?

277
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:13,027
-Yes. -If it was his day off,

278
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:15,527
he could've gone to watch the shooting of the film.

279
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:16,927
I'm sure anyone would,

280
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,927
if they're shooting a film for a flashy drama right close by.

281
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,927
If he wanted to, I'm sure there was a chance for him

282
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,727
to steal the police officers uniform.

283
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:26,727
And the fake police officer is someone close enough to Yasuyo

284
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:28,627
that she knows his face.

285
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:30,127
Conan, don't tell me that...

286
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:31,727
He is the fake police officer?

287
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:34,627
-Really? -But, why would he?

288
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:36,627
Conan?

289
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,627
Maybe...

290
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:41,504
"Publisher"

291
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:45,536
Then, is that man the one who choose that picture?

292
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,636
Yes, he seems to have said that

293
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,736
he wants to use this picture on the magazine.

294
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:51,836
She looks really good in this picture, doesn't she?

295
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:57,536
Does he like her? Maybe that's why he chose this picture.

296
00:14:57,536 --> 00:15:02,136
I see. It was about her.

297
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:05,036
His name is Tetsuji Odawara.

298
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,536
The fact is, he's was my classmate in high school.

299
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:10,836
And, after the interview, when we were drinking together...

300
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:14,336
You mean you have somebody you care for?

301
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:16,136
But, it'll end in one-sided love.

302
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:18,536
Why?

303
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:20,636
I mean, my looks are not the greatest.

304
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:24,236
Come on, you're just psyched into thinking that way.

305
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:27,736
I don't mind, as long as I can watch over her without being noticed.

306
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:29,836
I tell you...

307
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:32,536
Odawara's face looks grumpy when he's not talking,

308
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:34,436
so at first glance he seems difficult to approach.

309
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:37,336
But in fact, there couldn't be a nicer guy around.

310
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,536
And he's also a very timid guy.

311
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:43,536
At Tetsuryu?

312
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:48,236
Yes, I did, with an acquaintance.

313
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:50,336
It seems that I'm going to have to start working over-time

314
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:52,136
from the end of this month.

315
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,736
Oh, gosh.

316
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:57,036
I mean it's quite dangerous coming home every night on the last train.

317
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:00,836
I think it was about a half a month ago.

318
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,536
So, that's what he heard.

319
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:04,836
Anything?

320
00:16:04,836 --> 00:16:07,336
So, the fake police officer that you saw every night

321
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:11,236
wasn't there to steal something from you after all.

322
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,136
Did you find out?

323
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:15,536
All we have for now is circumstantial evidence.

324
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:18,336
But, we're going to confirm things with the person himself from now.

325
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:22,436
He is worry because he heard that

326
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:25,636
the woman he cared for was going to have to come home late

327
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,936
for a week.

328
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:32,236
He probably wanted to watch over her in secret if at all possible.

329
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:35,136
But because he thinks that his looks are frightening,

330
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:36,636
he figured that if he did something like that,

331
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:38,836
she would misunderstand him for being a weirdo,

332
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,336
so he decided against it.

333
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:43,636
"Close" -But, soon after that.

334
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:51,036
The incident happened at the park!

335
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:55,236
And, he saw the police officers outfit at the park.

336
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:58,636
It's at that time that he thought up a way

337
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:02,536
to guard Yasuyo fair and square.

338
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:09,836
So, he appeared before Yasuyo as a police officer.

339
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:13,736
Walking the streets at night is dangerous.

340
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:16,436
Please be very careful.

341
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,836
He's not back yet.

342
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,236
I wonder what happened?

343
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:23,136
Maybe he fled?

344
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:25,936
No. Maybe he...

345
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,636
is planning to catch the thief with his own hands

346
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:32,536
for the sake of Yasuyo who believed in his innocence.

347
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:35,236
That's too reckless and dangerous.

348
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:36,336
Let's split up and look for him!

349
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:37,436
Okay...

350
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:40,036
Hey! You kids.

351
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:47,636
It's impossible to begin with

352
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,336
because even if I want look for the thief,

353
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,936
I've got no clue to go on what so ever.

354
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:58,636
I can go home! I'm fine!

355
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,336
Oh, so he's the guy I saw yesterday.

356
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:07,236
I haven't eaten ramen and yet I smell like I did.

357
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,336
The smell of his clothes.

358
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:17,936
He's not here.

359
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:20,236
Where did he go?

360
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:40,036
Do you remember me?

361
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,436
We saw each other last night.

362
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:42,936
Last night?

363
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:46,736
I'm sorry, I was really wasted last night, you see...

364
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:50,436
Yes, you really smelled of alcohol back then.

365
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:53,736
But, it was your clothes that smelled,

366
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:56,036
not your breath.

367
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:58,536
Just what are you talking about?

368
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,436
You staggered along as if you were drunk

369
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:03,436
and went looking for a house you could break into!

370
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:07,536
Don't move!

371
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:09,536
Stand right there!

372
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:13,536
Stop! You thief!

373
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:15,036
Thief?

374
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:16,836
Stop!

375
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,036
Get out of my way!

376
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:37,036
I would like to question you regarding the series of thefts

377
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:40,036
that have been occurring lately.

378
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:43,136
Okay.

379
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:44,536
Officer Arai, can you take care of him for me.

380
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:45,736
Yes, sir.

381
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:52,236
You're Mr. Tetsuji Odawara?

382
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:58,236
Yes.

383
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:04,336
Yasuyo.

384
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:11,436
Who on earth are you?

385
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,836
Ms. Akimoto, he is...

386
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:17,436
In order to protect

387
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:20,236
a woman going home late at night,

388
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:23,736
in order to see that she gets safely home,

389
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,536
you became a fake police officer, right?

390
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,236
How did you know that?

391
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:28,836
What are you talking about?

392
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,536
But, you know, sir, a person whos not a police officer

393
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:35,136
should never disguise as a police officer.

394
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:38,236
No matter what the reason is.

395
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,436
Do you understand

396
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:42,536
what Conan just said?

397
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:49,436
You did it the wrong way.

398
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,536
Yasuyo.

399
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:05,736
I'm arresting you for faking identity

400
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,536
and stealing the outfit.

401
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:09,536
Shall we go then?

402
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:16,836
Wait.

403
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:23,936
I'll go to eat ramen again.

404
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:06,436
"Tetsuryu"

405
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:09,736
Really!

406
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,836
It was his first time stealing something

407
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:14,636
and he didn't steal the uniform to carry out a crime.

408
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:18,036
He was acquitted considering that

409
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,836
he also captured the thief.

410
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:21,736
Of course he was severely reprimanded.

411
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:25,536
In other words, he was scolded very severely.

412
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:29,036
Thank you for waiting!

413
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:37,036
Thank you.

414
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:41,736
A man and woman

415
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:44,936
who are awkward at living a smooth life despite their age.

416
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:47,836
I don't think those two would like to hear something like that from you.

417
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:49,836
Did you say something?

418
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:57,336
"Next Episode"

419
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,836
I've got to nab the culprit who snuck into this room

420
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:02,736
and get it back.

421
00:24:02,736 --> 00:24:04,236
Which means the culprit snuck in

422
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:07,136
from a place other than this room.

423
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:10,136
Moreover, just until a while ago.

424
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:13,236
-What? -Doc.

425
00:24:16,636 --> 00:24:21,436
Next Conan, "The Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 1)"

426
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:39,836
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:42,136
"A whole lot of sweat"

428
00:24:42,136 --> 00:24:45,636
I'm sweating so much that I might drown.

429
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:47,136
Just drown then.
