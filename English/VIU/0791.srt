1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,093
"Danny's Restaurant."

2
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:05,488
Cut it out, you jerk!

3
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:07,089
Let me go!

4
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:10,888
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,689
Somebody, call the police!

6
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:15,889
Oh, no!

7
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,388
Are you all right?

8
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,688
Oh, yes.

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,088
Hey, you. Are you okay?

10
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,888
Yes, I guess.

11
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:31,188
What on earth happened?

12
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,089
Nothing. It's just a brawl.

13
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:38,688
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

14
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,688
Love and cases come from the same origin.

15
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:42,588
A police detective on duty is on the run with handcuffs?

16
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:44,888
Wataru Takagi's super long day.

17
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,488
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,288
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,789
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,130
"Handcuffed Officer Takagi on the Run."

21
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:41,537
"After three days."

22
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:43,776
It hurts, you idiot!

23
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,476
I said, don't pull!

24
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:47,776
"Ryuta Someya (28)" -Resign yourself, Someya!

25
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:50,577
I'm taking you to MPD now!

26
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:54,276
Please take care of the rest, then.

27
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:55,577
Good work.

28
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,176
How frightening!

29
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:08,876
I wonder what'll happen if we fall?

30
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:10,777
Hey, do you want to try it?

31
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:15,276
What do you think you're doing? Cut it out, Someya!

32
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:17,076
There! Fall!

33
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,177
Fall!

34
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:40,677
Good work.

35
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:49,876
Too bad.

36
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:52,277
You don't have a gun on you.

37
00:03:58,377 --> 00:04:00,976
I don't get to carry guns around

38
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:04,377
when all I have to do is take a suspect of a fight to MPD.

39
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:09,176
Oh, no! This is like replaying the "you know what".

40
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:10,377
What?

41
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,176
Oh, well...

42
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,477
It's nothing.

43
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:17,977
Get out!

44
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,177
It hurts.

45
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:23,376
Hey, Officer Kishida.

46
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:25,376
Are you all right?

47
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:26,677
Yes.

48
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:33,376
Let's wait for back up here.

49
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:35,176
Call MPD.

50
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:36,377
Got you.

51
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,777
Oh, you got a gun.

52
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:42,077
Hey! What are you...

53
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:45,377
Why you?

54
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:47,777
Pick up the key and unlock the handcuffs!

55
00:04:58,577 --> 00:04:59,976
Even if you shoot me with this,

56
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,176
you won't be able to get away!

57
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:02,676
Why you...

58
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,076
Okay, have it your way!

59
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:05,277
No way!

60
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,077
Officer Takagi!

61
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:24,076
What?

62
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:27,176
Officer Takagi fell into the river with the suspect?

63
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,176
Officer Takagi?

64
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:32,376
Emergency dispatch on the double and request road block!

65
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:33,377
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

66
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,476
Darn it!

67
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,277
Break already!

68
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:54,976
Police handcuffs aren't made to break off that easily.

69
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:57,076
Forget it.

70
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:59,076
Oh, you can't use it.

71
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:01,576
I tried it a while ago.

72
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,077
Darn.

73
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,676
I quit.

74
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:08,376
It hurts...

75
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,076
Hey, cut it out!

76
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,376
What's with that non-energetic attitude of yours?

77
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:15,876
Get yourself together and try to run with all your might!

78
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,876
You've got a purpose, don't you?

79
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,176
A purpose?

80
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:22,377
You fled because of it, didn't you?

81
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:27,076
The town we just came from was the town you were born in.

82
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:28,077
You probably didn't know where to run

83
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:29,976
so you just happened to land up there

84
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:31,576
but according to the local police,

85
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:35,676
it seems you bought a ticket back to the city right away.

86
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,476
Where were you planning to go?

87
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,676
I had no place to go.

88
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:42,176
I just didn't want to get caught yet.

89
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:45,576
Cut it out! Look at this! This!

90
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,176
We're connected, you know.

91
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:50,077
Just like the "you know what".

92
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,277
What do you mean by "you know what"?

93
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:56,577
Well...

94
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,576
It sure is of concern.

95
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,276
Yes, it sure is.

96
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,776
I wish his bad habit doesn't get the best of him.

97
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:07,876
Bad habit?

98
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:08,877
A movie?

99
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:10,476
Yes, a movie.

100
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:12,676
The title is, "On the Run with Handcuffs".

101
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:13,776
You know it, don't you?

102
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:15,976
What're you talking about?

103
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,976
Are you serious? You don't know it?

104
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:20,276
It's a masterpiece that has left its name in the history of movies!

105
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:22,076
A masterpiece!

106
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:27,076
Well, so what about it?

107
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:29,776
Two men connected by handcuffs.

108
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:33,376
At first, they are hostile to each other, but gradually open up.

109
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:34,776
And regardless of the difference of their social standing,

110
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:36,976
friendship grows.

111
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,276
It's a masterpiece of the soul.

112
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:44,076
Incidentally, I watched it twelve times on DVD!

113
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:45,476
That's why, Someya...

114
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:47,476
If there's anything you're hiding,

115
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,776
since we're connected like this...

116
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:51,277
Why don't you tell me about...

117
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:56,276
Enough, quiet already!

118
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:59,976
That's the way! That's the way it starts...

119
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:02,176
You're doing good, yes!

120
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,776
I told you to be quiet!

121
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,576
-Let's go! -See...

122
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:08,976
So, you've got a purpose after all.

123
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:11,276
-Shut up! -It hurts...

124
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:12,976
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Now for the next news.

125
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:15,476
-Today, the whereabouts of a suspect -Dad, Conan!

126
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:19,276
who was being moved to prison along with the investigators

127
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:20,876
who accompanied him became unknown.

128
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,576
They are Ryuta Someya,

129
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,676
who had been arrested on charges of assault and battery, age 28,

130
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,176
and Officer Wataru Takagi.

131
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:28,876
-What the heck is Takagi doing? -of the first investigation division of MPD.

132
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,776
-Hey, Conan, this man... -who was escorting him.

133
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,076
-According to the report, the two... -Yeah...

134
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:35,576
He's the man we saw at the family restaurant.

135
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:39,176
It's Sunday. You got to be joking.

136
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:43,476
I'm sure the police have already come here and investigated.

137
00:08:43,477 --> 00:08:47,676
Yeah, but there's something that's bothering me.

138
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:52,476
Yeah, the police already came.

139
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:57,076
I told them that I don't know where that guy, Someya, is though.

140
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,276
Did you still need to know something?

141
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:01,076
Was that woman a customer?

142
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,476
Woman?

143
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:06,876
Remember the person, who was over there, when you two were fighting?

144
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:08,076
"Yasuo Nashimoto (28)"

145
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,076
Yeah...

146
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:11,977
I wonder if I should be telling you this?

147
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:15,576
The fact is, Ms. Konaka...

148
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:18,677
was being stalked by Someya.

149
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,076
What?

150
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,376
Stalked?

151
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:25,176
So, I tried to stop him.

152
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:27,976
And I end up like this...

153
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:30,176
Did you tell the police about it?

154
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,276
No.

155
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:35,776
Because she was really freaked out about him.

156
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,976
Do you know where Ms. Konaka's house is?

157
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,576
Yeah, I know because she used to discuss her problems with me.

158
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:44,376
Maybe he's going to...

159
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:47,777
Yeah, he probably fled because of that too!

160
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:55,176
You're Ms. Chie Konaka, correct?

161
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,276
"Chie Konaka (23)" -I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.

162
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,476
Detective?

163
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:03,876
Could you spare me a bit of your time?

164
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:07,177
I'm sorry, I have a cold and don't feel too well.

165
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:11,676
Isn't it because you're frightened?

166
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,177
Of that man?

167
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:17,776
He may not look it, but Dad is a famed detective.

168
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:20,076
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,077
Oh, wait!

170
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:30,577
Dad.

171
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:34,076
Thank you for contacting us.

172
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:35,676
How are things on your side?

173
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,976
Nothing yet.

174
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,476
They haven't been stopped at the roadblock yet either.

175
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:41,776
I hope Officer Takagi is okay.

176
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:45,477
Oh... I guess so. Thank you.

177
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:52,476
It's good news that we've figured out why Someya fled.

178
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,776
If he plans to hurt her,

179
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:57,176
I'm sure that he'll appear here.

180
00:10:57,177 --> 00:11:01,076
Yeah, that's very likely.

181
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,176
What's this?

182
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,476
Something's not right.

183
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:06,177
I wonder what it is?

184
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,476
We're gonna cut the chain of the handcuffs

185
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:16,176
with the wheels of the train?

186
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,276
Are you serious?

187
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,076
Dead serious!

188
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,476
There was a similar scene in that movie too, but...

189
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:24,177
Are you serious?

190
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:28,277
Here it comes!

191
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,243
What the heck do you think you're doing?

192
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:13,543
There was no space where you could get under the train.

193
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:16,843
-If things went as planned, you would've been smashed. -Cut it out!

194
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:18,043
It's true!

195
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,343
I'm not lying!

196
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:20,544
Shut up!

197
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:49,943
Someya...

198
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:51,343
This...

199
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:53,043
Use this...

200
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:54,444
Someya!

201
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,143
What's that?

202
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,943
The key that the police threw a while ago,

203
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,543
was for my handcuff.

204
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:07,443
This is the key to your handcuff.

205
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:10,443
Quit playing around.

206
00:13:10,444 --> 00:13:11,444
Hurry!

207
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:14,143
If we stay this way, both of us'll fall.

208
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,944
At least you can make it.

209
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,544
Hurry it up!

210
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,243
Darn it!

211
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:31,544
You're gonna make it too!

212
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,743
Someya... You...

213
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:44,243
The key... Give me the key...

214
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:46,843
Yeah... Oh, no...

215
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:48,243
It's gone...

216
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,643
I must've dropped it...

217
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:51,343
What?

218
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:52,444
Sorry...

219
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:56,943
What're you apologizing for, you idiot?

220
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:59,043
I mean, you're a lifesaver.

221
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,343
Thanks.

222
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:04,243
What's this? A policeman thanking a suspect!

223
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,143
I... I guess so...

224
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:09,543
But, if you didn't save me, I wouldn't be here.

225
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,543
What a guy... I had no other choice.

226
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:14,944
After all, we're connected!

227
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:17,444
Yeah...

228
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:51,944
Officer Sato!

229
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:54,343
Eye-witness report!

230
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:55,443
Where?

231
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,843
Is Officer Takagi okay?

232
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:00,143
They're at a drive-in on the border.

233
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:01,943
The local police sent a footage

234
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,344
that was found on their security camera.

235
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:09,143
What's this?

236
00:15:09,144 --> 00:15:12,144
They look to be on good terms.

237
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:15,444
So, his bad habit got the better of him.

238
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:20,043
No, it's nothing.

239
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,443
And? What's the current location of the truck?

240
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:25,843
Although they already seem to be within the city,

241
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:29,443
they haven't hit any roadblocks yet.

242
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:31,944
I guess we have no choice but to just wait here.

243
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:35,744
Don't you have a girlfriend?

244
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:39,044
How about you?

245
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:43,243
Well... I guess I do.

246
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:45,043
Me too, I guess...

247
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,043
I see... That's why you...

248
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:49,044
Hey...

249
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:52,443
Will you let me make a phone call?

250
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:54,743
Then...

251
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,343
I'll turn myself in.

252
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:59,344
Rather, I'll go to the police with you.

253
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:01,743
Really?

254
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:02,943
Well...

255
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:05,443
I've got no other choice, do I?

256
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:06,744
Okay.

257
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,243
I wanna use your restroom!

258
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:13,844
Go ahead.

259
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:25,443
Oh, look!

260
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,843
Chie seems to be on the phone with someone.

261
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:30,444
I wonder if she's talking to Someya?

262
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:34,544
Oh! She hung up.

263
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:53,243
I think Someya asked her to come see him after all.

264
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:57,343
Yeah. After threatening her not to tell the police,

265
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:58,443
he probably plans to do his thing.

266
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:00,444
Oh, no.

267
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,943
That is bad!

268
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:12,244
Officer Chiba! Call the Inspector and ask for backup!

269
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:14,643
Roger.

270
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:17,243
Maybe he...

271
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,143
Inspector, Chiba here.

272
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:20,243
Conan?

273
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:23,244
"Danny's Restaurant."

274
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:28,743
Excuse me.

275
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:32,543
Where's the waiter that was punched by Mr. Someya the other day?

276
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:34,143
You mean Mr. Nashimoto?

277
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:37,443
He just got a call a while ago and went to the locker room.

278
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,944
Mr. Nashimoto.

279
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,143
I wonder where he went?

280
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,744
"Nashimoto."

281
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:49,043
This is...

282
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:51,744
So, that's the story, after all...

283
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,743
No good!

284
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,743
Hey, sonny.

285
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,643
If you're looking for Mr. Nashimoto,

286
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:05,044
it seems he's at the dilapidated factory in Haido-cho.

287
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:10,244
I found this memo on the table.

288
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,243
Just what do you mean, Someya?

289
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:18,843
Explain.

290
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:21,243
Didn't you say you were going to turn yourself in?

291
00:18:21,244 --> 00:18:23,043
I did.

292
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:25,843
After I settle things with him.

293
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:27,744
So, explain it, will you...

294
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:29,944
Darn it.

295
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,443
Just what's going on?

296
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:37,044
She's mine!

297
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:41,944
I'm not going to let you have her!

298
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:03,444
Go for it!

299
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:14,243
Conan?

300
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,543
What brings you here?

301
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:18,543
Who the heck is he?

302
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:21,444
He's the stalker.

303
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:23,943
Stalker?

304
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:25,943
Of course, the lady was afraid of him

305
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:30,143
so Mr. Someya was trying to protect her.

306
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:33,443
Oh? Someya?

307
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:34,444
He fled?

308
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:36,043
This is bad!

309
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:39,243
I don't think he fled.

310
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,544
Didn't Mr. Someya make two phone calls?

311
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:50,444
He did make two phone calls.

312
00:19:57,244 --> 00:20:01,143
I see! Then, Someya called that guy

313
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:04,343
and the woman that was being stalked by him.

314
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:05,943
Right!

315
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:09,944
Why don't you trust him till the end, Officer Takagi?

316
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,844
Yeah...

317
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:20,543
I can't wait any longer!

318
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:21,843
Let's get moving!

319
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:24,043
Just a little while more.

320
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:25,443
Another ten minutes...

321
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:27,843
No, another five minutes will do!

322
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:30,343
It's about time you wake up, Takagi.

323
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:33,443
This isn't a movie, you know.

324
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:35,944
I know but...

325
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:49,844
Someya!

326
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:55,643
Look at your face, Officer of MPD.

327
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:58,644
Oh, no. That's not it.

328
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:02,144
Well, you know...

329
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:08,244
I guess I don't have a choice.

330
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,543
There's no way I can flee.

331
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:16,543
We're connected, you see.

332
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:19,343
Right, that's it!

333
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,744
That's the way to go!

334
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:25,944
That the way!

335
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:57,643
What a jerk, that stalker!

336
00:22:57,644 --> 00:23:00,243
The nerve of him to go as far as to deceive us too!

337
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:04,743
So, Mr. Someya fled in order to protect Chie.

338
00:23:04,744 --> 00:23:06,643
In spite of being handcuffed.

339
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:08,243
Well, I guess as to him,

340
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:09,543
he broke free of the rotten chain

341
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:11,843
but he himself wasn't rotten.

342
00:23:11,844 --> 00:23:15,644
Yes! He was actually a kind, good person.

343
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:19,443
His soul wasn't rotten.

344
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:21,343
Although the rotten chain was severed.

345
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,444
Why are you repeating the same thing over and over?

346
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:30,343
The rotten chain broke off, but his soul wasn't rotten.

347
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,843
Rotten soul.

348
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,243
Cut off the rotten chain.

349
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,943
Of the handcuffs.

350
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:36,944
Great pun.

351
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:41,444
I guess this is all for today.

352
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:48,843
"Next Episode."

353
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,943
Which means inside the wallet on the desk

354
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:55,544
was the detailed statement of the bank ATM.

355
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,644
Alibi?

356
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:02,143
Money was supposed to have been deposited by 2:00 pm.

357
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:04,243
But when I confirmed it at the bank ATM,

358
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,743
the money wasn't deposited.

359
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,844
What?

360
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:13,044
Next Conan, "The Three First Discoverers (Part 1)"
