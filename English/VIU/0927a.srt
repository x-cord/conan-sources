1
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:07,643
Happy New Year, everyone!

2
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:11,543
Last year, the comic, TV anime, movie,

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:15,143
and various events were met with great enthusiasm.

4
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:20,344
In particular, the movie "Zero the Enforcer" was a huge hit.

5
00:00:21,144 --> 00:00:26,243
We have all of you who support us to thank for that.

6
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:29,743
We'll be working even harder this year,

7
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:31,844
so we appreciate your continued support.

8
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:54,343
Hold on, Sonoko.

9
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,943
Come on. It's been forever.

10
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:58,343
No...

11
00:00:58,344 --> 00:00:59,743
Give me a break!

12
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:05,243
Come on. I'll take a romantic photo of you two.

13
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:07,443
Let's take one of all of us.

14
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:08,943
Nope.

15
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:14,243
Feel free to share a passionate kiss, missus.

16
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:15,743
What?

17
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,943
In any case...

18
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,844
Go on!

"The Scarlet School Trip: Bright Red and Red Love Arcs"

20
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:43,453
"The Scarlet School Trip (Bright Red Arc)"

21
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,327
Sorry for bumping into you.

22
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:47,728
Did it hurt?

23
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:52,927
You probably shouldn't get too close to me.

24
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,628
I told you, I have a bit of a cold.

25
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:57,727
Are you okay?

26
00:01:57,728 --> 00:02:00,027
I brought some cold medicine.

27
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,627
I'm fine.

28
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:03,727
Dr. Agasa gave me some medicine.

29
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:05,727
Look at you two.

30
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:08,027
Are you planning tonight's tryst?

31
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,427
Sonoko!

32
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,928
If you don't cut it out, I'm really going to get mad.

33
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:18,127
You're even cute when you're angry, missus.

34
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:20,527
Oh, no.

35
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:23,327
I'd only been looking up at her from a low angle recently,

36
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:25,327
so I was starting to forget,

37
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,328
but seeing her up close...

38
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,828
Hey, you.

39
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:34,227
Are you really Shinichi Kudo?

40
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:35,628
Yeah.

41
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,828
What?

42
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,927
You remember me, don't you?

43
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:45,927
Huh? Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:48,327
Didn't we meet on the beach when we were kids?

45
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:50,127
It's been ten years, right?

46
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,927
Ten years?

47
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:54,027
Has it really been that long?

48
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:56,128
Huh? Yeah, of course.

49
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,127
Sera, we're going to the Kiyomizu butai.

50
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,627
Okay.

51
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:04,827
See you later.

52
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:07,827
We can have a nice long chat then.

53
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,127
-Sure. -Hey, Kudo.

54
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:11,227
We sure got lucky.

55
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:13,827
Nakamichi, what do you mean?

56
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:18,527
Three of the Teitan High School popularity contest's top ten girls

57
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:21,027
are in our group.

58
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:25,427
Really? A popularity contest, huh?

59
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:27,628
What rank was Ran?

60
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:32,127
Since you confessed your feelings to Ran in London,

61
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,927
I'll pass on her out of respect for you.

62
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:35,327
You idiot.

63
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:38,227
Sonoko's got a really strong boyfriend,

64
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:40,727
and Sera's a Jeet Kune Do...

65
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:44,527
What? How do you know I confessed my feelings?

66
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,827
Suzuki told everyone.

67
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:50,527
-What? -She said we should support you guys.

68
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,627
Gosh, that Sonoko...

69
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:54,627
Anyway, Kudo...

70
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:57,227
I'm surprised you were able to come on the school trip.

71
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:59,527
I didn't think you'd come.

72
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:00,727
Yeah.

73
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:02,628
It took a lot to get here.

74
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:08,227
That's not why we did it,

75
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:11,927
but if you don't mind, the medicine to restore my body...

76
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:15,427
Absolutely not!

77
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:17,828
I didn't think so.

78
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,427
Do you have a cold?

79
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,428
No.

80
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,527
Conan jumped into the sea

81
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,227
when the strap nearly fell into the water.

82
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:31,327
It ended up belonging to someone else, though.

83
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:34,527
And he kept looking even though his clothes were wet.

84
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:38,627
Come to think of it, you kids seem a little dirty, too.

85
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:41,327
We were looking under cars and stuff, too.

86
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:43,027
We did it for Ai.

87
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:44,827
We're totally fine.

88
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:47,227
Yeah...

89
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:49,327
If it's to help Haibara...

90
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,428
-We know. -I don't mind getting this dirty at all.

91
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:01,027
I guess I'll have to give up on the school trip.

92
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:04,728
I wouldn't want people to know Shinichi Kudo is still alive.

93
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:08,027
It hurts!

94
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,227
What was that for, Haibara?

95
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,127
I'll give you the medicine.

96
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,428
Really?

97
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:17,827
But you have to do as I say.

98
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:18,927
Got it?

99
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:22,128
Yeah, yeah. I know.

100
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:27,827
What a nice view.

101
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:33,027
Yeah, but this place isn't too high up.

102
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:34,928
Looks like about 12 meters.

103
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:38,927
Sera, don't lean over so far. It's dangerous.

104
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:43,427
Apparently, someone jumped to their death from here the other day.

105
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,527
Really?

106
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:46,427
So?

107
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,027
Have you responded to Shinichi's confession?

108
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:50,228
What?

109
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:54,627
Not yet.

110
00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:58,627
Then you really should kiss him here.

111
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:01,527
Imagine you're leaping off the Kiyomizu butai.

112
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,927
I can't do that!

113
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:07,127
What's going on? Ran, are you going to jump off?

114
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:09,128
It's a matter of motivation.

115
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:17,527
You just wait, Dekuri.

116
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,028
It won't be long now.

117
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:30,728
Excuse me, are you the actress Keiko Kurachi?

118
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:34,427
"Keiko Kurachi(37), Actress" -I came here secretly.

119
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,727
Don't tell anyone.

120
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,427
Sure.

121
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:38,727
Is she a celebrity?

122
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:40,927
Can we take a picture with you?

123
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:42,827
Yes, as long as we do it quietly.

124
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:44,427
Thank you.

125
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:47,427
Shinichi, Nakamichi, come here.

126
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,228
Let's take a picture together.

127
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:52,128
Shinichi?

128
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:56,927
Thank you...

129
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:59,027
Hey, you.

130
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:03,827
Are you Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective?

131
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:04,828
Yes.

132
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:07,027
You're Yukiko's son, aren't you?

133
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:09,427
-Yes, that's me. -I thought so.

134
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,527
I've changed your diaper before.

135
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:15,627
-Are you here on a school trip? -Yes.

136
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:18,627
Hey, missus. Your husband's cheating on you.

137
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,427
They seem to know each other.

138
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,527
No way. We're staying in the same hotel.

139
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:26,527
We? Are you here with someone?

140
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:27,927
Yes.

141
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:30,427
Some college classmates and I came

142
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:33,127
to pay our respects to an old friend.

143
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:37,227
I say classmates, but they're all celebrities, too.

144
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,527
Really?

145
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:41,027
I know. Since we're staying in the same hotel,

146
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,027
could you come to my room tonight?

147
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,327
What?

148
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,227
There's something I want to show you.

149
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:47,927
Show me what?

150
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,927
It's a cipher.

151
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,928
Detectives love those, right?

152
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,827
Come see me around nine tonight.

153
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:58,328
Here. This is my room number.

154
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,728
She gave him something.

155
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:07,227
I was going to ask Yukiko's husband.

156
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:09,127
Are you too busy?

157
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:11,227
No, it's totally fine!

158
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:13,027
It's decided, then.

159
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:15,528
You can bring your girlfriend, too.

160
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,627
She's that long-haired girl over there, right?

161
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,028
She's been staring at us this whole time.

162
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:24,227
See you later.

163
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:26,327
I'll be waiting. You have to come.

164
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,628
Okay.

165
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,428
Wait, Ran!

166
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,627
Tonight at nine?

167
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:39,228
That's cutting it close.

168
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,692
"Purify your body and mind, Beautifying Water"

169
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,191
"Momoyama Palace, Bloody Ceiling"

00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,891
Please look up at the ceiling.

171
00:09:56,892 --> 00:10:00,291
The general staying at Fushimi Castle at this time...

172
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:03,691
Wow. So this is the bloody ceiling.

173
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:06,291
It's an ancient murder scene.

174
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,292
It figures a high school girl detective would say that.

175
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,491
Hey.

176
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:12,691
Let's keep moving.

177
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,391
Don't worry. It won't drip on us.

178
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:17,591
I know that.

179
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:19,991
Besides, it was painted on the ceiling

180
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:21,891
to memorialize the men who died in battle.

181
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:25,091
You should look at it and pray for them.

182
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,892
You're right.

183
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,691
Oh, man.

184
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:38,292
This is too much fun.

185
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:48,591
What number is Kurachi's room?

186
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,991
-It's room 1506. -I'm sorry about the poster, Mai.

187
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:53,291
It can't be helped.

188
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:57,391
They've been friends since college, right?

189
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,891
-Besides, I heard that movie... -Mai Kuraki!

190
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,192
-is a remake of one they made in college. -Who?

191
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:07,891
If my name appeared alongside theirs on the movie poster,

192
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,491
it would look like I forced them to do it,

193
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:15,291
even though I sang the theme song.

194
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,391
I'm glad they turned us down.

195
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:18,991
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:22,091
I thought it'd be a good opportunity to promote you.

197
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:24,091
Are you kids in high school?

198
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,191
Are you on a school trip?

199
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,291
Yeah.

200
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:29,891
I see. That's nice.

201
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:32,691
A double date on a school trip, huh?

202
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,291
Oh, to be young.

203
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,492
You made my heart skip a beat.

204
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:41,192
A double date?

205
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:48,792
-I thought I was going to die. -Sorry.

206
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,791
Coming!

207
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:53,792
Welcome.

208
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:54,991
Huh?

209
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:57,591
You brought more than just her.

210
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,991
Sorry. When I told them I was meeting you,

211
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,291
they insisted on coming.

212
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,691
Hello!

213
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:04,191
Should I not have brought them?

214
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,391
No, it's totally fine.

215
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,091
The more, the merrier, right?

216
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:11,191
I'll crack that code for you.

217
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:12,891
She's a detective, too.

218
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,691
A high school girl detective.

219
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,891
Really? How promising.

220
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:18,291
Excuse me.

221
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,791
You wear your hat inside, too?

222
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,291
Oh, this?

223
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:26,091
I tripped during filming and got a bump on my head.

224
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:29,391
Were you filming for your movie that comes out this weekend?

225
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,191
That's right.

226
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,691
"The Fighting Red Tengu."

227
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:35,091
"Shinya Ihaya (37), Actor" -The highlight of...

228
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:38,791
this historical fantasy film is its star, me.

229
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,191
No, no.

230
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,191
I believe the highlight of the film...

231
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:44,891
"Mineto Mayama (38), Movie Director" -is me, the director.

232
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:46,691
No...

233
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:47,692
I thought the selling point of the film

234
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:50,591
"Riki Agata (37), Composer" -was my music.

235
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:51,991
What are you talking about?

236
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:53,191
This movie doesn't exist without its star.

237
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,491
You're wrong.

238
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:57,391
People have always said a movie is made by its director.

239
00:12:57,392 --> 00:12:59,891
They really are all celebrities.

240
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:01,291
That's right.

241
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:05,191
They're all my friends from college.

242
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,791
So, what's this cipher you mentioned?

243
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:10,091
Oh, right.

244
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:12,491
Our scriptwriter Nishiki has it.

245
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,492
Let's go to his room together.

246
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:17,591
Yeah.

247
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:21,591
This is the cipher I received last week.

248
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,291
Let me take a look.

249
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,791
The envelope the cipher came in

250
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:29,091
also contained a dried paper plant leaf.

251
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:30,291
Excuse me.

252
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,591
Do you know what these four black squares

253
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:35,991
at the top of the cipher mean?

254
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:37,291
Yeah.

255
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:41,591
That's the mark of Dekuri, the guy who came up with that cipher.

256
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:45,591
He drew that mark on his notebooks and bags.

257
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:48,091
Then can't you ask that Dekuri person

258
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,791
for the meaning of the cipher?

259
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,291
We can't anymore.

260
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,591
The other day,

261
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:57,691
he jumped to his death from the Kiyomizu butai.

262
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:58,991
What?

263
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:03,191
I thought that cipher was a message he left to me

264
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:06,191
before he killed himself.

265
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,492
That's why I wanted you to decipher it.

266
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,291
Hey, kids.

267
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:16,491
We're going to get dinner in the hotel lounge.

268
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:19,491
If you want to know more, why don't you come with us?

269
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,791
No, thanks. We'll pass.

270
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,791
Then text me when you figure out the cipher.

271
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,092
Got it.

272
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,991
That's a pretty bare-bones cipher.

273
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,091
And the characters are arranged crookedly.

274
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:39,691
There's probably some meaning to those crooked spaces.

275
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:40,891
Come to think of it,

276
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:43,692
I wonder what the paper plant leaf in the envelope was about.

277
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:48,592
Tengu often carry paper plant leaves, right?

278
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,091
It's from Keiko.

279
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,692
Come on. I haven't decoded the cipher yet.

280
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,592
"Shinichi, hurry! Come to Nishiki's room!"

281
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:05,192
What happened, Keiko?

282
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,991
He's been stabbed.

283
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:15,491
And there are bumps on his head.

284
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:20,092
Didn't you say you were getting dinner in the lounge?

285
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:22,091
Yeah.

286
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:26,291
After that, we returned to our rooms to get ready.

287
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,891
We were supposed to meet at this room

288
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:30,691
in ten minutes before heading down.

289
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:32,691
He wouldn't answer the door

290
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:33,991
no matter how many times we rang the bell,

291
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:36,491
so we had a bellhop unlock it.

292
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:38,092
That's how we found him.

293
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:43,492
What is it?

294
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:45,792
Something fell on my shoulder.

295
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,891
It looks just like the bloody ceiling.

296
00:15:54,892 --> 00:16:01,592
Yeah, and the footprints on the ceiling lead to the window.

297
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:04,291
Most likely the culprit wanted it to seem like

298
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:07,891
he lifted the victim to the ceiling to stab him,

299
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:11,091
walked across the ceiling to the window,

300
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:16,192
and vanished from the window of this 15th floor room,

301
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:20,292
as though a monster with wings capable of flight

302
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:25,492
and magic powers capable of manipulating human bodies

303
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,292
committed this crime.

304
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:40,054
You mean a tengu?

305
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,654
Are you saying Nishiki was killed by a tengu?

306
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,254
Don't be ridiculous!

307
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:49,354
But a monster with magic powers who can fly...

308
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,554
What are you talking about? Those don't actually exist!

309
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,254
But it's the only possible explanation.

310
00:16:54,255 --> 00:16:56,354
Tengu are imaginary creatures.

311
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:58,354
They only exist within movies

312
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:01,155
like the one we were filming until recently.

313
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:06,555
Are you saying Nishiki was killed by a fictional monster?

314
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:09,654
Either way, it seems like the culprit

315
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,955
wanted it to look like the work of a tengu.

316
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:16,854
There's a paper plant leaf in the victim's jacket,

317
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:19,354
which tengu often carry.

318
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,955
And a new cipher as well.

319
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:29,354
Maybe the similar cipher Nishiki received last week

320
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:32,154
was a warning.

321
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,254
A warning?

322
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:38,154
Hold on. If there's a new code...

323
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:41,154
Does that mean someone else will be killed?

324
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:46,855
Is it possible this Dekuri person who came up with the code hated you?

325
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:51,754
That's not possible. Right?

326
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:52,955
Yeah.

327
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:58,954
Either way, this is probably the work of someone unhappy

328
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:03,554
with your movie "The Fighting Tengu" that comes out this weekend.

329
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:07,555
The movie's script is scattered all over the floor.

330
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,554
By the way,

331
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:16,455
what are these smooth pieces of paper stuck all over the script?

332
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:20,654
They're labels.

333
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:24,254
Nishiki had been using that type of label recently

334
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:27,754
since they were easy to stick on and take off.

335
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:30,054
Since the movie's going to be novelized,

336
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:32,454
Nishiki brought the script to the hotel

337
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,554
so he could make adjustments.

338
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:36,354
I see.

339
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:40,355
He was so excited to finish it before the movie opened.

340
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,055
Excuse me.

341
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,654
Hello?

342
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:51,154
You said you planned to meet at this room

343
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:53,954
in ten minutes before going to dinner.

344
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:56,854
Who was first to arrive at the room?

345
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:59,754
Me and Agata.

346
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:03,555
By the time we arrived, he wasn't answering his door.

347
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,554
If that's true,

348
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:11,654
then the culprit killed Nishiki and sprayed the ceiling

349
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:15,255
with blood during those ten minutes.

350
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:21,555
Yeah. That blood wasn't there when we came here earlier.

351
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:26,354
Did you call the police?

352
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:31,254
The bellhop who unlocked the door called the police for us.

353
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:35,754
He just called to say a Kyoto Police inspector named Ayanokoji

354
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:37,954
would be coming.

355
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:41,154
Inspector Ayanokoji of the Kyoto Police, huh?

356
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:45,554
He's an odd inspector with a pet chipmunk,

357
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:47,254
but he's a smart man.

358
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,755
We don't have to worry about...

359
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:54,454
Is something wrong?

360
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:56,555
No, it's nothing.

361
00:19:57,755 --> 00:19:59,954
-Hey. -This isn't good.

362
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:02,354
The medicine's wearing off.

363
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,254
Are you okay?

364
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:06,054
Yeah.

365
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:09,754
In any case, the rest is up to you, Sera.

366
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:10,955
Hey!

367
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,954
Are you okay?

368
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:17,154
Yes. The police will handle the rest.

369
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:18,854
I'll leave Sera with you.

370
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:20,954
-If you need anything, talk to her. -Okay.

371
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:23,254
Shinichi.

372
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,954
You look pale.

373
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,854
Is it that bad inside?

374
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:31,554
Yeah. Don't go in there.

375
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:32,654
Shinichi!

376
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,455
Don't follow me!

377
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,254
My cold returned with a vengeance.

378
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:40,354
I don't want you to get sick.

379
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:43,755
I should be fine after a good night's sleep. Don't worry.

380
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:48,755
I can't turn back into Conan in front of Ran.

381
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:51,755
Shinichi...

382
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,554
Yes! First one out!

383
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:01,055
Gosh!

384
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:06,354
Is it a teacher coming to check on us?

385
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:07,554
Seriously?

386
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,854
This isn't good. Kudo's not here.

387
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:12,254
Answer the door, Nakamichi.

388
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:15,654
-Me? -Of course. This is your room.

389
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:17,855
We'll clean this up.

390
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:22,454
I'm coming.

391
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:24,255
Sorry, sir.

392
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:28,954
It's just you, Kudo.

393
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,854
Sorry, Nakamichi.

394
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,754
I forgot my key inside the room.

395
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:35,154
Don't scare us like that.

396
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:37,755
We thought you were a teacher.

397
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:40,354
Anyway, how'd it go?

398
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:43,154
How was meeting the great actress Keiko Kurachi?

399
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:46,254
I... I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

400
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:49,054
I'm tired, so I'm going to sleep.

401
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:50,055
Don't wake me.

402
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:53,354
Seriously? We were looking forward to hearing about it.

403
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,954
You're only interested in idols, Nakamichi.

404
00:21:55,955 --> 00:21:57,454
Well, yeah.

405
00:21:57,455 --> 00:21:59,754
Let's keep playing.

406
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:02,854
Your win earlier doesn't count, Nakamichi.

407
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,254
Why not?

408
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:07,754
We mixed up the cards because we thought a teacher came to check on us.

409
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:10,155
Then you guys can play the rest of the round yourselves.

410
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:16,154
Are you okay, Kudo?

411
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,754
Leave him be.

412
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,954
He's just excited because he finally got to see his wife again.

413
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:22,254
Oh, right.

414
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:23,354
Ran!

415
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:26,055
Shinichi! I missed you!

416
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:30,554
Those idiots are always doing as they please.

417
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:32,954
Hey, you can come out now.

418
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:35,354
Just so you know, Kudo,

419
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,554
you really owe me for this.

420
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:41,454
Yeah, I know. Make sure no one finds out.

421
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:43,255
You can count on me.

422
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:48,854
Oh, right. Hey, Kudo.

423
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:52,855
Before you go to sleep, tell us about your confession to Ran in London.

424
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:58,354
Don't be shy, Kudo.

425
00:22:58,355 --> 00:23:00,354
You're not asleep yet, are you?

426
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:03,654
Did you guys kiss?

427
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,954
If you don't tell us, I'll rip off the covers.

428
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:09,955
Yeah. Of course we kissed, you moron.

429
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:12,854
They really did it?

430
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:14,154
They kissed?

431
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:16,554
Why do you have a Kansai accent?

432
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:19,054
When in Rome, do as the Romans do, you know?

433
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:22,654
You guys had better learn to speak in a Kansai accent, too.

434
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:23,954
Sure.

435
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:26,354
-They kissed? -Lucky.

436
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:28,654
Lucky.

437
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:33,155
I'd better keep my voice changer on me starting tomorrow.

438
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:38,055
Following Haibara's rules isn't easy.

439
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:40,054
Listen closely.

440
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:42,654
The following three rules are important.

441
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,354
Don't take the next dose immediately

442
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:45,954
when the medicine wears off.

443
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:48,554
You have to wait eight hours.

444
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,754
Come up with a plan so the people around you

445
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:54,054
won't notice when you turn into a child.

446
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:58,555
Don't draw attention to yourself when you're Shinichi Kudo.

447
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:02,554
And don't flirt too much.

448
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:04,554
Don't flirt?

449
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:07,054
Wasn't that four things?

450
00:24:07,055 --> 00:24:10,154
Well, the fourth one's not important.

451
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:12,054
But following the first three

452
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:15,354
is my condition for giving you the APTX 4869 antidote.

453
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:17,554
Eight more hours.

454
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:20,854
This is going to be long.

455
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:24,255
Oh, right. I should show Hattori.

456
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:32,955
A message?

457
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:36,654
What's this?

458
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:38,355
A cipher?

459
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,354
I see.

460
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:46,654
The high school detective Shinichi Kudo mentioned me?

461
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:50,255
Yeah. He said not to worry since you're a smart inspector.

462
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:53,254
"Fumimaro Ayanokoji (28)" -I appreciate it.

463
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:55,354
That's odd, though.

464
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:57,954
I've never met Kudo before.

465
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,454
He really does have a pet chipmunk.

466
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:03,254
Perhaps Conan told him about me.

467
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:08,454
Should a police officer be bringing a pet to a crime scene?

468
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:11,854
This is quite the brutal murder.

469
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:13,854
Not only was he stabbed in the heart,

470
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:16,754
but he has two bumps on his head.

471
00:25:16,755 --> 00:25:21,154
It will take some time to examine the crime scene.

472
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:25,354
Could you please wait in your rooms?

473
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:29,555
After all, the victim and the suspects are all celebrities.

474
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:34,155
I'm sure there will be quite the commotion tomorrow morning.

475
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,455
Come to think of it, I slept under the bed.

476
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:04,654
It's been eight hours.

477
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:06,455
Time for my medicine.

478
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:25,355
Will I make it until the end of the school trip?

479
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:32,654
These guys didn't go back to their rooms?

480
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:34,155
Gosh.

481
00:26:36,455 --> 00:26:38,654
It's Keiko.

482
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:39,854
"Shinichi, help! Agata's in trouble now!"

483
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,655
Something happened to Agata?

484
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:45,854
Hey, Hattori! Wake up!

485
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,954
No, I can't eat anymore.

486
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:49,855
Hattori, it's a case!

487
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:55,654
Did Agata really say that?

488
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,954
Yes. He was shouting loudly enough

489
00:26:57,955 --> 00:26:59,954
that I could hear him from the neighboring room.

490
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:02,354
Shouting, "Help me! He's going to kill me!"

491
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:03,854
Seriously?

492
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,254
Keiko!

493
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:06,354
Shinichi.

494
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:09,154
You're Shinichi Kudo?

495
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:12,854
Oh? That boy next to you is

496
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:17,054
the Osaka Police chief's son Heiji Hattori.

497
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:18,854
What are you doing here?

498
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:21,054
Kudo invited me to come hang out.

499
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,754
I just happened to be here.

500
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:24,454
Anyway, what happened?

501
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:28,454
Agata was heard shouting something rather strange inside his room.

502
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:30,754
This bellhop is unlocking the door for us.

503
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:33,054
-It's open. -Thank you.

504
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:36,354
He's probably having nightmares

505
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:40,154
after seeing last night's crime scene and moaning in his sleep.

506
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:42,954
Agata, are you all right?

507
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,054
We're coming in.

508
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:46,355
Agata.

509
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:51,355
Please don't!

510
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,654
A tengu?

511
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:57,154
Forgive me.

512
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,854
Forgive me!

513
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:01,354
Hey, you got any weapons?

514
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:02,754
No.

515
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:04,854
Stay back! Stay back!

516
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:06,554
Darn it!

517
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:08,155
Stay back!

518
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:13,954
It... it disappeared!

519
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:15,654
It went up in flames and vanished!

520
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:17,354
No way!

521
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:20,154
Hey, Kudo.

522
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:23,355
We're not still asleep, are we?
