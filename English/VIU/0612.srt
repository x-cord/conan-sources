1
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:14,571
There was a history of calls received on Saki's cell phone

2
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:16,571
from the Inubushi family?

3
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:20,671
Yeah. About two hours before she fell off the cliff.

4
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:22,271
So the more suspicious

5
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:25,471
the remaining for adopted children are becoming.

6
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,371
It could be that they asked her to go out for sudden urgent shopping

7
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,971
delaying the time she comes home.

8
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:32,471
Then, after the surroundings get dark,

9
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:36,271
they made the dog attack her, you know.

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:41,471
Huh? Isn't it three? Miyuki has an alibi, so...

11
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:43,771
Miyuki is also suspicious!

12
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,471
If she were to make the dog attack,

13
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:48,171
she could do so even if she's with us so long

14
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:51,071
as she blows the dog whistle secretly.

15
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:53,871
After all, she was right below the cliff too!

16
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:56,471
The only one in that house that's not suspicious is

17
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:59,871
Satomi, who's bed-ridden!

18
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:03,671
You... how come you're acting like you're in charge of this place?

19
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:06,571
Are Mr. Mouri's assistant just like Conan, or what?

20
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:10,071
Well, I guess you could put it that way.

21
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,871
Like a keep saying, cut out that assistant stuff.

22
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:18,271
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

23
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,971
Tears are the start of all dramas.

24
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,671
The mystery of the footprints of the demon dog.

25
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,471
Engulfed in flames and the balls left behind.

26
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:26,071
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,071
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,871
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

29
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:15,378
A clan cursed by a dog, the Inubushi family.

30
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,078
After the previous head of the household, Tsunechika

31
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,878
passed away five years ago,

32
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,578
the present head of the household, Satomi is also bed-ridden.

33
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,978
If she dies, the eight adopted children

34
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:29,878
will inherit the vast estate of the Inubushi family,

35
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,278
but, they are dying bizarre deaths one after the other.

36
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:37,678
We went out to investigate the incidents,

37
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:41,378
but the fourth victim fell before our eyes.

38
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:44,178
Footprints of fire were found here and there

39
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:46,878
at the site of the crime.

40
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,478
Could it be that a demon dog engulfed in fire actually exists?

41
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:54,078
Are the serial killings occurring at the Inubushi residence

42
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:56,978
the doings of a cursed demon dog?

43
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:01,278
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

44
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:04,278
"(Footprints Chapter)"

45
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:07,778
He's cute.

46
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:12,178
Yes! It would be nice if the demon dog is this way too.

47
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,778
What's the matter?

48
00:04:23,778 --> 00:04:27,278
What's that? Isn't something glowing over there?

49
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,478
Yes.

50
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:51,178
Kazuha!

51
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,378
Stand up! The front door's right there!

52
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:08,478
What's all the fuss about?

53
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:09,978
The demon dog!

54
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:12,278
The demon dog appeared in the yard!

55
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,178
-Demon dog? -Don't be ridiculous!

56
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,578
It would never appear inside the premises of the house!

57
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:21,278
Don't tell me it jumped over the fence and came inside.

58
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:24,078
That's ridiculous.

59
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:26,678
At any rate, it's dangerous,

60
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:29,678
so I think that you should stay inside for a while.

61
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:32,778
Hachi's barking.

62
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:36,078
I wonder if Hachi's going to be okay?

63
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:37,978
We better bring Hachi here!

64
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:40,878
Hey, girls?

65
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:48,478
No matter what angle you look at it from, it's a plain marble.

66
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:50,778
A pachinko ball, ping pong ball,

67
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:53,978
a round pearl and a marble.

68
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,178
What on earth does the culprit want to say?

69
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:59,078
It's that, that!

70
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,178
A dog and balls.

71
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:07,278
Hey. None of your stupid play on words again now.

72
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:10,678
You can say whatever you like! I'm all ears.

73
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:13,578
It could turn out to be a hint!

74
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:19,078
No! It's stupid so I don't think so!

75
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:24,278
Hey, you! Don't hold out on us! Say it!

76
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:27,778
I won't ever say it!

77
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:36,278
It's true that there are traces of the grass having burned.

78
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:37,978
The rope that was tied by the edge of the cliff

79
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,678
-had been cut too. -Besides...

80
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,978
The sign has also been pulled out.

81
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:47,778
The road sign that was beyond the forked road

82
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:49,778
"Inubushi Residence" -was also knocked down.

83
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:53,878
I see. If chased by a dog in the dark like this

84
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:57,378
without a road sign or a rope,

85
00:06:57,378 --> 00:07:01,878
it would send anyone right over the cliff!

86
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:08,178
The problem is the demon dog that attacked, right?

87
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,678
There's no such thing as a demon dog!

88
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:12,878
This is a psychological trick!

89
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:15,078
It's just being made to look as if

90
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:19,078
a demon dog exists with the story of the cursed dog in the past

91
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:21,478
and the fire footprints!

92
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,078
Fluorescent paint was probably used on the dog to make it glow!

93
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,578
-Fluorescent paint? -Yeah!

94
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:31,178
Since something that usually isn't glowing was glowing,

95
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:33,778
it gave the mistaken impression that something was burning!

96
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,678
Then, what about the fire footprints?

97
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:37,978
There was no smell of oil, was there?

98
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,178
Maybe the fire was set by using a gas burner or something?

99
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:45,778
What is it, Kazuha?

100
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:47,978
It's going to take us a little mover time yet,

101
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:51,578
so if you get sleepy, don't wait for us and...

102
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:53,078
What?

103
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:56,378
The demon dog appeared at the house?

104
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:02,278
Really? Was the dog really burning?

105
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,178
Yes.

106
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:06,678
-Right, Ran? -Yes!

107
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:09,478
It wasn't fluorescent paint or anything!

108
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:11,778
Although the fire's gone already.

109
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:15,278
There were fire footprints left where the dog went by.

110
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:19,878
True. There are burnt remains just like we saw on the cliff.

111
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:23,478
And, where did that dog come from?

112
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:25,878
From over that side!

113
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:30,478
These footprints are strange.

114
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,478
See, judging from the space of the footsteps,

115
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:36,878
there should be some around here too,

116
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:39,378
but there's none here at all!

117
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:42,078
Besides, the ground is messed up only over here.

118
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:45,378
That's the place you fell, right, Kazuha?

119
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:52,478
Yes...

120
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:57,378
and when I fell, I smelled something strange.

121
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:59,778
What do you mean strange?

122
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:04,578
Like rotten onions or something. It had a pungent foul smell.

123
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,378
Onions?

124
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:10,578
Oh, and after we evacuated into the house,

125
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:12,978
we came right out again and saw...

126
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:16,078
It looked kind of alive.

127
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:19,978
Of course! It attacked after all.

128
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:25,578
Oh, no. Not the demon dog, but the burnt footprints.

129
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:29,878
It seemed to be hopping around while making a clanking sound.

130
00:09:30,478 --> 00:09:32,378
You saw it too, didn't you, Kazuha?

131
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:33,678
I did, I saw it!

132
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:37,978
It looked as though the footprints had souls in them!

133
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,578
It's surprising that you went outside again.

134
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:42,978
Despite the chances of the demon dog still being there.

135
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:45,778
Yes, but we were worried about Hachi!

136
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:48,278
We thought the demon dog might eat him.

137
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,778
I've figured out how the demon dog got inside.

138
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,078
The backdoor!

139
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:58,178
The door was unlocked and opened,

140
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,878
and there were the footprints of a dog there too.

141
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:03,978
In other words, the culprit who let the demon dog in

142
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,278
through the backdoor and into the house

143
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,678
is most likely among the four of you

144
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:12,378
who were in the house at that time!

145
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,378
Because bed-ridden Satomi couldn't have done it.

146
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:19,078
Ran and Kazuha.

147
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,678
You said you went outside to feed Hachi,

148
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:24,378
but who asked you to do so?

149
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:26,278
Miyuki.

150
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:28,378
Oh, but she told us that the other three people

151
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,578
refused to feed the dog.

152
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:35,078
Maybe she knew beforehand that we'd be feeding the dog.

153
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,278
Well, it's certain that

154
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,878
someone is keeping the demon dog near this house.

155
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,078
Right.

156
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:44,678
If it wasn't close by, the person couldn't make the dog

157
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,578
attack Ran and Kazuha all of a sudden.

158
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:51,278
Do you have any idea who it could be?

159
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,578
Like you heard a dog bark in the woods or something.

160
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:56,578
Come to think of it.

161
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:59,678
Miwako, the second one who died had asked me

162
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:01,878
to go check a strange hut

163
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:05,078
where she heard the barking of a dog.

164
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:09,278
But, I was scared that I didn't go inside.

165
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:10,678
What?

166
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:11,778
Where is that?

167
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:16,378
I think it was near the swamp where Miwako drowned.

168
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,078
Take us there right away!

169
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,478
-Now? -If you take us now,

170
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:23,178
we may be able to figure out the demon dog trick!

171
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:25,078
True.

172
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:26,878
If the culprit is among somebody here,

173
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:30,278
there was no time to get rid of the evidence.

174
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:35,378
But I'm on duty tonight and have to go back to the hospital.

175
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:39,178
After we check the hut, I'll drive you back by car!

176
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,578
It's probably frightening to walk through the forest alone

177
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:42,978
and go back to the hospital besides.

178
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:47,278
But... back then, I just followed Miwako,

179
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:49,978
so I'm not sure where the swamp is.

180
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:52,578
I'll take you to the swamp!

181
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:57,978
I know the forest by heart and it's not too far from here!

182
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:14,033
So, this is that swamp.

183
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:18,733
Is it true that there was fire around this swamp?

184
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:22,833
Yeah. Although it was just burned traces here and there.

185
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,333
And? Where's the hut?

186
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,133
Well...

187
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:33,433
Oh, there! That worn out hut is it!

188
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:37,233
Okay, so let's go raid the demon dog's nest!

189
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,833
Please watch your step!

190
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,633
This swamp seems to be made of quicksand.

191
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,433
Aren't you going?

192
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:52,033
Of course not! I'll wait in the car!

193
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,733
Is that so?

194
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:02,033
What the heck is this?

195
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,933
This place is packed with books on black magic!

196
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,033
Even a magic circle is drawn on the floor.

197
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:11,833
There's no mistake that someone was keeping a dog here.

198
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,033
But, who on earth could it be?

199
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:17,633
That someone cast a curse on the dog here.

200
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:20,933
Idiot! If people can commit murder by casting curses,

201
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,633
detectives will go out of business!

202
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:25,233
But, Ran and her friend say they saw...

203
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:29,933
So, like I said before that was some kind of a trick...

204
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,433
What?

205
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,233
-Don't move! -Stay still!

206
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,533
Are you all right?

207
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,333
He was just a little burned, that's all.

208
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:04,333
By the way, what we just saw...

209
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,233
Demon dog, wasn't it?

210
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,633
What? It came out again?

211
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:12,033
The demon dog appeared again?

212
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:15,633
Yeah. It's already the third time tonight.

213
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,433
Was the dog really on fire?

214
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,833
Isn't it some kind of a trick?

215
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,633
Yeah. We thought so too.

216
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,733
But no matter how you look at it...

217
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,733
I think it was really burning!

218
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:32,033
It's body was engulfed in flames.

219
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:36,733
Everywhere the dog walked, there were burning fire footprints.

220
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,033
Furthermore,

221
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,633
Tomoaki was attacked by the demon dog

222
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:43,233
and his arm was on fire, and now he has a burn.

223
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,933
Are you all right?

224
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:50,333
Yes, I used the first aid kit I had in my bag and treated it so...

225
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,933
But, I called the hospital to tell them

226
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,333
to find somebody else to take my place tonight.

227
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,833
Why did you get out of the car?

228
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:03,133
I got scared waiting by myself after all.

229
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:07,533
The question is this onion that was found

230
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:11,333
near where Tomoaki was attacked!

231
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,133
Another round thing?

232
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,933
What on earth are you talking about?

233
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:20,133
Come to think of it, you mentioned that

234
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:23,033
when you fell fleeing from the demon dog,

235
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:25,733
you smelled rotten onions.

236
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:31,633
Yes. Maybe the demon dog and onion is connected somehow?

237
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,633
And? Do the police have any idea

238
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,433
who the person manipulating that demon dog is?

239
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:40,933
I'm planning to call forensics in the morning

240
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:44,533
and check out that suspicious hut.

241
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:47,133
I don't think that the culprit will be caught though.

242
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,933
-What? -Why not?

243
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:55,033
Because we're up against a black magic magician, you know?

244
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,833
How could we just normal civilian officers

245
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,933
possibly stand up to somebody like that?

246
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,333
I mean I would really like to get of here

247
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,433
as soon as possible if I could!

248
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,833
Black magic?

249
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,233
We found it in the hut!

250
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,833
A whole lot of those books.

251
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,733
I'd like to ask you just in case.

252
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,633
At the time we encountered the demon dog,

253
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:21,133
all of you were in the house, correct?

254
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,333
I was on the phone right through

255
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,033
making arrangements for Saki's funeral.

256
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:28,733
I was chatting on the computer with my survival game friends.

257
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:32,133
Survival game? That survival thing?

258
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:37,433
Yeah. I'm an instructor at a camp nearby.

259
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:41,133
And I play the survival game with my friends once a month!

260
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:45,133
Then, you must know this forest pretty well too.

261
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,533
I guess so.

262
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,933
But, I'm not as good as Miyuki

263
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:52,833
who used to go pick mountain vegetables together with Satomi.

264
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:56,833
And, is Satomi still doing the same?

265
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,933
Yes. She was asleep in her room.

266
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:04,933
Oh, come to think of it, where are Heiji and Conan?

267
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:07,633
I haven't seen them for a while.

268
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:12,233
I'll bet they were shocked that they're dazed out somewhere.

269
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,933
They believed that the demon dog was a trick

270
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,833
and yet they saw it with their own eyes, you see.

271
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,533
Oh, there they are!

272
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,133
They really looked dazed out.

273
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,233
Let's just forget all the bad stuff!

274
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:32,533
Right! Right! In this world there are strange things

275
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:36,233
that you just can't understand no matter how hard you try!

276
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,933
Strange things that you just can't understand?

277
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,933
Just what are you talking about?

278
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,933
You know, like the demon dog!

279
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:47,533
You guys saw too, didn't you Heiji? The monster on fire!

280
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:51,633
Dad also said that he saw footprints of fire left behind too.

281
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:52,633
Yeah.

282
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,133
As for the trick of the footprints of fire,

283
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:59,433
from what you said about the smell of rotten onions when you fell...

284
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,433
And right after the demon dog disappeared,

285
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:03,533
what you said about seeing a thing on fire hopping around

286
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,033
with a clanking sound,

287
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,633
we figured out approximately what happened!

288
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,333
What?

289
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,933
The footprints of fire were always about 20m.

290
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:16,633
There were traces of something being dragged along too!

291
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:20,133
But, the thing I had to really rack my brains to figure out

292
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:23,133
-was the burning body. -Yeah.

293
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,333
How the culprit engulfed the dog's body in flames

294
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,233
so that the dog would pounce on Tomoaki

295
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,533
and injure him with burns with the attack?

296
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:33,233
If the dog were wrapped with a cloth and really set fire to,

297
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:36,833
there should be the burnt remains of a dog nearby.

298
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,433
If the culprit used an extinguisher or something

299
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,133
to put the fire out,

300
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:43,033
the equipment used should be nearby too.

301
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:46,733
If the culprit waited in the car for the dog to come back

302
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,633
and extinguished the fire on the bed of the car or something,

303
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:51,033
there should be traces of that left behind too.

304
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:53,233
There were no traces of tire marks nearby

305
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,833
nor any sound of an engine running.

306
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,233
Where did the dog disappear to in the first place?

307
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:02,233
If it were burning, when we ran over to Tomoaki,

308
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,433
we should've seen it somewhere.

309
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:07,133
The dog wasn't around?

310
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:11,333
No. It's as if it were swallowed by the darkness.

311
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,633
Swallowed?

312
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:15,233
Are you saying it was swallowed by the dark?

313
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,733
-Wanna eat? -What?

314
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,933
Eat?

315
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:22,633
Oh, I'm talking about dinner.

316
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:25,033
Would you like me to reheat it if you're going to eat?

317
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,433
-I'll eat! -I'm starved!

318
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,933
I'll get to it right away, then.

319
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,633
Oh, I want to ask you something.

320
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,633
Do you have something that crosses your mind

321
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:35,233
when you think of round things or balls?

322
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,233
Round balls?

323
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:38,233
The culprit is always leaving round balls

324
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,133
back at the scene of the crime, right?

325
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:44,933
The Inubushi family and round balls, is there a connection?

326
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,133
The thing that comes to mind

327
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,033
when I think of the word "tama" (ball)

328
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:53,133
is my original last name Tamaki.

329
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:57,433
My nickname when I was a child was also Tama-chan.

330
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,233
Tama-chan?

331
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:02,433
But just because of that, don't say that I'm the culprit, now!

332
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:05,633
I'm not called by that nickname here either so...

333
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:08,033
Do you know the last name of all the others?

334
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:12,933
No. I'm the last one who was adopted and came here.

335
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,833
Come to think of it, you're much younger

336
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,633
than anybody else here, no?

337
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,133
Yes. It seems that I came here

338
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:24,133
when my father Chairman Tsunechika was in his mid 50's.

339
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,633
As for my name, at first,

340
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,333
one kanji character was taken from my father's name,

341
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,033
and Chikae was supposed to be my name.

342
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,833
But mother didn't like it, so I got my present name.

343
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,233
Mother used to hate father.

344
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,533
She used to say she was deceived by a rich man

345
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,833
and then disposed of.

346
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,533
Then why did you come here?

347
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:43,533
You must've hated it if all she did was complain to you.

348
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:48,033
To be honest, I had no intention of coming here either.

349
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:51,433
But, a while after my mother fell ill and passed away,

350
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:54,133
I received a letter from my father.

351
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:57,333
-A letter? -It said, I'm not doing well.

352
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,833
If you're going to forgive me,

353
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,533
come to the Inubushi family and protect the princess for me.

354
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:08,333
The others seem to have received a similar kind of letter too.

355
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,833
-Princess... -Who is it about?

356
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,533
Isn't it about Miyuki?

357
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,833
Because she has a kanji character in her name that reads "princess".

358
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,033
Idiot! Who'd send a letter to the princess herself

359
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,733
asking her to protect the princess?

360
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:25,533
I didn't know who it was about at first either,

361
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,233
but after coming here, I found out

362
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,633
it was about Mother Satomi right away!

363
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:34,533
After all, all the helpers were calling her princess.

364
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,733
Why was she called princess?

365
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:39,933
I was told that father used to always call her that way.

366
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,333
Mother used to laugh and tell him to stop

367
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,533
because it embarrassed her.

368
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:48,633
Could it be because this house looks like a castle?

369
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,333
That's right.

370
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,933
I'm sure that Chairman Tsunechika felt like a King himself!

371
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:57,833
My name is written using the kanji character "kou" which mean happiness

372
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,233
and read "Miyuki"

373
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,533
but mother recommended that

374
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,533
I add the kanji character "princess" to my name.

375
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,633
It isn't read "hime" (princess) to begin with anyway.

376
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,533
Did you change your name?

377
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,133
Yes. Mother told me, "Let's both be "princess" together

378
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:13,233
and live in this castle smiling all the time.

379
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,133
Oh.

380
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,233
Talking about names.

381
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:20,533
There's a strange story regarding our names.

382
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:23,233
About your names?

383
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:27,233
The culprit is among the remaining adopted children.

384
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:30,433
Who on earth is the culprit that's manipulating

385
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:34,233
the burning demon dog and killing the adopted children

386
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,633
of the Inubushi family one after the other?

387
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:00,733
Mother collapsed?

388
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:02,633
Something's on the floor.

389
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,533
It's a bead from the rosary.

390
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,133
This is...

391
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,833
Eight beads?

392
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,133
Could it be some kind of fortune-telling?

393
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,133
No. It's not fortune-telling.

394
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:18,133
-Demon dog? -It's appeared!

395
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:24,033
Next Conan,

396
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,333
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

397
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,133
"(Princess Chapter)"

398
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:46,233
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,633
"Japanese Rosary"

400
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,433
Bite the burning dog!

401
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:50,533
What? How scary.

402
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,933
-Like hot dog. -Hold on.
