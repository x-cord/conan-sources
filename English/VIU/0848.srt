1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:02,937
On the campus of Haido High School,

2
00:00:02,938 --> 00:00:08,237
Magazine editor, Mr. Kyogo Nakatsu was found dead lying face down

3
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:11,037
"Kyogo Nakatsu (42), Magazine Editor" -and pressed into the concrete.

4
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:13,737
"Yusuke Kuchiki (38), Unemployed" -The suspect is Yusuke Kuchiki,

5
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:19,137
who was found face up in the concrete next to Mr. Nakatsu.

6
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:21,637
However, it seems that Mr. Kuchiki

7
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:24,137
testified that an alien who came down on a UFO

8
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,837
killed Mr. Nakatsu in midair,

9
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:31,737
went back inside the UFO and flew off.

10
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:35,537
See! So aliens exist after all!

11
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:36,837
Yeah.

12
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:41,037
No, it's not an alien.

13
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:45,238
This is a murder committed by a human!

14
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:00,037
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

15
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:02,337
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

16
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:04,437
A queer case involving a UFO.

17
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,637
An officer on diet closes in on the mystery.

18
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:08,337
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:10,237
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,638
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:47,462
"Chiba's Difficult UFO Case (Part 2)"

22
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:51,661
Hey, Officer Chiba, what's going on?

23
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:52,761
What do you mean?

24
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:54,461
About the concrete murder case

25
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:57,061
that occurred on October 4th.

26
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:59,961
A great fuss is going on over it online.

27
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:02,661
People are saying that an alien committed the murder

28
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,561
and that the police are trying to hide

29
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:06,261
he existence of the alien from the public.

30
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,761
The article online

31
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:11,061
has many details that have not been publicized yet,

32
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:12,062
and the one who is providing this information

33
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:14,361
is a certain famed detective, it says.

34
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,161
That's probably Mr. Mouri.

35
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:19,561
I happened to run into him at the site the other day, you see.

36
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,461
Then go over to his place right this minute

37
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,161
and ask him what's going on!

38
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,461
Yes, sir!

39
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:25,661
My God.

40
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:27,961
Officer Chiba's changed, hasn't he?

41
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,161
He hasn't changed a bit.

42
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:33,161
He seems to still be absorbed in cartoons and comic books.

43
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:35,561
No. I mean his physique.

44
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,262
You think so?

45
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:39,961
Officer Chiba.

46
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:42,062
I guess you goofed.

47
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:45,361
Leaking classified information.

48
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,661
You shouldn't have.

49
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:49,561
You've got to be really careful when you talk to Mr. Mouri.

50
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,561
Officer Sato and you frequently tell him about the cases too.

51
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,861
I make sure he doesn't leak the info.

52
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:59,361
That's nothing to boast about, you know.

53
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:02,761
Well, there are times I feel like relying on him too.

54
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:06,361
Because no matter how much I ask around, there's no progress at all.

55
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:08,761
Come to think of it, Yumi was saying.

56
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:10,861
If you want to know about 3 months ago,

57
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:14,061
you should've come and asked 3 months ago.

58
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:16,161
Well, I couldn't help it.

59
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:17,761
Because the man who was at the site

60
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:20,361
suddenly changed his story.

61
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:24,861
First, he said he was showered with a strong light and passed out.

62
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:27,861
But then, he says the murderer is an alien

63
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:30,262
who came down on a UFO, who got back in and fled.

64
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:32,961
That's why

65
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:35,361
I had to ask around the vicinity of the site every single day

66
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,861
and I'm pooped.

67
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,761
True, you look a bit haggard.

68
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:42,361
Rather, did you lose weight?

69
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:44,661
Well, about 10 kilograms.

70
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:47,161
The diet methods that I received in the package

71
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,061
were really good, you see.

72
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:52,061
I lose small kilograms everyday,

73
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:54,761
so I enjoy weighing myself.

74
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:58,261
Okay, next it's memory diet

75
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:00,061
and the eating order diet.

76
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:02,761
Maybe I'll send him the papers on the 8-hour diet too.

77
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:03,861
"Mouri Detective Agency"

78
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:05,261
Sorry.

79
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:09,261
I talked about it to my drinking friends half joking.

80
00:05:09,262 --> 00:05:10,561
Gosh.

81
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:13,961
Please tell them to delete the blog right away.

82
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:15,761
But is it true

83
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,961
that the man who was at the site

84
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:21,761
recently started saying suddenly that the perp was an alien?

85
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:25,961
Yeah, he says he suddenly recalled this after 3 months.

86
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,461
Of course this is a secret too.

87
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:32,261
But that man also had a blog,

88
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:33,761
so I took a look at it.

89
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:35,561
And it seems he went into somebody's yard

90
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:37,961
because he wanted to take pictures of UFOs

91
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:41,461
and was arrested by the police for trespassing.

92
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,761
He also wrote that when he went after a UFO on his car,

93
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:47,461
he was caught and given a speeding ticket.

94
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:48,861
He claims that he let the UFO get away

95
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,461
because the police got in his way.

96
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:52,061
He went as far to write that

97
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:54,361
maybe the police was deliberately getting in his way

98
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:57,261
because they don't want to publicize information regarding UFOs.

99
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:59,861
Is that right?

100
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:02,461
This man's a UFO freak, right?

101
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,161
Then I think he'd rather brag on his blog before telling the police

102
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,261
that an alien came down out of a UFO and committed murder.

103
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:11,661
He doesn't seem bothered writing about things like this.

104
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,161
True.

105
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:16,261
If he wants to insist that he's not the perp,

106
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:17,661
he should be writing it.

107
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:22,161
Rather, weren't there any other eye-witness reports on UFO sightings?

108
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:24,861
It flew in the direction of Haido Park, right?

109
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:26,061
Yes.

110
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:29,361
Everybody was at the Haido-cho Festival that day,

111
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:32,061
so the park was virtually empty that day.

112
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:36,361
Then what about during summer vacation when Ran's friend saw the UFO?

113
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,761
Since right before summer vacation,

114
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,361
an elementary school teacher was pushed down

115
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:42,861
from the stairs of Haido Park.

116
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,361
Because of this incident,

117
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,761
everybody seems to have avoided going to Haido Park from fear.

118
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:51,761
From the end of August when a security camera was set up in Haido Park,

119
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:55,561
everybody started feeling safe and started coming back to Haido Park.

120
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:59,961
Then why don't we go to that man's place from now?

121
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,761
From now?

122
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:05,861
If the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri asks detailed questions,

123
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:07,961
the case will be solved

124
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,362
and maybe you won't get so badly scolded then too, Officer Chiba.

125
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:18,262
Mr. Kuchiki.

126
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,362
Mr. Yusuke Kuchiki?

127
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,661
Yes, what is it?

128
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:27,761
I'm Officer Chiba from MPD,

129
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:29,761
and I would like to ask you a few questions,

130
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,161
so do you mind letting us in?

131
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:33,361
Wait.

132
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:36,062
The place is a mess right now.

133
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:47,761
Okay, please come in.

134
00:07:47,762 --> 00:07:49,961
Excuse me.

135
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:53,361
I can't even serve you tea, you know.

136
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:55,262
Well, don't bother.

137
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:01,461
You mean he cleaned the place?

138
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:04,361
Please don't touch anything here.

139
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:06,762
Rather, what's this brat doing here?

140
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:12,661
There are so many photos of UFOs!

141
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,861
I mean what the hell are you doing here?

142
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,761
Oh, well.

143
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,762
He's staying at my place. He loves UFOs.

144
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:23,661
Hey!

145
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:25,062
What do you think you're...

146
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,861
You darn brat!

147
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:35,962
I'm so sorry.

148
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:39,262
He's always into mischief, you see.

149
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,662
You wait outside!

150
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,962
Conan?

151
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:56,461
You want me to give you Hina's phone number?

152
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:59,561
Yep! I have something I'd like to ask her.

153
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:01,661
Hold on.

154
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:04,361
Hina's right beside me now.

155
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:06,561
What? Why?

156
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:09,061
Today our school had joint karate practice

157
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,761
with Haido High School karate club.

158
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:13,761
We just finished and were getting ready to go home.

159
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,461
I'll put her on.

160
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:18,461
Hina. Phone call from Conan.

161
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:20,061
He wants to talk to you.

162
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:23,361
Oh, that smart boy?

163
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,461
"Hina Wada (17), Haido High School, Second-Year"

164
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:27,161
What is it? Did you find the alien?

165
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:30,361
No, not yet.

166
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,861
But I was wondering

167
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,661
what color was the cigar type UFO that you saw, Hina.

168
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:36,961
It was black.

169
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:39,861
It was a bit shiny and pitch black!

170
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,061
I got it.

171
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:43,561
Thank you.

172
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:44,961
Wait.

173
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:46,561
I see.

174
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:48,661
So, that's the story.

175
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,161
That's why he deliberately

176
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:55,261
didn't post and upload on his blog that he saw the alien.

177
00:09:55,262 --> 00:10:00,262
So that no one would try to verify the Unidentified Flying Object.

178
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,962
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Yes.

179
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,861
I'm sorry I'm late.

180
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:15,461
I thought it was just the right distance,

181
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:18,561
so I jogged all the way here from home.

182
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,361
You are...

183
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:23,361
May I ask who you are?

184
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:26,261
I'm Chiba from MPD. Chiba!

185
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:28,261
Please don't forget me.

186
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,461
Officer Chiba, we've been waiting for you.

187
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:33,561
Right. Conan told me to come over.

188
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:36,761
You've figured out the concrete murder case, right?

189
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:37,762
What?

190
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,661
Remember, we made it last night, didn't we?

191
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:43,661
The trick that the perp used.

192
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:45,961
You mean that slender big bag we made

193
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:48,361
by taping black plastic bags together?

194
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:51,961
So, that wasn't your science homework?

195
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:54,861
Let's just call everybody over and try out the experiment.

196
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,561
Because today just happens to be

197
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:59,762
a clear day with no clouds.

198
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,290
What on earth?

199
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:15,190
I talked to you a lot at my room the other day, didn't I?

200
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:17,890
Then, you're insisting that not you,

201
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:20,390
but the alien committed the murder?

202
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:22,690
How else could it have been?

203
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:25,890
Mr. Nakatsu who was found in the half-dried concrete

204
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:30,090
was suffocated to death with a bag-type weapon, right?

205
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:35,590
I may have been lying next to him buried in the concrete,

206
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:39,890
but I didn't have that bag-type weapon on me.

207
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:43,790
The footprints on the concrete are no more.

208
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,590
And since that day had no wind,

209
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:50,090
the bag couldn't have been blown away either.

210
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:52,690
Couldn't you have walked backward out of the concrete,

211
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,990
while retracing the footprints of when you went in?

212
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,390
Idiot!

213
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:59,090
Then those footprints would be deeper.

214
00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:01,590
In the first place, you're not even a student here.

215
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:04,290
What were you doing inside our campus?

216
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,890
Hina!

217
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,591
I saw a UFO around here the day before.

218
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:15,290
That's why I brought UFO magazine editor, Mr. Nakatsu here with me.

219
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,190
We could get a good view

220
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,690
if we go up to the roof of this school, you see.

221
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,090
Rather, what's with that girl?

222
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,190
She witnessed it too.

223
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,190
Flying over Haido Park during summer vacation,

224
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:29,690
the cigar-shaped UFO.

225
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:32,690
See! So UFOs exist after all!

226
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:35,490
The one I saw was probably the same kind too.

227
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:38,390
I was blinded by the strong light it emitted when it fled

228
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,290
and passed out.

229
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,090
Then, wasn't the color of that UFO...

230
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:45,591
this color?

231
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:51,890
No.

232
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:54,790
The one I saw was sort of more grayish.

233
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,790
But I think you can

234
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,790
fly this in the sky just like a UFO, right?

235
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:05,290
Of course, you can suffocate a person to death with this too.

236
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,990
What're you talking about?

237
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,490
Even if you pull such a big bag over a person,

238
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,490
you couldn't possibly murder somebody with this.

239
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,291
Then, try covering your head with it.

240
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:25,890
See?

241
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:28,890
I can breathe even if I squeeze the bag close.

242
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,390
Okay then, Officer Chiba.

243
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:33,991
Can you squeeze the bag from behind Pops?

244
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,090
Like this?

245
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:40,090
I see! Better too big than too little!

246
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:42,590
-This way you can suffocate somebody! -I can't breathe.

247
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,891
Dad!

248
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,790
But I wasn't holding a big bag like this

249
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,190
in the footage of the security camera, right?

250
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:55,390
You're right.

251
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:58,890
I think you hid it in the shrubbery over there or something, right?

252
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:00,890
Even so, I'm telling you

253
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:04,890
that a bag this big wasn't found at the crime scene!

254
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:08,190
That's why you flew it like a UFO, right?

255
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:10,590
By putting air into the bag.

256
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:12,490
Air?

257
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:13,590
How?

258
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,790
If you run around with the mouth of the bag open,

259
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,790
maybe you can get air into it.

260
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,890
But there are no such footprints left on the concrete.

261
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,590
Then open the bag

262
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:26,290
and try waving the bag sideways like you're writing the number 8 horizontally.

263
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,891
Like so?

264
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:33,990
Amazing!

265
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:36,390
-Air is coming in! -It's coming in!

266
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:38,190
After the bag is filled with quite a lot of air,

267
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:41,890
tie the bag shut and all set to go.

268
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,190
Okay.

269
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:45,490
See? This way you don't have to run around

270
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:47,790
to put air in the bag, right?

271
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,390
Right.

272
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:53,690
So, if you swing the bag around like you just did,

273
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:57,590
just those parts should have deep footprints.

274
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,590
You're right.

275
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:02,891
All the footprints look to be about the same depth.

276
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,390
He's no more than a kid after all.

277
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:11,290
If a big monster steps on the footprints, you could hide them.

278
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,390
Monster?

279
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:14,990
I see!

280
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:17,990
He fell on the deep footprints.

281
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:20,790
That way he could hide the footprints with his body.

282
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,590
Like I said!

283
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:27,090
There was no large bag with air inside!

284
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:30,390
If a strong wind was blowing, it could've been flown away,

285
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,090
but that day had practically no wind.

286
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:33,390
No problem!

287
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,890
Because in time,

288
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,690
this black bag will turn into a UFO.

289
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:38,790
What?

290
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,290
It's a bag with only plain air inside it, you know?

291
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,990
No matter how long you wait,

292
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:44,291
it won't work.

293
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:49,791
-It floated! -It floated!

294
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,690
-Fantastic! -Right!

295
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:57,390
The UFO that I saw looked like that!

296
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,890
It's called a solar balloon.

297
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:03,690
When the air inside the bag is warmed by the sun, it inflates,

298
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:08,390
and when the density decreases more than the air outside the bag, it floats.

299
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:12,490
The bag is black so it can easily absorb the heat of the sun.

300
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,290
And the shape is slender and long

301
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:19,290
making the air inside the bag warm faster to the center.

302
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,391
I saw this on an experiment program on TV.

303
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:25,490
I see.

304
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,690
In other words, you committed the crime in this manner?

305
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:30,990
First of all, you knew that this part of Haido High School

306
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,090
would be filled with concrete,

307
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,590
so you called Mr. Nakatsu out here.

308
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,090
Then you used the big long slender plastic bag

309
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:40,590
that you had hidden in the shrubbery,

310
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,890
and pulled it down over Mr. Nakatsu's head from behind.

311
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:47,690
Then you went inside the half-dried concrete and suffocated him to death.

312
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:51,090
You then pushed his corpse onto the concrete, sinking it in deep.

313
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:53,590
Finally, you filled the bag with air

314
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:56,890
using the method we just used and tied the bag shut.

315
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,990
You fell on the footprints that were deep

316
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,190
and threw the bag in the air.

317
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,890
Then all you had to do

318
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:06,490
was wait for the air in the bag to be warmed with the heat from the sun

319
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,891
and float off somewhere.

320
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:13,190
And just as you planned,

321
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:17,290
you made the workers who came to check on the concrete discover you.

322
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:21,790
So the long, slender, large shadow that was recorded on the security camera was...

323
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,290
The shadow of the solar balloon that was used to commit the crime.

324
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,590
What about the UFO that I saw during summer vacation, then?

325
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:30,990
He was probably experimenting

326
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:34,790
whether the black bag would really float through the air.

327
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,290
You guys have been carrying on for a while,

328
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,290
but do you have proof, or what?

329
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:44,090
Proof that I flew that black bag into the sky?

330
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,790
I was holding back till now,

331
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,590
but if you the police are going to be that way,

332
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:49,890
I'll post it all over the internet

333
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:51,390
that the perp is an alien

334
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:54,190
but the police want to hide the fact.

335
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:58,490
As to the evidence, I think it's stuck on a tree in Haido Park.

336
00:17:58,491 --> 00:17:59,491
What?

337
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:02,990
It seems you were able to retrieve the bag that you flew when you experimented,

338
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:04,590
but at the end of summer vacation,

339
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:07,890
the security camera was set up in the park.

340
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:09,090
I see.

341
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:12,790
Initially your plan was to retrieve the bag that you used for the trick

342
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,890
and then insist that the perp was an alien.

343
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:19,090
But because of the security camera, you couldn't retrieve the bag,

344
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,790
so you couldn't say anything even if you wanted to.

345
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,490
If you mentioned anything,

346
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:27,290
eye-witness reports of the black bag flying through the air would be gathered

347
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,490
and that would increase the risk of the black bag

348
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:32,390
stuck to the tree in the park being found.

349
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:36,990
But since there were no such reports even after three months,

350
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:41,090
you decided to go with the "An alien descended from a UFO and did it"

351
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:44,390
that you were initially planning to use.

352
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,190
If that bag is found,

353
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,590
Mr. Nakatsu's saliva and the perp's fingerprints should also be found on it.

354
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:51,890
There could be no better evidence.

355
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:53,690
But what an idiot.

356
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,390
To go out of his way to get stuck in concrete

357
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:58,391
in order to make the murder look as if it were committed by an alien.

358
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,990
I did what he wanted me to do.

359
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:05,390
That Nakatsu

360
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,990
had the nerve to look at the photos of the UFOs I took with all my heart

361
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:09,790
and say...

362
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,690
No good. They're out of focus.

363
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,491
Besides, it's too small and you can't make out what it is.

364
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:19,990
Bring me more flashy pictures with impact.

365
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,590
Go and use a trick if you have to.

366
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:26,190
Because UFOs don't exist anyway.

367
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:28,890
He edited UFO magazines

368
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:32,190
and yet he had the nerve to say something like that!

369
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:34,390
All you had to do was hold true to your heart

370
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:39,390
and take better photos of real UFOs and put him to shame.

371
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,090
But instead, you set the alien that you believe in up as the perp

372
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,190
and tried to get away with the crime you committed.

373
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:49,090
Right now to me, you look more like

374
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:52,191
an unidentified alien more than anything else.

375
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:01,390
Yusuke Kuchiki.

376
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:02,790
Let's go.

377
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,190
Officer Chiba's awesome.

378
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:10,290
Kyogoku would knock a guy like him over anyday.

379
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,690
I see!

380
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:15,390
Kyogoku belonged to the Karate Club at Haido High School, right?

381
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,490
That's right.

382
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:19,090
He's abroad as an exchange student right now,

383
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:23,091
but it seems some rich girl keeps hanging around him though.

384
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,190
I'm amazed that you figured out this trick.

385
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:32,290
When I opened the top cabinet of his room,

386
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,790
there were a lot of science books, black plastic bags and tape shoved inside.

387
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,490
But how did you know they were all in there?

388
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:40,690
His hand!

389
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:45,090
After he cleaned his room and let us in,

390
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:47,390
only his right hand was white.

391
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:48,990
That's how I found out

392
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:51,790
that he raised his right hand up above his chest

393
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,490
and hid something important.

394
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:58,890
But you noticed that too, didn't you, Pops?

395
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,190
Yeah.

396
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,491
Of course.

397
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:05,591
Of course I noticed.

398
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,690
Officer Chiba, I heard.

399
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,690
You nabbed the alien?

400
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:33,590
Hey, is it true?

401
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:35,090
No.

402
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:36,990
I arrested a suspect who tried to make the murder look like

403
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:39,190
it was committed by an alien.

404
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,990
Well, it was practically all thanks to Conan, though.

405
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:46,090
Chiba is starting to look a bit awesome.

406
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:47,890
He's not only a bit awesome!

407
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:49,691
He's really awesome.

408
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:54,490
He wasn't giving it his all till now, I guess.

409
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:56,090
Right, right.

410
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:59,091
He's like the star of a detective drama.

411
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:02,590
Maybe I'll launch an attack at him.

412
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,090
No, you don't! Me first!

413
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:06,691
What?

414
00:23:08,191 --> 00:23:10,490
"Several days later" -Officer Chiba.

415
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:14,290
You gained your weight back.

416
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,890
You think so?

417
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:21,990
A load of early handmade Valentine Day chocolates was delivered.

418
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,990
I tasted one and it was so delicious,

419
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:25,590
so I kept on eating.

420
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:27,690
Overeating is not good.

421
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:29,990
Detectives need to keep in shape, you know.

422
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,890
That's mutual for both of us.

423
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,290
True.

424
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,490
A complete rebound.

425
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,790
Officer Chiba's not for me, after all.

426
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,790
You can say that again.

427
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,591
All right!

428
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,190
"Next Episode" -It's already gone!

429
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:51,290
Was anything written on the envelope?

430
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,091
You mean that envelope with the marriage registration inside it.

431
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,490
So, you've finally come, Chacha.

432
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:01,690
"Marriage Registration" -Did you look inside the envelope?

433
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,090
After getting hold of the Seven Crowns,

434
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:06,191
I will await Yumi's answer totally ready for her.

435
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,890
Next Conan,

436
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:13,691
"Marriage Registration Password (Part 1)"
