1
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:04,121
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:06,221
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:08,021
The three kimono beauties are the suspects.

4
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:09,821
Solve the mystery of the mole on the chest.

5
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:11,421
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:13,121
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:15,122
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,280
"The Little Client (Part 2)"

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,479
No murder weapon?

10
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,479
Well...

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,979
"Tomoka Saegusa (28)" -I can't believe it.

12
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,079
You haven't even found the murder weapon.

13
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,179
We're going back to work then.

14
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,479
Wait!

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,179
I'd like to question you all later,

16
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,779
so please wait in another room till then.

17
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,679
If you insist that we wait, I guess we will.

18
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,879
"Toshika Bessho (29)" -But I won't answer

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,579
no matter what you ask me.

20
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,179
"Mitsu Kusano (34)" -There's nothing suspicious about us.

21
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,579
We were just taking an outdoor bath,

22
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,179
so we're not going to let you treat us like criminals.

23
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,279
An outdoor bath?

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,679
Yes, it seems that they all took a bath at about 11:55 pm,

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,179
which is around the time of the crime.

26
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,379
Then, about 20 minutes later,

27
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,279
Mr. Mouri went in as well.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,579
What? He went in?

29
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,379
Don't tell me you peeked into the women's bath?

30
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,979
It's for both men and women.

31
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,279
I see. Just because it's for both women and men,

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,479
it doesn't mean that you can go ahead and look in, you know!

33
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,179
I'm telling you! So listen!

34
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,379
I just thought that if somebody was already inside,

35
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,479
-I'd be lucky... -Huh?

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,080
Isn't this movie the one that Kazuki acted in?

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,879
Why is something like that found over here?

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,379
It's the video that Mr. Kamoshita rented.

39
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,779
They rent out movie videos here at the inn.

40
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Give it to me.

41
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,480
Let's take a look at it.

42
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,779
Mr. Mouri, we don't have time to watch that.

43
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,880
Some clues could be hidden in it, right?

44
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,779
It looks like a scary movie.

45
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,380
It's only kid's stuff.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,479
Don't worry.

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,479
Your mother's not the killer.

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,780
I'm not worried about that lady at all.

49
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,279
Kazuki?

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,979
The sound reminds me of my mother.

51
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,279
Huh?

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Wait!

53
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,279
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,679
A guest suddenly said he wants dinner.

55
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,979
Was it noisy?

56
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,179
No.

57
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,779
So you want to see your mother after all, don't you, Kazuki?

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,179
Not really.

59
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,280
I just thought that it'd be a hint to finding her.

60
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,679
Hey, stupid! Look behind you, behind!

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,279
Behind you, I said!

62
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,080
Wait. Something's coming from the ceiling!

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,479
Talk about getting carried away.

64
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,180
"The end."

65
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,579
It was quite amusing, wasn't it?

66
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,579
Yes.

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,079
But we really got nothing out of it, didn't we?

68
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,479
I guess not.

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,780
I see. I get it now.

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,379
That's why the killer soaked his body

71
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,679
into the bath tub after strangling the victim.

72
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,779
There are only two mysteries left to solve.

73
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,979
The reason why the killer took a bath

74
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,779
and that mole.

75
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,579
The killer could've gotten naked to set the victim off guard,

76
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,280
but what about the mole?

77
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,379
Officer Yokomizo, may I have a moment with you?

78
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,580
Yes, what is it?

79
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,379
We were concerned about the trace on the neck

80
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,979
that we didn't notice at first.

81
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,479
But there were marks of the victim

82
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,380
being hit several times on the back of his head.

83
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,979
Then, was he struck to death?

84
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,479
No. He seemed to have bled,

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,079
but it wasn't what killed him.

86
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,579
It's most likely that the killer hit him, and after he passed out,

87
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,779
she strangled him to death.

88
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,879
If so, this shower nozzle is very likely

89
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,279
the weapon that was used to hit him.

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,279
Please do a luminol reaction test right away.

91
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,379
I see. So that's the story.

92
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,979
That means the most suspicious person

93
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,179
would be the one who tried to hide it.

94
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,979
Okay, I'll put Pops to sleep using the tranquilizer gun.

95
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,779
-Hey, Conan. -Huh?

96
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,079
What do you mean, "Huh"?

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,479
It's past three o'clock already,

98
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,279
so you'd better get to bed!

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,379
But...

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,979
We've got to go look for Kazuki's mother

101
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,879
who's a good cook tomorrow, you know.

102
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,279
Good cook?

103
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Remember?

104
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:13,679
He mentioned that he used to go to sleep a lot

105
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,479
while looking at his mother's mole.

106
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,979
It seems that he used to hear

107
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,079
the rhythmical sound of the knife cutting things.

108
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,579
It means that she's a good cook, right?

109
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,379
I... I guess so.

110
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,979
I'll be right over, so please lay the mattress out for me, okay?

111
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,379
Promise, okay?

112
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,780
And if Kazuki gets up, please tell him something.

113
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,680
His mother is not the killer.

114
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,579
Inspector Yokomizo, luminol reaction was detected

115
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,479
from the shower nozzle.

116
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,879
The killer must've hit Mr. Kamoshita on the head

117
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,379
with this shower nozzle,

118
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,079
knocked him out and then strangled him to death.

119
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,979
And did you find that thin, long, black string

120
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,279
that was used to choke him?

121
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,679
Well, we looked all over

122
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,179
where the three suspects could've hidden the string,

123
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
but no luck so far.

124
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,479
This means that somebody out of those three

125
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,179
must still have it on her.

126
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,179
Okay, tell the policewoman

127
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,379
-to do a body check on them. -I think...

128
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,079
that would be useless.

129
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,179
-But... -You saw it, didn't you?

130
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,779
The picture that was taken on the cell phone

131
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,879
the moment Mr. Kamoshita was being strangled to death!

132
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,379
There was a mole on the left side

133
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,779
of the chest of the woman, wasn't there?

134
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,879
But Ms. Kusano's mole on her chest was on the right side.

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,079
Ms. Bessho's was on her left cheek.

136
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,479
And, Ms. Saegusa's was on the back of her neck.

137
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,779
They are obviously not the killers.

138
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,179
If you try to do a body check on them,

139
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,879
you're just going to get them angrier, don't you think?

140
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,179
But the only ones who don't have an alibi

141
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,280
among the employees of this inn are those three.

142
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,979
Well, let's call it a day for now.

143
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,679
And I'd advise you to do a re-check on everyone in this inn,

144
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,979
including the guests.

145
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,579
-Okay. -It did poke him for sure.

146
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,079
What is going on?

147
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,079
It seems that there's an off-season mosquito here too.

148
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,579
A mosquito?

149
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,380
See. I got a bite on my neck just a while ago...

150
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
What?

151
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,680
Jalapeno, harami...

152
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,579
Here he comes! The Sleeping Kogoro!

153
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,079
It turns out the needle just didn't poke him deep enough.

154
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,879
All right then, Officer Yokomizo.

155
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,179
Please gather the things that I ask for

156
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,679
and bring the three suspects here.

157
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,979
Mr. Mouri.

158
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,879
You've figured it out after all!

159
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,479
Yes. Let me explain the truth

160
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,479
of what went on in this room

161
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
regarding the strangulation of Mr. Kamoshita.

162
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,879
What you're saying doesn't fit in

163
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,280
with what you've been saying just a while ago.

164
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,880
All right, Mr. Mouri!

165
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,479
Everything's set.

166
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,580
Sleeping Kogoro's deduction show is about to begin!

167
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:04,765
Hey, wait a second.

168
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:07,895
Why do we have to be called in again?

169
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,695
You saw for yourself already, didn't you?

170
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:12,795
We don't have the same mole that the killer had!

171
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:16,095
Besides, has the murder weapon been found?

172
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:19,196
You can't prove the murder without it, can you?

173
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,195
Of course we found it.

174
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,795
Right, Mr. Mouri?

175
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,995
No, we haven't found it.

176
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:26,996
What?

177
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:31,095
It has most likely been destroyed.

178
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,395
Destroyed? Mr. Mouri...

179
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,795
But we know what the killer used

180
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:38,895
to strangle Mr. Kamoshita

181
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:41,395
because we have this screwdriver.

182
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:45,495
Oh, it seems as if your hands have become a bit smaller.

183
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:48,995
Never mind the details.

184
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:51,096
Inspector! I've rented it.

185
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,495
Shall we compare the two, then?

186
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:01,895
The video of the same movie that Mr. Kamoshita rented from this inn

187
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:05,696
and the video that we rented from the rental video shop.

188
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:09,895
First, we'll look at Mr. Kamoshita's video

189
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,696
that was here in this room.

190
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:20,695
Just as we've seen before,

191
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:23,095
it has a scary opening scene.

192
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:26,395
Next, let's look at the video from the rental video shop.

193
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,095
What? Is that all?

194
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,296
Yes.

195
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:47,495
The spot display of the video company...

196
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:49,995
and the spot display of the movie company.

197
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,996
What? Hey.

198
00:10:53,296 --> 00:10:54,795
Besides that, this is...

199
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:57,895
-the prologue of the movie. -So, let me explain the story

200
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,195
of the cursed stairs...

201
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,395
Strange. The opening title

202
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:03,895
appeared immediately in the other video we just saw.

203
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,495
It's been cut off

204
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:08,296
and shortened by about one minute.

205
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:15,695
And the killer used it to murder her victim.

206
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:17,795
I see! It's the video tape!

207
00:11:17,796 --> 00:11:19,895
The killer victim opened the video tape using a screwdriver

208
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,595
and removed the tape from inside,

209
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:24,295
then cut off enough tape to use as the murder weapon.

210
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:27,895
She then reconnected the tape together with scotch tape.

211
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:28,995
If she adjusted the tape

212
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:32,195
so that the opening title appears when the tape is played,

213
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:34,795
she wouldn't be suspected

214
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:37,695
even if the police were to check the tape later.

215
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,395
But the black string that was taken on the cell phone

216
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:42,595
looked much thinner.

217
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:44,595
That's easy.

218
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:46,595
Hey, disassemble the brand new tape

219
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:49,195
that Mr. Mouri told you to go buy.

220
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,196
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:04,395
Now, please look!

222
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,695
If you don't do anything, it's nothing but a plain black strip.

223
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:09,496
But if you twist it like this...

224
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,095
Why...

225
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,595
It doesn't look like a thinner string.

226
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:16,895
It sure doesn't.

227
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:20,295
Instead of twisting it, you stretch it out.

228
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,995
Stretch it out?

229
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:24,396
How can you stretch it out even more...

230
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:30,695
Yes. When you pull the tape really hard,

231
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:33,295
it becomes thinner.

232
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:36,995
While I'm at it, the length of a tape being played at normal mode

233
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,895
is about 30 centimeters per 10 seconds.

234
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:40,995
That is 180 centimeters per minute.

235
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:44,295
So if you stretch it out, it can easily go over 2 meters.

236
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,495
It's long enough for the killer

237
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:49,695
to wind around both hands, then strangle the victim to death.

238
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:54,196
So that's why the tape was a minute short.

239
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:57,795
He looked at the recording time

240
00:12:57,796 --> 00:13:00,595
that is posted on the box of the video!

241
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:02,395
Where did you come from, Conan?

242
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:05,095
See, it says the duration is 94 minutes.

243
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,595
but the counter of the video tape that we just saw

244
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:10,495
was 1 hour and 33 minutes.

245
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,495
Right, Pops?

246
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:16,395
But where's the video tape that was used to kill the victim?

247
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,095
She probably burned it with a lighter or something

248
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:22,595
and shoved the ashes down the drain of the bath tub.

249
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:25,895
After all, video tapes are made from very easily burnable substance.

250
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:29,995
Well, there's no doubt that the murder weapon is the tape.

251
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:31,895
If you check the video tape,

252
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:34,495
the part of the tape that was connected will probably be found.

253
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,895
Therefore, the killer tried to deceive the police

254
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:40,396
by soaking the body in a tub of water.

255
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:42,995
Didn't the killer do that to complicate

256
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:44,795
the estimation of the time of death?

257
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:46,695
Then please take a look

258
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:49,995
at your left hand that is holding the video tape.

259
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,895
What is this black trace?

260
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:55,095
This is the black magnetic substance

261
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:58,495
that is on the surface of the video tape in order to record images.

262
00:13:58,496 --> 00:14:02,395
The killer tried to wash the black traces

263
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:06,295
off Mr. Kamoshita's neck, but his yukata got wet,

264
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:10,396
so she dunked his body into the water.

265
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:17,795
But the killer couldn't wash off what she had to the most.

266
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,595
The thing that would serve as conclusive evidence,

267
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:21,295
her red mole.

268
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:22,695
Red, you said?

269
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,095
Are you saying that the mole in the picture was...

270
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,895
Well, that wasn't a mole,

271
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:30,295
but something that flew on her when she hit

272
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:32,695
and knocked Mr. Kamoshita out with the shower nozzle.

273
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,096
It was his blood!

274
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:37,695
I see.

275
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:42,495
It looked like a black mole because the scene was static.

276
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:44,495
So, the killer took off all her clothes

277
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,995
to avoid getting blood on her yukata.

278
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:50,295
Yes. That's why the killer said

279
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:53,795
that she wanted to take a shower when she came to this room.

280
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:56,095
She probably said something like the shower broke

281
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,395
and lured Mr. Kamoshita into the shower room.

282
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:00,695
When he came in,

283
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:03,095
she hit him with the shower nozzle and knocked him out.

284
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:06,995
Without bothering to put on her clothes, she cut the video tape.

285
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:10,695
She then used it to strangle Mr. Kamoshita.

286
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:14,295
She was not aware at that time that her picture was being taken.

287
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:18,495
The killer wiped off the blood that splattered on her,

288
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:20,495
left the room, and put away the scissors

289
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,495
and screwdriver where they originally were.

290
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,195
She headed for the outdoor bath

291
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:26,895
to completely wash off the magnetic substance on her hand

292
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:29,195
and the blood that splattered on herself.

293
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,995
Am I wrong?

294
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,495
The one who tried to hide the red mole,

295
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:34,996
Ms. Toshiko Bessho?

296
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:38,595
She... she tried to hide it?

297
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,295
Don't be ridiculous! She was the first one

298
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:42,995
who showed you her body of her own initiative!

299
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:46,095
Yes. That was what bothered me.

300
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,595
Being as introverted as she is,

301
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:51,095
what she did was way out of line of her actual character.

302
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:52,895
That's when I realized

303
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,895
that it's a blind spot under the collar bone.

304
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:57,295
That the killer didn't know

305
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:59,295
that there was blood by her chest

306
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:02,195
until she saw that picture.

307
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:06,095
But there was no blood on her chest!

308
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:09,995
Of course it came off when she took a bath,

309
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:13,195
but the traces of it may be found if a body check is carried out.

310
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:15,195
That's why Ms. Bessho, afraid of this,

311
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,995
grabbed that part with her hand

312
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:19,495
so that it would be out of view,

313
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:22,995
and made the police confirm that she had no mole.

314
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:25,996
All of that was to avoid a body check.

315
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:31,695
She didn't want the police to find Mr. Kamoshita's blood

316
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:34,795
that had splattered on the underwear of her kimono!

317
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:36,495
No way.

318
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,095
So, you did it?

319
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,295
You blackmailed Kazuki's agency

320
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:44,495
despite being his mother?

321
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:45,895
What?

322
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,296
Why did you do that?

323
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:50,595
It was a joke.

324
00:16:50,596 --> 00:16:51,895
A joke?

325
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:53,995
I probably did it out of envy.

326
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,895
I wanted a child really badly.

327
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,295
So, you're saying...

328
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:00,895
Yes, I'm not his mother.

329
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,795
The thing about his father being a killer is also a lie.

330
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:05,095
I thought that if I said so,

331
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:08,295
his agency would stop giving the postcards

332
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:10,195
that his mother had been sending to him.

333
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,595
But a while later,

334
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:13,995
money was really deposited into my account.

335
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:15,695
I was at a loss what to do,

336
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:18,895
and that was when that guy sniffed things out and came around.

337
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:22,495
I called this room and told him everything honestly.

338
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:24,395
That everything I said was a lie.

339
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:27,196
But that man had the nerve to laugh and...

340
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:31,295
Dear mother, I know how you feel about wanting to protect your child.

341
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,895
But you see, I'm doing business here.

342
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:36,695
Well, if it's really all baloney,

343
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:39,695
it's my turn to blackmail you this time.

344
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:42,095
I'll suck up to you for the rest of your life.

345
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:44,695
That's why I got scared.

346
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,095
I was scared, so I...

347
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:50,695
How did you find out the details

348
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,895
about Kazuki and his mother?

349
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:55,596
I'll tell you about it at the station.

350
00:17:56,696 --> 00:18:00,496
But officer, I don't regret what I did.

351
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:04,695
Because I think I made her understand how it feels

352
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:07,796
for a woman to want a child really badly.

353
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:14,195
What?

354
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:17,495
So, Ms. Bessho was the killer?

355
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,795
Yes. Pops said he was going to Shizuoka Prefectural Police

356
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:24,595
for questioning together with the other officers.

357
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:26,095
He also said that he's leaving his wallet behind,

358
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:29,295
so you can take the kids home.

359
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:31,095
Where's Kazuki?

360
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:34,895
Oh, he got dressed and headed off to the front door

361
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,295
saying that he was leaving.

362
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,995
Wasn't he going to look for his mother?

363
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:41,695
He was.

364
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:42,795
But he's been acting strange

365
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:44,395
ever since last night before he went to bed.

366
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:47,195
He wouldn't answer no matter what I asked him.

367
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:50,596
I wonder if I should've carried him instead of piggy-backed him?

368
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,095
Come to think of it, Conan,

369
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:57,795
you were saying that Kazuki's mother wasn't the killer.

370
00:18:57,796 --> 00:19:01,696
Does that mean you know who Kazuki's mother is?

371
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:06,395
"To Ms. Mitsu."

372
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,195
-Here you go. -Thank you so much.

373
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,895
I'll treasure it.

374
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:10,995
Me too.

375
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,195
So will I.

376
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:14,396
Can I have get an autograph for my grandson?

377
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:18,395
She did not carry him in front, but piggy-backed him?

378
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:22,895
Yes! When Kazuki fell asleep while looking at the mole,

379
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,895
he heard his mother chopping food with the knife, right?

380
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,995
She couldn't have done so if she carried him in front of her.

381
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,195
Oh, I see.

382
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:32,995
Kazuki was probably hugged when he was raised at church,

383
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:35,795
so he probably mistakenly thought the mole was on his mother's chest.

384
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,195
So, you're saying that his mother

385
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:38,995
is the one with a mole on the back of her neck,

386
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:40,296
Ms. Saegusa?

387
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:47,995
But she seemed so stuck up and cold towards him, didn't she?

388
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:50,295
She was acting that way deliberately

389
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:51,995
so he wouldn't recognize her as his mother.

390
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:56,095
She figured it would cause Kazuki problems if he found out.

391
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:57,695
I'm sure that Ms. Saegusa

392
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,695
had told the killer, Ms. Bessho about him.

393
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:03,595
About having no other choice but to leave him at church,

394
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:06,295
and how much she loved him.

395
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:08,095
Ms. Bessho probably figured out from the story

396
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:11,295
and the postcards that she sent out every month,

397
00:20:11,296 --> 00:20:13,795
that Ms. Saegusa was his mother.

398
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,395
The postcards stopped coming since winter of last year

399
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:18,295
probably because Ms. Bessho blackmailed Kazuki's agency

400
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:19,495
just around that time,

401
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:22,695
so they stopped giving the postcards to Kazuki.

402
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:25,096
Pops was the one who said that!

403
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,695
But how does he know

404
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:29,495
that she left him at church because she had no choice?

405
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,295
Because if the son whom she wrote to every month

406
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,295
appears before her,

407
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:35,595
the first thing you'd expect her to do is to hug him!

408
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:38,395
After all, he's famous and rich.

409
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:41,395
Despite that, she held back her feelings and acted indifferently.

410
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:45,195
That goes to show how much she must really care for him, right?

411
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:46,496
I guess you're right.

412
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:49,495
Ran?

413
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:52,995
I'm going to tell Kazuki about this.

414
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:54,595
I feel sorry for him having to hold a grudge

415
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:55,996
against his mother all his life.

416
00:20:56,896 --> 00:21:00,895
On the contrary, I think he's dying to see her.

417
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:02,095
The fact that the postcards from his mother

418
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:04,195
are all wrinkled up and stained

419
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,095
only proves that he read them in tears over and over.

420
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:08,695
Besides, I'm sure Kazuki already knows

421
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:10,995
who his mother is.

422
00:21:10,996 --> 00:21:13,595
Go on. Why don't you get his autograph too?

423
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:15,195
No, I don't think so.

424
00:21:15,196 --> 00:21:16,995
How come you're so hesitant?

425
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:21,096
You watched his videos and movies over and over too.

426
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:23,596
Come on.

427
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,596
I'm not giving you my autograph.

428
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:34,795
But I'll give you...

429
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,496
this instead.

430
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,496
I'll come again if you don't send these out.

431
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,596
Wait, Kazuki.

432
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:54,096
"Postcards"

433
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:58,296
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:01,896
I'm so sorry, honey.

435
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:04,196
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:32,195
Three days later,

437
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:34,895
he received payment for the job he was asked to do.

438
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:36,395
What...

439
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:39,496
What exactly is this?

440
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:43,295
It looks like a piggy bank no matter what angle you look at it from.

441
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,195
No... no way.

442
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:47,895
Is this all he's paying us?

443
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:51,095
-Maybe kid actors don't make much? -135 yen, 185 yen...

444
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,895
Let's see...

445
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:56,496
I mean, this doesn't even cover the travel expenses!

446
00:23:57,296 --> 00:24:00,696
"Next Episode."

447
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:08,896
He's walking?

448
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:12,896
Wow, he's walking.

449
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,195
It can't be!

450
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:18,096
Then how the hell is he up there?

451
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:23,595
Next Conan special,

452
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:27,296
"Thief Kid's Wondrous Sky Walk."

453
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:45,895
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:47,695
"Wind."

455
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:48,696
The next episode is already time for the new semester!

456
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,395
Movies and TV programs start together with Conan.

457
00:24:50,396 --> 00:24:51,996
The target is the Kid!
