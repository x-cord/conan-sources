1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:01,978
Pops was chosen as

2
00:00:01,978 --> 00:00:05,878
the Japanese Detective League's Best Detective Award.

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:08,578
"Kokura Station" -We came to Kokura, Fukuoka,

4
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:11,078
to attend the award ceremony.

5
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,178
"Miyajidake Shrine" -Leaving Ran, who wanted to go sightseeing,

6
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:14,378
"Munakata Taisha" -Pops and I stopped by the company

7
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,278
"Munakata Taisha" -run by Torazo Fukamachi,

8
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:20,678
"Tiger Tradings" -his senior from his police days, but...

9
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,978
He was hospitalized for an injury?

10
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:24,078
"Torazo Fukamachi (63), Tiger Tradings President"

11
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:27,878
A week ago, President Fukamachi accidentally tripped and hit his head,

12
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:29,878
and he was still unconscious in the hospital.

13
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:32,378
Graffiti threatening Director Kiriyama,

14
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:35,878
the man next in line for the president's seat, was discovered.

15
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:38,078
As Pops began his investigation,

16
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:39,878
President Fukamachi's son, Torahiko,

17
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:42,578
emerged as his prime suspect.

18
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:43,978
"Torahiko Fukamachi (21), Torazo Fukamachi's Son"

19
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,478
Sorry, were you waiting long?

20
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:48,678
Huh?

21
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,778
Sorry, but could you be my girlfriend for a while?

22
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:55,878
What?

23
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,878
I'm being followed by bad men.

24
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:00,278
I just need 10 seconds.

25
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:01,378
What?

26
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:04,378
Let go!

27
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,378
Stop resisting!

28
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:07,778
What are you doing?

29
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:10,878
Stay out of the way!

30
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:15,878
Ran, what's wrong?

31
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:17,378
What happened?

32
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,478
Ran!

33
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:24,878
In my eyes are maximum creation.

34
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,678
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

35
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:28,278
A series of cases plague those involved!

36
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:30,278
What is the deep mystery hidden in Kokura and Moji?

37
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:31,778
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:33,578
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:35,978
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,950
"The Northern Kyushu Mystery Tour (Moji Arc)"

41
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:25,847
Stay out of the way!

42
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:29,847
Let's go!

43
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:44,647
What are you doing?

44
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,447
Oh, no!

45
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:54,547
This way.

46
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,047
It's an emergency!

47
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:02,947
Something must've happened to Ran!

48
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,447
"Tiger Tradings"

49
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:12,647
Ran.

50
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,947
Darn it. Where did they go?

51
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,447
Ran!

52
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,947
Mr. Mouri.

53
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,647
Don't worry.

54
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,047
Who are you?

55
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:49,047
Have you seen a young blond man?

56
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:50,247
What?

57
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:54,447
He came running this way with a young woman.

58
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:58,547
Who are you?

59
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,047
The police?

60
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:04,647
-Yeah. -Those two were police officers?

61
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,647
I've known them since high school.

62
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:09,047
"Ginji Nakamaru (38)" -They're from Kokura Station.

63
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,447
"Shuhei Shigaki (42)" -They've been chasing me around

64
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:13,947
because they think I wrote that graffiti.

65
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,647
What am I going to do?

66
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,647
I attacked some police officers.

67
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,947
You were trying to save me.

68
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:22,447
You did nothing wrong.

69
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,147
It's my fault.

70
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:28,247
Did you write the graffiti, Torahiko?

71
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,647
It wasn't me.

72
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:31,647
Then you shouldn't run.

73
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,947
You need to talk to the police.

74
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,547
If I go to the police now,

75
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:43,647
they'll treat me like a criminal.

76
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:47,147
Some of them think I hurt my dad.

77
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,147
What?

78
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,747
Someone pushed my dad from behind.

79
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:53,647
I can't let them arrest me

80
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,447
until I find evidence of the culprit.

81
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:56,947
What evidence?

82
00:05:56,947 --> 00:06:00,747
Apparently my dad said "tora" (tiger) in the ambulance.

83
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:04,647
There's a stuffed doll called Toraccha in my dad's car.

84
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:10,647
There used to be a GPS and security camera inside of it.

85
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:15,147
It's possible the culprit's voice or image or something else

86
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:17,947
that could serve as evidence were captured by it.

87
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,847
Don't answer it.

88
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:24,947
It's okay. It's Conan.

89
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,647
Ran, you're with Mr. Torahiko, aren't you?

90
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:31,347
How did you know?

91
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:34,947
Pops is desperately looking for you.

92
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:37,947
Ran, where are you?

93
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,347
Ran, where are you?

94
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:43,747
Ran!

95
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,947
What should I do, Conan?

96
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,247
"Tiger Tradings" -It's okay.

97
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:50,447
He'll solve everything.

98
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:53,847
Convince Mr. Torahiko not to run.

99
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,447
Torahiko.

100
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,947
If you're innocent,

101
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:03,747
my father will protect you.

102
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:08,147
Let's go back to the others.

103
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:11,547
My dad's a pretty good detective.

104
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:14,747
I know.

105
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:15,847
What?

106
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:21,747
My dad bragged that

107
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,647
one of his juniors from his MPD days

108
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,047
is a famous detective named Kogoro Mouri.

109
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,247
I see.

110
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:32,047
Yeah.

111
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:35,247
Are you listening, Ran?

112
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,347
It's okay, Conan.

113
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:40,747
Torahiko and I will head your way now.

114
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:41,847
That's good.

115
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:46,347
I also have a request for Mr. Torahiko.

116
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:47,647
A request?

117
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:50,147
What?

118
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:53,347
Ran and Torahiko are heading towards the office?

119
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,347
Yeah.

120
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:58,147
They want you to reveal the truth there.

121
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:00,047
Who? Me?

122
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,147
It's time for the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri

123
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,747
to show off his skills.

124
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:06,347
Insolent brat!

125
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:07,447
Fine.

126
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,647
As long as Ran comes back safe,

127
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:11,747
I'll handle the rest.

128
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:13,547
We'll help.

129
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:15,847
It's an honor to work alongside

130
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,347
the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

131
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:22,047
Please gather everyone connected to the case.

132
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:24,747
"Noriko Izumi (28)" -Director Kiriyama is at the hospital.

133
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:27,147
I doubt he'll be able to return right away.

134
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:28,247
The hospital?

135
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:31,047
Yes, he's visiting the president.

136
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:33,647
That's odd.

137
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,947
He told me not to visit Fukamachi.

138
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,847
That's it! I've figured it out!

139
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:48,747
"President's Office"

140
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:54,047
I've been waiting for you,

141
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:56,747
"Eisaku Kiriyama (45)" -Director Kiriyama.

142
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:04,447
Mr. Mouri, is it true that you've determined who's responsible

143
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:05,747
for the graffiti?

144
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:09,847
Yes. That's why I asked all of you to come here.

145
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:13,247
But the shareholders' meeting starts at 3 pm,

146
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:14,947
so we don't have much time.

147
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:16,747
Could we hurry, please?

148
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,847
Despite being short on time,

149
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,347
you visited President Fukamachi

150
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:23,647
in the hospital, didn't you?

151
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,647
Yes.

152
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,147
He's still unconscious,

153
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:31,547
but I thought I'd tell him about the shareholders' meeting.

154
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:35,747
Was there some reason you didn't want me to visit him?

155
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,747
Mr. Mouri, what are you trying to say?

156
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:41,147
You're the one who pushed President Fukamachi,

157
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,447
aren't you?

158
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:43,647
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,647
Wrong guy, Pops.

160
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:47,847
Once the president regains consciousness,

161
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,847
we'll know you did it.

162
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,147
That is why you went to the hospital.

163
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:55,747
Is that it?

164
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:02,947
Is that...

165
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:04,447
The Sleeping Kogoro!

166
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:09,247
Director Kiriyama, please don't be upset.

167
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:13,647
Your visit to the hospital has nothing to do with the case.

168
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,347
Then who did it?

169
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:18,147
If you know, tell us!

170
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:21,347
The first thing we should make clear

171
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:25,047
is that Torahiko didn't write the graffiti.

172
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:26,147
What?

173
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:27,647
"Makoto Ukaji (42), President's Driver" -That's ridiculous!

174
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,047
Mr. Iwata saw him do it.

175
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:34,547
Mr. Iwata, you said the culprit was blond, correct?

176
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,647
"Genichiro Iwata (63), Tiger Tradings Security Guard" -Yes.

177
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:39,047
But three days ago in the morning, when the buildings were vandalized,

178
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:42,647
Torahiko wasn't blond yet.

179
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:43,947
What?

180
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:44,947
Conan!

181
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,847
Here!

182
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:50,447
Mr. Torahiko was looking for work in Tokyo,

183
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:54,047
so he'd been keeping his hair black for some time.

184
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,247
See?

185
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:59,247
Mr. Torahiko just sent me this photo.

186
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:00,947
And that's not all.

187
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:03,247
The night Mr. Iwata saw the culprit,

188
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,847
this photo was taken at Airs Cafe.

189
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:06,947
See?

190
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:09,147
Mr. Torahiko said he dyed his hair blond

191
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:12,447
the day after the graffiti was discovered.

192
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:15,147
Why don't you check with the salon?

193
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:17,847
But why did he dyed his hair blond again?

194
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:21,147
Mr. Torahiko wanted to pump himself up.

195
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,247
He was determined not to let the police beat him

196
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,947
until he discovered the truth.

197
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:32,447
I may have been mistaken about the blond hair.

198
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,947
Mr. Iwata, after we met at the parking lot today,

199
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:37,447
you came here, didn't you?

200
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,547
What? In the president's office?

201
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:44,847
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

202
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:48,047
I found this in the garbage can.

203
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,347
It looks like a bank envelope.

204
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:52,147
There's donut crumbs on it,

205
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:54,947
so maybe Mr. Ukaji threw it away.

206
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,247
Hey! Don't go making wild accusations!

207
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,747
I'm scared!

208
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:01,947
Officers,

209
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:05,347
could you have your forensics team examine that envelope?

210
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:09,347
I'm sure you'll find Mr. Iwata and Mr. Ukaji's fingerprints on it.

211
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:10,847
Understood.

212
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:20,947
How much was inside the envelope, Mr. Ukaji?

213
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:25,647
I'm asking how much Mr. Iwata paid you.

214
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:29,947
Are you saying I blackmailed Mr. Iwata?

215
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,347
That's right!

216
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:32,947
That's ridiculous!

217
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:36,947
Mr. Ukaji, you don't know the truth.

218
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,647
The truth?

219
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:40,647
The culprit's goal.

220
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,947
Wasn't it to threaten Director Kiriyama?

221
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:48,247
No. The culprit's goal was to murder you.

222
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:49,347
What?

223
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,545
They were trying to kill me?

224
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:05,845
Isn't that right, Mr. Iwata?

225
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:10,445
You wanted to kill Mr. Ukaji.

226
00:13:10,445 --> 00:13:12,845
But if you went after him directly,

227
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:15,045
the police would investigate his associates

228
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,245
and discover he was threatening you

229
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,345
and realize you did it.

230
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,845
That's why you used that graffiti

231
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:29,045
to make everyone believe Director Kiriyama was the target.

232
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,145
"Tiger"

233
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,645
If Director Kiriyama was killed

234
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:37,445
and Mr. Ukaji got caught in the crossfire,

235
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:38,845
then suspicion would fall on Torahiko,

236
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:41,145
who was assumed to have vandalized the buildings.

237
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,745
You wouldn't be suspected.

238
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:45,945
On what basis do you say that?

239
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:48,145
Conan, bring it to me.

240
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:49,345
Okay!

241
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:55,345
Mr. Iwata, you left this inside the president's car, didn't you?

242
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,745
No. I don't know what you're talking about!

243
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,945
I thought it was strange.

244
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:03,545
The Toraccha in the photo I took

245
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:08,745
was dirty and old like the one Mr. Fukamachi was holding.

246
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:11,645
But this Toraccha is brand new.

247
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:14,445
Since you left it outside while washing the car,

248
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:16,145
it's a little damp too.

249
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,845
You're lying!

250
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:22,245
Maybe you hid the old Toraccha in your toolbox.

251
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,145
See? I knew it.

252
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:30,145
Huh?

253
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:31,645
Did you use this toolbox to store

254
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:35,345
the red spray paint you used for the graffiti too?

255
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:40,045
Let go! There's no time!

256
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,545
There's no time?

257
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,645
It's a bomb!

258
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,245
It'll explode in 10 minutes!

259
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,245
-What? -A bomb?

260
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:50,845
In 10 minutes?

261
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:55,145
It's okay. I just bought this Toraccha.

262
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,045
It's not your bomb.

263
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:00,745
What?

264
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:04,645
If it's set to explode in 10 minutes,

265
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:08,445
then that means you set it for 2:30 pm, right?

266
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:10,245
2:30 pm?

267
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:15,245
Mr. Ukaji would be driving the president's car then.

268
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:18,745
He'd be taking Director Kiriyama to the shareholders' meeting.

269
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:23,045
You were planning to blow up me and the director?

270
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:27,145
Then the real bomb's still inside the president's car?

271
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:28,845
Don't worry about that.

272
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,445
Mr. Mouri called the prefectural police earlier.

273
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:35,445
The bomb squad is already there.

274
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,045
He called to tell us about the bomb

275
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:40,945
inside the stuffed tiger in the president's car.

276
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:43,045
How did you know?

277
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:45,345
In high school,

278
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,445
Torahiko stole gunpowder from your fireworks factory

279
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:51,045
to build a bomb.

280
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,945
In order to frame Torahiko

281
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:58,345
for the murder of Mr. Ukaji and Director Kiriyama,

282
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:01,945
you believed setting a bomb inside the Toraccha was the best method.

283
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:06,145
You even had the skills to build a bomb.

284
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:15,445
Mr. Iwata, what happened in the parking lot that day?

285
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:19,245
Torazo and I were childhood friends,

286
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,845
but he tried to fire me anyway.

287
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,645
Torazo, let me keep working a little longer.

288
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,245
Gen.

289
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:37,745
I'm sorry but I've already decided to hire a security company.

290
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:40,045
You should learn to do desk work.

291
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:43,645
No! I like how easy things are now!

292
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:45,745
Don't be so selfish.

293
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:55,845
Torazo.

294
00:16:57,245 --> 00:17:00,145
I got scared and ran,

295
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,345
but later...

296
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:08,445
Last month the president told me to install a dash cam.

297
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,445
It's all on there.

298
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:14,545
You pushing the president.

299
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:21,845
Get me 500 thousand by the end of the week, got it?

300
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:28,945
Maybe the president was trying to say "dorareko" in the ambulance.

301
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:30,045
"Dorareko" (Dash cam)?

302
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:31,245
"Dorareko" (Dash cam).

303
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:32,445
In other words,

304
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:35,645
he wanted us to check the dash cam footage.

305
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:40,145
I only took 500 thousand yen!

306
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:42,845
Why would you kill me over that?

307
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,745
You were going to blackmail me for the rest of my life!

308
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:47,745
It would've been more than 500 thousand yen!

309
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:49,145
What?

310
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,845
Shut up, both of you!

311
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:52,945
Do you have any idea how sad the president would be

312
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:55,845
if he found of what you did?

313
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:05,245
Torahiko and Ran are late.

314
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:06,245
It's an emergency!

315
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:09,545
The car! The car that have a bomb inside is missing!

316
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:11,945
No way!

317
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:18,445
Where are we going, Torahiko?

318
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:21,145
You promised we'd rejoin the others.

319
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:24,445
I need to deliver Toraccha to the TV station first.

320
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:25,945
The TV station?

321
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:28,145
I'm going to have them make a broadcast.

322
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:30,645
We still don't know who the culprit is.

323
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:32,045
If we don't leave the evidence with them,

324
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,345
the culprit might try to hide it.

325
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:41,245
Torahiko, stop the car!

326
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,945
I can't believe he stole the car with the bomb.

327
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:48,545
Conan.

328
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,145
Ran, listen closely.

329
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,645
That Toraccha...

330
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:00,445
Ran, what happened?

331
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:03,645
Conan!

332
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:06,545
There's a bomb inside that Toraccha!

333
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,345
Huh? What?

334
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,045
It's going to explode in three minutes!

335
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:20,745
What's happening in three minutes?

336
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:22,345
Say it again.

337
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:24,445
It's a bomb! A bomb!

338
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,445
-A bomb? -What?

339
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,845
There's a bomb inside that Toraccha!

340
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:30,045
Throw it away quick!

341
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,145
What?

342
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:43,545
Stop the car!

343
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:47,545
Twenty seconds left.

344
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:48,945
Ran!

Ten seconds left.

347
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,145
Go!

348
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:09,045
That former firework maker.

349
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:12,345
He even made a flamboyant bomb.

"Best Detective Award Ceremony"

352
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:46,545
What a cozy party.

353
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:48,045
I'm overjoyed.

354
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:52,745
This event's being hosted by the historic Japanese Detective League.

355
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:57,145
I've never heard of the Japanese Detective League.

356
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:03,145
We've been waiting for you, Mr. Mouri.

357
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:05,245
Ms. Izumi.

358
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:14,245
Congratulations on your Best Detective Award.

359
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:16,545
Ms. Izumi, why are you here?

360
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:25,445
Fukamachi.

361
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:31,245
Kogoro Mouri, congratulations on your Best Detective Award.

362
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:32,345
Fukamachi.

363
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:34,145
It's been so long.

364
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,945
I'm glad you're doing well.

365
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:39,245
You too.

366
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:43,645
He actually regained consciousness a few days ago,

367
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:46,845
but he'd lost his memories of the accident.

368
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:50,845
We decided to hire you to uncover the truth.

369
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:54,645
The Director even kept it secret from me.

370
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:56,745
I see.

371
00:22:56,745 --> 00:23:01,045
The president will be our president a while longer.

372
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:04,745
At least until Torahiko becomes a proper adult.

373
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:06,745
Good luck, Torahiko.

374
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:07,945
Thanks.

375
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:09,945
The Japanese Detective League

376
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:14,345
was created by President Fukamachi to support you, Mouri.

377
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:16,745
What? You did?

378
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:19,245
Keep up the good work.

379
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:21,545
Thank you, sir!

380
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:24,845
I'm sure the life of the man known as the Tiger of Sakuradamon

381
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:27,645
will make a magnificent drama.

382
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:31,145
Since you're a tiger, it'll surely be a roaring success.

383
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:32,545
Just kidding.

384
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:37,645
Dad.

You must be joking.

389
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:50,445
Excuse me.

390
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:53,945
I'm a huge horse racing fan.

391
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:56,645
I'd actually like to hire you.

392
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,445
Huh?
