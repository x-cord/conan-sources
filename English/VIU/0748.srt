1
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,458
Officer Sato?

2
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:13,458
What important thing did you want to talk to me about?

3
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:14,958
Never mind, just get in!

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:16,958
Okay.

5
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:23,258
Wait a second.

6
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:25,958
This feels familiar.

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:29,658
Back then, when I opened the door of the car.

8
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,058
You fell for it, you fell for it.

9
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:42,358
Back then, Officer Sato was really catching her thrills.

10
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:48,358
So maybe I'll make like I really fell for her trick today too.

11
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,858
Please cut out jokes like this!

12
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:56,458
What?

13
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,158
Just what're you doing?

14
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:00,558
Oh, no, well...

15
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,158
I just thought that you were going to play a prank on me again.

16
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:06,458
I told you I have something important to talk to you about, didn't I?

17
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,758
You said so some time ago and I fell for it back then, didn't I?

18
00:01:13,058 --> 00:01:14,258
Hey.

19
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:15,258
Yes?

20
00:01:17,158 --> 00:01:18,658
Can't you tell?

21
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:22,358
Tell, what?

22
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:25,558
All I can see is that you're as beautiful as always.

23
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:29,558
Just what're you talking about? Oh boy.

24
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,758
So, what is it you want anyway?

25
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,858
I don't have it...

26
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:38,158
You know, that.

27
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:42,158
That? You don't have it?

28
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:46,758
You don't have it? Don't tell me...

29
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:47,758
Oh boy.

30
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:50,358
Don't tell anybody because it's embarrassing.

31
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:53,058
No, I won't! Of course not!

32
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,558
But, what shall I do?

33
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:57,158
This is a grave case of responsibility, isn't it?

34
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:02,858
I'll take full responsibility!

35
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:04,658
Officer Takagi.

36
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,158
Wait a second.

37
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:08,258
If between two police officers,

38
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,958
moreover, between officers working in the same department

39
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,558
become married taking into consideration,

40
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:15,858
that married couples working together may encounter various problems,

41
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:18,658
either one of the partners would have to transfer.

42
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:22,258
Officer Sato is popular here, so if she's transferred...

43
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:27,758
God knows what the senior officers would do to me.

44
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,458
If so, it'd be better if I transfer elsewhere.

45
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,558
No, rather, I should just quit

46
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:36,758
and become a house-husband.

47
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:37,958
Yes, sir! I understand!

48
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,758
We'll be right over!

49
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:44,458
There was an eye-witness report of the suspect at Beikacho!

50
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,458
We're heading for the site right now!

51
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,258
Okay!

52
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:58,058
Miwako's having a baby?

53
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:00,058
She's pregnant, right?

54
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:04,258
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

55
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:05,858
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

56
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:07,858
Sato finally confesses to Takagi?

57
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,958
A perfect alibi, the mystery of the language of flowers.

58
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,458
He sees through the one and only truth.

59
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,258
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

60
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:15,458
His name is Detective Conan!

61
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:01,469
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Confession)"

62
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:13,069
Hey, hey, all three of you yawning.

63
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,969
I mean you're taking after Ai.

64
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:17,969
Well, sorry that I yawn so much.

65
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,269
But...

66
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:22,769
The Titan Fighter that came out the other day was really interesting!

67
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,169
We overplayed it, you see.

68
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,269
I mean you guys want to waste your summer vacation

69
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:28,869
playing games all the while or what?

70
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,369
Right! I had Daddy help me and I'm on rank five now!

71
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,869
No joke?

72
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,469
I was eaten by the blue giant so many times.

73
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,269
What kind of game is it?

74
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,669
Something about it being a role playing game

75
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:45,069
in which you protect you castle

76
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,569
from the giants who come to attack it.

77
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:50,769
Come to think of it,

78
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:53,469
the hint book's coming out today, isn't it?

79
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:54,569
Right! Right!

80
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,869
Hey, maybe they have it at the convenience store over there?

81
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:59,069
Let's go!

82
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,769
Hey, you guys!

83
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:03,969
Weren't we going to play soccer in the park?

84
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,269
It can't be helped.

85
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:14,069
I wonder if there was an accident there or something?

86
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,569
If so, those flowers...

87
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:19,669
If I remember correctly, those flowers are called False Dragonheads.

88
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:20,869
The flower language is...

89
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:23,169
Hey, Conan.

90
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:24,569
Just what're you doing?

91
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,069
I'm leaving you behind.

92
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,769
Okay.

93
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:33,069
"Flower Shop, Nostalgia"

94
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:35,469
Well, it sure was a surprise

95
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,269
to think that there's somebody who looks so much alike.

96
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,169
Yes, it sure was.

97
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:43,469
It's a bit late,

98
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,569
but would you like to have lunch somewhere nearby?

99
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,369
Okay.

100
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,869
Then, would you like something sour?

101
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,769
Why?

102
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:55,069
"24 Hour Mart" -Wow! Fantastic.

103
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,869
It says Haoken!

104
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:58,569
How awesome.

105
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,769
It says here that it an attacking power of over 10,000,

106
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:05,369
and it's the one and only sacred sword that the giant tribe fears!

107
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,969
But, the picture's black and white so it's hard to tell.

108
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,869
It says you can't get a hold of it

109
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:14,969
unless you defeat the super huge red giant.

110
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,369
It's going to take quite a while yet.

111
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,369
I've got that sword.

112
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,069
The handle is shiny gold

113
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,469
"Noriya Makabe (7)" -and the pattern on the blade is red!

114
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:25,869
"First Grader" -Even after getting hold of the sword

115
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:30,669
you've got to reinforce it with many reinforcement items, though!

116
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:34,369
Wow. Which means you're already rank eight?

117
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:37,669
-Yes! -You belong to the class next to ours, right?

118
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:40,769
I hope you're not lying.

119
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,669
I'm not lying!

120
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:44,569
Right, Toshinari!

121
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,369
Yeah!

122
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,369
Noriya really hung in there, you see!

123
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,869
He's the man I saw a while ago.

124
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:55,369
If you really got hold of the Haoken, I'd like to see it!

125
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:57,469
-Me too! -Same here.

126
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,869
Would you all like to come to Toshinari's home with me, then?

127
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:04,269
It's okay, isn't it, Toshinari?

128
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,269
"Toshinari Shiga (25)" -Then, go on ahead to the car.

129
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,169
"Graduate student" -I'll finish paying for the stuff.

130
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,769
It'll be 1350 yen.

131
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,569
I'll pay by credit card.

132
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,969
Yes, sir. How many payments?

133
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:18,969
One.

134
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:20,469
All right, sir.

135
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:23,269
A key for a foreign car and a platinum card.

136
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,269
I wonder if he comes from some rich family.

137
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,069
What a shabby apartment.

138
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:35,569
Hey, Genta!

139
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:37,869
It may look shabby

140
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:39,669
but it's home sweet home once you live in it!

141
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,669
I'll go park the car, so you guys go on inside!

142
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,669
Okay!

143
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,469
"Room 3, Shiga"

144
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:52,569
It's really Haoken!

145
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:55,169
The handle is really shiny!

146
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,069
-That's really awesome. - So cool.

147
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:00,569
Gosh.

148
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:02,369
The trash bag is full of candies,

149
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:05,969
containers of cup noodles, and packed foods.

150
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,869
Talk about unhealthy diet.

151
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,469
Hey, Ai.

152
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,169
What?

153
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,969
Didn't something smell?

154
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:16,469
Not really.

155
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:19,369
There seems to be no kitchen garbage, though.

156
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:22,369
No, I mean in the corridor before we entered this room.

157
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,769
Beats me.

158
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,169
I didn't notice anything, why?

159
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,169
I see.

160
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:39,469
Hey, what're you searching other people's houses for?

161
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:42,169
Noriya.

162
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:45,269
Did your big brother Toshinari just move here?

163
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,569
Nope. It was about a month ago.

164
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:49,669
Before summer vacation

165
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:52,369
he was living in the same condo I was living in.

166
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:58,269
Besides, Toshinari's not my big brother, he's my cousin.

167
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,169
He's my mother's older sister's son.

168
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:05,169
Daddy's on something called an overseas business trip

169
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:08,369
and Mommy went along with him to stay for a week to help him,

170
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:11,869
so I'm staying over at Toshinari's place during that time.

171
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:13,769
You're staying here a week?

172
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:14,869
Yes.

173
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:18,269
Besides Mommy told me to stay here.

174
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,169
Toshinari's older sister died 6 months ago

175
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,769
and he's depressed after the incident.

176
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,669
That's why Mommy sent me to help cheer him up.

177
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,769
Then, he went to offer those flowers a while ago

178
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:35,269
to the site where his older sister had the accident?

179
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,269
That's right! He showed me a picture of his older sister some time ago!

180
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,769
She used to be a very kind person

181
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,169
who used to take me camping a lot.

182
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:49,769
I wonder if there were so many pictures of her?

183
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,869
Let me see it.

184
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:52,869
Okay.

185
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:01,369
Strange, these pictures toward the end...

186
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,669
All of these pictures...

187
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,569
She's not looking this way.

188
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:07,569
Besides, what's this?

189
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:10,469
There's a small hole at the upper part of the pictures.

190
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,969
It's Toshinari's voice?

191
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,169
The corridor?

192
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:20,269
Don't tell me...

193
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:24,269
Room number 4 next door!

194
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,069
It's the thing I smelled a while ago.

195
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,069
Conan.

196
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,669
What on earth?

197
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,469
You guys stay here!

198
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:39,869
Ai! Call the police!

199
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:42,169
And tell them someone's dead!

200
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,769
-What? -Okay.

201
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:52,969
What's that?

202
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:00,269
This picture that is on the board...

203
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:01,569
The place where the board is discoloured

204
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:04,269
and where the picture's placed is slightly shifted.

205
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:07,869
That's not only for 1 or 2 pictures.

206
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,269
Why?

207
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:13,369
All of these pictures...

208
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,469
She's not looking this way.

209
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:20,169
There's a small hole at the upper part of the pictures.

210
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:25,069
Don't tell me...

211
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:28,769
That the perp who did this...

212
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,469
It can't be.

213
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,335
But...

214
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:42,235
to think that those two were that far into each other.

215
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:44,835
They're headed directly for goal now, aren't they?

216
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:46,235
But...

217
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,635
It doesn't look all that great for Officer Takagi.

218
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,035
What do you mean?

219
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,335
Think what'll happen to him

220
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:53,935
if the police detectives find out about this.

221
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:56,235
True.

222
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,935
Officer Sato's got a large group of fans so...

223
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:00,735
This is bad, no joke.

224
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:02,235
True.

225
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:05,235
No joke, this is bad.

226
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,335
Yumi?

227
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:14,335
What you're saying and your facial expression aren't jiving.

228
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:21,435
The victim is Mr. Hiroto Yasutomi, age 31,

229
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,935
a free lancer.

230
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,335
According to the ME,

231
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:26,635
the estimated time of death

232
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:29,335
is between 07:00 pm and 09:00 pm last night.

233
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:33,335
He's been stabbed multiple times in the chest and stomach.

234
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:36,835
And? The one who first found the corpse

235
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:41,535
was you who lives next door, Mr. Toshinari Shiga, correct?

236
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:42,835
Yes.

237
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:45,435
I parked the car in the parking lot

238
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:47,735
and was on my way to my room

239
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:50,235
I smelled a foul odor from this room.

240
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,935
The door wasn't locked so I opened it,

241
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,535
and this is what I found.

242
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:57,635
I was shocked, then found this boy, a friend of my cousin Noriya

243
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:00,435
had helped himself inside.

244
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:01,935
It's you, Conan!

245
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:06,135
Then, the girl who reported this to the police is...

246
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:07,535
Me.

247
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:10,835
We all came over to play at Noriya's cousin,

248
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:13,235
Toshinari's home today.

249
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,835
But, you're just as much a caller of Death yourself

250
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,235
as Mr. Mouri, aren't you?

251
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:20,035
You show up at murder sites one after the other.

252
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:24,535
But, you sure got here quickly too, didn't you, Officer Sato?

253
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,435
We got a call saying that the salesclerk

254
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:31,735
at a florist near here resembled a suspect at large.

255
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:34,335
It turned out to be a mistake though.

256
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:36,935
We were coincidentally in this neighborhood

257
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:40,135
so we were dispatched here!

258
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,135
Well, if Officer Takagi didn't dilly-dally

259
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:45,135
whispering to the salesclerk back then,

260
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,735
we would've been able to leave much earlier, you see.

261
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:50,735
We were nearby because we were having lunch, right?

262
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:52,535
Were you talking about flowers?

263
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:54,135
Are you going to give flowers to anyone?

264
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:55,635
But, if you're giving them to Officer Sato

265
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,635
you don't have to be secretive about it, do you?

266
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:58,735
Flirting?

267
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:02,535
-You think so too? -No way!

268
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,535
Hey, by the way...

269
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:07,935
If the victim died between 07:00 pm and 09:00 pm last night,

270
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:11,035
why don't you ask Noriya or Toshinari about it?

271
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,735
If they were in the room next door,

272
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:15,935
they may have heard some suspicious noises or something.

273
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:17,835
If at that time last night,

274
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,435
I was watching TV with Toshinari!

275
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:23,135
A Masked Yaiba movie was playing, you see.

276
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,535
Oh, I was watching it too!

277
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:28,835
Me too! It was really interesting!

278
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,135
It was from 07:00 pm to 09:00 pm

279
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:33,235
and it was the first TV premier!

280
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:35,635
And, while you were watching it,

281
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,435
didn't you hear any strange sounds or groans?

282
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:42,535
No! Part way, the man next door pounded on the door yelling,

283
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:45,035
to cut the noise down though...

284
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:47,135
About what time was that?

285
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:50,435
I think it was about 07:30.

286
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:53,135
I apologized from behind the door

287
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:54,935
and turned the volume down.

288
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:59,835
Which means that Mr. Yasutomi was alive till then.

289
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,035
Did you hear any strange sounds after that?

290
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,135
Not that I'm aware of.

291
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:05,835
Since Masked Yaiba is an action hero movie,

292
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:09,535
people screaming and explosions were frequent,

293
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,435
so even if there were any suspicious noises,

294
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,235
I may not have noticed.

295
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:16,035
Besides, the place where the corpse

296
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:18,535
of the next door neighbor was found was in the kitchen by the sink,

297
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:22,535
two rooms away from where we were watching TV.

298
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:23,635
Now that you mentioned it,

299
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:24,735
I saw the next door neighbor

300
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,435
at a convenience store around sundown yesterday.

301
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,535
Around what time was that?

302
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:30,835
I'm not sure.

303
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:34,335
It was when I went to buy packed food for dinner.

304
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:36,735
I was bothered by the expiration date on the packed food

305
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:40,135
and remembers asking Noriya what the date on it was.

306
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:41,835
You asked the child the date?

307
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,335
Yes! I was holding the shopping basket.

308
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:48,635
The newspaper that we bought at the convenience store was inside it,

309
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:52,735
so I told Toshinari that the date was August 13th!

310
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,635
That it was the day that Yaiba's movi e was going to be playing on TV!

311
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:58,635
If it was the 13th, it's unmistakably yesterday.

312
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:02,635
Was Mr. Yasutomi with someone back then?

313
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:06,035
No, I think he was alone.

314
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:07,835
Hey, Noriya.

315
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,935
While you were watching the Yaiba movie,

316
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:12,835
did Toshinari go to use the restroom or something?

317
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:17,635
No, because I was watching leaning against Toshinari right through.

318
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,935
What did you do after you finished watching?

319
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:22,535
The movie ended before 09:00 pm, didn't it?

320
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:25,535
Yes! I went to take a pee right afterwards

321
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,535
and resumed playing the game.

322
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:31,035
Which means you were playing the game before that too?

323
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:33,735
Yes! After coming back from the convenience store

324
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,935
till the time when the movie began.

325
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:39,235
Then, Toshinari looked at his wristwatch and said,

326
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:41,235
"Oh no!" It's already 07:00!

327
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:44,635
Let's save it because the movie's going to start."

328
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,235
So, we saved the game right away

329
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:48,035
and switched to watching TV.

330
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:51,435
We made it just as the movie was about to start!

331
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:53,335
Then, after you finished watching the movie

332
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:55,635
and while you were in the restroom,

333
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:58,235
didn't Toshinari leave the room?

334
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:00,035
No, besides, he asked me what snack I'd like to eat

335
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:02,935
from outside the restroom too.

336
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,735
Then, after that you both continued playing

337
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,035
the game together right through?

338
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:09,235
Right! We played until quite late,

339
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:12,235
woke up early in the morning played again,

340
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:15,935
then went to the convenience store to buy breakfast

341
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,435
and played until around noon but,

342
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:22,735
I got sleepy so I took a nap

343
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,735
and resumed playing the game again

344
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,035
after I got up. Then, we got hungry

345
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:28,635
so we went to the convenience store again.

346
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:30,935
And, that's where we met you!

347
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,135
Nothing but playing games.

348
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,535
That's why you ranked so high!

349
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:37,035
How lucky!

350
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:40,835
And? What did you have for lunch?

351
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:43,835
I was eating snacks so I wasn't hungry at all!

352
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:46,435
Eating snacks and playing the game right through.

353
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:47,635
How lucky!

354
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:49,235
It's heaven!

355
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:50,835
Make sure you don't copy him.

356
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:56,235
Which means you were with Toshinari right through today again?

357
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:58,835
After eating breakfast,

358
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:00,135
he told me that he had something to do and left,

359
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:03,035
after telling me to stay put and keep playing.

360
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:05,035
He also told me to play using the headset

361
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:07,135
so that the man next door wouldn't come

362
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,935
to complain of it being noisy again.

363
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:11,235
Around what time was that?

364
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,835
It was about...

365
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:17,135
We went to the store to buy breakfast around 06:00 am,

366
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,535
came home and ate it right away,

367
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,835
so I think it was about 07:00 am.

368
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,435
The clock behind the salesclerk of the convenience store indicated

369
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:26,835
a little after 06:00 am, you see.

370
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,835
What?

371
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,435
Don't tell me that you suspect him?

372
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:38,235
may I be excused to go back to my room already?

373
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:42,235
I don't want to keep the children near the corpse any longer.

374
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:43,935
I guess so.

375
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:47,235
Just in case, I'd like to check the contents

376
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:49,735
inside your trash bag, okay?

377
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:52,235
Yes, go right ahead.

378
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:54,435
That rear view.

379
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:57,835
Weren't you at the florist a while ago?

380
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:01,135
Yes, I did buy flowers.

381
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:02,535
Just as I thought.

382
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,235
When I asked the salesclerk there,

383
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:08,935
what flower I should send when a wish was fulfilled,

384
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:11,235
she suggested that I buy a fake dragonhead

385
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:14,735
like the one the customer just before had purchased.

386
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:18,735
I happened to see you leaving the shop!

387
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:21,935
Then, something good happened to you, right, Officer Takagi?

388
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:23,935
You won another ice cream or something?

389
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,735
Come on, tell us.

390
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:27,435
Oh, no.

391
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,835
Please help me out.

392
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:30,835
Why?

393
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:33,435
I said I'd take full responsibility, didn't I?

394
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:35,835
Oh that?

395
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:40,235
Well, you are partly responsible too.

396
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:43,835
So, it's only natural that you do.

397
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:46,335
Yeah. Sort of.

398
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:49,335
You bought those flowers too, didn't you?

399
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,435
Yeah.

400
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:52,435
If so...

401
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:56,935
Did one of your wishes come true or something?

402
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:59,035
Yeah.

403
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:06,535
Then, shall we go to your room, Mr. Shiga?

404
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:07,735
Okay.

405
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:13,935
Officer Takagi?

406
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:15,535
What is it, Conan?

407
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:18,035
I've got something I want you to check for me.

408
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:21,635
I was wondering if there was an accident or something

409
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:23,535
because Toshinari was offering flowers

410
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:26,235
on the road in front of the florist.

411
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:27,635
Is that so?

412
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:30,535
Come on, stop dilly-dallying, Officer Takagi.

413
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:32,335
Okay.

414
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:33,435
Hurry up.

415
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,635
You're being impulsive, Officer Sato.

416
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:36,935
Go easy on me, please.

417
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:44,235
He's probably the one who killed Mr. Yasutomi,

418
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:47,935
Mr. Toshinari Shiga, no doubt about it.

419
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:52,035
Besides, he's motive for killing is probably...

420
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:55,535
But, the problem is his alibi

421
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:59,135
August 13th, between 07:00 pm to 09:00 pm,

422
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:01,335
the time when the crime was committed.

423
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:06,335
The alibi that he was by Noriya right through.

424
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:08,035
Darn.

425
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:12,335
How on earth did he kill Mr. Yasutomi?

426
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,835
And?

427
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:21,235
Officer Takagi. Did something good happen?

428
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:22,335
Yes?

429
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:48,535
What is it? This sinister atmosphere?

430
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:52,235
The fact is...

431
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:56,335
Motherly instinct is growing in Officer Sato?

432
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,535
The Yaiba movie you saw last night...

433
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:01,235
Yeah, that's right!

434
00:24:01,235 --> 00:24:05,035
I watched it and holding back wanting to go pee!

435
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:07,235
Just as I thought...

436
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:08,535
Next Conan,

437
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:12,435
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Truth)"
