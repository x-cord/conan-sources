Ms. Kobayashi!

3
00:00:07,422 --> 00:00:11,022
You talked things over with everybody after the hearing, right?

4
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:13,622
Yes, all of the lay judges

5
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:15,122
get together and discuss the case.

6
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:19,122
How is it? Is the defendant guilty after all?

7
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:22,122
Which decision was greater, guilty or not guilty?

8
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,622
Of course I can't tell you that!

9
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:28,322
Who cares? We'll keep it a secret.

10
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:30,522
I said no, and I mean no!

11
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:32,022
Hey, Ms. Kobayashi!

12
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:33,822
-Wait! -Tell us!

13
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:36,122
What about the picture that

14
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:38,522
Ms. Kobayashi asked a question about?

15
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:41,422
Just like she said, the picture was upside down.

16
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:43,922
And who could've done that?

17
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:45,122
If that's figured out,

18
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:48,022
I think we'll also be able to solve the case.

19
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:49,322
I guess so.

20
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:52,422
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

21
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:54,822
Tears are the start of all dramas.

22
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,722
The truth of the case that the flower vase leads to.

23
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:59,122
The courtroom is shaken by the surprising sentence that is passed.

24
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:00,822
He sees through the one and only truth.

No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:49,045
Ms. Kobayashi is chosen as a lay judge.

28
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,945
The one who's going to be working for the defendant is

29
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:55,345
Ran's mother, Attorney At Law Kisaki.

30
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:59,845
Confronting her is Madonna Prosecutor Kujo.

31
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,245
Although the defendant has a lot of evidence against him,

32
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,845
Attorney at Law Kisaki manages to get around,

33
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:08,945
and the hearing is a tie for the two women for now.

34
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:13,845
The upside down picture that Ms. Kobayashi was concerned about,

35
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,545
also concerned me.

36
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:19,845
The picture was verified at the scene of the crime,

37
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:23,645
and an IOU agreement signed by the defendant was found.

38
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:27,145
What an unexpected surprise evidence this was.

39
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:30,045
However, the housekeeper,

40
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:32,345
Hara at the victim's residence is also acting strange.

41
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,845
What on earth is the outcome of the hearing going to be?

42

44
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,445
"Toshio Iwamatsu (35)" -What? My IOU was in the back of the picture?

45
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,945
Why did you hide the fact

46
00:03:54,945 --> 00:03:56,845
that you borrowed money from Mr. Ishigaki?

47
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,445
Just because I borrowed money from that guy,

48
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,345
I was on the verge of losing my store

49
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:03,945
in exchange for paying off my debts.

50
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:06,045
But if I told you what I thought,

51
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,645
I'd be even more suspected.

52
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:10,945
That's why...

53
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:15,045
The prosecution is thinking of using the evidence

54
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:17,445
as your motive for killing the victim.

55
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:21,645
No, I just went to get the IOU back!

56
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:24,345
You really haven't touched the picture?

57
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:27,045
No, because this is the first time

58
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:29,145
I'm hearing that it was hidden behind the picture.

59
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,845
Please believe me!

60
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:33,445
It's not whether I believe you or not,

61
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:39,445
but rather, whether we can convince the lay judges or not.

62
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,445
At any rate, I'll try to find a way out

63
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:45,245
of this crisis by the next hearing.

64
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:51,145
That's right, didn't you see a flower vase in that room?

65
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:53,645
What? A flower vase?

66
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,245
Yeah.

67
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:08,545
I saw a flower vase!

68
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:11,245
So, it was there.

Ran, you're here.

00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:25,345
I came here together with Conan after school

75
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:27,745
because he says he wants to talk to you, mom.

76
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,245
You mean about the flower vase

77
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,645
you wanted me to ask the defendant about?

78
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,045
Yes, and what did he say?

79
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,045
Just as you said,

80
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,545
there seems to have been a flower vase in that room, Conan.

81
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,945
There is no mention of a flower vase

82
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:43,045
on the report of the scene made by the police.

83

It could be that someone walked off with it.

84
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,845
Does the vase have something to do with the case?

85
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,345
The only thing that disappeared

86
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:53,545
from the site was not only the murder weapon.

87
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:57,645
When the defendant saw the flower vase, where was it?

88
00:05:57,645 --> 00:05:59,445
Give me a minute.

89
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:05,545
It fell from this shelf and rolled to about here, it seems.

90
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,245
Near the door...

91
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,345
Yes, this is Kisaki Law Office.

92
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:15,645
What?

93
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:19,745
Yes, she's here.

94
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,145
Who is it?

95
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,945
It's from Prosecutor Kujo.

96
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:28,545
This is Kisaki.

97
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:31,645
What? The murder weapon's been found?

98
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:37,045
The pool cleaners found it at the bottom of the pool

99
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:39,445
located in a pool at 3-Mizushima-cho.

100
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,745
And as a result of forensic examination,

101
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:44,945
"Reiko Kujo (33)" -it was found to have been

102
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,845
used to commit the murder.

103
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:50,945
How nice of you to go out of your way to tell me about it.

104
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:54,645
But, isn't Mizushima-cho located some distance away

105
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:57,045
from the culprit's escape route?

106
00:06:57,045 --> 00:07:00,745
The time the crime was committed seems to

107
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,145
have been 15 minutes earlier than what we estimated.

108
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:06,045
Around that time, we got a new eye-witness report

109
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:07,645
a figure that looked to be Iwamatsu

110
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:10,545
was in the vicinity of the Ishigaki residence.

111
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:15,245
This may be the first time Ms. Kisaki

112
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:19,445
who's had a successions of victories will experience losing a case.

113
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,445
See you then.

114
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:23,245
You can look forward to tomorrow's hearing.

115
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:31,445
Have they found the murder weapon?

116
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:35,445
It seems that only evidence

117
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:37,245
working against the defendant comes up.

118
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:40,745
The IOU and all, are fatal evidence.

119
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:42,945
No use brooding.

120
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:44,645
Once we take on a client,

121
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:48,845
it's our job to do our best for the defendant.

122
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,345
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,145
Things are starting to get kind of tough.

124
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:57,445
I guess I'll go a bit out of my way for the sake of Ran's mom!

Yes.

129
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:12,445
We heard that the great detective Kogoro Mouri

130
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:14,545
is going to help capture the real culprit of the incident

131
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:17,645
that occurred here so we came to check the place out.

132
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:19,545
The culprit of that case has been arrested sometime ago

133
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:22,545
and is going through a hearing now.

134
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,845
He's not the real culprit.

135
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:29,045
What? Who said so?

136
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:32,545
Like we just said, the great detective Kogoro Mouri!

137
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,945
The culprit is another person

138
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:37,445
who broke into the house and killed the president

139
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:42,245
-to steal an expensive vase... -That can't be! That vase is...

140
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:46,645
Come on, I don't know if he's a great detective or what

141
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:47,845
but the trial is in progress right now.

142
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:50,645
The culprit's going through a hearing.

143
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:55,245
Are you sure she said, "That vase"?

144
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:56,645
No mistake about it!

145
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,845
Come on, it's about time you tell us.

146
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:01,345
Did that lady steal the vase?

147
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:03,745
Is it true that another person is the real culprit

148

who committed the crime?

149

You'll learn about it soon.

150
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:10,545
I'm sure that the lady will tell us about the vase

that disappeared from the scene.

152

Before we call the witness,

As a result of inspecting the picture that was in question

during the previous hearing.

162

an IOU in the amount of three million yen.

00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:32,245
And the murder weapon that

167
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:34,545
could not be found was also discovered.

168
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:36,545
The blood that was found on it

169
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:38,345
matched the blood of the victim.

170
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:41,745
I know nothing of it! I don't know of that knife!

171
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,345
Darn it!

172
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:47,545
-Do you want to turn me into a murderer? -Mr. Iwamoto, please calm down!

173
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:48,945
Darn it!

174
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:52,245
-Order in the court! -Let me go!

175
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:55,745
The defendant must refrain from using unruly language.

176
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,245
Things look in favor of Madonna.

177
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,545
What about the vase?

178
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:08,345
This is just the beginning.

179
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:09,345
What?

180
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:13,045
Does the defense have any objections

181
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,845
about using the new evidence submitted by the prosecution?

182
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:18,645
No objection, your honor.

183
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,245
However, I'd like to request cross-examination

184
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:24,245
of housekeeper Hara once again.

185
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:26,345
What is she up to calling her out

186
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:28,545
to the witness stand again at this point?

187
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,345
Does the witness have any recollection

188
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,045
of seeing this flower vase?

189
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:41,545
Yes. It's the flower vase that was in Mr. Ishigaki's study.

190
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:44,145
When did you see it?

191
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:48,145
I'm sure it was there on the day of the incident.

192
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:50,145
Before I went to clean the second floor,

193
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:53,645
I cleaned the study room.

194
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,545
So, I'm sure about it.

195
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:57,545
What's going on?

196
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:58,545
There was no flower vase

197
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:00,845
among the things left behind at the scene.

198
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:05,145
When is the next time you saw this flower vase and where?

199
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:07,645
The following day after the incident...

200
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,645
in the trash dump.

201
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,345
I headed for the residence like always to start my work day,

202
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:14,445
but the house was closed off.

203
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:16,045
So having no other choice,

204
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:19,345
I decided to go back home...

205
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:22,345
and found this flower vase in the trash dump.

206
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,345
"Whoever dumped this, please take it back."

207
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:24,745
"We are not collecting nonflammable garbage today."

208
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,345
I wonder why it was in a place like that.

209
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:31,045
So, you took it with you?

210
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:36,345
I just took it with me temporarily. It's true.

211
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:40,145
If nobody noticed, I'll bet you wanted to steal it.

212
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:41,445
Objection!

213
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,745
We are here to adjudicate a homicide case.

214
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:47,745
The questions by the defense pertain to the suspected theft

215
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:50,645
of the witness, and is clearly a tactic to buy time.

216
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,545
Will the defense explain to the court,

217
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,245
the nature of the question?

218
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:55,945
I would like to call to the stand a man who was present

219
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,645
when this vase was discovered,

220
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:01,445
a new witness, Kogoro Mouri.

221
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,245
Showtime, dad!

222
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,045
How dare she introduce me as if I was just a part of the evidence

223
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:11,145
left behind at the crime scene.

224
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:13,745
-Pops, there dust on your suit! -What?

225
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,945
Okay, off I go!

226
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:22,345
We're counting on you, Pops!

227
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:34,717
Please explain the connection of this flower vase to the case.

228
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:39,456
Why did the vase disappear?

229
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:43,356
Because the culprit hid the murder weapon knife inside it

230
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,356
to remove it from the study room, the scene of the crime!

231
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:49,256
Objection! He's only assuming.

232
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:53,956
Can you see the soiled part on the inside of the vase?

233
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:58,856
The brownish part...

234
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,256
Don't tell me it's blood!

235
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:04,556
When I got this back from the housekeeper

236
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:10,456
an inspiration flashed through my grayish brain cells!

237
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:14,356
Don't tell me that you were trying to steal this vase,

238
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:15,656
but the victim found you, so you stabbed him.

239
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,456
No way!

240
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,856
I didn't do such a thing!

241
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:24,756
The stain on the inside of the vase looks like blood.

242
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,056
What?

243
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:31,756
No doubt, it's blood!

244
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:34,456
There're stains on the bottom of the vase too!

245
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:39,756
If you doubt my perfect deduction,

246
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:42,756
try comparing the blood that is left on this vase

247
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,956
to that of the victim's.

248
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:47,156
Even so, you can't tell if they're blood stains

249
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:48,756
from the murder weapon.

250
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:52,256
After stabbing the victim, the culprit hid this knife

251
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:56,056
inside the vase and took it out of the study room.

252
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:58,256
The culprit left the vase behind in the trash dump,

253
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:01,356
took only the knife and fled!

254
00:15:01,356 --> 00:15:04,156
Why did the culprit do something as troublesome as that

255
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:05,756
when the culprit could've fled

256
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:07,256
along with the murder weapon to begin with?

257
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,056
No, so like I was saying...

258
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:10,656
if the blood on the knife got on his clothes,

259
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:11,956
it would leave stains behind...

260
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:14,256
When the defendant was arrested,

261
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:18,456
the blood of the victim was found on his shirt sleeve and slacks.

262
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:19,756
I wonder if he would've bothered

263
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,156
to think about getting blood stains on himself?

264
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:25,256
No, so...

265
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:28,556
Hey! Didn't you figure out the truth?

266
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:31,156
Well, you see...

267
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:33,556
Pops, I'll take care of things from here!

268
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:41,456
What on earth is happening?

269
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:43,156
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

270
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:45,356
What?

271
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:47,556
The victim was stabbed to death

272
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,156
before the defendant snuck into the house.

273
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:55,556
Most probably when housekeeper Hara was vacuuming the room upstairs.

274
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:59,556
She testified that she thought she heard noise downstairs,

275
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:03,756
at that time, the victim was probably

276
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:08,156
killed by the culprit in the first floor study.

277
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:09,556
The culprit probably took the picture off the wall

278
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:11,556
and took what he was looking for away

279
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:14,656
from behind the frame of the picture.

280
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:19,156
However, the culprit heard a strange sound just then...

281
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,856
The culprit was probably in more than in a great hurry

282
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,256
because he didn't even realize

283
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,956
he hung the picture back on upside down.

284
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,956
And the person who came sneaking in

285
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:33,656
was the defendant who came to look for his IOU.

286
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:37,856
Then, he found President Ishigaki's corpse.

287
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,756
And then there...

288
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:56,056
Are you back?

289
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,456
Mr. Ishigaki?

290
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:04,356
Back then, the culprit hid the knife

291
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,856
in the flower vase that was nearby

292
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:08,956
and came back in as if he just got there.

293
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:12,156
As if he just got back?

294
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,056
Then the real culprit is...

295
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:15,456
Right.

296
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:18,856
The one who appeared in the in the study right after Ms. Hara.

297
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:23,256
What's wrong, Ms. Hara?

298
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:24,956
Yes.

299
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:28,156
The culprit is you, Mr. Tsukamoto!

300
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:37,256
What do you think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

301
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:42,456
Mr. Tsukamoto, I know everything.

302
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:43,956
At the time the corpse was found,

303
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:45,256
you probably touched it

304
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:47,656
because you wanted to distract attention

305
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:49,956
from the blood that was already on your clothes from killing the victim...

306
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:52,956
You made Ms. Hara go and call an ambulance

307
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:54,656
and during that time...

308
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,856
you took the vase that you hid the knife inside,

309
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:00,656
out of the study and took it with you,

310
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:05,656
leaving it at the trash dump that is behind the house.

311
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:08,556
After finishing interrogation at the police station,

312
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:12,156
on your way home, you took the knife and gloves out of the vase,

313
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,956
and took it home with you.

314
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:16,756
The flower vase was supposed to be collected

315
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:19,656
along with the trash the following day.

316
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:21,256
However,

317
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:25,156
unfortunately, it wasn't inflammable trash collection day.

318
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:27,356
So, the flower vase that was left at the trash dump

319
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,556
was taken home by Ms. Hara.

320
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:34,556
Moreover, since the question of the missing murder weapon

321
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,356
was brought up during the first hearing,

322
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:39,856
you rushed over to the pool in the park and disposed of it there.

323
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:41,656
You were hoping that it would be found when they drain the water

324
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:42,956
in order to clean the pool.

325
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,056
That's enough!

326
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:48,356
Why would I have to kill my brother-in-law?

327
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:52,756
As to that, Attorney at Law Kisaki should've checked on it.

328
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,656
We have testimony that as chief manager, you,

329
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:57,556
Mr. Tsukamoto embezzled money from the company

330
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,456
and was on bad terms with the victim.

331
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:04,656
That's only a rumor! Where's the proof?

332
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,356
Did you find my fingerprints on the frame

333
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:07,656
of the picture or something?

334
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,956
I'm sure not...

335
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:13,156
because you would've been wearing gloves when committing the crime.

336
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:14,856
See.

337
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:17,556
Lay judges, please make sure that

338
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,856
you take that part into consideration!

339
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:24,656
Mr. Mouri.

340
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:27,756
But, what about when you took the gloves

341
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:30,156
and knife out of the flower vase?

342
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:33,856
The gloves were inside the flower vase,

343
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,356
so I'm sure when you were taking them out,

344
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:37,156
you did it with bare hands.

345
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:40,856
I checked the inside of the flower vase just to be sure,

346
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:42,056
and...

347
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:50,856
just as I expected, there was...

348
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,956
a bloody fingerprints.

349
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,956
When you took out the gloves and knife,

350
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:58,156
blood smeared on your fingertips.

351
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,756
That's what you left behind.

352
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:04,556
But, since you wanted to get out of there as soon as possible,

353
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,556
it didn't cross your mind.

354
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:08,356
Besides, you obviously figured that

355
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:12,756
the trash would be collected the following day anyway.

356
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:15,556
The one who could move the flower vase

357
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:18,556
that was at the scene of the crime, and move it to the trash dump.

358
00:20:18,556 --> 00:20:21,456
And the owner of the blood smeared fingerprints

359
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:25,256
left on the vase is indeed the real killer!

360
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:29,656
I would like to formally submit this flower vase as evidence,

361
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:33,156
Prosecution. Any objections?

362
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:35,356
We will take the flower vase immediately to forensics

363
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:37,256
and have them check the traces of blood

364
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:39,656
as well as the fingerprints on it.

365
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:44,356
He's the one to blame. That greedy guy...

366
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:47,956
He took away the deed for land that my older sister left me,

367
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:53,256
saying it was in return for the money I embezzled!

368
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:55,956
That's why that day when he wasn't home, I...

369
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,256
I recalled hearing about a picture

370
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:02,156
from my older sister in the past.

371
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,756
Ishiga, what do you think you're doing?

372
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:09,356
Ishiga, what're you doing acting like a petty thief?

373
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:12,256
I tried to overlook things because you're my brother-in-law,

374
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:14,456
and you go and embezzled money from the company.

375
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:16,956
This time, you're robbing me?

376
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:21,956
Please! That land is what my older sister gave me.

377
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:23,456
Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,956
You're not getting a cent from me!

379
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:29,356
I could just turn you into the police, you know.

380
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:30,756
If you don't want me to do that,

381
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,256
don't you ever show your face to me again!

382
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:40,556
I didn't want to give my older sister's land to him no matter what.

383
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:44,156
Not that land!

384
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:51,056
Regarding the murder charges against suspect Toru Tsukano,

385
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,856
I would like to make preparations to press charges against him.

386
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,456
Please stand beside the great Detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

387
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:25,856
How do you feel about having asked a question

388
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:27,756
that lead to solving the case?

389
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,856
I was honestly really surprised,

390
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:33,656
but I am delighted that I contributed to solving the case!

391
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:35,956
Ms. Kobayashi's become a hero.

392
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,056
Not a hero but a heroine.

393
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:41,256
No wonder she's advisor for the Youth Detective Squad!

394
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:44,456
And all she said was, "the picture is upside down".

395
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,056
If there is any other need to attend a hearing,

396
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,256
I will gladly take the job, so call me.

397
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:52,056
I don't think that'll ever happen again.

398
00:23:57,456 --> 00:24:00,356
"Next Episode" -Talking of White Day,

399
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,956
did you receive anything, Ran?

400
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:04,156
Something in return from Shinichi...

401
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:06,356
What?

402
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:08,556
I wonder what's going to happen?

403
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,156
What? What do you mean?

404
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:11,656
According to Sonoko,

405
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:15,256
they do something interesting every birthday!

406
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:27,456
Next Conan, "White Day of Betrayal (Part 1)"

407
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,656
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,456
"Sour".

409
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:48,856
What comes to mind when you say, bitter sweet?

410
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:50,856
-The taste of a kiss. -A kiss? How did you know?

411
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,656
-Just kidding -What?
