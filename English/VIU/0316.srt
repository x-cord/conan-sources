1
00:00:03,188 --> 00:00:04,987
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,887
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:08,687
A graceful mask on the professional wrestling ring.

4
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:10,887
Solve the case of the masked man.

5
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:12,487
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:14,487
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:16,588
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:00,426
"Tohto Kokugikan"

9
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:04,025
Now, let's have renown Detective Kogoro Mouri

10
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,925
pick the real Wolf Face!

11
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:10,225
Who of the five men here is the masked man, Wolf Face,

12
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:13,526
in the Teito professional wrestling match occurring right now?

13
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:26,526
Well?

14
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,425
Is it number three?

15
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:35,225
Yes! Correct! Exactly!

16
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:36,825
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

17
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,826
What spectacular deduction!

18
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:45,125
It's so obvious that he'd figure it out

19
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:46,225
with the panel of the real one

20
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:47,726
being pushed at his face like that.

21
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:55,726
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 1)"

22
00:02:58,426 --> 00:02:59,725
Darn it.

23
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:02,925
I just took this job because they're giving me good pay,

24
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:05,525
but what a place to have come to.

25
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:07,525
What do you mean?

26
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:11,625
Combat sports are pretty popular among the young people nowadays.

27
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,525
Even the boys in our karate club

28
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,725
use professional wrestling techniques on each other for fun too!

29
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:18,325
Hey...

30
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:22,425
Especially that technique that was just used...

31
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:26,925
Wait, what was it called?

32
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:28,825
No matter how cool they try to make it look,

33
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:31,926
it's no more than just kid's stuff.

34
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,225
All right!

35
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:57,026
You're totally into it.

36
00:03:58,126 --> 00:03:59,425
Hey, Ran.

37
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:02,125
When is that Wolf Face that was introduced a while ago going to fight?

38
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:04,125
He's incredibly strong, isn't he?

39
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:07,625
Wolf Face is fighting in the junior heavyweight title match,

40
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:10,125
so it'll be at the very end, which is the main event!

41
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:13,425
Are you saying that he's a champion or something like that?

42
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:14,725
Right!

43
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:16,225
After he debuted making an official announcement

44
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,925
that he would take off his mask if he loses,

45
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:21,326
but he never lost in all the single 65 matches he fought!

46
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:26,625
But, I'd like to see him lose for once.

47
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:28,625
Why?

48
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,025
Because if he loses,

49
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:32,925
we get to see what he looks like!

50
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:36,025
Hiding his face with a mask.

51
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,225
I'll bet he's probably just some super ugly dude or going bald!

52
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:43,026
Sorry for being an ugly man.

53
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:50,125
But, he isn't bald.

54
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:51,225
What?

55
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:52,725
Then, don't tell me that...

56
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,426
You're him?

57
00:04:57,426 --> 00:05:02,825
"Takaharu Ogami (27)" -This is the true identity of Wolf Face.

58
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:04,225
Are you sure it's okay, though?

59
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,625
Coming out without your mask to a place like this.

60
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:07,725
No worry,

61
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:11,425
Wolf Face is said to be Mexican.

62
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:16,025
Besides, I sometimes fight in the opening performance with this face.

63
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:19,525
But, everybody thinks that I'm just a young wrestler.

64
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:22,825
Well, I don't use the techniques of Wolf Face at that time,

65
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:25,025
so I'm just another young wrestler.

66
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:27,625
So, no one knows your true identity then.

67
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:28,725
Yes.

68
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:32,225
Nobody except for the personnel of Teito Pro Wrestling knows about me.

69
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,725
Neither do my parents nor my girlfriend.

70
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,625
I debuted as a mysterious masked wrestler

71
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:40,625
in Mexico to begin with so...

72
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:44,325
You don't have the kind of face that you'd have to hide, though.

73
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:47,225
I like to wear masks!

74
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:49,825
It's been my dream since I was a child.

75
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:52,125
Excuse me.

76
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,025
Doesn't it bother you at all?

77
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:57,326
To hide your identity and deceive everybody.

78
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:05,026
I'm sure that your girlfriend wants you to tell her the truth.

79
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:11,726
I really wish that you were Shinichi, Conan.

80
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:14,726
Ran.

81
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:20,325
I just said a while ago, remember?

82
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:21,825
That my true identity is

83
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:25,325
a secret that only the personnel of Teito Pro Wrestling know of.

84
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:26,725
If an outsider revealed my true identity,

85
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:29,825
I won't have to suspect her for having given away my identity

86
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:32,425
if she doesn't know, right?

87
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,525
But...

88
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,925
Besides, I don't want to worry her.

89
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:42,325
Wolf Face's match is aired on TV during Golden Time.

90
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:45,826
The match may turn out to be violent and bloody too so...

91
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:48,225
Well,

92
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:50,425
I'm more or less prepared for what is to come.

93
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:52,025
The time when I take my mask off

94
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:54,525
is when I lose and sink into the mat.

95
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,826
It's when Wolf Face dies and leaves the ring.

96
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:05,225
But why did you reveal your identity to us, then?

97
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:06,825
Well,

98
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:11,125
the thing is, my girlfriend is a great fan of the Sleeping Kogoro.

99
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,325
I figured you wouldn't give me your autograph

100
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:14,825
if I was just another young wrestler.

101
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:17,625
Why didn't you ask me when you were wearing your mask,

102
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:19,025
just a while ago, then?

103
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:22,125
But Wolf Face can't communicate in Japanese

104
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,425
unless he uses an interpreter!

105
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:27,125
Therefore, I wouldn't be able to ask you to give me an autograph

106
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,825
addressed to a girl with a Japanese name!

107
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:32,725
Besides, I figured that you're not the kind of people

108
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:36,425
who would give away my secret and shatter the dreams of children.

109
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:38,825
Well, of course not.

110
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,825
Mr. Ogami, it's about time.

111
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,025
Okay!

112
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:45,425
Well, then... Her name's inside,

113
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,426
so please give me your autograph!

114
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,825
His identity will be revealed

115
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,126
when he dies?

116
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,525
Mr. Nagase.

117
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,526
Mr. Nagase! Turn this way please.

118
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:13,125
Mr. Nagase! You're finally going to be fighting against

119
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,725
the invincible champion Wolf Face for his belt,

120
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:17,725
can you tell us how you're feeling now?

121
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:20,025
How am I feeling?

122
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:24,125
All I want is for the people here to watch me.

123
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:27,025
To watch me fight with all my might

124
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,025
"Hyota Nagase (25)" -against that idiot Japanese leopard

125
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:33,725
whose mask will be torn off when I defeat him.

126
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:35,525
Japanese leopard?

127
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:39,225
You mean Wolf Face is Japanese?

128
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,625
-Oh, no. -It's a joke, just a joke!

129
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:44,926
We're in a rush, so interview us later.

130
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,025
"Japanese Team Locker Room" -Hey, Nagase!

131
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,725
Just what do you think you're doing?

132
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:50,825
"Iwao Ushigome (36)" -Didn't I tell you

133
00:08:50,826 --> 00:08:53,725
that Wolf Face's identity is top secret?

134
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,125
And that you're not supposed to say a word about it to anyone!

135
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:58,125
Are you aware of the fact that

136
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:03,125
Ogami shoulders half the popularity that Teito Pro Wrestling enjoys!

137
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,425
Then, what is it you're saying, Mr. Ushigome?

138
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:08,725
Are you telling me, the star of the main event,

139
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:13,925
who has worked and polished strength as well as gain popularity

140
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:17,126
to go out of my way to lose deliberately on this gala occasion?

141
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:19,925
It's true that you're just a good looking

142
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,625
or even better than him,

143
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,325
but with the strength that you possess now,

144
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:25,225
you couldn't possibly beat him.

145
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:26,825
Just what are you talking about?

146
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,525
What's important for a wrestler is looks.

147
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,625
If not, a wrestler with your ability

148
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:34,725
would've become popular a long time ago, right?

149
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,126
What?

150
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,425
Hey, Nagase!

151
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:41,425
That's no way to talk to your superior.

152
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:42,825
"Hiroyuki Sakuma (25)" -Hold it.

153
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:47,425
You don't want to hurt a precious body just before a match, do you?

154
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:48,725
Okay then.

155
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:51,925
I'll be flexing my body like always in the room.

156
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,026
So when it's time to fight the match, please call me.

157
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,125
Well, if I win,

158
00:09:57,126 --> 00:10:00,425
I'll give all of you a mask as a gift.

159
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,225
So that you guys can all hide your ugly faces

160
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,926
and gain more popularity.

161
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,825
Yeah. No problem.

162
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:16,925
Chances are 200 percent my win.

163
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,325
Although, it's a hidden fact,

164
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,326
his left knee is not completely healed yet.

165
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:26,325
If I target his weak point, I can stop him in his moves

166
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,725
and if it looks like I'm about to lose, that's fine too.

167
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:33,625
All I have to do is peel his mask off on the mat, that'll be it.

168
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,825
Everything will work out just fine.

169
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:38,825
I made the young ones at your place wear masks

170
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:41,025
and I practiced time and again with them

171
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:45,225
on how to tear off the mask during the match.

172
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:47,825
The match will be cancelled once his identity is revealed,

173
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:50,225
and I'll be fired,

174
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:53,425
but Teito Pro Wrestling's popularity will go down too.

175
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:55,425
I'll end up the unfortunate wrestler

176
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,125
who is fired from Teito Pro Wrestling

177
00:10:57,126 --> 00:11:00,525
for revealing the true identity of Wolf Face,

178
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:04,725
and go up on the ring at your place.

179
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:07,725
I'm counting on you when that time comes.

180
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:10,126
Okay, Bankoku Pro Wrestling?

181
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:18,725
He sure is the leader of Teito Pro Wrestling.

182
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:20,825
It's finally time for Wolf Face to fight!

183
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:23,325
I gotta go to the restroom!

184
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:25,925
You better come back quick or the match will start!

185
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:27,425
Yep!

186
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:30,026
So where's the restroom...

187
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:37,826
Mr. Ogami?

188
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:42,125
Amazing.

189
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:44,426
He's so different from who we just saw.

190
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:47,325
Hey, Wolf!

191
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:50,026
"Leonardo Rossi (30)" -Good luck.

192
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:59,525
Shoots. I better go to the restroom quickly.

193
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:01,125
Hey, kid!

194
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:04,225
This place is off limits to everyone except authorized personnel!

195
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:07,625
Come on, I'm just going to the restroom!

196
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,825
No...

197
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:10,925
The restroom for the general public is on the second floor...

198
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,625
Hey, Nagase!

199
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:13,825
Just what do you think you're doing!

200
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:16,925
The match is going to start!

201
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:19,325
Hey, Nagase! Hey!

202
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:21,125
What's up, Sakuma?

203
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,725
Mr. Kiba.

204
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,525
Is something wrong with Nagase?

205
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:25,725
Well...

206
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:29,325
Nagase won't come out of the waiting room.

207
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:31,625
Well, we had a slight argument a while ago,

208
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,925
and nobody wanted to be his corner man,

209
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:38,825
so I decided to be his corner man and came to call him but...

210
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,725
Then, why don't you just drag him out of there

211
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:44,325
and make him get up on the ring!

212
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:45,625
But, he gets outraged saying that

213
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:46,725
his concentration is interrupted

214
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:50,225
if we go in without his permission.

215
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:54,025
Who does that green-horn think he is?

216
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,325
Hey, Nagase!

217
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:57,126
Hurry up and come out!

218
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:05,625
Nagase?

219
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:08,025
Hey, get a hold of yourself! Nagase!

220
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,325
No good.

221
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,925
There's no pulse.

222
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:12,325
What?

223
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:16,225
Hurry and get an ambulance and the police!

224
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:18,125
Yes, sir!

225
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:20,125
Darn it, who...

226
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,126
who could've done a thing like this?

227
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:25,125
Don't you hear a strange noise?

228
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:26,126
What?

229
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:29,225
A strange noise?

230
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,126
It's coming from that bag.

231
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:35,725
A hidden camera?

232
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:37,526
Nichiuri TV?

233
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,926
"Nichiuri TV"

234
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:52,526
Don't tell me that the killer is in the video...

235
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:04,926
This is...

236
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,826
Wolf Face?

237
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:26,733
We're sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.

238
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,533
The challenger for the junior heavyweight title match,

239
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,933
Hyota Nagase, is unable to fight

240
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:35,133
because of a sudden accident.

241
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:39,133
Therefore, the title match with Wolf Face that had been scheduled

242
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:40,934
has been cancelled.

243
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:43,133
What?

244
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:44,534
No way.

245
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:57,933
The victim is Mr. Hyota Nagase, age 25.

246
00:14:57,934 --> 00:14:59,933
He belongs to the Teito Pro Wrestling team.

247
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,733
A professional wrestler?

248
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,333
Yes, he'd been getting stronger day by day

249
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,233
and was steadily gaining popularity.

250
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,733
He seems to have been stabbed to death.

251
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:09,833
Yes.

252
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,933
He's been stabbed in a total of three places

253
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:14,133
which are his back, his chest and his stomach.

254
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:19,233
The blow that took his life was the final stab in his chest.

255
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:22,133
How do you know that the final stab was in his chest?

256
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:23,633
Well...

257
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:27,533
that's what we saw on the video before you got here, Inspector.

258
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:28,833
The video?

259
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,433
You mean a surveillance camera?

260
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:35,133
No. It is a hidden camera that Nichiuri TV,

261
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,833
who holds broadcasting rights

262
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:39,633
to our Teito Pro Wrestling Team set up in this room!

263
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,933
They wanted to film in secret Nagase

264
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:44,733
just before the title match.

265
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:47,533
Whenever he fought at the Tohto Kokugikan,

266
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:52,333
he used to do warm-up exercises alone in this room.

267
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,933
I see.

268
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:58,433
Will you show me that video too?

269
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,633
Oh. Here it is!

270
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:05,933
If so, the case is just as well solved!

271
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,633
The killer is shown on this tape, right?

272
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,833
Well, the thing is...

273
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:13,433
Wolfman?

274
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,933
Rather, a wolf's mask?

275
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,533
Wolf Face.

276
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:20,133
The masked wrestler that is popular now.

277
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:22,333
He's a junior heavyweight champion

278
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:27,733
and was scheduled to fight Nagase tonight for the title.

279
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,833
Since Wolf Face publicly announced that

280
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,433
he would reveal his true identity if he lost.

281
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:35,533
So it was a match in which his mask was at stake.

282
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:38,833
Which means in order to protect his title and identity,

283
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:42,133
the masked wrestler killed Nagase before the match

284
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,833
without realizing that there was a hidden camera here.

285
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,033
Oh, not really.

286
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:49,733
Not really!

287
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:53,233
Almost all the people of the Teito Wrestling Team

288
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:58,133
besides Nagase knew that there was a hidden camera here,

289
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:00,233
and once this wolf's mask is worn,

290
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:02,733
Wolf Face could be anybody, right?

291
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,733
Conan?

292
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:08,433
Which means that the killer is Wolf Face himself

293
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:11,233
or a professional wrestler with the same kind of physique as Wolf Face

294
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:15,733
who wants to set him up as the killer, right?

295
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,233
A professional wrestler with the same physique?

296
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:21,633
Because the killer that is in the video is

297
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:24,633
about the same height as Mr. Nagase.

298
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:28,833
Wolf Face is about the same height as Mr. Nagase, right?

299
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,433
Yeah.

300
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:31,933
Besides, this room is closed to everyone

301
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:34,433
except authorized personnel!

302
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:37,433
Only another professional wrestler

303
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:40,433
could stab a professional wrestler in a place like this!

304
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,533
I already gave the forensic officers

305
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,433
the murder weapon, which was a knife,

306
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,833
the gloves and outfit of the killer,

307
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:50,433
that was found in the restroom nearby, so don't worry!

308
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,234
I see.

309
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:56,033
So, Mr. Kiba,

310
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,833
please bring that masked wrestler and the professional wrestler

311
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:01,433
that has the same physique as he does here!

312
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,934
Yes, sir.

313
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:09,833
But, Conan. Why are you here?

314
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,833
I wanted to go to the restroom

315
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,833
and I heard the other wrestler making a fuss

316
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:14,933
over Mr. Nagase not coming out of his room,

317
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:16,633
so I came to check out what was happening!

318
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:18,433
No, rather,

319
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:22,333
who brought you to this professional wrestling grounds?

320
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:27,433
The famous Detective Kogoro Mouri, Inspector!

321
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:31,133
It's you after all, God of Death.

322
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:35,433
Well... Please let me see it too.

323
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:40,434
The video tape which shows the murder being committed!

324
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:46,533
Oh, it's you.

325
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:51,133
This is when the killer comes into the room.

326
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:52,433
Hey...

327
00:18:52,434 --> 00:18:55,333
I have nothing to talk to you about before the match.

328
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,733
Or do you want to ask me to lose on purpose?

329
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,933
The video just shook just now.

330
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,833
I think the killer's foot touched the bag

331
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:06,633
in which the video camera was hidden.

332
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:11,133
I already told you that I'm going to go for it seriously tonight.

333
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:14,134
He's already holding the knife.

334
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:18,533
-What do you think you're doing? -He stabs Mr. Nagase in the back first.

335
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,133
Then as he turns around,

336
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:21,933
Mr. Nagase is stabbed again in the stomach.

337
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:25,333
Hey. Isn't the victim trying to say something?

338
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:28,733
But, the killer covers his mouth so nothing can be heard.

339
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,833
He's going for the mask!

340
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,033
Come to think of it,

341
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:35,533
the blood smeared mask that I found in the restroom

342
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:38,633
was ripped about 10cm under the part of the right eye!

343
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,734
Then, maybe the killer's face can be seen.

344
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,833
Then, the final blow in the chest.

345
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:50,133
Darn it! Only if the killer would look this way.

346
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:52,433
But, why is he looking around like that?

347
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:55,033
Maybe he's looking for something?

348
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,233
He fell?

349
00:19:57,234 --> 00:20:00,233
Okay, get up, just the way you are!

350
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:02,333
Then, we get to see a close up of his face

351
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,134
from the ripped part of the mask.

352
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:08,633
Darn it. It's the left profile of his face of the part

353
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,234
that's not ripped that we first saw.

354
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:15,033
And, he leaves the room.

355
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:17,733
But, if a blood smeared man like him walks around,

356
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:20,633
I'm sure that somebody would've noticed him.

357
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:21,933
Oh, yes,

358
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,433
the young wrestler who was in front of the restroom

359
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:27,833
seems to have seen a man with blood on his outfit.

360
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,033
It seems that the man went into the restroom

361
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,933
hiding his head with a bath towel,

362
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,633
that the young wrestler took no special note of him,

363
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,333
thinking that it was just another veteran wrestler,

364
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,633
who was smeared in blood after fighting in the opening performance.

365
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,333
I see.

366
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:43,733
If he hid another outfit in the restroom beforehand,

367
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:46,033
he can change clothes then come out

368
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:48,833
looking as if nothing had happened.

369
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:51,033
What time is the estimated time of death?

370
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:54,633
A definite time has not been concluded yet but...

371
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:58,733
It was probably some time during the match Mr. Kiba was fighting.

372
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:00,833
Because three minutes after the killer left the room,

373
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,933
Mr. Kiba's roar of victory.

374
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:06,534
See! You'll hear it soon!

375
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,333
-Right? -You're right.

376
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,633
Which means that the time the murder was committed is...

377
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:16,833
Around 7:20 pm.

378
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:20,433
Inspector, I brought the four

379
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:23,433
who have a physique similar to Nagase.

380
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:28,633
So, please let me know when you find the murderer.

381
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:32,633
It's a promise, Inspector.

382
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:35,733
Okay.

383
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:38,133
Oh, there he is!

384
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:42,533
Mr. Kiba! Is it true that Mr. Nagase was killed?

385
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,233
Are the four that just went in suspects?

386
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:47,733
Please answer us, Mr. Kiba!

387
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,733
-Mr. Kiba? -Mr. Kiba!

388
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,033
Gosh, his lips are sealed.

389
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:55,533
But, this means the end of the Teito Pro Wrestling Team.

390
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:57,333
Yeah.

391
00:21:57,334 --> 00:22:01,833
All right then, from the person on the right,

392
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,733
please give me your name

393
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:07,733
and where you were around 7:20 pm.

394
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,333
Yeah.

395
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:12,133
Judging from the circumstances,

396
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:15,533
the killer should be among the four.

397
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,633
Who was it?

398
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:20,533
Who was it among these four people?

399
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:23,334
The person who killed Mr. Nagase.

400
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:03,934
"Next Episode" -It's the wrestler that did the bloody match.

401
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:16,133
Hey, Officer Takagi.

402
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:18,534
I have two things I want to ask you.

403
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:26,633
Next Conan,

404
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:30,834
