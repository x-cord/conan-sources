1
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:04,694
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:06,794
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,894
Bright and warm is the sunshine of April.

4
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:10,894
Even a surprising case grows rapidly.

5
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:12,494
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,494
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:16,495
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:08,156
I more or less have an idea of the situation

9
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:10,956
thanks to the telephone call last night

10
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:14,156
but is Mr. Seizan's slump that bad?

11
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:17,757
Yes, he hasn't drawn one picture these three months.

12
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,379
Why?

13
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,579
Maybe it has to do with his age since he's already 70,

14
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,479
it seems that he can't come up with anything creative,

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,979
and because of pressure from this,

16
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,679
"Jiro Kuroki (28)" -his fingers have begun to shake.

17
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,679
Oh, no!

18
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,179
He hasn't been eating very much lately

19
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,379
and is emotionally unstable.

20
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,979
He has sudden spurts of anger,

21
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,479
while at other times he goes completely silent.

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,779
In the end, he went on to attempt suicide.

23
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,080
Yes.

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,280
"A Place in the Sun."

25
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,479
I asked you to come today in hopes that.

26
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,879
Mr. Seizan would feel at least a bit refreshed.

27
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,279
I'm sorry to have called you knowing how busy you are.

28
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,579
Oh, no. Don't be.

29
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,979
If I can be of help to Mr. Seizan who is my drinking friend,

30
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,579
I couldn't be happier.

31
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,379
He would never turn down an offer that comes with Japanese sake

32
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,879
and hot spring, would he, Ran?

33
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,979
You're right.

34
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,180
Just what was that?

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,179
But, Mr. Seizan sure is a lucky man,

36
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,079
because he has a kind hearted disciple like you.

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm what I am, thanks to Mr. Seizan.

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,579
Oh, it's a bush warbler!

39
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,780
They reside in this bamboo forest.

40
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,979
I hear them from this side.

41
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,380
Oh, he's...

42
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,280
Mr. Seizan.

43
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,379
"Good friends who travel great distances

44
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,679
just to see you are as precious as gold."

45
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,179
Thanks for stopping by on the way.

46
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,579
When I saw the name of the station,

47
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,579
your face flashed through my mind, so...

48
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,379
I'm glad to see that you seem to be doing very well.

49
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,079
"Seizan Hayakawa (70)" -The older I get the more filled with energy I am.

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,580
I was just sketching the bamboo around here now too.

51
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,379
He doesn't look the least bit pressured.

52
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,979
Can't you tell?

53
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,979
He's putting on an act

54
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,279
because he doesn't want you to see his wretched self!

55
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,780
An act.

56
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,379
Did you just see that?

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,579
That's called the flight of a bush warbler

58
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,079
from valley to valley.

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,879
That's they're cry of warning.

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,279
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,480
Please forgive them because they'll fly away in time.

62
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,579
This bamboo forest is a sacred place for the bush warbler

63
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,379
and is not to be infiltrated.

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,980
Let's leave them so as not to intrude on them.

65
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,779
"Noriko Yamamoto (35)" -Welcome back, Mr. Seizan.

66
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,079
We've got guests.

67
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,879
Please make them something good to eat.

68
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,279
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,779
Who is she?

70
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,879
She comes here daily to take care of Mr. Seizan.

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,879
Her name is Noriko Yamamoto.

72
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,379
I see.

73
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,580
Mother!

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,979
Look... I'm good, aren't I?

75
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,879
Kenichi.

76
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,879
-Noriko... -I'm very sorry!

77
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,779
My mother came down with a sudden fever

78
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,279
and couldn't take care of him so, that's why.

79
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,879
No excuses!

80
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,279
I told you never to bring your child here!

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,779
Yes. But, just today.

82
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,879
No! Make him go home!

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,679
Don't ever bring him before me again!

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,079
Mother...

85
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,380
Go home, right this minute! Understand?

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,479
By the way, is that a new piece of work?

87
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,979
Fantastic mountain.

88
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,979
This is Mt. Fuji that I drew recently

89
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,979
because a certain company asked me for it.

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,579
Mr. Kuroki, don't you draw?

91
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,679
It's been a while since you've become Mr. Seizan's disciple, isn't it?

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,079
Sort of.

93
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,979
I saw it some time ago, but he's pretty good.

94
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,179
Unlike Mr. Seizan's, it's colorful.

95
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,879
Yes, mine are pictures in color.

96
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,679
Come to think of it, you know the contest

97
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,879
that Mr. Seizan serves as a judge?

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,979
Isn't it about time it starts?

99
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,479
You know very well, don't you?

100
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,779
The day after tomorrow is the deadline.

101
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,779
Why don't you make an entry, Mr. Kuroki?

102
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,579
I think you'll do pretty good.

103
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,679
Right, Mr. Seizan?

104
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,879
I don't think so.

105
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,379
I, his teacher, Seizan Hayakawa, will be laughed at.

106
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,180
Kuroki's not skilled enough to enter the contest.

107
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,679
But, Mr. Seizan...

108
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,379
Mr. Mouri, it's just as Mr. Seizan says!

109
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,679
I haven't gone through enough training yet.

110
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,579
Right, Ran, would you please be my model?

111
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,979
As part of training for me?

112
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,179
Sure.

113
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,279
Oh, Mr. Kuroki, one minute.

114
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,579
Mr. Seizan, could you draw us a picture?

115
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,879
Mr. Mouri!

116
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,879
When you were in Tokyo,

117
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,979
you used to draw a lot for us to enhance gaiety.

118
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,779
No, not tonight...

119
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,979
Please don't let him.

120
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,079
Mr. Mouri! Mr. Seizan has already drunk liquor.

121
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,479
He used to drink and draw for us in the past too.

122
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,679
Please, Mr. Seizan.

123
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,980
Please!

124
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,580
No good!

125
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,679
I'm sorry, I got carried away and I got kind of pushy.

126
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,079
No, don't be. It's just that I've gotten very weak lately

127
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,480
when it comes to drinking.

128
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Mr. Seizan!

129
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:26,979
Why don't we go fishing out at sea tomorrow?

130
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,879
Of course with Mr. Mouri and the others.

131
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,679
That sounds great!

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,879
Do let us accompany you, Mr. Seizan!

133
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,979
I haven't gone fishing in a long time.

134
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,779
I wonder if we can fish when it's raining like this?

135
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,879
According to the weather forecast,

136
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,479
the rain is supposed to stop by sunrise,

137
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,879
and it's said that tomorrow will be a hot day.

138
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,379
Well, as for tonight, I guess I'll go hit the sack already.

139
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,379
Good night, Mr. Seizan.

140
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Yeah, good night.

141
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,779
Dad! That's rude, you shouldn't have done it!

142
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,379
Mr. Mouri!

143
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,379
Please don't get me wrong, Mr. Kuroki.

144
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,079
I want to confirm with my own eyes

145
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,179
whether he cannot draw because his fingers are shaking, as you say.

146
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,279
That's why I put on that act.

147
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,780
I see.

148
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,479
So this is your workplace.

149
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,179
How cute. Is this your work?

150
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,179
It's still incomplete, though.

151
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,779
What beautiful colors.

152
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,080
It's drawn by mixing this powdered paint with hide glue.

153
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,579
This white one is called Oyster White, right?

154
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,379
You're knowledgeable, aren't you?

155
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,379
It's made by crushing the shell of oysters

156
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,079
and making them into powder.

157
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,580
Oysters?

158
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,380
What? That picture.

159
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,879
It's a picture of the bush warbler flying from valley to valley.

160
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,379
Good morning!

161
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,379
Oh, Mrs. Yamamoto.

162
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,079
What's wrong? You look pale.

163
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,579
I haven't had much sleep having to look after my mother.

164
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,780
I'm going to go call the doctor and ask him to check on her.

165
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,079
Mr. Mouri!

166
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,379
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

167
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,879
Mr. Seizan hasn't come out of his room yet,

168
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,779
so please go ahead to the harbor.

169
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,079
I see, all right.

170
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,279
What?

171
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,979
You mean Mr. Seizan isn't going to come?

172
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,379
Yes. He says he wants to stay home and relax.

173
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,879
Mr. Seizan, I'll switch over to Mr. Mouri now.

174
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,079
Yes.

175
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,279
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll go today.

176
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,479
Are you all right, Mr. Seizan?

177
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,679
Maybe we should...

178
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,379
Okay, we'll see you by sundown.

179
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,579
Yes.

180
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,879
You can expect a good catch!

181
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Let's not stimulate him too much for now.

182
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,479
-Octopus! -Amazing!

183
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,379
-Fish! -Great!

184
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,780
-Old boot. -That's not good.

185
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,979
Yes, this is Kuroki.

186
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,579
You mean, Mr. Seizan?

187
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,279
He left a note?

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,279
Yes. I can't draw anymore.

189
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,379
I'm sorry for relying on you. Thanks for everything.

190
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,379
Hello, please come back right away.

191
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,579
It seems she found it

192
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,979
when she went to clean up at the usual time.

193
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,379
Please call the police immediately

194
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,179
and have them search for him!

195
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,379
You heard him, didn't you?

196
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,580
We'll head back right away!

197
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,179
Mr. Seizan!

198
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,879
Is it suicide?

199
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,579
Who are you?

200
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,779
I'm a private detective, Kogoro Mouri.

201
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,679
You mean you're the famous...

202
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,479
I'm Daimatsu from the local police station.

203
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,379
We found a death note too,

204
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,779
so it's probably undoubtedly suicide.

205
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,579
He tied a rope to the bamboo,

206
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,179
jumped off from the rock and committed suicide.

207
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,679
The estimated time of his death is

208
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
thought to be between 11:00 to 13:00.

209
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,279
He tied the rope to the bamboo just when we were fishing.

210
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,379
I wonder why the bamboo was all cut down?

211
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,179
Water wasn't accumulated

212
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,679
so the bamboo was cut this morning after the rain stopped.

213
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,479
So what?

214
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,280
Go away!

215
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,480
A bush warbler?

216
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,580
It's way too soon to conclude this as suicide!

217
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:09,391
So this is Mr. Seizan's atelier.

218
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,590
Mr. Seizan confined himself in here

219
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,591
and was drawing all the while after that.

220
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,790
Bamboo Diary.

221
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,191
I wonder what this is.

222
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,991
The record of the growth of bamboo.

223
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:44,190
I see.

224
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,391
If it's like this, then maybe...

225
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:50,790
Pops.

226
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,390
There are expensive drawings here,

227
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,890
stop scampering around!

228
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:55,490
Look at this!

229
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:58,190
This is a sketch of Ran.

230
00:13:58,191 --> 00:13:59,690
What about this?

231
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:02,790
You see...

232
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,590
What? I see.

233
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:09,090
Oh, I was just thinking the same thing!

234
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:13,190
Mr. Mouri, I've finished most of the questioning,

235
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:15,590
so I'm heading back to the station now.

236
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:16,990
Please wait.

237
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,090
Isn't it too soon to decide that this is a suicide?

238
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:23,190
What do you mean?

239
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:27,290
Mr. Seizan said this yesterday.

240
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:31,090
This bamboo forest is a sacred place for the bush warbler

241
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:32,691
and is not to be infiltrated.

242
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,990
I wonder if Mr. Seizan,

243
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,090
would do such a thing as pollute the bamboo forest that he loved

244
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,090
with his corpse?

245
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,790
One more thing!

246
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,590
Last night Mr. Seizan confined himself

247
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:45,890
to the atelier after dinner

248
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:48,490
and was drawing this right through.

249
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:51,390
He was probably planning to give it to us as a gift

250
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,190
at the time we leave here.

251
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:58,490
If so, I wonder if he would commit suicide.

252
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,090
Which means...

253
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:03,890
A homicide under the pretense of suicide!

254
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:06,190
Mr. Seizan said "The bush warbler's flight from valley to valley"

255
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:08,991
means that the bush warbler's crying is the sound of warning.

256
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:13,990
Mrs. Yamamoto, just before we met you this morning,

257
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:16,390
we heard the cry of the bush warbler!

258
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:20,991
And, you ran off with a pale face.

259
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:25,990
I'll bet you were at the bamboo forest then?

260
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,091
No!

261
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:31,791
That is...

262
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,590
Conan.

263
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:39,190
But, his estimated time of death

264
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:43,390
is between 11 am to 1 pm.

265
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,690
She has an alibi during that time.

266
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:48,790
What?

267
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,290
I was at the city hospital.

268
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,790
I was told that I should take my mother to a large hospital.

269
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,790
So I took her there.

270
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,090
I see.

271
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,890
What's the matter, Conan?

272
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:04,890
Mr. Kuroki's painting is completed!

273
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:08,390
Mr. Kuroki must've stayed up last night and completed it.

274
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:13,990
Ran, Pops says to bring that painting and the sketch.

275
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:16,890
-When? -Right now!

276
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:18,090
I see.

277
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:20,890
She was by her mother's side all the time.

278
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:23,090
I understand.

279
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:26,190
You seem to have a definite alibi.

280
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:31,190
Which means it's most likely that Mr. Seizan committed suicide then.

281
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,391
I guess I'll be going then.

282
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:43,790
Officer Daimatsu, please wait!

283
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,390
Mr. Seizan did not commit suicide!

284
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:48,491
What?

285
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,390
The motive of the killer

286
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:54,690
who committed this homicide and made it look like a suicide

287
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:58,690
can be found in the pictures that Ran has brought here!

288
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:02,790
Mr. Kuroki, you were planning to enter the contest

289
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,990
with this painting, which deadline is tomorrow, right?

290
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,190
But Mr. Seizan wouldn't let you.

291
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:13,690
Therefore, you decided to kill him.

292
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:16,790
Mr. Mouri, what a thing to say out of the blue.

293
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,090
You invited me to come here saying that Mr. Seizan

294
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:20,290
was in a grave slump,

295
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,790
and wanted me to come to cheer him up,

296
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,190
but that was a lie!

297
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:29,890
Mr. Seizan was not in a slump

298
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:32,290
nor did he have any reason to commit suicide.

299
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,790
But his fingers were shaking.

300
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,490
I guess that's true.

301
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,490
But that painting of Mt. Fuji that was in the guest room.

302
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:43,590
How do you explain that?

303
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:48,790
Mr. Seizan said, "I just finished drawing it a few days ago".

304
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,590
That's probably what you completed

305
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:56,090
using Mr. Seizan's rough draft.

306
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:58,190
No, not only that.

307
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:00,590
Weren't you the one who was drawing

308
00:18:00,591 --> 00:18:03,891
all of Mr. Seizan's paintings these past few years?

309
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:07,990
No way...

310
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:09,390
So, having you enter the contest

311
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:12,890
and going independent was totally absurd

312
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:17,190
as far as Mr. Seizan was concerned.

313
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:20,190
Last night, you suddenly asked Ran to be your model

314
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:23,090
and diverted my attention.

315
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:27,990
I see! He knew that you would try to test Mr. Seizan

316
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:31,190
and ask him to draw!

317
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:35,590
Right, and after seeing Mr. Seizan's condition,

318
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:39,290
Mr. Kuroki, I believed that you said,

319
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,891
"It's not surprising that Mr. Seizan would commit suicide".

320
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,990
By the way, Mr. Kuroki, early this morning,

321
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,590
you carried Mr. Seizan's body to the bamboo forest

322
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:50,890
where he was found, didn't you?

323
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:55,890
No! You talked to Mr. Seizan on the phone, didn't you?

324
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:59,290
That's an entry level trick!

325
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,990
You recorded Mr. Seizan's voice beforehand,

326
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:07,090
and set the voice that you edited on the answer phone.

327
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,490
But like I've kept telling you time and again,

328
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:11,890
I have an alibi.

329
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:16,290
You mean, you were at sea with us?

330
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,890
Ran, please show Officer Daimatsu the sketchbook Conan gave you.

331
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:22,190
Here you go.

332
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:27,390
Bamboos grow way faster than we imagine them too.

333
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,490
Very true.

334
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:33,690
Please show us how much they have grown in a period of three days.

335
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:35,990
About 2m.

336
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:37,290
Amazing.

337
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,290
Bamboos grow greatly at once,

338
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,390
when like this morning after the rain clears

339
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:44,890
and the temperature rises.

340
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:50,890
Mr. Kuroki, you took advantage of this and killed Mr. Seizan!

341
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,990
This morning you carried Mr. Seizan

342
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,791
who you put to sleep with sleeping pills to the bamboo forest.

343
00:19:58,091 --> 00:20:02,490
You made Mr. Seizan sit in front of a bamboo you chose

344
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:05,090
and put a rope around his neck.

345
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:08,591
Then you cut the bamboo that was around Mr. Seizan.

346
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:16,490
You made sure that a lot of sun would shine

347
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:20,390
on the bamboo that you tied the rope onto.

348
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,990
The cry of the bush warblers we heard this morning,

349
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:27,990
was the cry of warning aimed at you, Mr. Kuroki.

350
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:32,390
The bamboo that was showered with a lot of sunshine grew rapidly

351
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:36,690
and eventually suspended Mr. Seizan in the air.

352
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:39,290
This is how Mr. Seizan died

353
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:43,090
while we were out fishing with you, Mr. Kuroki.

354
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:46,591
The white sawdust on your socks is the evidence!

355
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:52,390
This is Oyster White.

356
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,990
Just what kind of evidence is this?

357
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:58,990
No, that's not Oyster White.

358
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,190
Please take a good look.

359
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:05,490
That's sawdust that fell on you

360
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,491
when you cut the bamboo!

361
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:15,990
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,690
It's just as you say.

363
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,490
I've been drawing on behalf of Mr. Seizan

364
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:24,390
since a few years ago.

365
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:27,290
But I wanted to sign my name on them

366
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,590
instead of Mr. Seizan's at least once.

367
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,091
I want to give my paintings a place in the sun at least once.

368
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,490
I wanted somebody to look at them.

369
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:39,791
So I...

370
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:18,791
"Mouri Detective Agency."

371
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:24,290
All right. It's done.

372
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,690
Really?

373
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:27,191
Let me see...

374
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,990
What's that supposed to be?

375
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:37,290
You idiot! Don't you know about realism?

376
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,390
It's nothing more than a child's doodling!

377
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:42,490
What?

378
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:45,790
Even Conan can draw way better than this, right, Conan?

379
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,090
Don't compare me with a brat like him!

380
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,590
I'm just telling you the truth.

381
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,690
You have no sense for this piece of artwork!

382
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,991
I'm glad that I don't.

383
00:23:59,491 --> 00:24:02,491
"Next Episode" -So where's the restroom...

384
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,891
It's Wolf Face.

385
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,991
Amazing.

386
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,890
Don't you hear a strange noise?

387
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:18,790
A hidden camera?

388
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,391
Nichiuri TV?

389
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,291
This is...

390
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:25,390
Next Conan,

391
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:29,491
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 1)"
