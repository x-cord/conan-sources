1
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:20,930
Risa...

2
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:24,030
Risa Purple sure is popular, isn't she?

3
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:27,630
Yes, she's a charismatic underground idol.

4
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,730
Everyone adores her.

5
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:33,531
It's the "in" thing now to do Risa's cosplay.

6
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:39,730
Her charm point is this mole.

7
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:44,230
We've got to be grateful to Pops Kogoro for letting us come here today.

8
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,130
Right. It's all thanks to Risa asking Dad to serve as her bodyguard.

9
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,831
That's why we were specially invited here.

10
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:02,930
"Risa Purple (21), Idol"

11
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,830
It's like a dream come true!

12
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:09,530
All these people gathered here for me.

13
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:12,130
"Ginji Yamane (38)" -I'm glad that her fans increased

14
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:17,430
but as her manager, I'm worried that she may be attacked.

15
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,230
You can count on me!

16
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:23,830
I, Kogoro Mouri, will protect Risa with my life

17
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:27,230
no matter who attack her.

18
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,730
Bianca. Where were you?

19
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,330
I'm so sorry...

20
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,930
Risa!

21
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:34,330
Bianca!

22
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:37,630
"Bianca (26), Concert MC" -Risa, it's time for the live performance!

23
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,931
"Junichi Sakuta (34)" -Okay, Bianca! Let's go!

24
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:48,630
Thank you for waiting, everyone!

25
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:51,430
I'm your master of ceremony, Bianca.

26
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:53,830
Thanks for having me today.

27
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:58,430
Let's call Risa Purple to come on stage!

28
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:01,830
Three, two, one!

29
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:06,230
-Risa! -Risa!

30
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:09,631
Everybody, thanks for coming today!

31
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:21,031
Risa...

32
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:43,930
What the heck?

33
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,231
What're you doing, Dad?

34
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:51,231
Risa, this way!

35
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:59,031
Sakuta! Turn on the light!

36
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:03,830
This is bad!

37
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:07,030
Risa Purple has been abducted!

38
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,231
Hold it!

39
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:15,430
Oh, that's...

40
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:16,531
Ran?

41
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,030
A canvas stained black with crime.

42
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:22,230
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

43
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,330
A contemplated abduction from a live performance hall.

44
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:26,630
Ran is mistakenly abducted.

45
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,430
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:30,430
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:32,731
His name is Detective Conan!

48

"The Great Pursuit of Enraged Kogoro (Part 1)"

49
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:34,326
Hey! What're you going to do with my daughter?

50
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,025
Hold it!

51
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:42,326
Give me back my daughter!

52
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,226
Pops! Hurry!

53
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:55,425
Brat, get off.

54
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:58,525
I'm worried about Ran too, you know!

55
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:01,425
You worrying about her isn't going to get us anywhere!

56
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:03,625
Leave it to me!

57
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,926
Pops, that...

58
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,426
Darn!

59
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,225
Pops, look!

60
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:18,725
"Risa"

61
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:19,726
Risa?

62
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:24,325
I'm sure Ran wrote this message!

63
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:27,525
So, she tried to say that they mistook her for Risa?

64
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:31,725
No. I think it's more like a clue to who the perpetrator is.

65
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,925
I'm sure the perpetrator hasn't gone that far yet.

66
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,126
I won't let the perpetrator get away!

67
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:46,625
Wait! Excuse me.

68
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:47,626
"Recycling Shop" -Yes?

69
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:53,025
Did you see the guys who came down from the boat boarding area over there?

70
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:55,525
Two men and a woman.

71
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:59,025
The woman may have been carried by a man.

72
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:01,825
Oh, the one with the purple hair!

73
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:03,725
Yes, that's right.

74
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:07,225
I saw them get on a red truck and go that way.

75
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,725
A red truck?

76
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:11,425
Got it!

77
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:14,025
Please lend me your car.

78
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,325
What?

79
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:17,325
It's a kidnapping!

80
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:19,225
It's an emergency!

81
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,126
Oh, hold it.

82
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:27,726
Pops.

83
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:35,026
A red truck...

84
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:44,925
So, you're saying that the perpetrator

85
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:49,025
mistakenly kidnapped Ran instead of Risa?

86
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:51,325
Yes. Most probably.

87
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,125
The hall was pitch dark

88
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:56,825
and Ran was dressed just like Risa.

89
00:07:56,826 --> 00:08:02,525
I also at first thought that Risa was kidnapped.

90
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:06,025
Inspector, it seems that someone pushed the fire alarm

91
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,626
and turned off the breaker too.

92
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,626
Inspector, please take a look at this.

93
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,825
This is the flash from a stun gun.

94
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:20,826
A stun gun?

95
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,025
Yeah.

96
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:26,225
They probably kidnapped Ran after she passed out.

97
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:28,725
Do you work with her agency?

98
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:29,726
No.

99
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:34,425
I'm the director of Beika Cable TV, Sakuta.

100
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:37,725
I've been filming Risa at her events for the past five years

101
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,625
ever since she used to be an underground idol.

102
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:43,025
Can I have you submit this footage

103
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:45,425
as material for investigation to the police?

104
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:46,925
Sure.

105
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,925
But I've already sent this data to other TV stations as news material.

106
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:53,425
Huh?

107
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:56,325
I'm sure that it'll be aired on the news soon.

108
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:59,325
Investigations have just started.

109
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:02,526
It's a problem to have it publicized indiscriminately.

110
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:06,525
Megure here.

111
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,725
Where are you now, Mouri?

112
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:10,725
I'm in the pursuit of the perpetrator now.

113
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:12,025
What?

114
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:14,125
It seems that the perpetrator is on a red truck

115
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:18,025
driving along the canal heading in the direction of the clock tower.

116
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:21,925
Okay! Along the canal in the direction of the clock tower, right?

117
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,625
How's the signal from Ran's cell phone?

118
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:26,125
No doubt about it.

119
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:30,625
The car that Ran is on is headed towards the clock tower!

120
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,325
Contact headquarters.

121
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:36,625
Red alert on a red truck driving along the canal!

122
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,525
Yes, sir!

123
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:41,925
Inspector Megure, I left Conan behind at the boat

124
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,525
that the perpetrator had abandoned,

125
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,525
so please go pick him up.

126
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:46,825
Okay!

127
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,825
Conan is at the wharf!

128
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:50,825
Will you go pick him up on the double!

129
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:51,926
Yes, sir.

130
00:09:56,226 --> 00:10:01,525
Those guys are careless enough to mistakenly kidnap Ran.

131
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:04,626
So, I'm sure they've left some sort of clue behind.

132
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:09,626
That's...

133
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:20,425
Inspector. The fact is...

134
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:25,125
we've been getting threatening calls at the office since about a week ago.

135
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,025
Threatening calls?

136
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,025
From one who claims to be a fan of hers,

137
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:31,325
saying to let her free,

138
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:34,625
or that he feels sorry for her being slave driven on such cheap pay.

139
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:35,725
He said that if things are left as is,

140
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:39,225
something terrible would happen at the next event.

141
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:43,525
It sure does sound like a forewarning of what happened today.

142
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,925
But that's a misunderstanding!

143
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:48,825
I have no gripes against the agency!

144
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:53,025
I think it's probably an illusion that a fanatic fan is holding.

145
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,025
Do you have any idea who it may be?

146
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:59,125
Yes. There's a man who's been coming to the events

147
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,225
ever since Risa's debut as an underground idol.

148
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:03,825
Come to think of it,

149
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:07,125
there's a suspicious man who always shows up

150
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,425
at her filming and handshaking events.

151
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:11,626
A suspicious man?

152
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:27,926
Thank you so very much for your cooperation.

153
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:33,625
A red truck...

154
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,926
Where is it?

155
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:44,125
Are you all right?

156
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:47,626
Yes, I just rushed a bit too much because I might be late for work

157
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:53,125
I didn't know he was in such a rush.

158
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:55,325
I sort of feel bad for what I did.

159
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,725
News just came in.

160
00:11:57,726 --> 00:12:01,925
Just a while ago, at the live event hall of singer idol, Risa Purple,

161
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:04,625
a kidnapping case seems to have occurred!

162
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,825
We received footage of just after the incident,

163
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,725
so please take a look.

164
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:10,825
It's an emergency!

165
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:14,126
Risa Purple has been abducted.

166
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:18,726
That man just now sure looks familiar.

167
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:24,026
Stop. Please zoom in on the face of that man.

168
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:29,826
It's this man! I'm sure about it!

169
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:32,926
I've seen him somewhere

170
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:39,426
It was that guy!

171
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:53,426
"Takichi Takeyama (43), Recycling Shop Owner"

172
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:55,325
It's this man!

173
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:58,326
The suspicious man who always comes to the events!

174
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:04,325
I'll send you the image of the suspect.

175
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,526
Check on him.

176
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,126
Ran.

177
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:19,525
Then, you mean that the perpetrator

178
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:22,125
was in the car that Mr. Mouri was driving?

179
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:28,325
Yep. That man said that Ran's hair was purple.

180
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,725
Two men and a woman.

181
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,025
The woman may have been carried by a man.

182
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:37,025
Oh, the one with the purple hair!

183
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:39,325
Yes, that's right.

184
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:43,225
But this was floating between the wharf and the boat

185
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:46,725
I'm sure that it fell off when she was taken off the boat.

186
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:50,825
If that man was an eye-witness having nothing to do with the case,

187
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:55,425
He would never have said that the hair was purple, right?

188
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,325
Amazing, Conan.

189
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,825
It's all thanks to the message that Ran left behind.

190
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:02,125
Message?

191
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:05,925
She actually wanted to write recycling shop but...

192
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:10,925
I think she was taken off the boat before she could write it out.

193
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:12,925
Recycling shop.

194
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,525
On the bed of the recycle truck,

195
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:18,425
I'm sure I saw a refrigerator.

196
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:22,925
So, maybe the larger man shoved Ran in there

197
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:25,825
and then hid in the bed of the truck himself too.

198
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:29,325
Since Ran's mouth was probably covered with something,

199
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:33,725
she switched on her cell phone to let us know where she was.

200
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:38,225
I see. That's why the signal was moving towards the clock tower.

201
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:41,825
A red truck never existed to begin with.

202
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:44,126
Oh, Pops Kogoro!

203
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:48,625
Pops!

204
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:49,725
Oh, kid!

205
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:52,325
Good news, I've figured out who the perpetrator is!

206
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,725
The driver of the recycle truck, right?

207
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,625
What? How did you know?

208
00:14:56,626 --> 00:15:00,425
Ran's locked up in the refrigerator that was on the bed of the truck.

209
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:03,125
What? In the refrigerator?

210
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:06,925
Darn! To think that Ran and the perpetrator was riding together with me

211
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:09,325
and yet I didn't realize it.

212
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,825
Mr. Mouri. We know where Ran is from the GPS.

213
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:14,526
Please get in the car!

214
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:33,125
Yosaburo. Handle Risa gently, will you?

215
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:34,926
Yes, president!

216
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,825
She's not Risa!

217
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:48,325
-What? -Who are you?

218
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,625
What's with you?

219
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:53,225
You're the ones who made the mistake.

220
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:55,926
Who are you guys?

221
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:09,125
That's...

222
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:11,625
The cell phone's switched on.

223
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:14,625
The police will find out our whereabouts.

224
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:18,425
"Yosaburo Ihara (28)" -President, shall we...

225
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:21,925
Yosaburo, don't tell me that you...

226
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:24,925
I feel sorry for her, but we have no choice.

227
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:27,326
She's seen our faces too.

228
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:39,025
The signal from Ran's cell phone disappeared.

229
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:40,126
What?

230
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:47,825
Mr. Mouri. Do you know where they're headed?

231
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:52,025
That car's bumper is hanging down and scraping the ground!

232
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:55,425
If we follow the trace, we should get to their hideout!

233
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:58,826
But, Mr. Mouri. Why don't you get in the car...

234
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,725
Yes, Takagi here.

235
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:05,025
We found out the identity of the suspect.

236
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,825
Takichi Takeyama, age 43.

237
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,525
President of a recycling shop.

238
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:12,525
There's only one employee.

239
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:16,925
His height is 190 cm and its most likely that he's an accomplice.

240
00:17:16,926 --> 00:17:20,025
His name is Yosaburo Ihara, age 28.

241
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:21,825
I'll send you the data now.

242
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:23,226
Got it.

243
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:32,825
Yes, all right.

244
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:37,325
There are a lot of requests for interviews on the case, Mr. Sakuta.

245
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:39,425
I think you'd better hurry back.

246
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,725
I guess so.

247
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,525
Wait a minute, please.

248
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,125
Anything more?

249
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:47,025
There's one thing that concerns me.

250
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:48,625
Something that concerns you?

251
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:51,225
The fire alarm that the perpetrator pushed

252
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:55,725
was located in the corridor leading from the hall to the room backstage.

253
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:59,625
But that door is usually locked from the corridor side

254
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:02,426
and cannot be entered from the hall.

255
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:04,826
In other words,

256
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:09,625
the perpetrator couldn't have pushed the fire alarm button.

257
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:14,425
So you're implying that one of us pushed the button?

258
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,225
No way!

259
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:20,925
When the fire alarm went off, we were all in the hall!

260
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:22,125
That's right.

261
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:24,725
Right, Risa, her manager and Bianca too.

262
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:27,025
They're all on this camera.

263
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:30,225
Yes, exactly.

264
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:32,225
There's no mistake that the one who pushed the fire alarm

265
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:35,225
is one of the perpetrators.

266
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:39,025
However, the fact that the perpetrator was able to get into the corridor

267
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:43,325
means the door was unlocked from inside.

268
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:46,825
You're saying that one of us here unlocked the door?

269
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,625
There's no other way to think of it.

270
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:55,925
Is there anyone who went out to the corridor just before the live began?

271
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,425
Come to think of it.

272
00:18:57,426 --> 00:19:00,525
I didn't get to see Mr. Yamane for a little while.

273
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:04,225
No. I just went to make a phone call.

274
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,726
I didn't unlock the door.

275
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:14,526
So, this is the perpetrator's hideout.

276
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:17,925
Where are you, Ran?

277
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:19,526
I came to rescue you!

278
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:30,126
The perpetrator is a fanatical fan of Risa Purple, right?

279
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:37,425
Mr. Mouri. I got a call from the Inspector.

280
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,525
The perpetrator is Takichi Takeyama, age 43!

281
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:44,325
The other one he says, is probably an employee called Yosaburo Ihara.

282
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:47,326
It's him! Taikichi Takeyama!

283
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:50,925
It's the Face Net of Takichi Takeyama.

284
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:52,625
Face Net?

285
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,125
Risa Shigaki?

286
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:58,425
Risa Shigaki is Risa Purple's real name.

287
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:02,825
It seems the perpetrator was corresponding with Risa by mail.

288
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:07,425
"Mr. Takeyama, please save me."

289
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:12,625
"Please carry me out of the live concert hall on the day of the event"?

290
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:16,825
"Set the fire alarm off and cause a commotion"?

291
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:20,625
This is the blueprint of today's event hall.

292
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:25,425
Which means that Risa Purple's the one who planned today's kidnapping

293
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:27,725
and made Takeyama carry it out?

294
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,425
That's ridiculous!

295
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,625
Why would an idol and fan have to work together

296
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:34,025
and cause such a commotion!

297
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:37,825
Because a commotion would cause nationwide attention.

298
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:39,125
Attention?

299
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:44,325
It's true that this case is being aired on TV and internet repeatedly.

300
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,325
Therefore, I'm sure that the name Risa Purple are now,

301
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:50,425
is known not only to her fans but also to people all over the nation.

302
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:54,025
It seems that Takeyama mailed her back 15 minutes ago.

303
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:58,725
"Risa, I've mistakenly kidnapped the wrong person."

304
00:20:58,726 --> 00:21:00,525
"What shall I do?"

305
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:04,025
If you made a mistake, just release her right away!

306
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:07,025
"We're going to take the refrigerator to the cemetery now."

307
00:21:07,026 --> 00:21:09,225
"Please call me."

308
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,425
Cemetery?

309
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:13,525
I think the cemetery is...

310
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:17,025
I see. The grave for TVs and computers.

311
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:22,125
Those guys were illegally disposing recycle goods in the mountains.

312
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:28,125
I'm sure that the plan was to set Risa free over there.

313
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,725
If so, I'm sure then Ran would also be set free.

314
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:34,025
No. Ran most probably won't be set free.

315
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,325
On the contrary,

316
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,225
it hard to believe that they would let her free

317
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:39,425
after she's seen their faces and all.

318
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:41,625
Those who have no set plan

319
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:44,425
are more prone to make irrational moves on impulse.

320
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:49,226
Even if means taking action that would threaten a person's life.

321
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:28,526
Where am I?

322
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:35,825
What was that? What's going on?

323
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:37,525
I'm scared.

324
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:40,425
Dad. Conan.

325
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:41,726
Help me.

326
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:48,225
"Next Episode" -Hey, where's Ran?

327
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,025
The only method we could count on vanished!

328
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:52,725

I'm sure my daughter means nothing to you guys.

330
00:23:57,426 --> 00:24:01,325
Although my daughter tells me nothing,

331
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:05,625
I'm sure she's hoping for a happy future.

332
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,625
You guys are trying to take that happy future

333
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,926
from my daughter right this minute!
