1
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:04,625
A man named Eiji Kadowaki was murdered.

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,524
Eiji was a man with a bad reputation

3
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:10,524
who was often taken into police custody.

4
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:13,624
He also allegedly abused his mother,

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:17,925
while his older brother Yuichi Kadowaki protected her.

6
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:23,124
He was suspected of killing his younger brother

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,624
to protect his mother from his repeated acts of violence,

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:30,325
but his alibi was verified, and Yuichi was released.

9
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:34,725
Meanwhile, another suspect emerged.

10
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:38,424
This is Takase.

11
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:40,524
Rintaro Takase,

12
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:44,824
one of Yasuko's students from when she was a teacher.

13
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:47,324
Mrs. Yasuko Kadowaki?

14
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,324
Yeah, of course I remember her.

15
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:53,724
I was a rowdy kid.

16
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:57,225
She scolded me all the time.

17
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,425
Honestly, I hated her.

18
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:06,824
But that was 20 years ago.

19
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,824
What? He has an alibi?

20
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:12,025
-Yes, sir. -I see.

21
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:19,224
I told you so.

22
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:21,724
I didn't do it.

23
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:24,424
Well, I'm leaving now.

24
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:27,124
Good luck with your job.

25
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,825
Wait a minute.

26
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,024
Megure here.

27
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,925
What? A fire at the Kadowaki family residence?

28
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:45,824
That night, there was a fire at the Kadowaki family residence,

29
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:48,225
and the mother Yasuko was killed.

30
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:54,624
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

31
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,424
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

32
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:58,424
A complicated family situation and a former student and suspect.

33
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:00,424
With a fire layered on top of that, the truth is hard to see.

34
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:02,024
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:03,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,725
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:52,918
"The Mystery-Solving Water Taxi (Part 2)"

38
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:59,091
I told the cops who came yesterday about that customer.

39
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:00,791
He sat in that corner seat

40
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:04,591
for the three-hours all you can eat and drink.

41
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:08,491
You're sure it was from 8 pm to 11 pm?

42
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:11,691
Yeah. We even checked the security cameras.

43
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:12,891
Hey.

44
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:16,091
Which side was Takase sitting on?

45
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:20,191
I think it was that side.

46
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,392
What does it matter?

47
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,891
So his back was facing the other customers.

48
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,491
We should check the security cameras next, right?

49
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:33,191
Yeah. Can we?

50
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:34,192
Sure.

51
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:39,191
That's definitely Takase.

52
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:41,591
And the time is 8:01 pm.

53
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:44,091
Next let's check three hours later at 11 pm.

54
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:45,092
Yeah.

55
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:49,491
Hey, can't you make it go any faster?

56
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:51,692
Yeah, but...

57
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,091
What?

58
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:56,491
Oh, sorry. Wrong person.

59
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:57,891
Gosh.

60
00:04:57,892 --> 00:05:00,191
Their builds looked similar.

61
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:01,891
Idiot.

62
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:04,391
He's wearing totally different clothes.

63
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:06,291
He's got glasses, too.

64
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,891
Look closely.

65
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,291
Okay.

66
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,391
What?

67
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:11,991
What now?

68
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:16,091
Look. He came back out in less than 10 minutes.

69
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:20,091
It seemed like he was meeting someone.

70
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:22,591
He checked inside the shop, but no one was there.

71
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:25,891
He said he'd come again and left immediately.

72
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,191
He came back about an hour and a half later,

73
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:31,191
but there was still no one there.

74
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:34,491
He said he got the date wrong and left.

75
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:37,991
What? Sounds like a real scatterbrain.

76
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,692
Right? Isn't it funny?

77
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,191
Come to think of it,

78
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,891
we got an even stranger customer the other day.

79
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:46,091
Look at this.

80
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:48,591
What? Did you find something?

81
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:49,592
Yeah.

82
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:53,591
This is the second time that person came,

83
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:56,291
and this is when he left.

84
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,291
What about it?

85
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:02,292
I'll play it again. Watch his face.

86
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:06,091
This is when he came after 9 pm.

87
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:08,191
You can see his face, right?

88
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:10,091
And this is when he left.

89
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:12,591
He's facing downwards so you can't see it.

90
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:16,191
This is when he came back an hour and a half later.

91
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:18,091
You can't see his face clearly here either.

92
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:21,091
And this is the last time he left.

93
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:22,591
You can clearly see his face,

94
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:25,291
and he seems to have a satisfied smile.

95
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:27,491
Isn't it strange for him to be satisfied

96
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:30,791
if he got the day of his meet-up wrong?

97
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:34,891
When did he first leave and return?

98
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:40,891
He first left at 9:08 pm and came back at 10:35 pm.

99
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:44,191
9:08 pm to 10:35 pm.

100
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,291
That's about an hour and a half.

101
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,391
Hey.

102
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:49,491
From here to the crime scene...

103
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,691
It's about a 30 minutes walk.

104
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,292
So that's how it is.

105
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:57,791
"Three Hours 3,330 Yen All You Can Eat and Drink! Nebada Brewery."

106
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,591
Hello, inspector?

107
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:02,291
He had an accomplice.

108
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:06,591
Yes, the store's security cameras caught him.

109
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,791
Yes.

110
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:12,191
I'll tell the waiter to expect you.

111
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,391
Bye.

112
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,691
Now we just need evidence that Takase did it.

113
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:19,291
We don't need evidence.

114
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:22,891
If we tell him we've disproved his alibi,

115
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:25,292
he'll give it up.

116
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:28,691
"Safety First" -Later.

117
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:31,192
"Rintaro Takase (32), Construction Site Worker."

118
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:33,692
Is that...

119
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,092
What's he doing here?

120
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,292
Darn it.

121
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:52,592
The water taxi for Asakusa is departing.

122
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,992
Sucks for the great detective.

123
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:11,592
So you thought you got away.

124
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:18,291
The fact that you fled when you saw me proves it.

125
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:22,591
Rintaro Takase, you're the culprit.

126
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:24,791
I fled?

127
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:29,191
I just wanted to try riding the water taxi.

128
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:33,391
You only have 40 more minutes to crack jokes.

129
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:35,892
Then this boat will arrive in Asakusa.

130
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,791
Yes, inspector. Mouri here.

131
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:47,391
Yes. I'd like to turn over Eiji Kadowaki's murderer.

132
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:52,691
Could you come to the water taxi pier in Asakusa? Yes.

133
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:55,392
I'll tell you more then. Bye.

134
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:00,091
The alibi you've been relying on to prove your innocence

135
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:02,691
is easily constructed if you have,

136
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:06,492
for example, a friend to help you.

137
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,091
Bingo.

138
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:13,591
You used a person with a build similar to yours as a stand-in.

139
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:16,291
Ten cutlet skewers and a large beer!

140
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:19,991
Ten cutlet skewers and a large beer.

141
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,291
Welcome.

142
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:24,091
I'm meeting a friend. Can I look inside?

143
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:25,092
Go right ahead.

144
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,692
You swapped places with your friend in the bathroom.

145
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:39,991
Spirit! Spirit!

146
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,691
Looks like he's not here. I'll be back.

147
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,191
Okay.

148
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:47,792
You left the store, and murdered Eiji.

149
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,291
Then you returned to the restaurant

150
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,491
and swapped places with your friend again,

151
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,292
creating your fake alibi.

152
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,892
Unfortunately, this is the end of the line for you.

153
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:09,291
Right. There's a fireworks show today.

154
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,591
Listen, Takase.

155
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:13,791
It would be best if you came clean

156
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:16,291
and turned yourself in.

157
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,091
Where's the proof?

158
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,491
Not good.

159
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:24,091
You were just saying how I could've killed him, too, weren't you?

160
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:27,491
What proof do you have that I did it?

161
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:28,892
Well...

162
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,691
I think I'll go have a beer downstairs,

163
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:38,492
until the great detective remembers what proof he has.

164
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:43,491
I told you we needed evidence.

165
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:46,092
Shut up. He's not getting away, darn it.

166
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:48,592
Gosh.

167
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:52,291
But now that we've started this,

168
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,392
we have to do whatever it takes to get him.

169
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:07,590
A man as kind-hearted as me could never kill a man.

170
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:11,090
You called yourself rowdy just yesterday.

171
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:12,290
Hey, Pops.

172
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,390
What?

173
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,590
Let's let him talk.

174
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,191
He might accidentally reveal something.

175
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,491
Darn it. I'm having a beer, too.

176
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:35,891
Hey.

177
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:41,390
Give yourself up and confess already.

178
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:46,491
But I didn't do it. I can't confess to anything.

179
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,990
In that case...

180
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:54,990
Who do you think killed Eiji Kadowaki, and why?

181
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:57,090
How should I know?

182
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,290
He probably got on someone's bad side.

183
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,391
I heard he was one hopeless dude.

184
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,690
Really? So Eiji wasn't a very good person.

185
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:16,190
But since the good brother was around, Mrs. Kadowaki...

186
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:18,491
I'm going to use the bathroom.

187
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,791
So he knew.

188
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,090
But if that's true, isn't it strange?

189
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:29,390
What's strange?

190
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:32,990
If he wanted to get back at Yasuko Kadowaki,

191
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:36,291
he would've killed Yuichi instead of Eiji.

192
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,491
Hey, mister.

193
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,790
It's you, kid.

194
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,490
Don't scare me like that.

195
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:08,490
Were you really that rowdy when you were a kid?

196
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:12,690
Yeah, I guess. Bad enough that my parents abandoned me.

197
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,790
It must've been hard.

198
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:19,491
Abandoned at home, yelled at by teachers at school.

199
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:24,290
You get in trouble at school, too?

200
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:29,090
What? Yeah. Sometimes.

201
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:33,691
Someday you'll understand what a blessing it is.

202
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,591
I see. So that's how it is.

203
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,991
But why now?

204
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:55,791
Why after running into her for the first time in 20 years?

205
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,290
Drink up.

206
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,491
Thanks.

207
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:08,890
Once you finish that, confess.

208
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,390
You never give up.

209
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,090
I can't confess to something I didn't do.

210
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,690
Come on!

211
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,490
Hey.

212
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:19,390
You said you ran into Mrs. Kadowaki.

213
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,790
Where was that?

214
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,791
She was there when I went to the orthopedist for my chronic back pain.

215
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:30,790
She was at the hospital, too.

216
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,590
Full body contusions?

217
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:36,690
That's right. I accidentally missed a step on the stairs last night.

218
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:39,290
"Yasuko Kadowaki (63)" -and rolled all the way down.

219
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,190
Accidentally?

220
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:44,290
I laughed, too.

221
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:48,590
I couldn't believe that happened to that careful teacher.

222
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:50,091
That's it.

223
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:56,590
I think it was last Saturday.

224
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:59,390
She must've lied on the spot.

225
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:02,090
She couldn't tell her former student

226
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:06,390
that her son was abusing her.

227
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:09,590
So that's how it is.

228
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:11,791
Which means the fire...

229
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:22,090
What? This bridge...

230
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:25,090
We just passed Ryogoku Bridge.

231
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,090
The fireworks show grounds are approaching,

232
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,390
-so we'll be lowering the lights within the boat. -Darn.

233
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:33,390
-Asakusa is getting closer. -Please enjoy the sights from the windows.

234
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:38,090
A fireworks show? What fun.

235
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,390
Darn it.

236
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,990
Let's go upstairs to watch the fireworks.

237
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:42,690
Good idea.

238
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,890
We should go upstairs, too.

239
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:45,290
Yeah, let's.

240
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,891
I'm so excited.

241
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,790
Darn it!

242
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,790
I told the inspector to come.

243
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,890
There's no turning back now.

244
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:59,691
Too bad, detective.

245
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:06,490
Gosh. Who's calling? I'm busy.

246
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,890
"Incoming Call, Inspector Megure" -Inspector Megure?

247
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:12,091
Oh, no! What do I do...

248
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,790
Yes, hello! Mouri here!

249
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,890
Yes. No, of course not.

250
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:23,490
In just a few more minutes...

251
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:25,490
Yes.

252
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,691
What? What do you mean?

253
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,590
Darn. That just leaves this.

254
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:37,890
Takase!

255
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:41,090
What? Did you find the evidence?

256
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:42,490
I don't have any.

257
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:45,191
I'll force it out of you if I have to.

258
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,491
What's gotten into you?

259
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,790
Hey, are you okay?

260
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,090
Takase.

261
00:16:57,091 --> 00:17:02,690
You probably thought you were returning the favor

262
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:05,790
when you killed Eiji Kadowaki.

263
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,590
When even your own parents had abandoned you,

264
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:13,590
Yasuko Kadowaki was the only one who paid you any attention.

265
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:17,591
You felt indebted to her because of that.

266
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:20,490
Don't be ridiculous!

267
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:23,090
Who would feel indebted to that woman?

268
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,690
All I had for her was hatred!

269
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:28,990
When you saw her again at the hospital,

270
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:32,890
you couldn't believe that careful woman

271
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:35,590
could have done that.

272
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:38,890
And when you began investigating the Kadowaki family,

273
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,291
you heard a certain rumor.

274
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:48,490
Yasuko was being abused by her younger son Eiji daily,

275
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:53,091
and her older son Yuichi was trying to protect her.

276
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,290
You had an idea.

277
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,490
Fortunately, Yuichi had protected Yasuko

278
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:03,290
from Eiji's violence until now.

279
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,490
However, there was no guarantee.

280
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:09,590
Yuichi would always be there in the future.

281
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:13,390
At this rate, Eiji might eventually kill her.

282
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,691
Believing that, you...

283
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,590
I told you, I didn't do it!

284
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:24,590
When you think of it that way, it explains what you said.

285
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:30,190
So that was your destiny.

286
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:33,690
You thought you'd saved her from her son's violence,

287
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:38,190
but in the end, she was destined to die.

288
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:40,790
Isn't that what you meant?

289
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,490
You're making all of this up!

290
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:45,290
If you're so determined to pin this on me,

291
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,590
bring me the evidence!

292
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:48,891
Takase.

293
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:54,690
You shouldn't assume rumors are true.

294
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,890
What?

295
00:18:55,891 --> 00:19:00,490
You ran into Mrs. Kadowaki at the hospital last Saturday.

296
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:05,290
In other words, Yasuko Kadowaki was injured the day before,

297
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,890
on Friday night.

298
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:14,290
But that Friday night, Eiji wasn't at home.

299
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,490
Last Friday, he got drunk

300
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,790
and argued with a bar employee.

301
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,591
He spent the night in jail.

302
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:29,790
But since Yasuko was injured regardless,

303
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,090
there's only one explanation.

304
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:37,090
It was the older brother Yuichi

305
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,590
who was abusing his mother Yasuko daily,

306
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:43,590
and it was the younger brother Eiji who was protecting her.

307
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:46,890
You can't expect me to believe that!

308
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:51,690
And without Eiji to put the brakes on the situation,

309
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,991
the worst possible outcome occurred.

310
00:19:56,591 --> 00:20:01,091
Yasuko's murder at Yuichi's hands.

311
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:07,090
Perhaps he did it for revenge.

312
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:11,090
I'll never forget the humiliation I suffered

313
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:14,190
while being treated like a murder suspect.

314
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:18,190
Yuichi couldn't let go of his rage.

315
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:20,590
Isn't he the one who did it?

316
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:22,790
Your former student?

317
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,690
There's no way.

318
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,490
Even the police said they weren't sure yet.

319
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:29,790
I don't care about the police!

320
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,990
I'm asking you!

321
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:35,390
Maybe you didn't teach him well enough!

322
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:40,190
Because of him, I suffered that humiliation!

323
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:41,591
Darn it!

324
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:50,591
After killing his mother,

325
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:56,990
Yuichi set the house on fire to destroy the evidence.

326
00:20:56,991 --> 00:21:01,690
No. That's just your fantasy!

327
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:03,490
What evidence is there of that?

328
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:06,090
I just got a call.

329
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,890
When asked about the unnatural way the fire started

330
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,490
during his deposition,

331
00:21:11,491 --> 00:21:14,191
Yuichi Kadowaki admitted to it.

332
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,590
He killed his mother
