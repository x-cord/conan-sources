1
00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:04,047
Before I became Conan Edogawa,

2
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:07,547
I was brought to Beika Aquarium by Ran

3
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:09,347
in order to carry out a project entitled

4
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:12,347
"The great coincidental two lovers meet again

5
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:13,747
at the aquarium lovey-dovey project",

6
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:16,147
in an attempt to bring an end to the separation of her parents.

7
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:17,348
But, there...

8
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:30,547
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

9
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:32,447
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

10
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,347
Cell phone movies at the underwater spiral corridor.

11
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:36,347
A queer subject relays the truth.

12
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:37,947
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:39,747
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,948
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:27,641
"Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 2)"

16
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:28,442
"Beika Aquarium"

17
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:30,541
"Beika Aquarium" -I panicked!

18
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,341
"Kanoko Nakagiri (27), Customer" -I was picked up by him

19
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:35,041
"Kanoko Nakagiri (27), Customer" -only last week.

20
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:38,841
I smelled something fishy.

21
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:42,541
I thought it best not to get involved.

22
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,741
Wearing a mini skirt, smelling of perfume

23
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:47,241
and about 5'4".

24
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:48,641
See?

25
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:53,141
Then, you're the one who came to this aquarium with the victim?

26
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:54,241
Yes.

27
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,241
When I told him I liked dolphins

28
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,041
he invited me to come to this aquarium with him.

29
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,841
Then, you saw the dolphin show too, didn't you?

30
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:05,041
Yes! Together with him.

31
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:07,341
But, after he left for the restroom,

32
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:09,741
he didn't come back.

33
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:11,841
The dolphin show finished.

34
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:14,941
So I went looking around for him thinking to give it to him,

35
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:16,942
but was I shocked out of my wits!

36
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:20,841
Because he was collapsed on the floor bleeding.

37
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,342
What shocked me even more was after that...

38
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:27,441
The call that came in on his cell phone.

39
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:30,041
The people around him seem to have been making a fuss

40
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,141
saying that there was a stabbing incident

41
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:34,142
so I decided to ignore it.

42
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:37,641
I thought that maybe the one who called

43
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:41,641
was the one who stabbed him and was coming after me too.

44
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:44,241
Why did you think they'd come after you?

45
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,741
Because he was talking sneakily on his cell phone

46
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,641
about things that sounded dangerous.

47
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:52,341
Like, I'll get the dough ready for sure or whatever.

48
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:55,941
Could it be that you're suspecting me if so, you're wrong.

49
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:58,641
I have movie to prove it too, you know!

50
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:01,542
The one that I took at the dolphin show a while ago.

51
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,541
The viewers in front are drenched!

52
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,342
This is funny.

53
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:12,741
The show ended at 12 pm sharp!

54
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:17,941
-His corpse was found before 12, right? -Yes.

55
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,841
I was recording the dolphin show to the end

56
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:23,341
and the voice that's recorded is mine too!

57
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,942
This will serve as an alibi, no?

58
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,342
True.

59
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:33,641
The victim was Mr. Shumoto?

60
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:36,841
What is your relationship with the victim?

61
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,841
"Naho Ojiro (26), Customer" -He was my ex-boyfriend.

62
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:42,141
It's already been a year since we split, though.

63
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:45,341
Then, why did you ignore his call?

64
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:49,141
Because he kept bugging me to reconcile time and again so...

65
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,641
I was dating today too.

66
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:54,941
That's why I had my cell phone switched off.

67
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,042
Then...

68
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:59,841
you were with your date right through?

69
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,141
Yes.

70
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:04,541
This is him.

71
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,941
You can ask him if you need to.

72
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:10,541
But, testimonies of lovers don't...

73
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,542
Come to think of it.

74
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:14,041
Just about the time the incident occurred,

75
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:16,841
I was taking a movie.

76
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:18,342
Really?

77
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:25,041
It's been about 10 minutes already

78
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:27,041
but nothing's happening.

79
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:29,341
It's after this...

80
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,441
Ran, go back to the entrance and get the staff for me!

81
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:33,841
-We're in the movie. -Quick!

82
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,641
-No joke. -Shinichi.

83
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:36,741
What was that?

84
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:38,442
This is his voice.

85
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,541
Something seems to have happened.

86
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,141
Do you want to go look?

87
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:47,342
No, no. I don't want to get involved.

88
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:52,241
This indeed seems to be a movie that you took.

89
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:55,941
And why was Mr. Shumoto here?

90
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:59,941
It seems he was on a date with his girlfriend.

91
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:04,041
Then, maybe he just called

92
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,241
because he wanted to introduce her to me.

93
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,741
"Beika Aquarium"

94
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:12,141
You must be the one going with Ms. Naho Ojiro?

95
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:15,541
Yes. How do you know?

96
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,041
She just told me a while ago.

97
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,141
She also told me that the one who was killed here today

98
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:22,741
used to be her ex-boyfriend.

99
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:23,742
What?

100
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,541
"Kohdai Jinbei (28), Customer" -Naho's ex-boyfriend was killed?

101
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,941
Really?

102
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:32,141
You know him too, don't you?

103
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,741
No way. It's a first.

104
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:40,241
But, your mail address was also in his cell phone

105
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:43,241
and you ignored the text mail that I sent you a while ago too, didn't you?

106
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:45,041
Yeah, you mean the mail that said,

107
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,342
"Contact me right away?"

108
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,341
Since it was the same as the crank mail that I got before,

109
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:52,941
I deleted it.

110
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,141
I get a lot of those recently.

111
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:58,341
"If you want to hear my secret, click here."

112
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:00,341
It were sexually provoking mails.

113
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:03,941
Was the sender Naho's ex-boyfriend?

114
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:05,041
Yes.

115
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,341
By the way, at the time of the crime,

116
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:11,341
it seems you were also taking movies like she was.

117
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:12,641
Yeah.

118
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:13,742
Maybe...

119
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,441
You mean this?

120
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:22,742
Ran, go back to the entrance and get the staff for me!

121
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:25,641
Quick!

122
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,341
What was that?

123
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:29,041
Something seems to have happened.

124
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,141
Do you want to go look?

125
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:33,441
No, no. I don't want to get involved.

126
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:35,142
Right.

127
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:40,741
Of course even before this, the movie was taken without interruption.

128
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:44,842
Because we were both planning to upload the movie on the blog later.

129
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:47,341
Inspector Megure.

130
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,941
There were other viewers who filmed the dolphin show,

131
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:53,541
so we checked them against what Ms. Nakagiri took

132
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,442
and found there were no discrepancies.

133
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,241
I see.

134
00:07:58,242 --> 00:08:02,441
Why of all places did the perpetrator choose that tunnel

135
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,441
as a place to commit the crime?

136
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,941
If it were the corridor where the normal fish tanks are lined out,

137
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,941
it's dark so the other people

138
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,241
can only make out the silhouette of the perpetrator.

139
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:14,542
Why did the perpetrator deliberately choose such a bright tunnel?

140
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:19,841
Ran, lend me your cell phone.

141
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:22,241
I forgot to bring mine.

142
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:23,641
Okay.

143
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,041
Don't break it.

144
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,841
Because I finally got Dad to buy it for me.

145
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:31,042
Sorry, but will you please look the other way?

146
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:34,241
Hey, what's with you? What?

147
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:36,141
Just what are you up to?

148
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:37,341
What do you mean what?

149
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,941
I'm wondering if that tunnel holds any meaning...

150
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,141
Well, of course.

151
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:43,541
Because no matter where you look

152
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,441
there's nothing more but all kinds of fishes,

153
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,742
and it's as if you're at the bottom of sea!

154
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:50,741
Like I said...

155
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:53,842
It's romantic like a dating spot...

156
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:56,241
Shinichi?

157
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:57,841
I see.

158
00:08:57,842 --> 00:08:59,942
That's why the perpetrator chose that place.

159
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,741
He chose this place because he wanted to replicate the ocean,

160
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:07,242
and this place is exactly that!

161
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,341
Hey, just what do you mean?

162
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,241
All the others have gone home,

163
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:16,341
and yet why are we the only ones here?

164
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:17,841
I showed it to you, didn't I?

165
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:19,341
The movie to prove my alibi.

166
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,741
You saw mine too, didn't you?

167
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:23,441
Mine too.

168
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:26,541
Yes, we did see it.

169
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:30,841
There's just one person that took a queer movie.

170
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:33,041
A movie that practically confesses

171
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,742
that the person is a murderer.

172
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:42,841
I hope you're not going to say that it's the dolphin show that I took?

173
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:45,242
The movie you took was terrible.

174
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:47,841
The images were blurred

175
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:49,841
and the voices were cracked,

176
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:51,741
that it wasn't worth watching.

177
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:54,741
I couldn't help it. Because I...

178
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:55,941
Right.

179
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,741
It's only natural

180
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:00,441
because you're an amateur.

181
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,241
On the contrary,

182
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:05,041
the movie that Mr. Jinbe took was fantastic!

183
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,641
He had taken a great shot of the shark

184
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:08,541
that was swimming gracefully.

185
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:12,141
Am I going to end up being the perpetrator because of it?

186
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:16,841
No, you're probably just used to taking movies.

187
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:21,141
You wanted to upload the movie onto your blog too.

188
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,041
The movie in question is...

189
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:24,742
the one that your girlfriend,

190
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,642
Naho Ojiro took!

191
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:42,480
This is that movie.

192
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,480
This was taken by Mr. Jinbe

193
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:46,781
and the one on this side was taken by Ms. Ojiro.

194
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,880
Don't you notice anything?

195
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,980
What do you mean?

196
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,280
Mine is taken sideways

197
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:56,180
and hers is taken vertically.

198
00:10:56,181 --> 00:11:02,180
Yes. Normally, if you want to film a fish that is long sideways,

199
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:04,980
you would take it sideways, like Mr. Jimbei, wouldn't you?

200
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:08,580
In order to get the entire body into the frame.

201
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:12,280
However, Ms. Ojiro took the movie vertically.

202
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:14,980
Just as expected, the shark that was in her movie,

203
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:18,081
framed out in no time at all.

204
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:24,180
I wasn't interested in taking the shark.

205
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:27,281
That's not the only thing that's strange.

206
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:30,980
When somebody is taking pictures of something,

207
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:36,680
it's common sense to try to avoid interrupting the cameraman.

208
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:39,180
Like in this movie taken by Mr. Jinbe

209
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:42,180
But, in Ms. Ojiro's movie,

210
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,180
nobody seems to give a care,

211
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:47,480
and they are interrupting left and right.

212
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,980
It's almost as if they're not aware

213
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:52,980
that she's even taking a picture.

214
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:54,480
That's because...

215
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,080
It's only natural that they're not aware

216
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:00,481
because she had her cell phone...

217
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:06,280
inside his knitted cap, here,

218
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,281
while taking the movie!

219
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:12,380
Even if a white cell phone were to be stuck into a white knitted cap,

220
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:15,180
unless you take a good look, it's quite inconspicuous.

221
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:20,180
Placed this way, she gets to take movies as if she were behind him.

222
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:25,080
That's why she chose the tunnel of this fish tank!

223
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,380
The front and back are full of fish,

224
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,880
no matter what the shot,

225
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,180
there is some kind of fish in the frame of the camera.

226
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:34,580
But, if he had something like that in his cap,

227
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:35,880
you'd think he'd notice, right?

228
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:40,080
She probably said there's something on your cap

229
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:41,980
and made him take it off once,

230
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:43,580
buried the cell phone into the knitted cap,

231
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,881
then put it back on him again.

232
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:50,080
You can remove the cell phone in the wink of an eye.

233
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,480
There was a part in her movie that was blurred, wasn't there?

234
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,480
That's when she removed it.

235
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:59,180
But people tend to move their faces unconsciously,

236
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:01,680
so I wonder if it's possible for someone to take something so fixed.

237
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,980
That can be explained.

238
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:05,181
Because he...

239
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:11,880
He hurt his neck and head neck braces on,

240
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:15,980
so his head was more or less set in place.

241
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:18,380
How do you know about my braces?

242
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,180
When I called out to you from the side,

243
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:25,280
you turned your body and all towards me.

244
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,580
And even when watching the movie,

245
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:30,580
you brought the cell phone right up in front of your face.

246
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:33,480
That's why I thought that you hurt your neck

247
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:35,180
and couldn't look down.

248
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,480
Which means that while she was letting him take the movie,

249
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,380
Ms. Ojiro went to commit the crime.

250
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:44,281
Yes. She had it set to see the victim at this tunnel,

251
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:48,080
and after rendering him unconscious with a stun gun,

252
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:51,580
she went on to pierce his heart with a knife and stab him to death.

253
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,880
Then, she went back to Mr. Jinbe

254
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,080
to retrieve the cell phone.

255
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:59,280
But, it's a miracle nobody saw her.

256
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:02,880
She was probably dressed so that it wouldn't hurt being witnessed.

257
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,980
If she removes her jacket and lifts her skirt up,

258
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,380
then wear a cap or something,

259
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:08,180
she'd look like a different person.

260
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,980
Once she gets out of the bright tunnel,

261
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,480
that rest is practically all dark.

262
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:15,480
This way, changing clothes wouldn't be a problem.

263
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,580
But however, it's too bad...

264
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:20,781
there was just one thing you couldn't change.

265
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:24,381
Yes. It's this glove.

266
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,580
It's reversible

267
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:30,981
so it seems that you're wearing it inside out to hide the fact...

268
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:37,480
See, just as I thought,

269
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,481
the blood of the victim is on the fingertips of your right hand.

270
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,480
How'd you know?

271
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:47,480
The picture you took with him that you showed me.

272
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:50,580
Judging from what you're wearing, I know you took it today.

273
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:52,680
But, the color of your gloves were different.

274
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:55,880
People normally don't bring two different gloves with them.

275
00:14:55,881 --> 00:15:00,280
Besides, that picture is what you took using your right hand.

276
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:03,980
You handed the Inspector your cell phone with your right hand.

277
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,680
You are apparently right-handed

278
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,280
But, after taking off your glove,

279
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,580
you worked your cell phone with your left hand.

280
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:14,080
Putting all these together,

281
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:17,580
with the fact that a bit of blood

282
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:21,380
was on the inside of the bag of the convenience store,

283
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:23,680
that the perpetrator used to stab the victim.

284
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:27,380
Simple summing up leads me to my conclusion.

285
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,881
Let's have forensics check the blood then.

286
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,380
If you're going to check, I'd like you to do it fast.

287
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:36,080
I'm dying to wash the blood of that guy off of me

288
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:39,080
as soon as I possibly can you see.

289
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:42,080
So, you killed him after all, Naho?

290
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,580
Yes, I did.

291
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:47,480
He threatened to distribute indecent pictures of me

292
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,581
over the net because I dumped him.

293
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:56,780
That guy said that he sent several to your cell phone too.

294
00:15:56,781 --> 00:16:00,580
So, that's where that indecent text mail came from...

295
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:02,580
Right.

296
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:06,680
If you opened it you would've found an indecent picture of me.

297
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:09,780
It seems though, that you deleted it without opening it.

298
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:12,480
How'd he get my mail address?

299
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:16,080
When I went over to his house to tell him that I wanted to split.

300
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:19,480
That guy when I went to the restroom,

301
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:22,680
seems to have looked through my cell phone.

302
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,680
He told me, "If you don't want me sending your indecent pictures

303
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:28,680
to your boyfriend, work place and family, pay me.

304
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:31,681
I'm up to my neck with debt."

305
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:38,281
That's why I decided to distribute his blood instead.

306
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:43,280
But, I goofed.

307
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:46,480
If I didn't turn my glove inside out because I got blood on it,

308
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:49,280
I may have been able to get away with it.

309
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:50,281
No.

310
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:55,080
It was obvious even if you didn't turn your gloves inside out.

311
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,480
In the movie that Mr. Jinbe took,

312
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:01,580
you wore gloves on both hands.

313
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,680
You used your left hand to work the cell phone

314
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:07,180
and back then your gloves were the knitted kind.

315
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:10,680
It's hard to work a smart phone unless your hands are bare

316
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:14,080
That just goes to show and serves as proof

317
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:18,480
that you needed gloves to do what you were trying to carry out.

318
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,081
It's a simple deduction.

319
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:25,880
I think that it's better to call the whole thing

320
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,680
about the lovey-dovey re-encounter project off,

321
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:31,380
because of this incident that happened here at this aquarium.

322
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:32,681
I guess so.

323
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,880
Oh, no. It's raining.

324
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:40,480
Let's run home then.

325
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:42,880
Hey, I told you not to run.

326
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:45,381
But, why?

327
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,181
My cell phone!

328
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,280
No.

329
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,280
Why was my cell phone in my hood?

330
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,780
Sorry.

331
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:57,580
I was thinking of where the perpetrator put the cell phone

332
00:17:57,581 --> 00:17:59,580
to take the movie

333
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:02,780
and forgot that I hid it in your hood.

334
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,380
So, what are you going to do about it?

335
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:08,180
Dad just bought it for me.

336
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,780
Don't cry.

337
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:12,581
I'll buy you a new one someday.

338
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:15,180
You're the pits. Really!

339
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:17,780
Nothing good happens when I'm with you!

340
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,080
Even when I went to the States,

341
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:21,280
all I did was run into crimes.

342
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:23,980
Okay, then...

343
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:27,881
Tropical Land! I'll take you there!

344
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:30,880
Tropical Land?

345
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,980
What's with that happy sounding place?

346
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:36,780
I hear they're going to be making it in Tokyo.

347
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:40,580
I'm sure that no crimes can happen at an amusement park.

348
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:44,981
I don't mind going if you're treating me to everything.

349
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:48,780
Why don't we go and you treat me

350
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,780
if I win the Tokyo Karate Championship?

351
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,380
Hey, hold it.

352
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,880
You were the runner up last year

353
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:56,880
and didn't the Senior upper classman that won the championship

354
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,680
quit the club already?

355
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,381
You promised, okay!

356
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:07,580
I don't get much of an allowance.

357
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:10,280
And if you're getting me a cell phone,

358
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,780
make sure you get me the sea cucumber man

359
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:14,580
that they sell at the Beika Aquarium too.

360
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,581
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,280
I was half joking

362
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:45,481
and yet he really went out and bought it for me.

363
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:50,680
But, I wonder how he really felt about me back then.

364
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,381
I wonder if he...

365
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:55,580
Oh, no.

366
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:58,281
"Heart pounding" -I'm getting this unstoppable urge to want to ask him.

367
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:03,280
Shinichi's cell phone?

368
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:04,481
"Incoming call, Ran Mouri"

369
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:07,481
From Ran?

370
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:11,480
Shinichi?

371
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:12,580
Ran.

372
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:15,780
Where do you think I am now?

373
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:18,980
I'm at the Beika Aquarium where I came with you before.

374
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:22,481
Yeah. That place where the stabbing took place.

375
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:25,180
By the way,

376
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,880
I have something I want to ask you about.

377
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:30,580
Back then, did you... you know, Shinichi..

378
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,180
What did you think of...

379
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:35,180
Oh, you mean that?

380
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:37,281
When I told you not to run, right?

381
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,680
That's not it?

382
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:44,480
Oh, yes. Well, that too but...

383
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:47,780
Right, that was sort of bugging me too.

384
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:48,980
Back the you said

385
00:21:48,981 --> 00:21:51,280
that all you were doing was checking the mail from your mother

386
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:53,880
and didn't respond to Sonoko's mail, right?

387
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:56,580
Moreover, you were using your left-hand then.

388
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,680
You probably hurt your right hand,

389
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:03,380
so you couldn't do something complex as to respond to a mail.

390
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:05,680
Since you didn't take off your glove,

391
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:08,380
you must've had a bandage on your hand.

392
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:10,680
But, since you were all excited saying

393
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:12,880
that you were going to win the championship,

394
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,780
you probably just sprained your finger or something.

395
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:18,880
Right, I got hurt during karate practice.

396
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,480
But, what does that have to do with telling me not to run?

397
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:25,281
It's because with a finger like that you could never...

398
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:28,381
hook on your bra.

399
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:34,881
After all, you only have the kind that have hooks in the back.

400
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:39,980
How do you know something like that?

401
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:43,180
My seat was right behind yours,

402
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:44,780
so each time you bent forward,

403
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,281
I couldn't help but see it.

404
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,080
I can't picture you asking that goofy detective,

405
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:52,280
Dad of yours to hook it on.

406
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:54,080
Sonoko had a cold.

407
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,580
And it's hard to believe you would go all the way to your Mom

408
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:58,480
just to ask her to do it for you.

409
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:01,780
In other words, you weren't wearing a bra back then...

410
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,580
You may not know it,

411
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,480
but if you run without a bra, your boobs will sway to no end

412
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:09,180
and the Cooper's ligaments that support your breasts will stretch

413
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,780
causing your breast to start sagging.

414
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:13,080
Idiot!

415
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:15,881
I use them, the ones called sports bras!

416
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,180
Oh, right!

417
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:21,780
I forgot that she used them at the school club activity.

418
00:23:21,781 --> 00:23:24,480
And when it comes to the bras with hooks behind,

419
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:26,680
all I have to do is hook it up after bringing it in front like this

420
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:30,280
and spin it around like this.

421
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:33,181
Just what do you think you're making me say, stupid!

422
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,581
I hung up.

423
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:41,581
So, what did she call me for anyway?

424
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:44,180
"Next Episode"

425
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:45,481
This is "Anxiety."

426
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:49,280
What is the meaning of this?

427
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:51,180
The car that was in front of us with the "Scream" in it,

428
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,681
suddenly went off route and disappeared!

429
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,480
It's like a three-panel cartoon.

430
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:01,380
It's about the "Scream" drawn by Munch being stolen, right?

431
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:03,380
How do you know?

432
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:05,681
This was a crime!

433
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:08,780
Next Conan,

434
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,981
"Munch's Scream Disappears"
