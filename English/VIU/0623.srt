1
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:02,381
We're in big trouble!

2
00:00:02,381 --> 00:00:05,581
The Youth Detective Squad's in a pinch!

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:08,381
It all started when we started playing Kick the Can!

4
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:10,281
We were in a building that was scheduled to be brought down,

5
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:11,381
and nobody was inside,

6
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,881
so I thought it was okay to play there,

7
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,581
but I heard a banging sound from inside!

8
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:19,181
The rhythm that was being pounded was "252",

9
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:21,081
the code that the Tokyo Metropolitan Fire Department

10
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:24,881
uses to indicate that there is someone needing to be rescued.

11
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:29,081
We looked around thinking that somebody needed help.

12
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,681
But the people who were making the noise

13
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:33,681
were workers who were going to bring down the building.

14
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,981
So, we were kind of thrown off, but...

15
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:38,781
Conan realized

16
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,581
that they were actually bad people

17
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:43,081
and that they had locked someone up!

18
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,681
We were going to contact the police,

19
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,781
but the men found us and...

20
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,681
They caught Conan!

21
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:54,881
The doorway of the building is blocked and we can't escape,

22
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:58,881
so we've got no choice but to find a way to contact the police but...

23
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:02,881
If we do so, those guy will find out right away.

24
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:07,881
So, we agreed to use Ai's idea to deceive those men!

25
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:10,981
Although the strategy seemed to work at first,

26
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:13,481
next, Ai was caught.

27
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,181
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

28
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:21,581
You must be true to yourself.

29
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,081
Decipher the code and overcome

30
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:25,281
the pinch you're in, Detective Squad.

31
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:26,981
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:28,981
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,381
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:15,955
"Emergency 252 Part 2"

35
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:18,455
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

36
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:20,955
-Call the police, the police! -Hurry, hurry!

37
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,155
It's calling now...

38
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:25,155
Hey brats!

39
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,655
Can you hear me?

40
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:29,055
If you dare call the police,

41
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:34,055
the brown-haired girl and boy with glasses are going to die! You get that?

42
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:35,255
What?

43
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:37,755
Yes! 911...

44
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:40,555
"Calling" -Is something wrong? Is it an accident?

45
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,255
Hello?

46
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:47,155
What's the matter?

47
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:49,255
Hello?

48
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,555
Hey!

49
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,955
Aren't you going to report this to the police?

50
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:57,655
I've got no choice.

51
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,355
We'll get Conan and Ai in trouble!

52
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,455
But now what? What do we do?

53
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:06,455
What shall we do?

54
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,555
At any rate, let's hide somewhere!

55
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:09,755
Okay.

56
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:22,255
There aren't any sounds of sirens...

57
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:25,755
Which means the brats are obeying my orders.

58
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:29,655
So, what do we do with these two kids?

59
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:33,455
Take them to the fourth floor where the gramps is locked up!

60
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:36,455
I'll go look for the rest of the brats.

61
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:40,455
By the way, are you sure that gramps has money or what?

62
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:43,455
Yeah, I hear he's making millions.

63
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:47,555
But, no one answers each time we call his house!

64
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,755
She'll be back soon.

65
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,155
His only daughter about intermediate school age,

66
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:53,855
who answers the phone sometimes!

67
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:57,355
We'll threaten that daughter and make her bring the ransom here.

68
00:04:57,355 --> 00:04:59,055
Then we'll lock her into this building too,

69
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:01,355
and set fire to the place before we split.

70
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:02,455
Right.

71
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:05,755
But, talk about a bunch of unlucky kids.

72
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,755
If they didn't come play here,

73
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:10,755
they didn't have to become burnt black and down to ashes.

74
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:13,755
Okay, I'll go look for the other kids,

75
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:16,355
so you watch those two.

76
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,555
You can never tell what they'll do.

77
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:20,255
Yes siree.

78
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:30,555
Darn!

79
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:32,555
Why aren't they anywhere in sight?

80
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:36,655
Hey, it's already after 6 pm, you know!

81
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:39,055
We'd better hurry or the parents of these brats

82
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:41,355
may start getting worried and make a fuss.

83
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:43,955
How's the old man doing?

84
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:47,755
The old man that we kidnapped and locked up inside that locker!

85
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:51,255
Oh, when I looked in a while ago, he was still asleep.

86
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:53,855
And? Did you call the old man's house?

87
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,055
Yeah, I've been calling for some time now,

88
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,455
but no one's answering!

89
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:03,955
I wonder where those brats disappeared to, anyway.

90
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:06,155
Did you look good enough?

91
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:10,955
Yeah, I'm not sloppy like you but rather meticulous, you see.

92
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,255
I looked through every nook and cranny!

93
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:16,855
And they still can't find them,

94
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:19,155
which means they're unmistakably hiding

95
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:22,655
in one of the lockers of this room.

96
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,955
They got here before we were brought here,

97
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:35,455
and ended up not being able to come out.

98
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:36,755
We've got no choice,

99
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:39,355
let's look once more and if we still can't find them,

100
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,255
let's set fire to this place and split.

101
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:44,655
Yeah, I guess we'll just have to give up on the money.

102
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,355
Make sure you pour the gasoline thoroughly!

103
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:48,555
Aye! You can count on me!

104
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,255
What shall we do?

105
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:52,055
We'll all be burnt black.

106
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,755
Maybe we've got no choice but to beat them up after all.

107
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:56,155
Right.

108
00:06:56,155 --> 00:07:00,655
Maybe it's our chance right now, since that man's alone.

109
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:03,055
That sound just now is from the detective squad badge...

110
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,655
Huh?

111
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,955
-Just as I thought. -Maybe this is...

112
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,355
It's Conan after all.

113
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:15,655
Conan's tapping on the floor using the detective squad badge!

114
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,955
The sound we just heard was,

115
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:24,055
first, twice, next five times and finally four times, right?

116
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:26,255
Isn't this the "what's it called" code

117
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,555
that you mentioned before, Mitsuhiko?

118
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:31,355
The code that the Tokyo Metropolitan Fire Department uses!

119
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:33,955
"254" means...

120
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,555
to wait at the site.

121
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:40,055
Oh, that's right.

122
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:44,255
Don't you guys dare move from there until I tell you to!

123
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:55,255
But, things do look pretty bad.

124
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,455
Those guys kidnapped an old man from somewhere and locked him up.

125
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:02,155
They're also demanding ransom.

126
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:03,755
We, who just happened to come play here,

127
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:05,455
coincidentally run into them.

128
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:08,155
Ai and I are caught and rendered helpless.

129
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:14,255
One of the men is pouring gasoline in the room

130
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,455
so that he can burn all of us together with the hostage,

131
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,355
and the other one is off looking for Genta and the others.

132
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:24,355
The kids are probably in one of the lockers of this room

133
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,955
and cannot come out.

134
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:29,455
In order to get out of this predicament,

135
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,255
the only thing to do is to get the one standing guard

136
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:34,555
away from this fourth floor room but...

137
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:37,755
Stink...

138
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:39,155
I guess I'll really pour all of it out

139
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:41,655
just before igniting the place.

140
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:46,255
With my mouth gagged and both my hands and legs tied,

141
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:47,955
the only thing I can do isto give orders to Genta and the others

142
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:51,855
by banging the detective squad badge against the floor.

143
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:54,655
How do I get him to go outside with this?

144
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:59,255
I guess I'll try calling the home of the old man we kidnapped again then.

145
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:01,955
Telephone...

146
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,755
Come to think of it...

147
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:07,755
Huh? Conan, your cell phone standby display

148
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,055
is the man at the detective agency!

149
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:12,955
Yeah, when Pops came back drunk the other day,

150
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:16,155
he fooled around with this and the standby display's been this way since.

151
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,755
Mine is of me doing sparklers!

152
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:22,855
I've got it in my school bag, so I'll show it to you later!

153
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:25,255
Mine is Kamen Yaiba!

154
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,955
How about you, Ai?

155
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:29,655
Doc's sleeping face.

156
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:33,255
Mine is of a stray cat living in the neighbourhood

157
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:36,355
but I seem to have dropped it while playing kick the can.

158
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:39,155
Wait a second.

159
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:44,255
My cell phone is in the second floor corridor where I passed out.

160
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:48,455
Ayumi's is probably in her school bag on the first floor.

161
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:52,955
Genta's is probably somewhere on the third floor where he was hiding.

162
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:56,755
Before Ai was captured by them, they body checked her,

163
00:09:56,755 --> 00:09:58,655
but she had no cell phone on her,

164
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,055
so it must be in her school bag lying there

165
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:05,155
that was kicked by one of the kidnappers.

166
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:06,855
And Mitsuhiko's is...

167
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:10,355
The cell phones are nicely scattered in place!

168
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:23,655
I tell you, when the heck is the daughter f that old man

169
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:26,155
going to come home anyway?

170
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:27,355
Hello.

171
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:32,255
What?

172
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,755
A young man answered the phone?

173
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,055
Yeah.

174
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:39,155
Are you sure you called the old man's house, or what?

175
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:42,755
I'm sure I dialed the right number!

176
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:46,155
I hung up and re-dialed the number right away after confirming it

177
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:48,655
but the same man answered again!

178
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:52,655
And? Did you talk to that man about anything?

179
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:56,555
Of course not. I thought he was a cop and hung up right away!

180
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,255
Idiot!

181
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,955
It couldn't have been a cop

182
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:03,955
because no one knows that the old man's been kidnapped or what yet.

183
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,955
But the story's different!

184
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:10,055
At first the story was that the old man is living with his daughter

185
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:11,655
who is about intermediate school age that sometimes picks up the phone.

186
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,555
Our plan was to threaten her

187
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:15,955
and make her bring over the ransom, correct?

188
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:18,255
Something's not right.

189
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:19,355
I guess so.

190
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,055
Since things are starting to look sober,

191
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,455
I guess we've got no choice.

192
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:25,855
Let's set fire to this place and split!

193
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:29,255
Let's burn to ashes the hostage as well as the kids!

194
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,455
Set fire to this place and split?

195
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,255
I mean all the kids have seen our faces!

196
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:37,455
Rats, I've got to do something right away.

197
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:40,555
What about the kids that we haven't found yet?

198
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:41,855
How should I know?

199
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,955
A sound is coming from the detective squad badge again.

200
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:50,555
The sound is "555".

201
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:53,955
"555" is the code for report by phone.

202
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:56,955
Maybe he wants us to contact the police?

203
00:11:56,955 --> 00:12:01,755
No, that would be "554" dispatch the police.

204
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,455
Then, where are we supposed to call?

205
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:13,355
That sound again.

206
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,955
The figure from the sound is "953"!

207
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:21,355
"953" is a code that means the cause of the fire is, playing with fire.

208
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:23,255
Isn't he trying to say,

209
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:25,755
"Tell the police that they're planning to set this place on fire"?

210
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,555
But, the code for arson is "951".

211
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:32,155
Then, maybe it means to call the person who is playing with fire?

212
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:35,055
Person who's playing with fire?

213
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,155
I get it! Ayumi's cell phone!

214
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:41,755
It probably means to call Ayumi's phone

215
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:44,855
that has a standby image of her playing with sparklers!

216
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:49,455
What're you all worked up about?

217
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:51,555
Set the place on fire and hurry on down here!

218
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:54,555
Who knows where the other brats are,

219
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:56,555
but by the time people realize that the building's on fire,

220
00:12:56,555 --> 00:13:00,255
they'll be covered with smoke and crossed over!

221
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:01,455
Hold it!

222
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,255
It's the ringtone of the cell phone.

223
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:05,455
The brats are on the first floor!

224
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,555
Hey, where the heck are you?

225
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,055
Give yourselves up and come out here!

226
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,555
Okay, next...

227
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,155
"655"...

228
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:27,055
"655" is totally wasted!

229
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:29,255
Meaning a person who is totally wasted.

230
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:30,955
Then...

231
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,855
It's Conan's cell phone!

232
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,055
Because his standby image was one taken together

233
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:38,255
with the drunk man at the detective agency!

234
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,255
Hey, how about it?

235
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,055
Did you find the brats?

236
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,955
Well, the ringtone suddenly stopped

237
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,455
and it seems that the cell phone was switched off.

238
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:51,755
No, it's upstairs!

239
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:54,455
A ring tone from another cell phone is ringing upstairs.

240
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:55,755
I'll go look for them, then.

241
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:57,555
No! I'll go!

242
00:13:57,555 --> 00:14:00,255
You stay there and watch the kids!

243
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:11,955
Don't tell me that they all split up and hid in different places.

244
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:15,155
"Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya Calling"

245
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,255
"One missed call"

246
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:21,455
Okay, before he finishes climbing the stairs, here goes the next one.

247
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,655
Address unknown?

248
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,755
Yeah. "658" is a code that

249
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,955
indicates someone with an unknown address!

250
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:39,255
What's that mean?

251
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,355
It means someone who doesn't have a stable home he lives in

252
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:43,155
and goes here and there.

253
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:45,155
Don't tell me

254
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:47,955
that means the stray cat on the standby display of my cell phone?

255
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:53,455
Another ringtone?

256
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:57,455
Hey! It's another ringtone from the top floor.

257
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:02,955
If it's that sound, I can hear it slightly

258
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:04,555
from the place on the fourth floor where I am now too!

259
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:07,355
Maybe the brats are climbing up to the top floor?

260
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:10,155
Okay, this is it.

261
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:18,455
"652: Bed-ridden aged person"

262
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:21,155
"652" means bed-ridden aged person.

263
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,655
I'm sure that's...

264
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,355
The standby image of Ai's cell phone.

265
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,055
-Doc's sleeping face! -Doc's sleeping face!

266
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:35,755
I think I heard the voices of the kids just now.

267
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:37,655
Hey.

268
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:43,555
Don't tell me that they're in one of these lockers.

269
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:00,083
Hey!

270
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,383
It's the vibe sound of the cell phone!

271
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:04,683
And, I hear it really near too!

272
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,583
Hey, what's up?

273
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,083
It's stopped.

274
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,783
It seems that the brats are looking for each other

275
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:16,183
by communicating on their cell phones.

276
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,883
Okay, block the door of that room with something,

277
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:20,283
and you search for them too!

278
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,983
-Okay! -I'll ambush them at the stairs,

279
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,983
so you threaten them with your voice and corner them,

280
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,783
then, we'll sandwich them!

281
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:38,283
Well, I guess this'll do.

282
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,083
Hey brats, get out here!

283
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,483
I know you're some place nearby!

284
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:47,983
Strange.

285
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:49,683
I don't hear anything anymore.

286
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:51,183
Same here.

287
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:02,883
It's the brat's cell phone!

288
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,483
It was dropped in the corridor!

289
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,383
What does that mean?

290
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:09,083
The brat was ringing the cell phones of his friends

291
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,383
one after the other to confuse us.

292
00:17:11,383 --> 00:17:14,583
Then, where the heck are the brats?

293
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,083
I see! I got it!

294
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,183
It's the room that he's locked up in!

295
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:23,383
This was a strategy to pull you away from that room!

296
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:25,783
So, the brats are in that room?

297
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:29,183
Yeah! We've haven't looked through the lockers in that room at all!

298
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:32,483
Darn! Then the voices of the brats that I heard a while ago was...

299
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:33,483
Punks!

300
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:36,583
Never mind and just go get all the brats and nab them!

301
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:41,883
Darn! Those brats, how dare they get wise with me!

302
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:43,483
Gotcha!

303
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:48,883
Hey?

304
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:50,383
Hey, what's the matter?

305
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:51,983
Did you find the brats?

306
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,183
Answer me!

307
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:55,883
No, the brats all got away.

308
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:58,083
Maybe they've already reported us to the police.

309
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:00,383
I'm getting out of here because I don't want more trouble!

310
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:02,283
I think you should split as soon as you can too!

311
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:03,483
Hey!

312
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,983
Hold it!

313
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:12,683
But, why did he let one get away?

314
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:15,583
Because if it's just one, if we join hands, we could...

315
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,883
Don't worry!

316
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:21,383
As to the other guy, he'll spit it all out at the police.

317
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,183
There're no more weapons left,

318
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:25,983
so there's no need to take anymore risky chances!

319
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,883
No. Footsteps... do you hear them?

320
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:41,683
It's getting closer.

321
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:43,383
He didn't run away.

322
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,383
You guys stay back!

323
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,083
This thing I sense...

324
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,183
Don't tell me that it's...

325
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,883
Subaru.

326
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:21,383
What brings you here?

327
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:26,083
Well, the lights didn't go on even after sundown

328
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,083
so I got worried and went to check things out.

329
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,283
Then, I found the front door unlocked,

330
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:32,883
and neither Doc nor that girl was there.

331
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:35,083
I was wondering what I should do,

332
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,283
when two calls came in with no one talking.

333
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:40,683
So, I thought that maybe both of them got messed up in a case

334
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,583
or something and were in trouble.

335
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:46,083
I went into Doc's room and used the spare pursuit glasses

336
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,083
I found there and tried to pinpoint the location

337
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,283
of the detective squad badge.

338
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:51,783
That's how managed to get here!

339
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:54,783
Then, don't tell me that the old man that was kidnapped is...

340
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:55,883
Yes.

341
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:58,183
It's somebody that all of you know very well.

342
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:04,483
Dr. Agasa!

343
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:07,883
-Doc! -Doc!

344
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:10,583
I think that if the front door wasn't locked,

345
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,583
the culprit probably disguised himself

346
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,883
as a courier or something and got in,

347
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:18,083
Then kidnapped Doc and locked him up here.

348
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,383
They probably mistakenly thought that

349
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:21,383
since Doc invents many things,

350
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:25,583
he must be making millions from them.

351
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,283
I guess so.

352
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:32,783
Doc's inventions are all junk and he's actually dirt poor.

353
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:36,183
Then, the intermediate school girl that sometimes answers the phone is...

354
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:38,283
Were they talking about Ai?

355
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:42,083
Ai has a very grown up voice as well as a style of talking too.

356
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,783
By the way, Subaru,

357
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:46,983
did you run into the other culprit?

358
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:49,583
I found him passed out on the stairs.

359
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,883
I'm sure he tripped in his haste to run down the stairs when fleeing.

360
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:56,583
But Subaru's like superman!

361
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,883
Sensing the slightest abnormality and coming to the rescue.

362
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,183
I guess so.

363
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:06,983
To come and check the house out only because the lights weren't turned on.

364
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,983
It's like you've been watching the house right through.

365
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:21,983
Yes,

366
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:25,583
the fact is, I was watching the house right through for you to come home!

367
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:32,183
I made too much curry for lunch,

368
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:33,883
so was thinking of sharing it with you.

369
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:34,983
Curry.

370
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:39,183
So, tomorrow we're all having curry for lunch at Doc's house!

371
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:42,083
Curry is said to be the most delicious on the second day too.

372
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,783
"The Next Day"

373
00:23:12,783 --> 00:23:16,483
You mean you kicked the wall not knowing what "252" meant?

374
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:19,283
Yeah, I heard the voices of you all,

375
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:22,383
so I kicked the wall hoping for the faintest chance that you would hear me!

376
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:25,883
With a strong desire that you would call the police right away!

377
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:36,283
Call the police right away...

378
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:39,283
It's coincidentally "252".

379
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:43,083
I'm glad that my feelings got through somehow and am glad!

380
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,883
Goes to show you can transmit your thoughts if you try!

381
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:50,683
You mean I sound that old?

382
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:53,983
"Next Episode" -You're looking for the answer

383
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:58,083
to a love letter that you received 13 yeas ago?

384
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,083
See, it's her!

385
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,983
-Cute! -Cute!

386
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:06,283
That specially produced drama of the memory of her and I

387
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:09,183
is carved deep within my mind.

388
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:10,683
Video?

389
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,583
Maybe you made a video letter

390
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,283
and kept it in one of the videos here?

391
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:22,283
