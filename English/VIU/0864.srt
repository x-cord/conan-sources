1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:04,211
Pops Kogoro and I headed for the hotel

2
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:07,511
to have a talk with spirit detective Gaito Hotta.

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:10,211
But Gaito Hotta was found murdered

4
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:13,211
in a room in that hotel.

5
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:17,511
Moreover, in the room next door...

6
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:19,711
Gosh, who is it?

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,811
What's with all the noise?

8
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,711
You're...

9
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,911
Huh? You're the guy from the detective agency.

10
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,911
Masumi Sera.

11
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,911
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

12
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:50,211
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

13
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:52,211
Is Masumi the only one in the next room?

14
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:54,411
The case turns a deeper shade of black.

15
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:56,111
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:58,311
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:00,611
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:36,617
"The Spirit Detective's Murder (Part 2)"

19
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:39,395
By the way,

20
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:43,295
did this wine belong to Mr. Hotta who was staying in this room?

21
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,595
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:47,295
He said he was planning to see someone,

23
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:51,295
and asked to have snacks and wine glasses for two, which I brought here.

24
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:52,595
I see.

25
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:56,195
Do you have any idea who that someone was?

26
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:58,295
Not at all.

27
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:02,995
But this room sure is hot.

28
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:04,195
It sure is hot.

29
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:05,995
Although it's sort of chilly today,

30
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,195
it's not that cold that you need to use a heater.

31
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:12,395
Well, if it was done to shift the ETD of the corpse,

32
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:17,095
this bedroom where the corpse is, should be heated to the max,

33
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,195
but on the contrary, the window is opened on this side

34
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,295
and it is rather cold.

35
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:23,095
And Mr. Mouri,

36
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:27,195
did you really see somebody flee from the window?

37
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:29,395
Yes, sir! I saw it clearly with these eyes of mine.

38
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,995
Somebody fled from the veranda just now!

39
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:37,695
Come to think of it, when that window was opened,

40
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,995
a gust of wind blew!

41
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,995
A gust of wind?

42
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:46,995
That's probably because I opened the front door, I think.

43
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:49,695
If a suspicious person came out of the room,

44
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:52,195
I wanted to take a picture using my video camera, you see.

45
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:54,695
Why didn't you keep the door closed?

46
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:57,295
The perp would flee, right?

47
00:03:57,295 --> 00:04:01,795
But if I don't let him flee, I'd be attacked, wouldn't I?

48
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:04,595
True.

49
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:09,395
So, the glass fell to the floor blown by the wind.

50
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,495
No.

51
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:14,395
The glass fell when we opened the front door

52
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,995
and that was before the bedroom door was opened.

53
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:17,495
Hey, Conan.

54
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:18,595
I see.

55
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:22,195
When you found the corpse, was that bellboy there too?

56
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,295
Yeah.

57
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:28,395
At first, Pops Kogoro and I came here with Mr. Kokuri,

58
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:31,395
but since there was no answer after ringing the doorbell.

59
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,295
Huh? This is strange.

60
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:38,795
He's supposed to be in his room.

61
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,695
After this, Mr. Kokuri realizes that

62
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:45,095
he received e-mail from Mr. Hotta an hour earlier

63
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,795
and checked his mail.

64
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:48,195
What?

65
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:50,795
"I'm going to be killed. Help me!"

66
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:55,895
So he went to get the bellboy to unlock the door.

67
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:57,995
Really?

68
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:01,195
And the bellboy opened the door right away?

69
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,395
No. When he was about to open it...

70
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:04,995
Wait!

71
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:06,895
An incoming call.

72
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:08,695
Hello, Mr. Hotta?

73
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:10,695
Are you Mr. Hotta?

74
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,795
I'm sorry. It was a wrong number.

75
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:15,495
I'll open the door then.

76
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:16,795
Okay.

77
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:20,095
And when he opened the door...

78
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:22,895
How about it?

79
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:26,095
Did I explain things well enough? To you know who?

80
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:27,295
What?

81
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:30,295
Who's that somebody, anyway?

82
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,095
More importantly,

83
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:35,895
I want to see the part above the window of the veranda.

84
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:37,295
Okay.

85
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:46,195
Here goes.

86
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:48,195
How about it, Conan?

87
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:51,195
Yep. It's a bit sticky, though.

88
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:53,395
Like something was pasted on above the window.

89
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,895
I see.

90
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:58,295
You found a trace of something pasted above the window.

91
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:00,395
You two!

92
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:03,295
What are you doing there?

93
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:04,495
Get out of there!

94
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:09,595
Which means that something was pasted on the window

95
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:13,495
but made to blow away when the door was opened?

96
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:18,295
See, because air flows from the warm to the cold, right?

97
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,795
But even if something were to have been pasted on,

98
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:24,095
I don't think that the wind would suffice in making it come off.

99
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:25,795
And even if it did come off,

100
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:30,295
the thing that blew away would have to fall somewhere.

101
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:31,995
You're right.

102
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,295
But, well...

103
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:38,095
Either way, the perp is probably Mr. Kokuri for sure.

104
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:45,995
Inspector Megure, we'll be going then.

105
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:47,695
Good work.

106
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:50,995
What's this?

107
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,495
What's the matter?

108
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,795
Did you find something?

109
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:58,095
No. When I came inside to use the bathroom,

110
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,895
the lid of the toilet opened on its own and I was surprised.

111
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:05,595
Using the restroom at the scene of the crime...

112
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:08,095
There are a lot of those toilets around these days!

113
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,195
-Really? -Yes.

114
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,695
They are equipped with sensors

115
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:14,595
and when people approach, it opens automatically.

116
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:19,895
Opens automatically with sensors...

117
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:22,795
Automatically... With sensors...

118
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,595
With sensors...

119
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,995
Okay, let's go then.

120
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:36,795
Huh? Mr. Hotta mailed me an hour ago.

121
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,295
What?

122
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:41,195
"I'm going to be killed. Help me!"

123
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,595
I'm sorry. It took me a while to explain.

124
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:47,595
Wait!

125
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,795
An incoming call.

126
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:51,295
It was a wrong number.

127
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:54,295
Mr. Hotta?

128
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,395
Somebody fled from the veranda just now!

129
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:03,095
There's a car parked right below the veranda.

130
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:05,295
Why is it parked in a place like that?

131
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:08,895
I see. I get the picture.

132
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,295
Hey, Masumi.

133
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:14,895
Deliver, what?

134
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,595
Gosh!

135
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,595
I've got no choice.

136
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:20,595
Pops.

137
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,895
I have something I want to show you.

138
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:26,095
Huh? What is it you want to show me?

139
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,695
Just come!

140
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:28,995
Gosh.

141
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:33,195
The forensics have finished doing their thing already

142
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:35,495
so there's nothing to see anymore.

143
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:45,495
Okay. All set for the Sleeping Kogoro!

144
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:47,895
It's kind of dangerous because Masumi's here.

145
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,495
All I have to do next is use the bowtie voice changer,

146
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,495
use Pop's voice and deceive everybody...

147
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:57,595
What?

148
00:08:57,595 --> 00:08:59,095
Crap!

149
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:01,495
The voice changer's missing!

150
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,101
Crap.

151
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:09,801
I must've dropped my bowtie voice changer somewhere!

152
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:14,101
Without it, I can't perform my Sleeping Kogoro deduction show!

153
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,601
And I already put Pops to sleep.

154
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,101
Mr. Mouri?

155
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:20,501
That pose, don't tell me that...

156
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:23,901
You've figured out the case, right?

157
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:26,201
Mr. Mouri?

158
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:29,101
Maybe he's really asleep.

159
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,901
I think he's just thinking.

160
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:36,101
Gosh. Why on earth is he doing so in that position?

161
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:44,001
This case would be an easy one for Masumi to solve, but...

162
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,101
Okay!

163
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:48,801
She doesn't know about Mr. Kokuri's car, though.

164
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:51,001
Conan.

165
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:53,001
Do you want me to help you?

166
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,601
You're in trouble, aren't you?

167
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:58,001
Not really. I'm not in trouble.

168
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,901
How about Pops Kogoro?

169
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:01,601
Do you need help?

170
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,901
Answer me.

171
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:06,401
It looks like he's really asleep.

172
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:07,701
Wait!

173
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:11,101
Sleep is a biological condition of

174
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:15,001
the periodically repeated loss consciousness.

175
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:18,201
-In other words, it is virtually impossible... -It's Pop's voice.

176
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,601
for people to talk when they are asleep.

177
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:21,201
The smartphone is behind his neck?

178
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:22,801
Of course, there are exceptions like sleep talking.

179
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,701
Where on earth?

180
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,901
The words I'm speaking now must sound

181
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:32,201
like senseless sleep talking to you.

182
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:34,601
But since they are the words of the detective

183
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,201
who has solved this ridiculous case,

184
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,801
I ask you to listen.

185
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,201
-So, you've figured out the case after all? -I get it!

186
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,001
She's using my voice changer from behind the curtains.

187
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,301
However, his tone of voice is different.

188
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:45,601
Gosh!

189
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,401
Don't get in the way.

190
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,901
I prefer to be brief,

191
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,001
so I'll get right to the conclusion.

192
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,101
The man who stabbed and murdered spirit detective Hotta,

193
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:00,201
or whatever his name is, in bed,

194
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:07,401
and made it look as if the killer fled the scene when we arrived is...

195
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,801
over there, TV Director Kokuri!

196
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,501
But you said that

197
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:20,001
the dishes fell to the floor when you opened the front door,

198
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:22,701
then you followed the footprints of the foot

199
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,401
that stepped on the spilt wine

200
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:25,901
and opened the door of this bedroom,

201
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:31,501
then saw somebody flee from the window.

202
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:35,501
Construction was underway back then on the floor below,

203
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,801
so it may have shook slightly,

204
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:40,501
but the odds the dishes would've fallen are 50-50.

205
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,701
So, it doesn't seem appropriate to use as a trick.

206
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,401
No, it was 100 percent!

207
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:49,101
It was impossible for the dishes not to fall!

208
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:51,801
Impossible?

209
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:52,901
Excuse me.

210
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,001
Yes?

211
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:58,601
I brought the wine glass, wine bottle, plate and salt

212
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,901
that you'll be using for the investigation like Detective Mouri told me to.

213
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,501
What?

214
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:10,401
First, set the plate on the very edge of the table.

215
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:13,601
Then pour a large amount of salt next to the plate

216
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,501
towards the center of the table!

217
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,901
Yes, sir.

218
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:20,901
I poured the salt!

219
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:23,801
Then stand the wine glass up on top of the salt,

220
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:27,101
so it's leaning towards the plate.

221
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,201
Place the wine glass... tilted...

222
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:31,401
The wine glass is standing.

223
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,701
With the wine glass standing, blow away the salt.

224
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:37,401
Don't blow too strong and make sure the glass doesn't fall.

225
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:42,901
Amazing!

226
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,301
It's still standing!

227
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:47,301
Right. The glass is left standing

228
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:50,701
by just a few grains of salt.

229
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:54,201
Finally, place the bottle against the base of the glass

230
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:56,301
and shake the table.

231
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:00,601
The glass becomes unbalanced. The bottle blocks the glass,

232
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,101
which inevitably falls towards the plate.

233
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,801
Then the glass falls together with the plate onto the floor.

234
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:12,901
If broken plates and glasses are placed under the table beforehand,

235
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:14,901
all the objects will crack due to the impact

236
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,901
as well as make a lot of noise.

237
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:20,501
What was that sound?

238
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,701
It sounded like something cracking.

239
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,701
By spilling wine on the floor

240
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:28,701
and creating wine stained footprints leading to the bedroom,

241
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:34,001
it would look as though the killer rain into the bedroom.

242
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:37,001
Furthermore, you created a difference in room temperature

243
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,001
between the living room and the bedroom by turning on the heat.

244
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:42,201
By doing so, when he door of the bedroom is opened,

245
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,301
a breeze would blow through,

246
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:48,801
scattering the small pile of salt that remained on the table.

247
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:50,301
You feared that

248
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:53,301
even a small amount of salt found on the bottom of the glass

249
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:58,801
could lead to the police to figure out your trick.

250
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,101
I see! He used that breeze

251
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:05,701
to blow away whatever was stuck on the window frame of the bedroom.

252
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:09,501
And created the illusion of someone having fled from the bedroom!

253
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,301
Are you nuts?

254
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,101
Just think about it!

255
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,401
How could just a mere wind blow something

256
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:19,001
that's pasted onto the frame of the window away leaving no traces behind?

257
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:22,601
Let's say it came off.

258
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:24,001
But are you saying that

259
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:27,801
the thing that blew off vanished with nobody seeing it?

260
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:30,301
Then, how?

261
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:33,801
A thin fishing line was attached to the door.

262
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:37,201
It was rigged to come off when I opened the door.

263
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:41,301
In other words, a cloth of the same color

264
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:43,901
as the curtain on the window frame of the bedroom was attached.

265
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,401
Then that line was pulled through the door

266
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:49,501
and taped onto the window frame of the veranda.

267
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,401
And on the tip of the line

268
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:52,901
that was pulled through a weight was attached,

269
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:55,801
and suspended from the railing of the veranda.

270
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:58,701
When the door is opened and the fishing line comes off,

271
00:14:58,701 --> 00:14:59,901
the cloth that was attached falls

272
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,501
because of the weight attached to the line.

273
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:05,401
This would give the illusion of someone having fled from the veranda.

274
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:07,101
A stupid trick!

275
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:12,101
But the cloth that fell... Wouldn't it be found by someone?

276
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:13,401
Masumi.

277
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:14,701
Masumi?

278
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:17,301
I don't think you saw,

279
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:21,101
but Kokuri had his car parked right below the veranda.

280
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:23,801
His car with a roof that opens and closes, a convertible, that is.

281
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:28,001
The switch for closing and opening the roof

282
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,501
can easily be put on the key if you ask for it.

283
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:35,301
If you keep holding the button of the switch down

284
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,901
and attach it to the weight that is suspending

285
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,601
from the railing of the veranda...

286
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:50,401
Simultaneous to the cloth falling, the roof of the car closes.

287
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:54,101
Just the car that is parked in a strange place is left behind!

288
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,601
By the way, this trick does not work

289
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:00,001
unless he gets me into this room at 9:00 sharp

290
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,801
when the construction stars.

291
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:09,001
That's why the perp set his cell phone to ring a minute before 9:00.

292
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:11,801
Wait!

293
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:13,701
An incoming call.

294
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:15,601
Hello, Mr. Hotta?

295
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,701
Are you Mr. Hotta?

296
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:21,001
I'm sorry. It was a wrong number.

297
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,801
By doing so,

298
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,901
the timing in which the bellboy uses the key

299
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,101
to open the door can be controlled.

300
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:33,101
If the e-mail asking for help was sent by the victim an hour earlier,

301
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:36,001
the victim was probably killed at that time, too.

302
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:38,101
In this country where earthquakes are frequent,

303
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:43,201
it'll not be reasonable to keep the salt trick as if for many hours.

304
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:47,601
If so, it should still be in his car,

305
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:50,201
the heavy weight and cloth that he used for the truck, of course,

306
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:53,801
as well as the murder weapon he used to kill Hotta

307
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:56,201
and clothing splattered with blood.

308
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,101
Yes.

309
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:04,401
The blood splattered clothes are still in the trunk of the car.

310
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:09,301
Together with the knife I used to punish that guy

311
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:12,201
who dared to expose my younger sister's corpse to public view.

312
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,501
Your younger sister's corpse?

313
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,101
Several years ago,

314
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,101
my younger sister killed herself on a certain mountain.

315
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:22,001
A death note saying that she hung herself

316
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,801
after going through the shock of a heartbreak.

317
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:28,601
But no matter how hard I looked, I couldn't find her corpse.

318
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,101
And yet!

319
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:32,001
On a TV program,

320
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,001
Gaito Hotta declared that on a certain mountain

321
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:38,601
he smelled death of a different person from the one he was searching for

322
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,401
and discovered the corpse of my younger sister

323
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,601
that was buried under the soil.

324
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,701
Do you see what I'm getting at?

325
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:48,801
Despite having found my younger sister who hung herself,

326
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,601
that guy buried her in the soil

327
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:53,201
without even reporting to the police!

328
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:54,301
He put on this performance

329
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:57,201
just to show what spiritual powers he possessed!

330
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,201
That's why I...

331
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,801
Gosh!

332
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,001
She went back to the room next door.

333
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:14,001
Okay. Let's hear the rest of what you have to say at the station.

334
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,301
Not yet.

335
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,101
I've got to tell her.

336
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:20,001
I've got to go report to my sister's grave

337
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:24,501
that I punished the man who put her death to shame.

338
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,901
Hey!

339
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,001
Hey!

340
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,901
Crap! In the next room, there's...

341
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:40,101
Who are you?

342
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,901
Gosh!

343
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:49,301
Move out of my way!

344
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,501
Is he dead?

345
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:03,001
No. She accurately hit his vitals and struck him out cold.

346
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,201
In the few seconds that it took me to get here

347
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:09,701
with the speed comparable to that of the secret service...

348
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:12,801
The one who did this is... is without doubt...

349
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,401
The untouchable...

350
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,801
Mom!

351
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,901
No. Are you okay, Conan?

352
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,501
Yeah.

353
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,901
Mom?

354
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,001
Well, it's you all right, Mom.

355
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:37,201
To be able to use Conan's bowtie device right on the spot!

356
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:41,701
Yeah. There was a mark on the dial, you see.

357
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:45,501
He was probably using the voice of that detective a lot.

358
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,201
How amazing though...

359
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,901
that the voice of so many different people can be mimicked

360
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:52,501
with such easy manipulation.

361
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:55,901
I was able to imagine using it in a variety of situations.

362
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,901
It's so exciting.

363
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,501
I guess so.

364
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,001
You don't look all that excited, though.

365
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,301
And?

366
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:10,201
Did you find out what information Hotta got a hold of?

367
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,201
Yeah.

368
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:14,801
Just before being taken to the polite man called Kokuri was saying

369
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:18,101
that somebody saw the bodyguard Asaka who disappeared,

370
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:21,401
with the hand mirror.

371
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:25,501
It seems that Hotta found out that Asaka was a woman.

372
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:28,101
He was going to summon the spirit of Koji Haneda

373
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:33,901
and make him scream, "It's a woman! I'm going to be killed by a woman!"

374
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,701
So, that's it? Trash!

375
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,801
More importantly, start packing.

376
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,201
We're moving out.

377
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:41,601
What? Already?

378
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:42,801
I was thinking how lucky I was

379
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:45,901
that I could finally tell Conan what hotel I was staying at, and then...

380
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,101
No one knows Conan's true identity.

381
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,701
Always keep on your guard when around Conan Edogawa.

382
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:59,401
He's a totally different person from the boy we met 10 years ago.

383
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:00,901
Okay.

384
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:26,501
Asaka's a bodyguard and a woman.

385
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:31,001
If that person is the number 2 of the Black Organization, Rum...

386
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:34,601
Then maybe the one that Ai referred to as an effeminate man

387
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:39,301
is a woman, but one who is as strong as a man inside.

388
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:42,401
If that person was a bodyguard 17 years ago,

389
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:45,301
I'm sure he or she is quite aged by now.

390
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:50,701
If like me, that person's age rewound to being in intermediate school,

391
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,501
the most likely one would be...

392
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:56,501
The woman that Masumi referred to as Mom.

393
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,501
I wonder who she is?

394
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,001
Come to think of it, boss...

395
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,101
It seems he croaked Gaito Hotta,

396
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:13,101
the one who was snooping around about the murder of Koji Haneda.

397
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:19,201
I could care less about the job that Rum goofed on 17 years ago.

398
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:22,801
What bothers me more is the Sleeping Kogoro.

399
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:28,801
It seems that he was involved in solving that case this morning, too.

400
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,901
It's not clear what his true identity is

401
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:35,001
but if he's someone deemed to be of danger to us,

402
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,801
we've got to kill him while he's asleep.

403
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,701
"Next Episode"

404
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:47,001
Call the police!

405
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,601
What? You let it go?

406
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:52,501
You idiot! You don't have to come!

407
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:53,801
Madam...

408
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:00,001
My, what's this party for?

409
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:04,001
Who of the three murdered Naoko?

410
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:07,801
So, that's the story after all!

411
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:13,801
Next Conan, "A Foul-Mouthed Myna Bird"
