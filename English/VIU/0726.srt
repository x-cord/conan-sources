1
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:08,198
Dad.

2
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:10,198
Are you sure this is the right road?

3
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:11,198
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,698
Don't tell me you're lost?

5
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:18,098
Shut up. Rural roads are too dark to begin with!

6
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:21,898
Dad! In front!

7
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:31,098
Gosh! Who parked in a place like this?

8
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,298
I'll get the guy!

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,598
Come on, Dad. Cut it out.

10
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:36,398
Pops, over there!

11
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:46,298
No good, she's dead.

12
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:50,698
This is...

13
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,198
A dying message?

14
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:09,898
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

15
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:11,598
are slashed by the light of deduction.

16
00:01:11,598 --> 00:01:13,098
An unexpected reaction to text mail

17
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:15,398
disclose the full picture of the alibi trick.

18
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:16,898
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:18,798
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:21,498
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,040
"The Mail of Happiness Brings Misfortune"

22
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,540
The victim is Ms. Nana Hirose, age 27.

23
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,540
She is an insurance lady who lives nearby.

24
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,340
It seems that she was attacked

25
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,740
when she dropped by after work in this park.

26
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,840
The cause of death is strangulation of the carotid artery.

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,540
The perp seems to have choked her many times

28
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,740
to make sure she died.

29
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,140
She had many strangulation marks on her neck, you see.

30
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,440
And what was the estimate time of death?

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Between 22:00 and 22:30.

32
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,440
It was just slightly earlier than when we arrived here.

33
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,340
Are you sure you didn't witness anything?

34
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,640
No, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,440
If we witnessed anything, we would've told you long ago.

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,940
I guess so. But no need to worry.

37
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,040
The victim made sure she wrote a dying message, you see!

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,940
The perp is someone whose name begins with

39
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,040
the katakana character "na".

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,040
Come to think of it, the name of the victim

41
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,240
is also "nana" written in Katakana.

42
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,140
I get it! The perp is herself!

43
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,740
In other words, she committed suicide!

44
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm sure the victim had a dual personality.

45
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,940
But there's something strange about it.

46
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,140
Besides, this smell...

47
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,140
No, Conan. Don't go near the corpse.

48
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,440
There's a strange smell coming from this lady's clothes.

49
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,340
What?

50
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,440
True.

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,740
It smells like gunpowder.

52
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,040
Why don't you have forensics check on it?

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,540
I was just thinking that.

54
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,840
Huh? Her hair's wet

55
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,540
and a bit of her make-up has come off.

56
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,240
I was just about to check on that, too.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,940
Nana!

58
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,640
Nana! Please let me go!

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,140
Nana!

60
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,040
-Who is it? -I wonder.

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,540
He looks to be an acquaintance of the victim, though.

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,540
"Osamu Samon (27)" -I'm Osamu Samon.

63
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,640
I'm an elementary school teacher and teach Japanese.

64
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,840
And what is your connection with the victim Ms. Hirose?

65
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,540
Yes.

66
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,940
She and I were engaged.

67
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,440
I see.

68
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,140
Then, do you know if there were any changes

69
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,640
that you noticed about Ms. Hirose?

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,440
The thing is, I was supposed to have dinner with Nana tonight,

71
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,340
but I got this text mail from Nana.

72
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,940
"I'm going to be a bit late.

73
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm going to be seeing Migita at the park. Nana."

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Mail receipt is at 21:45.

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,840
A little before her estimated time of death.

76
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Who's this "Migita" person?

77
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,140
The man who was going with Nana before me.

78
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,440
Migita was trying to get Nana back

79
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,740
and persistently bugging her.

80
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,340
That's why... maybe...

81
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,940
I see! I get it!

82
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Mr. Samon.

83
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,540
The name Migita, is it written "migi" meaning right,

84
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
as in right and "hidari" left?

85
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,040
Then followed by the next kanji character, "ta" meaning field?

86
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,440
Yes, that's correct.

87
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,940
In other words,

88
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,040
the victim did not write the katakana character "na".

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Rather, she tried to write the kanji character "migi"

90
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,940
but died before doing so.

91
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,240
I see! Just as would be expected of you, Mr. Mouri!

92
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,240
At any rate, let's go to Migita's place.

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,440
Please let me go with you.

94
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,240
No, but...

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,340
Please. No matter how small,

96
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,140
I'd like to help out with the investigation.

97
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,940
I've got no choice.

98
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,240
Promise me that you won't get in the way of the investigation, then.

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,840
I understand.

100
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Are they your students?

101
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
That's right.

102
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,740
They held a wedding party for me today.

103
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,640
What good students.

104
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,940
Yes.

105
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,040
I don't know what to say to them, too.

106
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,940
Did you notice?

107
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,040
That's correct.

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,740
My name is written "Samon" in kanji.

109
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,240
So, it also could be a part of the dying message.

110
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Yes, of course, I've already noticed that

111
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,240
you could be a suspect, too.

112
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,940
"Migita Bookstore"

113
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,340
Huh?

114
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,540
"Toshihiko Migita (32), Bookstore Owner" -Nana was killed?

115
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,840
Is that true?

116
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,240
Yes, at the park that she was scheduled to see you at tonight.

117
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
Cut out the joke!

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,040
I wasn't scheduled to see her at all!

119
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,140
But, what's with this mail?

120
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,140
I have no idea.

121
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,840
She probably used it as an excuse

122
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
to go see another man or something.

123
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
That's not the only thing.

124
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,840
The victim left behind a dying message.

125
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,640
The victim tried to write your name Mr. Migita

126
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,740
and died in the process.

127
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,840
No, it's doesn't necessarily have to be so.

128
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,340
Maybe it's true that Nana tried to write the character "migi".

129
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,240
But it could be "na" written in katakana

130
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
or the kanji character "dai"

131
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,340
or it could even be "inu".

132
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,540
-True. -Right, right.

133
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,640
Even if you were to try to write his name "Samon",

134
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,040
it would turn out this way, wouldn't it?

135
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,840
Oh my, true.

136
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,040
In the first place,

137
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,640
it was impossible for me to commit the crime.

138
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,340
Because I've got a perfect alibi.

139
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,440
I was working all night here.

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,640
I'm sure I can prove that using the surveillance camera.

141
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,140
I think it's right around here.

142
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,540
I'm glad I had it installed.

143
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,640
It's true that he's displayed on the surveillance camera right through.

144
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,140
He's gone!

145
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,240
But he came back right away.

146
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,440
I mean, I gotta go to the john too, you know.

147
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,240
I mean, that brings on confusion.

148
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,340
I see.

149
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,240
So, the only time you, Mr. Migita, went out of view of the camera

150
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,440
was when you went to the restroom.

151
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,740
From here to the site of the crime,

152
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,440
even if you were to go by car, it would take about 2 hours round trip.

153
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,640
It would have been impossible for him to commit the crime.

154
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,240
So now you know.

155
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,640
I have a perfect alibi, you see.

156
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,240
It's true that at first glance, it looks to be a perfect alibi,

157
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,540
but what happened a while ago?

158
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,140
I see.

159
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,740
So, the perp is you, Mr. Samon!

160
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,440
Why?

161
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,340
There's no reason for me killing Nana, is there?

162
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,540
To begin with, I didn't even get to see Nana today!

163
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,740
Then, do you have an alibi?

164
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,140
Well...

165
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,740
It's possible that you made that mail up

166
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,140
to frame Mr. Migita, too.

167
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,640
No way.

168
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,340
No. The dying message points to Mr. Migita.

169
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,240
Besides, that image...

170
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
But just that, wouldn't serve as evidence.

171
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,040
What's this?

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,623
This is maybe...

173
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:26,919
"Migita Bookstore"

174
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,519
Anyway, we'll get the details from you at the station.

175
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,819
Why? I didn't do it.

176
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:37,219
Yes, yes, all perps say that!

177
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,919
No, I...

178
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,019
Let's go, let's.

179
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,419
No...

180
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,319
Oh, my...

181
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:52,319
Don't tell me that...

182
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,219
You've become the Sleeping Kogoro!

183
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,819
Dad?

184
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:59,519
The person that the dying message of the victim is pointing to

185
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,719
is not Mr. Samon.

186
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:04,319
Mr. Migita, it's you.

187
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,819
How can you say something like that?

188
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:09,819
Mr. Mouri.

189
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:11,019
It's true that it's hard to tell

190
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,419
whether the perp wanted to write "migi" or "hidari".

191
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:16,119
The thing is you can tell...

192
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:19,019
-Hey, Conan. -Yes.

193
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,319
Mr. Samon, this.

194
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:24,919
You're an Elementary School teacher, aren't you?

195
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,319
Will you please write the character "migi" here

196
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,919
so that everyone can see?

197
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,119
Yeah.

198
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,719
So the character "migi" is written in the stroke order

199
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:39,319
of the first tapered part "no" followed by the horizontal line.

200
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,519
Please look at the part where the tapered line

201
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
and the horizontal line intersects.

202
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,719
It is obvious that

203
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:52,319
horizontal line was written after the tapered line.

204
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:55,319
That's true.

205
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,419
It is neither the katakana character "na" nor "hidari".

206
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,219
The way the character is written, the stroke order shows that

207
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,519
it is written in this order only when writing the character "migi".

208
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,619
Only that can't possibly serve as proof.

209
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:07,619
Besides, did you forget?

210
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:10,019
I've got a perfect alibi.

211
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,519
That's right.

212
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,019
Mr. Migita was displayed on the surveillance camera right through.

213
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,919
It's true he was there

214
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,419
while the surveillance camera was operating.

215
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:19,919
What?

216
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,819
Right. We all have the stereotyped idea

217
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:27,519
that a surveillance camera is continuously operating.

218
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,519
Mr. Migita used this to his advantage.

219
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,119
Back then, when you said you went off to use the restroom,

220
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,719
you switched off the surveillance camera.

221
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,319
Then, you went to the scene of the crime

222
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:43,419
in 10 minutes on your scooter

223
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:45,819
and killed Nana.

224
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:52,819
Mr. Migita then returns in 10 minutes

225
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:56,619
and switches the surveillance camera back on,

226
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:59,619
sitting within the visual range of the camera.

227
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,019
In that way,

228
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:06,119
you actually made the image look to be one continuous take

229
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,919
although you were gone for more than 20 minutes.

230
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,919
The surveillance camera of this store

231
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,819
is the type that doesn't display time.

232
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:17,019
So, it would be easy to make up a story.

233
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:19,519
Then, it was you after all who...

234
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,619
Where's the proof?

235
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:24,619
Where's the proof to support that I did something like that?

236
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:27,919
It's all right. Please come in.

237
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,619
He's a student who lives nearby.

238
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:37,419
Please tell us what you witnessed.

239
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:38,519
Yes, sir.

240
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,219
It was around 22:30.

241
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,119
The program that I wanted to watch was about to start,

242
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,719
so I was about to switch on the TV.

243
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:46,519
Then...

244
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,719
I see. It's true that it was 22:30 tonight.

245
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,719
It was probably somebody driving under the influence of alcohol.

246
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,419
I'm sure we can find it if we look around this vicinity.

247
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:10,619
It's a white car with a broke headlight.

248
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,719
I'm sure that there was a pretty loud noise

249
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,419
echoing through inside the store, too.

250
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,619
However, in the image we just saw,

251
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:19,419
there was no part where you seemed to notice anything.

252
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,019
Why?

253
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,219
Because the scene from that time span is missing.

254
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,019
22:30 is the time when the crime was committed.

255
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,119
Mr. Migita, you weren't in this store at that time.

256
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:34,919
Darn it!

257
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,619
I thought I totally deceived everyone and yet...

258
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,419
It's your hair!

259
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,719
My hair?

260
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:43,919
Your naturally curly hair that you had

261
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,819
until you left to go to the restroom,

262
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,419
when you came back was flattened out.

263
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:53,219
Just as if you had worn a helmet or something.

264
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,719
When I saw that,

265
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:58,019
I realized what your trick was about.

266
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,519
She... Nana's to blame.

267
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,519
"I'm happy." -She kept sending me images like this

268
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,619
"I got engaged." -to get on my nerves.

269
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,119
Darn it!

270
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,019
Moreover, that woman had the nerve to say

271
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,219
she didn't do anything like that.

272
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,619
She dare made fun of me!

273
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:28,419
Just as I thought. The rest is...

274
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:31,719
Yes?

275
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:35,019
Huh? Gunpowder residue?

276
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,319
It's okay, okay already,

277
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:39,119
because we've already arrested the perp.

278
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,919
Good work.

279
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,319
Maybe gunpowder residue

280
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,319
was detected on the clothing of the corpse?

281
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,619
Huh? I'm amazed, you know!

282
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:50,519
Okay! Everything fit in now.

283
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,619
Are you talking about

284
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,919
the thing that is detected when a gun is fired?

285
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,819
-Yes. -Hey! I didn't use a gun!

286
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:59,619
I know,

287
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:02,219
because the victim's cause of death was strangulation.

288
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:05,719
But why was there gunpowder residue on her?

289
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,119
It must be some kind of mistake.

290
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,819
I don't think it has anything to do with the case.

291
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:14,119
Oh, well.

292
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,519
Okay, Mr. Migita, let's go to the station.

293
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,319
Wait a minute, please.

294
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,419
The case isn't over yet.

295
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:23,219
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

296
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:25,419
The perp is right here.

297
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,519
Yes, of course Mr. Migita is the perp

298
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,819
that is for allegedly trying to kill Nana, right?

299
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,919
Alleged homicide?

300
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,819
-Then... -Yeah.

301
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,719
The real perp is another person!

302
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,019
Huh?

303
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,319
The real perp who killed Ms. Nana Hirose is...

304
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:43,619
That is...

305
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:46,919
Mr. Osamu Samon, you, is it not?

306
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:52,119
Detective. I'm not trying to protect him or anything,

307
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,719
but I killed Nana with my very hands.

308
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,019
Right!

309
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,619
Besides, the stroke order of the dying message

310
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,819
points to Mr. Migita, didn't you say?

311
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,219
The stroke order is the very thing that is indicating

312
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:07,519
that the one who wrote the dying message is not Nana,

313
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,319
-but Mr. Samon. -What?

314
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,919
First, for that dying message...

315
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,519
It's unthinkable that Nana would've written it.

316
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,819
As far as I've read her mails,

317
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:23,519
she always wrote Mr. Migita's name in katakana characters.

318
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,819
So, I wonder if she, at the verge of dying

319
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,919
would suddenly write his name in kanji characters.

320
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,919
I see. It is unnatural.

321
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,719
But even so, you can't say that I wrote it.

322
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:39,519
No. The possibility that you did is extremely high!

323
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,819
What?

324
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:42,419
Please recall the stroke order

325
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,719
of when Mr. Migita wrote the kanji character "migi"

326
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:50,219
and the stroke order of when Mr. Samon who is a teacher,

327
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:53,319
wrote the word.

328
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,619
But I know what I did...

329
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:58,119
Let me give you an orderly explanation.

330
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,019
First of all, Mr. Samon's plan was

331
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,219
to keep sending Mr. Migita obnoxious mails

332
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:05,219
from Nana's smart phone to start with.

333
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,519
Mr. Samon, who was aware of Mr. Migita's personality,

334
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,719
and his distorted love for her worked it out

335
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:16,519
so that Mr. Migita would attempt to kill her.

336
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,719
How unpleasant.

337
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,119
How can you say something like that?

338
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,019
The writing style.

339
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,519
The writing style?

340
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,119
In the mail that Nana herself had written,

341
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,719
there are no punctuation marks,

342
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:34,519
and at the end of the mail, she always inserts her name "Nana."

343
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,419
But in the mail that was written to get Mr. Migita angry

344
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:38,719
there were punctuation marks,

345
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,219
but no signature "Nana."

346
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:44,119
The writing style that a person usually uses

347
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,319
cannot be changed that easily.

348
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,019
Just like a person's stroke order.

349
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:52,219
It's apparent that someone else wrote it.

350
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:55,719
And the plan actually worked out.

351
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,419
As you had figured out it to be,

352
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,219
Mr. Migita who was angered with the hate

353
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:03,219
that built up inside of him, killed her.

354
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,519
At the park you went to confirm the chain of events,

355
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,119
when you found Nana lying on the ground,

356
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,519
I'm sure that you were convinced

357
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,419
that your scheme worked out.

358
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,319
However, something you didn't expect happened.

359
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,519
When Mr. Migita left the crime scene,

360
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,219
she was probably still just in a temporary state of apparent death.

361
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:25,919
Nana revived.

362
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,319
Back then, Nana in order to wash the soil off her face,

363
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,519
washed her face using the water from the faucet.

364
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,019
The face of the corpse was wet

365
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,919
and her make-up was removed because of this.

366
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,719
Then, immediately afterwards, she was finished off

367
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,919
by you.

368
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,119
Furthermore, you used the finger of the corpse

369
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,019
and tried to write the word "Migita" on the ground.

370
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,519
However, while you were in the process,

371
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,719
you noticed us approaching

372
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:54,619
and had no choice but to leave the scene.

373
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,719
This is the truth of what happened.

374
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:02,919
It's true that everything falls into place,

375
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,319
but all you mentioned is circumstantial evidence.

376
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,119
You have no concrete evidence.

377
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,019
I've got concrete proof.

378
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:10,219
Huh?

379
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:14,019
The gunpowder residue that was found on the clothes of the corpse.

380
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,919
Gunpowder residue?

381
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,819
Why was gunpowder residue found at the site

382
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:21,219
when no gun was used?

383
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:25,119
The answer was found in the image inside your smart phone.

384
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,819
Just what do you mean?

385
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:29,919
In the image you were being congratulated

386
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
with a lot of party crackers.

387
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,619
As you can tell from what sounds to be the sound of gun fire,

388
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:39,019
the party crackers leave gunpowder residue behind when used.

389
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:42,419
And this gunpowder residue that was left on your clothes back then

390
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,419
also ended up being on Nana's clothes

391
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:47,619
when you strangled her to death.

392
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,919
I'm sure that investigation will show

393
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,119
that the same gunpowder residue that was on her clothes,

394
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,019
would also be found on your clothes, too.

395
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:59,719
Can you explain this?

396
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,919
Why would the same gunpowder residue be found

397
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:02,619
on both your clothes and Nana's

398
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:05,519
when you didn't even see her?

399
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:10,219
How ironic.

400
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,419
To think that the children congratulating me

401
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,619
would serve as proof...

402
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:17,519
But, why did you kill Nana?

403
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,319
You two looked so happy together.

404
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,719
Your motive was that Nana had called off the engagement, no?

405
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,319
How do you know?

406
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,119
The ring.

407
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,619
You're wearing an engagement

408
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,619
on the middle finger of your right hand.

409
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,419
But there was no ring on Nana's finger.

410
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,519
That's when I realized

411
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,019
that your feelings for her were just a one-sided thing.

412
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,319
I couldn't take it.

413
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,519
As long as Nana was alive,

414
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,319
I would continue to keep feeling miserable.

415
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:54,219
I just couldn't bear the thought.

416
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:23,619
I hope we're really supposed to take a right here?

417
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,819
I think so.

418
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,719
If you say so, I'm sure we should go left.

419
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:28,819
How rude!

420
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:31,119
It's a right, go right! It's definitely a right!

421
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,519
No, it's a left. Definitely a left, left it is.

422
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,119
-Go right! -A left!

423
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,819
Who cares which way it is.

424
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,519
I just want to get home quickly.

425
