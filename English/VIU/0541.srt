1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:02,753
My name's Kogoro Mouri,

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,353
a famed renowned detective no need for mentioning.

3
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:06,953
The request this time was for me to find an eye-witness

4
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:09,153
to prove Mr. Gamo's alibi,

5
00:00:09,153 --> 00:00:12,553
since he was a suspect of murder.

6
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:16,553
The investigation was tougher than first expected,

7
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:20,053
and Mr. Gamo called every night demanding results.

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,153
I'm doomed.

9
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:26,753
The following morning, Mr. Gamo was found dead.

10
00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:28,253
Five years ago,

11
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,753
Mr. Gamo experienced being mistakenly arrested.

12
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:34,353
Afraid of having to go through the same thing once again,

13
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:36,653
we first thought that he committed suicide.

14
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,053
But, my eyes could not be deceived.

15
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:42,353
This is a homicide made to look like suicide.

16
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:44,953
The officer that mistakenly arrested Mr. Gamo.

17
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:47,853
"Isao Takeoka (40)" -was my old colleague, Takeoka.

18
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:50,953
After coincidentally running into Takeoka

19
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:53,453
who had quit the forces feeling responsible for his mistake

20
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,453
and decided to investigate the case together.

21
00:00:56,453 --> 00:01:00,453
The suspicious one is Mr. Gamo's nephew, Kyosuke Arai.

22
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:01,853
I'm sure that he's the culprit

23
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,153
because he was in debt

24
00:01:04,153 --> 00:01:06,053
and had an argument with Mr. Gamo.

25
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:10,453
However, Arai committed suicide.

26
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:11,953
Soon afterwards,

27
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:14,753
a witness proving his alibi appears.

28
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:16,953
Arai wasn't the culprit.

29
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:22,453
And yet I cornered him and lead him to death.

30
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:23,653
I'm going to bring down

31
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:26,553
the sign of the detective agency from today on.

32
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:29,753
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

33
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:32,153
Saturday nights are for mystery.

34
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:34,453
Is this the last case for the famed, renowned Detective Kogoro?

35
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:36,653
The real culprit is one who betrays all expectations.

36
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:38,253
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:40,053
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:41,853
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:26,878
"The Day Detective Kogoro Mouri Goes Out of Business (Part 2)"

40
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,778
"Mouri Detective Agency."

41
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:36,718
He's totally depressed.

42
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:40,918
But, are you sure that Mr. Kyosuke Arai wasn't the culprit?

43
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:44,518
The woman who lived next to him testified

44
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:46,118
that at around 8 pm,

45
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,318
when she was about to turn on the TV.

46
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,118
Time Machine?

47
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:52,418
The readers will never go for something like that.

48
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:55,518
She looked inside next door wanting to complain,

49
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:58,018
and saw him with a FAX sheet that just came in

50
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:00,918
shouting at the top of his lungs.

51
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:04,218
Mr. Arai was in charge of inserting pictures

52
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:06,318
in a serial detective novel.

53
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,918
And he was told that the culprit would be using a time machine

54
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:10,018
to carry out an alibi trick.

55
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:13,518
I guess it's true that readers would never go for something like that.

56
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:16,018
It takes at least 30 minutes by car

57
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:18,418
from Mr. Arai's condo to Mr. Gamo's residence.

58
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,818
And an additional hour is needed to get from the Gamo residence

59
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:22,618
to the site where the corpse was found.

60
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:24,618
He could've never made in time for the estimated time of death

61
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:27,218
which is between 7 pm to 9 pm.

62
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:30,018
So, it's impossible after all.

63
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:33,918
If his next door neighbor heard his voice after 8 pm,

64
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,618
Mr. Arai could've done it.

65
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:41,118
Because if he killed Mr. Gamo in the woods at 7 pm,

66
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:43,518
he could've returned to his room by 8:30 pm.

67
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,518
That's not possible.

68
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:50,118
Because Mr. Gamo called Mr. Mouri at 8 pm from his home.

69
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:51,718
What if he faked his tone of voice?

70
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:53,118
Wrong.

71
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,918
The call I received didn't sound like

72
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,118
a different tone of voice.

73
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:04,118
But, Mr. Gamo had a very hoarse voice, didn't he?

74
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:05,418
So, I don't think you could tell the difference

75
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:08,018
if someone tried to mimic him?

76
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:11,118
I would never mistake the voice of my client for someone else.

77
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:12,118
But...

78
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:15,718
Shut up! I've been making a living as a detective for ten years!

79
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,518
I wonder who the real culprit X of this case is.

80
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:29,618
What? The real culprit?

81
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:31,118
"X"?

82
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,818
The real culprit who killed both Mr. Gamo

83
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:34,018
and Mr. Arai making it look

84
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,718
as if they committed suicide.

85
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:40,118
If his next door neighbor didn't testify for him,

86
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:41,618
we would've also suspected.

87
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:44,518
Mr. Arai as being the one who killed Mr. Gamo.

88
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:47,718
The more so, now that he's committed suicide.

89
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,218
That's exactly what X is after.

90
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,618
Mr. Mouri.

91
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,018
We're going to re-investigate this case once more.

92
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,018
Excuse me.

93
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,118
If there's another culprit,

94
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:03,918
dad will not be blamed at all.

95
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,018
You don't have to quit being a detective.

96
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:07,518
Yes.

97
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:11,018
What's this about real culprit X?

98
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:14,818
Dad.

99
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:19,318
He's really critically had it.

100
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:21,418
Geez. There's no other way

101
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:23,618
than for you to give him a slap in the butt, mother.

102
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,118
He's that bad?

103
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,618
"Mouri Detective Agency."

104
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,018
It's all right already, dear.

105
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,918
After all, you've kept going for the past ten years.

106
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,218
I'm sure you're exhausted.

107
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:39,718
Mother.

108
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:44,518
Kogoro!

109
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,318
Just as you promised,

110
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:49,318
you're mine from today.

111
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:53,718
Dad.

112
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,218
Animal cookies.

113
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,618
Just like old times.

114
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:04,018
Mr. Takeoka came by the other day.

115
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:09,418
He said that it used to be his wife's favorite.

116
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:12,118
By the way, about your dad.

117
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:14,618
Is he going around with women like that recently?

118
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:15,718
No, you've got it all wrong.

119
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,718
She's not what you think.

120
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:19,418
Talk about messed up.

121
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:20,818
Bodyguard.

122
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,518
Getting rid of excess flab.

123
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,118
Keep me company when jogging.

124
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:25,818
Okay, Kogoro?

125
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:29,818
"Mouri..."

126
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:35,118
The only way I can make pops snap back to himself

127
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:38,018
is to make him solve this case himself.

128
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,118
"Saturday, 7 pm, Fugu Taisho, Mr Gamo."

129
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:46,318
Everything began when he got a job request from his client.

130
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:48,918
All you had to do was agree

131
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,718
to taking on the job I asked you to do to start with,

132
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,018
"Sayuri Tokomae (40)" -Kogoro.

133
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:54,418
Yes.

134
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,018
It was bound to turn out this way either way.

135
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,918
She's another one that would benefit

136
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,318
from Mr. Ryozo Gamo disappearing from this world.

137
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,618
This is so much fun.

138
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,518
Hey.

139
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:11,618
Could it be that they want to shut me up

140
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,418
because I've realized the truth.

141
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:21,418
It's this trio.

142
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,518
They've been after my jewelry for sometime.

143
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:27,818
Excessive? Excessive self-defense?

144
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:29,718
Just what do you mean?

145
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,918
All he did was beat up the thieves.

146
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,818
-Why? What's the meaning of this? -Yes...

147
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,618
Yes, it sure was a surprise to hear he committed suicide.

148
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,918
There was nothing abnormal in his exam results and yet...

149
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,218
that Ryozo Gamo.

150
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:45,818
Are you talking about Mr. Ryozo Gamo?

151
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,418
Yes. I just happened to run into him here

152
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:51,418
during my physical exam, about ten days ago.

153
00:08:51,418 --> 00:08:53,918
It was last Sunday.

154
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:56,118
Last week Sunday?

155
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,818
I got the job the day before,

156
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,718
on Saturday night.

157
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:02,618
Did he go through a barium test back then too?

158
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,518
Yes, he seems to have refrained from drinking

159
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:06,818
or eating anything from sundown the day before,

160
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:07,918
and there was no problem.

161
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:12,118
But, back then at night Mr. Gamo...

162
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:14,618
It doesn't connect.

163
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:16,718
Come to think of it, that brat...

164
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:18,818
What if he faked his tone of voice?

165
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,518
It can't be...

166
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,718
But, if I piece them together that way...

167
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:25,218
"Saturday, 7 pm, Fugu Taisho, Mr Gamo."

168
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:27,218
Wait a second.

169
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:29,918
I would never mistake the voice of my client for someone else.

170
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:32,518
I got it.

171
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:34,818
Conan.

172
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,718
I guess I cannot resign my job as a detective.

173
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:44,218
Moreover I'm not tired!

174
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:51,318
What brings you here?

175
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:53,318
Maybe we just get along?

176
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:54,418
No darn way.

177
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:57,718
Maybe pops also.

178
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:59,218
Although he used to patronize this shop,

179
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:02,618
Mr. Gamo's a fairly new customer.

180
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:05,418
He first came here about half a month

181
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:08,118
before he came here together with Mr. Mouri.

182
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:10,318
About a half month ago.

183
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,918
About two weeks.

184
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:14,318
About a half a month ago, I think.

185
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:17,518
No doubt about it.

186
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:21,218
Pops has also realized the method used by the real culprit X.

187
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:28,918
There are many prints from from the same shoes.

188
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:30,018
The bath tub.

189
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:35,318
He was hiding here every night waiting for a chance to come by.

190
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:37,218
Most probably.

191
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:41,218
But, just how do you intend to prove your point, famed detective?

192
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:56,518
"Haraiso Finance."

193
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:58,818
A recording of Mr. Gamo's voice?

194
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:00,618
A speech to his employees or anything for that matter,

195
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,218
as long as I can hear his voice.

196
00:11:03,218 --> 00:11:05,618
"Reiji Tsuchida (43)" -What about the answer phone at is residence?

197
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:09,118
This is Gamo. I cannot come to the phone right now.

198
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,418
You know, since he recorded his own voice.

199
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:12,618
Make the call.

200
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:14,318
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:17,518
"Speaker"

202
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:20,018
I cannot come to the phone right now.

203
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:22,518
Please leave your message after the beep.

204
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:25,818
I wonder when it was changed.

205
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,118
He erased it.

206
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:28,718
Someone is beating us over here.

207
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:30,418
Isn't there anything else?

208
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:33,818
Well... come to think of it,

209
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:38,118
there should be a video tape of last year's New Year's party.

210
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:41,518
-Here it is. -Show it to me.

211
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:44,518
There are no cameras or video deck here.

212
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:46,418
-None? -No.

213
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:49,618
Look for an electric shop or a camera shop.

214
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:50,718
You go over there.

215
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:51,718
Okay.

216
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:08,118
Pops, I found one over that way!

217
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,418
Are you okay, pops?

218
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,618
Who the heck...

219
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:15,618
The tape's gone! It's been stolen!

220
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:19,918
It could've served as conclusive evidence and yet!

221
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:23,018
Darn!

222
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:24,018
Right.

223
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:25,818
Smiley sweet black bean bun!

224
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:27,518
Talking about an afternoon snack at a time like this?

225
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:30,618
No, Mr. Gamo complained, didn't he?

226
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,318
I see.

227
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,418
"Nikoniko Bread Co. Ltd" -We've got to record the conversation

228
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:37,118
to avoid trouble in the future you see.

229
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:41,618
Just as I thought.

230
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:43,018
Bull's eye.

231
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,718
I've figured out the method,

232
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,618
but who the heck is he anyway?

233
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:49,118
The guy that framed me as well as killed the two.

234
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:53,518
"Animal Cookies."

235
00:12:54,518 --> 00:12:55,818
It can't be...

236
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:59,718
"Josai Police Station" -About the case five years ago?

237
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:02,118
Like I already said a few days ago.

238
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:05,018
Mr. Sakae Kinugasa was attacked by someone

239
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,718
on his way home.

240
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:09,118
Fortunately it was not fatal.

241
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:12,618
The culprit fled on a car that he had waiting for him.

242
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:15,718
However, there was a woman who just happened to pass by

243
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,718
and saw him being ambushed and attacked.

244
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:22,118
It's him.

245
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,018
The one who was driving the car

246
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:27,818
was a man in his mid-thirties with long hair.

247
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:31,318
Gamo is helping his nephew out giving him living expenses.

248
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:34,418
His name is Kyosuke Arai, an artist with long hair.

249
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:36,018
Although he was told that motive

250
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:38,518
and an eye-witness report were too weak to convict someone,

251
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,518
he ignored what people told him and went ahead and arrested Gamo.

252
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:43,118
However, a few days later,

253
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:47,318
people proving Gamo's alibi appeared

254
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:49,418
and Takeoka was accused of mistaken arrest.

255
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:54,118
Although it's true that Takeoka got a bit carried away,

256
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:55,418
he didn't have to resign his post.

257
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,418
"Police Detective Hisamoto (50)" -The woman who testified

258
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:00,318
was Takeoka's wife.

259
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:07,618
"Mouri Detective Agency."

260
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,118
Takeoka?

261
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:12,018
It's me, you me, Mouri.

262
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,318
Are you drunk?

263
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,918
Totally wasted.

264
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:21,318
I want to see you tomorrow, is that possible?

265
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,818
Dad so drunk, I wonder if he's okay.

266
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:27,618
He hasn't drunk at all and yet.

267
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:31,718
Well, I guess this is a call he can't make unless he acts drunk.

268
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,610
Do you remember this place?

269
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,610
Of course.

270
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,310
In summer ten years ago,

271
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,810
two couples ran into each other.

272
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,210
Takeoka?

273
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,210
Mouri?

274
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,810
Although we went to and were classmates of the same police academy,

275
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,310
we were too embarrassed to talk about our wives,

276
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,610
and never talked about them.

277
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,210
Back then, we first got to talk to each other's wives.

278
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,710
You got married when you were a student?

279
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,010
Yes, sort of.

280
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,210
We were childhood friends actually,

281
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,110
or rather, ended up stuck with each other.

282
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,110
What do you mean stuck with each other.

283
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,910
We got to know each other in college.

284
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,810
We both belonged to the drama club.

285
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,910
You mean this awkward guy was in the drama club?

286
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,910
Shut up! I used to be pretty keen back then.

287
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,910
It's been ten years already.

288
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,110
We were both young back then.

289
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,510
Are you sure the culprit's going to come here?

290
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,510
That's what pops told me.

291
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,910
Just as I thought, he's having a tough time saying what he wants to.

292
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,610
I guess I'll have to do it, then.

293
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,410
The detective revives.

294
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,110
My prayer's been answered.

295
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,310
I've got to let pops solve this case himself.

296
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,510
About the case we're investigating now...

297
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,210
The culprit, after finding out that Mr. Kinugasa was murdered,

298
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,910
planned everything.

299
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,910
The plan was to kill Mr. Gamo making it look like

300
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,410
he committed suicide,

301
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,410
and setting his nephew, Mr. Arai up as the murderer,

302
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,410
then killing him off too.

303
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,210
But, if the culprit wanted to make it look like Gamo committed suicide

304
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,010
and set Kyosuke Arai up as the killer,

305
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,110
why did he have to bring Gamo all the way out to a far place

306
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,810
and make it look like suicide?

307
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,410
To set up an alibi.

308
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,210
At 7 pm, the culprit, drives his own car

309
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,010
and takes Mr. Gamo to the scene of the crime and kills him.

310
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,710
He then hides his car in an abandoned warehouse

311
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,410
near the Gamo residence.

312
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,710
Then at 8 pm, the culprit poses as Mr. Gamo

313
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,410
and gives me a call.

314
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,610
He leaves the Gamo residence in Mr. Gamo's car

315
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,010
and hides the car for the time being in the abandoned warehouse.

316
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,410
He spends time with the person he had arrangements to see beforehand

317
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,510
at 8:30 pm and stayed together until after midnight.

318
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,510
After the meeting,

319
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,110
he goes back to the abandoned warehouse to get Mr. Gamo's car

320
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,910
to move it into the woods.

321
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,410
So long as I'm talking to Mr. Gamo at 8 pm,

322
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,010
Mr. Gamo had to have died after 9 pm.

323
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,410
And the culprit also had an alibi during that time

324
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,710
because he was with someone.

325
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,310
In other words, you're saying that the last call you got from Gamo

326
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,910
was the culprit mimicking his tone of voice?

327
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,810
Right.

328
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,510
But dad said he would never mistake

329
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,510
the voice of his client for someone else.

330
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,810
But, Mouri...

331
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,110
Is it possible to deceive the ears of a former police detective

332
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,010
and private detective such as you?

333
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,910
If it was only that one time, I wouldn't have been deceived.

334
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,210
But the culprit had been repeating his trick from a half a month ago,

335
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,710
in order to deceive me.

336
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,010
From the first time he called.

337
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,510
My name is Ryozo Gamo.

338
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,410
I would like you to find somebody who can testify

339
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,410
that I was at Akebonocho on the day of the crime.

340
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,610
The one who kept calling me every night

341
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,810
asking for results was not the real Gamo.

342
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:12,110
I never ever met or talked to the real Mr. Gamo on the phone.

343
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,510
Isn't that right?

344
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,410
Drama boy back in your younger days, Takeoka.

345
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,510
Mr. Gamo's characteristic appearance

346
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,610
and voice were most convenient to copy, right?

347
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,710
However, since I've known for quite some time,

348
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,810
there was a risk that I would see through your disguise.

349
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,910
That's why you deliberately came late that night

350
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,410
when you came to see me.

351
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,710
He says to give you his apologies,

352
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,410
but to go ahead and start without him.

353
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,110
You wanted to get me drunk and divert my concentration.

354
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,310
-On top of that... -Mr. Gamo,

355
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,710
I hope to be seeing you again soon.

356
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,110
-Mr. Gamo. -I wouldn't doubt you,

357
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,810
being that you virtually convinced

358
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,710
all those around you of being someone else the way you did.

359
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,410
It's only natural that the request made for finding a witness

360
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,510
to prove alibi didn't go well.

361
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,210
Because after all,

362
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,210
the content of the request was fake to begin with.

363
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,110
In order to keep anybody from getting to you

364
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,210
from the telephone records, you...

365
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,210
It's Gamo. You haven't come up with anything yet?

366
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,610
You waited for Mr. Gamo to take a bath

367
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,510
and called me every night on a cordless phone

368
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,910
or something that you secretly set up.

369
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,110
You've seen through everything.

370
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,810
I guess, I was setting up useless tricks.

371
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,110
Running into you at the horse race tracks

372
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,310
wasn't a coincidence either, was it?

373
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,510
No.

374
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,310
Why?

375
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,110
I'm sorry that I used you.

376
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,510
Why'd you kill the two?

377
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,510
Now, after five years have gone by!

378
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,310
My wife... she died last month.

379
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,310
After suffering with an illness for two years.

380
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:58,610
She apologized to me just before she passed away.

381
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,110
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,710
About what?

383
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,310
About five years ago.

384
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,010
I was surprised

385
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,010
that she had been regretting it all along

386
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,110
that her testimony cornered me into resignation.

387
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,910
But, I kept on believing her testimony.

388
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,510
I kept thinking that the witness for Gamo's alibi

389
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,110
was just somebody that he had paid off to testify.

390
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,310
And the day after her funeral,

391
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,110
after finding that Sakae Kinugasa was murdered,

392
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,410
I called Gamo.

393
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,210
Wasn't it you?

394
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,710
Just like you attacked the victim in the dark five years ago.

395
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,410
This time it's wasn't me.

396
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,110
I guess this is what you call the slip of the tongue.

397
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,910
His said, "This time it's wasn't me".

398
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,210
In other words, he did commit the previous crime.

399
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,910
Natsuko's testimony was true.

400
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,710
She spoke the truth,

401
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,110
but I refused to believe her

402
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,710
and she died apologizing to me.

403
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,010
All I wanted to do was clear her feelings of grief.

404
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,210
Mouri, make up with Eri.

405
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,310
Don't be silly, blurting something like that out.

406
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,510
Takeoka!

407
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,310
Mr. Takeoka!

408
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,310
Takeoka!

409
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,010
Takeoka!

410
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,210
Where are you?

411
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,010
-Takeoka! -There he is!

412
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,010
What?

413
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,810
It can't be...

414
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,010
Hold it!

415
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,810
No way!

416
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,810
You're not dying on me.

417
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,510
Live! You're making up for what you did!

418
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,310
I'm not letting you die on me, Takeoka!

419
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,410
Mouri!

420
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,910
Mr. Takeoka!

421
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,210
Mouri.

422
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,710
Takeoka.

423
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,110
Dad, you don't have to put the sign down for real.

424
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,510
Pops.

425
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,910
I always keep my word.

426
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,210
A new one sure is good after all.

427
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,210
You're not quitting being a detective?

428
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,710
I never said anything like that.

429
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,510
True, you only said was that you were going to bring the sign down.

430
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,110
Being a detective is a lonesome job

431
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,810
very usually misunderstood by others.

432
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,410
What's wrong with you? From a while ago.

433
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,110
"Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish."

434
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,110
Mackerel, carp, sea bream and flatfish?

435
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,610
Lipstick.

436
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,110
Somebody for some reason switched the regulator.

437
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,510
By the killer who came back here again.

438
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,910
Next Conan,

439
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:29,910
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 1)"

440
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:43,889
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:45,689
"Fish names".

442
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:47,589
Eels, eels over rice, eel cookies,

443
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:49,089
grilled eels, eel porridge, and eel soup.

444
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:50,789
They're all different types of eel dishes.
