1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:05,358
Dr. Agasa and Haibara go to introduce Doc's invention.

2
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:08,258
On their way back, Doc's car breaks down

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,558
and what's more he loses his wallet

4
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:12,958
so he can't even get on the bus.

5
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:17,858
Fortunately, they got a lift from a car that happened to pass by.

6
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:20,158
But there were bullet holes inside

7
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:22,258
and traces of where blood had been wiped away.

8
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:25,758
There was also a gun in the glove compartment.

9
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:27,558
The people in the car tell them that they are headed for

10
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:30,458
the Mouri Detective Agency. Who are these people?

11
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:34,258
I hope they're not from the Black Organization.

12
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:36,358
After getting Haibara's call...

13
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:40,258
I headed toward the drive-in diner where the four of them were.

14
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:43,158
The suspicious twosome

15
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:46,058
are Inspector Kansuke Yamato and Officer Yui Uehara

16
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:48,758
from the Nagano Prefectural Police Department.

17
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,058
Talk about worrying for nothing.

18
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:55,958
But what on earth did the two come here for?

19
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,158
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

20
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:01,758
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

21
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,958
A new character from Nagano, Inspector Koume.

22
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,858
Together we'll unravel the mystery of the Red Wall!

23
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,558
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:09,258
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:12,058
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:53,937
"Mouri Detective Agency."

27
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:55,346
And?

28
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:57,546
Did anything happen in Nagano?

29
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:59,346
You couldn't have come all the way out here

30
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,146
just to deliver us the Bota Mochi, right?

31
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,046
Oh, the fact is...

32
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:05,446
We can't solve it, you see...

33
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,446
So, we came to ask you for help.

34
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:10,446
We can't seem to solve

35
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:13,246
the mystery about the blood smeared "Red Wall."

36
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:19,946
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Three Favors)"

37
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:30,446
Isn't there a better road to drive on?

38
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:33,146
After all, I, Kogoro Mouri, the famed detective

39
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:37,746
has come to offer you a hand immediately

40
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:40,946
regarding the murder case, don't you think?

41
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:44,346
Thanks to you, I didn't get to eat the Bota Mochi either.

42
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:46,046
I'm so sorry.

43
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:47,846
This road is the shortcut.

44
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:50,746
And? Isn't it about time you tell us

45
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:54,046
about the mystery of the blood smeared red wall?

46
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,846
Don't tell me that there's a place somewhere in the forest

47
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:58,846
where the walls are painted red with human blood?

48
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,346
No.

49
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:03,146
Although Kan-chan says that that it is smeared with blood,

50
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:06,146
-he actually means... -Hey, stop right there.

51
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,746
Kan-chan.

52
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:11,146
Preconceptions get in the way of deduction.

53
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:13,246
We went all the way out to Tokyo to pick you up

54
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:16,546
so that you could come to the site and look it over immediately!

55
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:20,546
And Uehara!

56
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:22,746
I'm your boss!

57
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,546
Don't call me Kan-chan.

58
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:28,546
Yes, Inspector Kansuke Yamato!

59
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:33,146
Well, I guess you can at least tell us where we're headed, though.

60
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:36,446
To an old house that is built beyond inside this forest

61
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:39,246
called the House of Hope.

62
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:43,046
House of Hope, what a nice name.

63
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:47,946
It was called by that name 20 years ago.

64
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:51,746
Right. Three years ago, a woman,

65
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:52,946
who had died a pitiful death

66
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:56,246
was found in the warehouse of that house.

67
00:04:56,246 --> 00:05:00,146
And since then, I hear that the locals refer to it as...

68
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:02,446
not the House of Hope.

69
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:05,646
But, rather, the House of Death.

70
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:10,146
House of Death.

71
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:18,846
Although it's pretty old, it's a fine house.

72
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:23,246
It seems to have been the villa of some rich person originally.

73
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:24,446
Hey.

74
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:28,246
Isn't it sort of strange that Inspector Yamato

75
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:31,546
would ask Pops to help him with a case?

76
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:36,346
Oh, that's because someone that he doesn't want to admit defeat to

77
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:39,246
is involved in this case!

78
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,646
Which means that

79
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,746
the person he doesn't want to admit defeat to is from the police?

80
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:43,946
Yes.

81
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:48,346
But that person is not from the Nagano Prefectural Police Headquarters,

82
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:51,046
he is rather an officer whose jurisdiction is in this area,

83
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:53,546
an officer from the local Arano Police Department.

84
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:55,846
But if that officer's from the station with jurisdiction over this area,

85
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:59,146
why would an officer from the headquarters want to do him in?

86
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:00,946
That person is actually.

87
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:04,146
Kan-chan's classmate since elementary school

88
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:07,646
and seems to be competing with Kan-chan about everything!

89
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:12,146
He graduated Tohto University's School of Law with as a top graduate

90
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:13,746
but didn't take the career test for what he specialized in.

91
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:17,346
He rather, entered the headquarters as a non-career worker.

92
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:19,646
He is a slightly queer man who got transferred

93
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,746
to the Arano Police Department after a certain incident.

94
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:24,946
Which means they were originally colleagues

95
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:27,346
-at the Nagano Prefectural Police Department? -Right!

96
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,846
And this person's also got a militaristic name like Kan-chan!

97
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:32,946
Hey, Uehara!

98
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,546
We're going in!

99
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:36,746
Oh, yes, sir!

100
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:40,346
Come to think of it. The name Kansuke Yamato

101
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:43,046
is so much like the name of Shingen Takeda's strategist,

102
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,546
Kansuke Yamamoto.

103
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:46,046
Anyway,

104
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:48,046
anytime this person competes with him,

105
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:49,646
Kan-chan seems to get upset

106
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:52,046
and since he's never experience victory yet,

107
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:53,846
please help him out, okay?

108
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:58,746
It seems that Kan-chan's really not counting on Detective Mouri,

109
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:01,646
but, rather, you!

110
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:10,146
I'll tell you why this place was called the House of Hope.

111
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:12,846
A rich man who built this house,

112
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:16,746
after the house got old and he stopped using it,

113
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:18,246
decided to let talented young people

114
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:20,046
who didn't have money stay here

115
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:24,346
for rent that was almost like free,

116
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:27,246
until they realized their dreams!

117
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:32,446
Well, and that kindly rich man who used to come visit this house sometimes,

118
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:37,346
soon after finishing procedures to hand this house over to the inhabitants

119
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:38,746
died of an illness.

120
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:40,146
The people who lived here

121
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:44,346
went independent two or three years later and left the house too.

122
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:46,046
And since five or six years ago,

123
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:49,046
only a couple who met and got married at this house

124
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:51,146
seems to have been living here.

125
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:52,846
Hey, Uehara.

126
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:55,846
Show them the pictures of the people who used to live here!

127
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:57,046
Yes, sir!

128
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:01,546
Here are the six of them.

129
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:09,246
The topmost picture is Illustrator, Mr. Shusaku Akashi.

130
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:13,746
The next one is, Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, an actor.

131
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:18,146
The next is novelist, Ms. Aoi Kobashi.

132
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:22,546
Fashion designer, Mr. Shoji Yamabuki.

133
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:26,946
CG creator, Mr. Takuto Momose.

134
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:30,846
And lastly, musician Mr. Shiro Naoki.

135
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:38,246
The names are all ones that sound familiar and yet not.

136
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:39,746
By the way,

137
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:42,746
something's been bothering me from a while ago but...

138
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:45,446
What is this?

139
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:47,646
There's what looks to be the mark of colored paper

140
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:50,446
torn off from the door of the room.

141
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,546
Come to think of it,

142
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:54,346
there's a similar mark on the door of this room too.

143
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:56,746
That's probably...

144
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,646
Maybe they were marked by colored paper to tell them apart?

145
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,046
Colored paper?

146
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:05,546
I think that the people used the colored paper to tell the rooms apart!

147
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,546
Because all six people have colors in their names!

148
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:09,846
Stupid!

149
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:11,946
The names are pasted onto the pictures

150
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:14,046
but none of them have characters that mean color.

151
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,146
It's not the character, but sound of the name!

152
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:17,546
I get it!

153
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:20,946
Mr. Akashi is Red!

154
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:24,846
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa is Green!

155
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,446
Exactly.

156
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:28,746
Ms. Aoi Kobashi is Blue!

157
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:31,546
Mr. Shoji Yamabuki is Golden Yellow!

158
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:34,446
Mr. Takuto Momose is Peach color!

159
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:37,546
Mr. Shiro Naoki, the color White.

160
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:40,646
See, all six people have colors in their names!

161
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,046
Amazing, Conan!

162
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:46,446
Not only the rooms, but those six

163
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:51,446
seem to have categorized themselves by color for almost everything.

164
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:52,546
Look!

165
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:54,546
This came out of the warehouse of this house.

166
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:56,946
It's an old mealtime chore schedule!

167
00:09:56,946 --> 00:10:01,546
Their names aren't listed but rather, only color.

168
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:07,646
It could be that they were all calling themselves by color.

169
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:09,246
And?

170
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:12,046
Where's the room where the corpse was found?

171
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,346
This way.

172
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:22,446
What are those cardboard boxes that are stacked up on that cart?

173
00:10:22,446 --> 00:10:26,646
There are books inside and it's packed full.

174
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:28,646
It's really heavy too.

175
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:30,346
The door of this room that swings outwards

176
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:33,346
was blocked by this cart.

177
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,446
So that the person inside

178
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:38,546
couldn't come out until he died.

179
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:41,946
So, that room is the one in question...

180
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:43,246
Yeah.

181
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:45,346
When we got here,

182
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:49,246
he was already skinny and starved to death.

183
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:52,346
In this horrible...

184
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,546
room with red walls.

185
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:59,546
Don't tell me that this is...

186
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:00,846
Human blood?

187
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:03,546
-It's lacquer. -What?

188
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:08,146
See, the mouth of this lacquer paint spray can on the floor.

189
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:11,246
It's got the same color on it as the one on the wall!

190
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:16,346
But what's with this black and white chair?

191
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,946
Paint seems to have deliberately been put on it

192
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:20,946
and nailed to the floor to fix it in place.

193
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,346
The corpse was sitting on the white chair.

194
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:26,146
Don't tell me that

195
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:29,046
it's a message from the killer addressed to somebody?

196
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:31,646
No, that can't be.

197
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:36,346
In this room. The wiretap is still intact.

198
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:38,446
Wiretap?

199
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:40,946
I see.

200
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,646
The killer, wiretapped this room

201
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:45,746
and was confirming whether the victim was dead or alive.

202
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,146
And came to this room after no noise was heard at all

203
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,346
to confirm whether the victim had really died.

204
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:54,646
The wiretap would've been retrieved.

205
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:57,546
But since it's still here...

206
00:11:57,546 --> 00:12:00,446
Yeah. The killer left the victim locked in here

207
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:02,946
and never came here.

208
00:12:02,946 --> 00:12:08,546
In other words, the red wall and black and white chair are without doubt...

209
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:13,146
what the victim left behind as a dying message!

210
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:28,703
How about it? Did you figure it out?

211
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:32,203
It's so easy there's nothing to figure out. The message is red!

212
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:36,603
In other words, the color red is in the name.

213
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:39,203
Akashi, I think?

214
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:41,103
I hate to say this,

215
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:44,303
but the one who was found starved in this room

216
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:47,503
was that man, Shusaku Akashi!

217
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:54,103
By the way, Aoi Kobashi who was married to Shusaku Akashi

218
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:56,603
had the surname Akashi too but...

219
00:12:56,603 --> 00:13:00,403
She died three years ago in the warehouse here.

220
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:03,903
Don't tell me that the person called Aoi was also killed?

221
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:07,603
No, she had a bad heart condition to begin with.

222
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:11,203
She had an attack while looking for something in the warehouse,

223
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:12,603
and died.

224
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:15,103
Her husband was in this room

225
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:18,603
creating a piece of work at that time.

226
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:21,503
It seems that he only realized that she was lying dead

227
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:24,003
after half a day had passed.

228
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,703
Oh no.

229
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:30,603
If so, it's not the color red in this name.

230
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:34,103
Red. Red hot...

231
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:36,403
I see!

232
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:38,203
Red hot story, maybe?

233
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:41,003
I didn't go all the way to Tokyo

234
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:43,603
to pick you up to hear something like that from you!

235
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:46,203
Attempting to meet a worthy man

236
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:49,103
without taking the proper course

237
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:52,003
is as if inviting him to come

238
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:55,603
yet barring the gate against him.

239
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,203
I see.

240
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,603
You didn't call the renowned detective by phone and summon him

241
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:04,303
but rather, went to pick him up. Up to there, it's acceptable.

242
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:08,603
But, what you just said to Detective Mouri

243
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:11,003
is utterly rude.

244
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:16,803
As an old friend of yours, I'm ashamed, Kansuke.

245
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,803
Why the heck are you here?

246
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:20,803
Local police stay out of this, you!

247
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:24,703
No, this is the jurisdiction of the Arano Police Department.

248
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:27,103
I can't possibly stay out of this.

249
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:28,803
Stop your far-fetched argument!

250
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:30,903
-Just plain logic. -What was that

251
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,603
about being relieved being covered with hair?

252
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:37,203
It's not covered with hair.

253
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,803
Those are the words of Gentoku Ryubei

254
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:43,303
who appears in the story of the Three Kingdoms who went out of his way

255
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:46,703
to pick up a wise strategist to invite him over!

256
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:48,303
Attempting to meet a worthy man

257
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:50,203
without taking the proper course

258
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:51,903
is as if inviting him to come

259
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,603
yet barring the gate against him.

260
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,203
In other words,

261
00:14:56,203 --> 00:15:01,203
doing something improper as to summon a great wise man,

262
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:02,703
is like closing the gate to the wise man

263
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,803
despite asking him to come. This is what it means!

264
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:10,703
So, saying, Ryubei visited that man three times!

265
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:14,103
You knew nothing about Fuurinkazan,

266
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:17,003
and yet why do you know so much about the Three Kingdoms?

267
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,503
Who cares.

268
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,103
Anyway,

269
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:23,903
the unsolved mystery left in this room

270
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:29,003
are not only this red walls and the black and white chair.

271
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:32,603
That paneled boarded window has been cracked from inside.

272
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:36,003
And from that hole that had been opened, paint and lacquer,

273
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:39,403
anything that is used to paint color has all been thrown out.

274
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,803
The only thing left in this room

275
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:45,603
was this red colored spray

276
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:48,703
and the signature of the victim,

277
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:51,303
who bit off his own finger to write it

278
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,603
at the edge of the red colored wall.

279
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,803
Taking all these things into consideration, it is only proper

280
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,903
to ask the renowned detective once again of what he thinks.

281
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:05,503
Ryubei. Strategist. Three times?

282
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:10,203
Of course I will stand witness here.

283
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,403
After all, the fact that I thought that

284
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:14,003
there was something strange

285
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:16,403
about the large amount of paint that was scattered outside the house

286
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:19,303
was what lead to the discovery of the corpse.

287
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,903
Hey, don't tell me that the strategist is the famous...

288
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:26,403
Yes, the one who is always holding the feather fan.

289
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,003
You maybe from the prefectural headquarters,

290
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:32,203
but you can't possibly keep me out of this.

291
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,703
If I remember correctly, his name is...

292
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,303
Okay, I got it!

293
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:40,503
Stay as close as you want to your heart's content!

294
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:42,403
Shokatsuryo...

295
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:46,103
-Koume! -Koume?

296
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:52,203
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:55,903
My name is Takaaki Morofushi.

298
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:59,803
But, my nickname is read, Koume.

299
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:03,303
So, please call me that way from now on.

300
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:05,603
I see.

301
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:08,503
Instead of Koume Shokatsuryo...

302
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:12,003
He's local (Shokatsu) officer Koume.

303
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:20,503
And, how about it, Sleeping Kogoro?

304
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:23,703
This wall that is sprayed red with paint.

305
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:28,503
The signature that the victim wrote in blood on the edge of the wall!

306
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,703
The paneled window is cracked,

307
00:17:30,703 --> 00:17:34,603
and from that hole painting tools are thrown out the window!

308
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:37,303
And, these two chairs painted black and white

309
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:41,203
that are nailed in place to the floor!

310
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:44,703
A guy that was confined to a room like this and starved to death.

311
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,403
Do you know what this man was trying to relay?

312
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,003
Do I know?

313
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:55,103
Even with the intelligence of a famous detective,

314
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:57,803
this mystery I see is difficult to solve.

315
00:17:57,803 --> 00:18:00,603
Red, white and black.

316
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:05,503
He wanted to relay something using these three colors, right?

317
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:09,403
Because all the other colors were thrown out of the window.

318
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:12,203
Oh, who is this boy?

319
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:16,103
He's a kid that's staying with Sleeping Kogoro,

320
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,903
whose name is Conan Edogawa.

321
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:20,403
Conan Edogawa.

322
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,903
And...

323
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:25,703
The cardboard boxes that were stacked on the cart

324
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,903
that was blocking the door of the room from opening.

325
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:31,203
There seems to have been books inside them,

326
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:32,903
but whose books were they?

327
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,003
Aoi's books!

328
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:37,203
Like I just mentioned.

329
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,503
She's the wife of Mr. Shusaku Akashi

330
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:42,103
who was found starved to death in this room,

331
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:45,603
and the one who was found dead in the warehouse here of an illness,

332
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:48,003
maiden name, Ms. Aoi Kobashi.

333
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:51,903
A large amount of books from the bookshelf in her room were removed,

334
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:55,103
and were packed in those cardboard boxes.

335
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,403
She had a lot of books.

336
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,203
And, she herself was also a novelist.

337
00:19:01,203 --> 00:19:04,903
Then, it could've been the doing of one of Aoi's family members

338
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:07,103
who wanted to avenge her death.

339
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:10,803
Because despite Aoi collapsing of a heart attack,

340
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:12,603
Shusaku kept on drawing

341
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:15,403
and didn't realize what had happened until half a day later.

342
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:17,903
But, what family member...

343
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:19,803
She was an only child,

344
00:19:19,803 --> 00:19:22,103
and her parents had died when she was still young.

345
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:26,703
Then, maybe the four men who used to live here

346
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:29,403
with her in the past are to be suspected?

347
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,503
Huh? Why?

348
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,303
Because unless the culprit knew that there were many books in Aoi's room

349
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:38,503
as well as the fact that the door swings open outwardly,

350
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:40,903
the culprint wouldn't think of

351
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:44,503
placing a cart filled with books to block the door.

352
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:46,403
In other words, it is highly likely that.

353
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:49,003
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa the actor,

354
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:52,303
Mr. Shoji Yamabuki, the fashion designer.

355
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:55,403
CG creator Mr. Takuto Momose

356
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,503
or the musician Mr. Shiro Naoki

357
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:01,503
is the culprit.

358
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,903
That's the picture, right? Pops!

359
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:11,103
Yeah.

360
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:18,703
I see. You see things more or less as we do until here.

361
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:22,703
But, you deliberately didn't remark on it

362
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:24,803
because you figured that such a simple deduction

363
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:28,103
-was not even worth mentioning? -Yes.

364
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,303
What? Are you serious?

365
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:35,703
Yeah, okay, I'll go check things out for myself then!

366
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:37,403
What's the matter, Kan-chan?

367
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,303
I mean, Inspector Yamato.

368
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:42,303
What's the matter, my foot!

369
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:43,803
I was lead to believe that the fingerprints found on the door knob

370
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:45,803
on the inside of the room

371
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:49,003
and the prints on the red spray

372
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:53,003
were that of the victim, Mr. Akashi but...

373
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,103
The prints found were actually yours, Koume

374
00:20:55,103 --> 00:21:00,803
and that of your fellow police officer!

375
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:06,503
I'm going to call that officer over to headquarters right now

376
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:08,603
and squeeze info out of him, but...

377
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:12,803
Well, I wish you wouldn't get to hard on him.

378
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:15,903
After all, he's still a green-horn officer,

379
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,103
I'm sure he got upset over seeing his first dead body

380
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:21,003
at the scene experience,

381
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:23,403
and inadvertently touched something.

382
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:28,403
So, you and the green-horn officer found the corpse together?

383
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:33,103
Yes. I asked him to come to this house in the car on our way back

384
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:37,803
from another incident we going around asking questions about.

385
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:40,003
Because I wanted to offer flowers

386
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,603
and place them in front of the warehouse here.

387
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:45,303
Flowers?

388
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,403
Oh, I forgot to mention it,

389
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:50,403
but Inspector Morofushi and Inspector Yamato

390
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:54,603
were classmates with Aoi who died in this warehouse three years ago.

391
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:57,103
-Class... -Classmates?

392
00:21:57,103 --> 00:22:00,503
Inspector Morofushi was classmates with Ms. Aoi Kobashi

393
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:04,103
who passed away in the warehouse of this house three years ago?

394
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,603
Is it just a coincidence that the same inspector turns out

395
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:11,003
to be the one to first discover the corpse of Mr. Shusaku Akashi?

396
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:15,303
The dying message that Mr. Akashi left behind.

397
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:18,703
The walls that were painted red with lacquer spray

398
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:23,603
and the two chairs painted black and white that are nailed to the floor.

399
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:27,303
What did Mr. Akashi want to relay using all this?

400
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:29,203
The mystery of the red wall.

401
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:33,003
The culprit who starved Mr. Akashi to death.

402
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:36,203
I'm going to get him no matter what!

403
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:02,403
It's indeed like bamboo shoots in the snow.

404
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:05,003
There was! A quite suspicious person!

405
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:08,803
What kind of person was Aoi?

406
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:12,303
Again. The red wall.

407
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:15,603
"Move as swift as a wind", is it?

408
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:19,503
We got an important person who held the key to solving the case...

409
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:22,803
and we've had him murdered under our own watch!

410
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:24,103
Next Conan,

411
00:24:24,103 --> 00:24:31,403
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Mercy)"

412
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:45,902
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,602
"Chess."

414
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:50,802
They've come all the way from Nagano in want of my deduction.

415
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,902
He's really a happy-go-lucky man.
