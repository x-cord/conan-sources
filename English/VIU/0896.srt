1
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:04,791
Move your base of operations overseas?

2
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:06,691
Does this mean you're finally making a serious effort

3
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:08,891
to win a major title?

4
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:12,791
Yeah, since I won my first domestic tournament the other day.

5
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:14,891
"Teigo Banno (32)" -I'm going to base myself in the United States

6
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:17,791
and work for three or four years.

7
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:20,591
"Kurumi Iiyama (29)" -I've already found a house there.

8
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:21,791
Really?

9
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:23,191
So...

10
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:26,791
I need to move out of here by next month.

11
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:29,191
Could you return the spare key I gave you?

12
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:33,491
Oh, is that why you invited me here so early in the morning?

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,891
We hadn't seen each other in a while.

14
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:37,391
I thought you were breaking up with me.

15
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:38,592
I was nervous.

16
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:42,691
So, when are you leaving Japan?

17
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:45,191
My passport is expired.

18
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:46,891
I'll need to renew it.

19
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:48,591
Well, actually...

20
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:50,791
There's no ticket for you.

21
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:52,191
What?

22
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:53,591
I've thought about it.

23
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:58,791
I'd like to reset everything and start with a blank slate.

24
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,991
So you and I are over.

25
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,291
You owe me 100 million yen in damages.

26
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,891
100 million?

27
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:07,891
You can afford it, can't you?

28
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:11,591
It seems like you've been making money off your photo collections.

29
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:12,691
Wait a minute.

30
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:15,091
If I give you that much, I won't be able to go on tour anymore.

31
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:18,291
You know my father's a lawyer, don't you?

32
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:21,391
He'll take everything you have, so prepare yourself.

33
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:23,191
Calm down, Kurumi.

34
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:26,691
Why don't we talk about it here tonight?

35
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:30,591
I'll cook dinner for you like I used to.

36
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:32,191
Fine.

37
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,491
But I have work at 9 am tonight.

38
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:38,091
Then how about 6:30 pm?

39
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:41,092
I'll make sure you can eat right away.

40
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:46,091
Just so you know, you can't distract me with a meal.

41
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:49,191
In any case, let's talk over dinner.

42
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,891
Also, if you're going to cook, make my favourite paella.

43
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:56,992
Although you'll probably keep making it for me.

44
00:01:58,092 --> 00:01:59,391
No.

45
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:04,191
This will be our last dinner.

46
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,391
Did you say something?

47
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,391
No, nothing.

48
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:08,491
Really?

49
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:10,191
See you at 6:30 pm, then.

50
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:12,792
Yeah, I'll be waiting.

51
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:30,391
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

52
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:32,491
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

53
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,491
There's a troubled couple living in an upper floor apartment.

54
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:36,791
And Ms. Wakasa's home is next door.

55
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,591
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,491
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:43,092
His name is Detective Conan!

58
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,759
"The Woman with White Hands (Part 1)"

59
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:41,258
General, the tiger is afraid of me and won't come out!

60
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,058
Every night this tiger leaves its screen and causes trouble!

61
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,658
If you insist that I capture it,

62
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,658
then you must drive it out of the screen!

63
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,759
Then I, Ikkyu...

64
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,059
shall tie him up for you!

65
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,958
That was amazing!

66
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,958
That was amazing, Conan!

67
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,058
It's way better than the script I wrote.

68
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,158
Really?

69
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,858
You were like the real Ikkyu.

70
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:13,859
Really?

71
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,258
Impressive as always.

72
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,458
And you've got "tonkatsu" (Japanese pork cutlet).

73
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,458
You mean "tonchi" (wit).

74
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,558
"Menchi" (Minced meat)?

75
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,858
It's "tonchi".

76
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,858
What's that?

77
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,958
Genta, you haven't heard of "tonchi"?

78
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,458
I wasn't sure how it would turn out

79
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,358
since you've been skipping rehearsal,

80
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:32,658
but you show up when it counts.

81
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:37,658
Actually, I once played this role my third year of grade school.

82
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,958
"Ikkyu" -Who would like to play the role of Ikkyu

83
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,858
"Ikkyu, priest, general" -in the upcoming play?

84
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,758
Teacher!

85
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,458
Suzuki, do you want to play Ikkyu?

86
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,858
No. I think Ikkyu should be played

87
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:53,058
by the arrogant Shinichi.

88
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:54,358
What?

89
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,359
Right?

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,158
Don't you agree, Ran?

91
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:01,359
Yeah. And Ikkyu is smart like Holmes.

92
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,758
No way!

93
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,758
You're going to be playing Ikkyu in your upcoming play?

94
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,759
Yeah.

95
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,758
That's great, Shinichi. Isn't you're the leading role?

96
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,459
Well, yeah.

97
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,558
Then I, Ikkyu, will capture the tiger...

98
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,659
No!

99
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,058
You need to put yourself in Ikkyu's shoes.

100
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,458
Let me see that.

101
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,658
Watch this.

102
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:30,459
Glare straight ahead.

103
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:37,058
Then I, Ikkyu, will capture the tiger!

104
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:39,159
Here. Now you try it.

105
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:44,659
Then I, Ikkyu, will capture the tiger!

106
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,458
Why don't you change "will" to "shall?"

107
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,658
That'll make it sound more like a folk tale

108
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,658
and give it some weight.

109
00:06:54,659 --> 00:07:00,258
Also, I think changing "capture" to "tie up" would sound stronger too.

110
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,058
Great idea, Yu.

111
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,758
Who cares what I say?

112
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,058
It's just a play.

113
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,358
No.

114
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:12,658
Are you trying to embarrass the great actress, Yukiko Fujimine?

115
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,158
What?

116
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:18,858
My parents made me practice half to death.

117
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:20,058
I see.

118
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:22,758
So that's why you weren't taking rehearsal serious.

119
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,958
I still remembered most of my lines.

120
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,758
Anyway, this tiger painting is amazing.

121
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,658
It is. It's very realistic and powerful.

122
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:35,758
Ms. Wakasa, you painted this, right?

123
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,858
Yes. I'm pretty good at painting.

124
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,858
Okay, everyone.

125
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:43,958
The actual play is tomorrow.

126
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,558
Let's finish making the sets we have left.

127
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,359
-Okay! -Okay!

128
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,859
Oh, my.

129
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,858
The water for washing the brushes is pitch black.

130
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,158
I'll get you some clean water.

131
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,758
Thank you.

132
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,759
You're welcome...

133
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,059
It hurts...

134
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,358
The folding screen!

135
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,658
Oh, no. What should we do?

136
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,758
I'll repaint it immediately.

137
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:40,958
Oh, but I took the photo of the tiger I used for reference home.

138
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,158
I know it's a lot to ask,

139
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,358
but you could paint it once you get home today

140
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,758
and bring it in tomorrow?

141
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,458
But then I won't be sure

142
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:53,958
if the tiger is the right size for Conan's body.

143
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,158
In that case,

144
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,558
do you want me to come over to your place?

145
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,458
I want to go, too.

146
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,958
We'll help you color it.

147
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,959
Really?

148
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,158
It beats working alone.

149
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,758
I'm kind of interested to see your house.

150
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,658
Thank you.

151
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,858
Then can I count on you to recreate the tiger screen?

152
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:21,359
Yes. I'll take the children home once we're finished.

153
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,458
You live in a high-rise apartment, Ms. Wakasa?

154
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,559
Yes.

155
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:32,858
It's just like Ayumi's place.

156
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:35,358
Yoshida, you live in a high-rise, too?

157
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,758
Yeah.

158
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,258
"Banno"

159
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,359
This way.

160
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,158
She was wearing a lot of makeup.

161
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,858
Seems like she had business with Ms. Wakasa's neighbour.

162
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:08,258
What does your neighbour do?

163
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,658
I think he's some kind of sports athlete.

164
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,958
I've only seen him a few times,

165
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,058
so I don't know him well.

166
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,159
I see.

167
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,358
It's done!

168
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,758
It's even better than the last one.

169
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,658
The size and intensity are perfect, too.

170
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,758
Now we just have to glue it to cardboard once the paint dries.

171
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,558
Thanks, everyone.

172
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,959
I couldn't have done it without you.

173
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,658
You should always help a person in need.

174
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,359
You don't need to thank us.

175
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,258
In that case, to thank you for helping me,

176
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:47,258
I'll make you some Japanese omelette rice.

177
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,358
Seriously?

178
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,658
Genta.

179
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,259
I thought she didn't need to thank us.

180
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,358
-Thanks for the food! -Thanks for the food!

181
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,859
Sure. Eat up.

182
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,158
It's good!

183
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,558
It's delicious!

184
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,358
It's the best I've ever had!

185
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,558
Thank you.

186
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,058
Anyway, did you call your parents to tell them you'd be home late?

187
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,159
Yeah.

188
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,158
Your neighbour's awfully loud.

189
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,058
I hear it all the time.

190
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:26,358
Apparently he plays music on a timer instead of setting an alarm.

191
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:29,058
It's not stopping though.

192
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,559
That's odd. Normally it stops pretty quickly.

193
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,358
I'm gonna go complain.

194
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,758
Wait, Genta.

195
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,159
Conan, you too!

196
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,058
Gosh.

197
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:46,858
Hey, you're being too loud! Wake up!

198
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,558
Is he not home?

199
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,558
What? It's unlocked.

200
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,458
So he is home.

201
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,158
Wait, Genta.

202
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,358
Hey!

203
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,558
It must be that stereo.

204
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,459
Gosh. How do you turn this thing off?

205
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,359
I'll just unplug this.

206
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,959
It finally stopped.

207
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,059
What's wrong, Genta?

208
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,640
Darn it! That is loud.

209
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,940
Huh? Who are you kids?

210
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,840
Are you a zombie?

211
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,640
Who are you calling a zombie?

212
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:44,540
And you shouldn't come barging into people's homes uninvited.

213
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,140
Next to you...

214
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,341
What?

215
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:51,940
What is this?

216
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:53,441
Looks like...

217
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,940
someone bludgeoned her to death.

218
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:58,740
Bludgeoned?

219
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,140
Ms. Wakasa.

220
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:01,940
Call the police.

221
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:03,241
Okay.

222
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:10,340
Come to think of it, a strange woman zapped me in my doorway.

223
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:14,140
You have something on your right cheek.

224
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,341
Something? Like what?

225
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:19,741
See?

226
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:21,840
It's written in red.

227
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:23,240
"I love you"

228
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:24,540
I love you?

229
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:28,040
Did you make the dead woman write that?

230
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,541
No! This isn't Kurumi's handwriting!

231
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,740
It's her!

232
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:41,540
She did it!

233
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,740
Look!

234
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:45,640
This woman with the white hands wrote it!

235
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:50,640
Killing Kurumi after knocking me out!

236
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:53,141
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

237
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:56,640
It's true.

238
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:59,240
You have to believe me, officers.

239
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:03,640
A strange woman suddenly showed up at my place this evening.

240
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,240
The moment I opened the door,

241
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:08,940
she zapped me with a stun gun and knocked me out.

242
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:09,941
When I came to my senses,

243
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:13,340
these kids were in my apartment

244
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:15,740
and were yelling.

245
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:19,340
They told me to look next to me, so I did.

246
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,240
That's when I saw my girlfriend, Kurumi,

247
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:24,440
bleeding from her head on the floor.

248
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:25,840
I see.

249
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:29,340
By the way, what about those red letters on your right cheek?

250
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:32,140
That strange woman wrote this.

251
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:35,840
The one who knocked you out with the stun gun?

252
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:42,140
This polaroid that was on the floor next to me proves it.

253
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:43,141
Look.

254
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:46,641
This woman with white hands is writing on my cheek.

255
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:53,140
Kurumi was supposed to come to my place at 6.30 pm.

256
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:56,040
She must've entered without realizing that strange woman

257
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,440
was inside.

258
00:14:57,441 --> 00:15:00,841
And that woman killed her when they ran into each other.

259
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:04,540
An imaginary girlfriend.

260
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,940
What?

261
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:08,540
I've seen it on TV and in magazines.

262
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,040
Men put foundation and nail polish on their hands

263
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:16,140
and take selfies to make it look like they have girlfriends.

264
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:19,940
Maybe that's how you took that photo.

265
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:23,040
What are you talking about?

266
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,440
Look closely.

267
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,740
My right hand is behind my head.

268
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:32,140
And I couldn't write this clearly on my own face.

269
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:35,940
Then maybe you made the woman write that

270
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:37,940
on your face before killing her.

271
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,940
Don't be ridiculous!

272
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:43,140
There was another photo.

273
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,141
Look at it!

274
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:48,140
She took a photo before she wrote on my face.

275
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:51,640
That's why Kurumi couldn't have written it.

276
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:53,641
You're right.

277
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:02,840
Anyway, officers, can I erase this writing on my face?

278
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,440
It's creeping me out.

279
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:08,540
You can once forensics has taken photos of it.

280
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,441
Then hurry up.

281
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:18,940
Do you remember what the woman who knocked you out

282
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:20,540
with a stun gun looked like?

283
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,440
Yeah, but since I lost consciousness almost instantly,

284
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,540
I only got a quick look at her.

285
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,540
She was wearing a broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses.

286
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,840
A broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses...

287
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:36,240
Anything else?

288
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,740
Well...

289
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:41,540
She was wearing a lot of makeup.

290
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:46,641
We saw her standing in front of the door to this apartment.

291
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,040
Is that true?

292
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,140
She rang the doorbell a bunch of times.

293
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,240
When she realized he wasn't home,

294
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:57,540
she banged on the door and clicked her tongue.

295
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,940
Come to think of it,

296
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:02,940
she had a scrunchie on her right hand

297
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:04,940
like the woman in the photo.

298
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,040
That's it! It was her!

299
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,140
She was relatively tall.

300
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:13,840
Just about your height.

301
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:16,041
Really?

302
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:22,041
Did you recognize the woman?

303
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:26,940
I had my first win the other day and published a photo collection.

304
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:30,041
I've had a sudden increase in weird fans.

305
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,640
First win?

306
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:38,140
Are you the professional golfer, Teigo Banno?

307
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,340
You just noticed?

308
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,740
Then the murdered woman

309
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:44,940
is the model you were rumoured to have been dating...

310
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,540
Yeah, Kurumi Iiyama.

311
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,040
Is she famous?

312
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,140
Yes. Her father's a lawyer.

313
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:55,140
She was being promoted as a socialite model.

314
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,840
So you have all these trophies

315
00:17:56,841 --> 00:18:00,041
because you're a professional golfer.

316
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:05,040
The cabinets below are full of file folders.

317
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,441
Don't touch those!

318
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,640
I mean...

319
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:13,340
They're records of the tours I've participated in.

320
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,340
I finally got them organized recently,

321
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:18,040
so try not to touch them.

322
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,140
-I'm sorry. -Sorry.

323
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:25,940
By the way, why did the victim, Ms. Iiyama, come here?

324
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,240
She was just coming to hang out.

325
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,340
She's my girlfriend.

326
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:31,940
Nothing wrong with that, right?

327
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,540
You were breaking up.

328
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,041
Right?

329
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:40,940
Excuse me.

330
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:44,640
I've been wondering, but who are you?

331
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:49,940
I'm their assistant homeroom teacher, Rumi Wakasa.

332
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:53,040
What's their assistant homeroom teacher doing here?

333
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:58,040
I actually live next door.

334
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,940
Today the children helped me paint the screen

335
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:04,540
that we're using in a play tomorrow.

336
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:09,140
We heard loud music coming from next door.

337
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:13,640
Normally it stops immediately, but today it kept playing.

338
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:16,340
So we came to check things out

339
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:18,440
and found the front door unlocked.

340
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:21,440
And that's how we ended up here.

341
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:22,840
I see.

342
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,740
What did you mean by breaking up?

343
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:29,740
This morning on my way to school I passed by this apartment,

344
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:33,840
I heard the two of them arguing.

345
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,940
You heard them arguing?

346
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,540
About what?

347
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:42,540
I think he said he wasn't taking her with him on his international tour.

348
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,640
And she demanded he pay her damages for breaking up with her.

349
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:50,040
He said he'd cook for her so they could talk about it tonight.

350
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:54,240
So she asked him to make paella.

351
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,640
And he said,

352
00:19:55,641 --> 00:20:00,841
it would be their last dinner.

353
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,940
Their last dinner?

354
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:07,541
Oh, excuse me. I may have misheard them.

355
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,140
You haven't cooked anything, though.

356
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:16,040
We didn't smell any food when we entered the apartment.

357
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,640
The refrigerator's empty too.

358
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:21,240
I was just about to go buy ingredients

359
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:24,340
when the strange woman knocked me out.

360
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:27,040
And stop messing around in my kitchen.

361
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:32,140
Yeah, but when the strange woman rang your doorbell,

362
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:34,840
you were out, right?

363
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:38,940
You should've bought the ingredients on your way home.

364
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:41,440
I do what I want.

365
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:45,540
In any case, see if any the other residents have seen the woman.

366
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,140
Yes, sir.

367
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,740
And Ms. Wakasa,

368
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:52,740
could you return to your apartment with the children?

369
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:53,940
Okay.

370
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:56,640
Come on, children. Let's head back to my apartment.

371
00:20:56,641 --> 00:20:58,041
Okay.

372
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:02,840
Darn it.

373
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:03,940
If I'd known this would happen,

374
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:07,640
I would've taken a photo of that woman ringing the doorbell.

375
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:13,041
Her white hands are in the polaroid, though.

376
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:15,940
Conan.

377
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,540
Can't you drag the woman out of the photo?

378
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,840
Aren't you Ikkyu?

379
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,940
I can't do that.

380
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:26,340
Besides, I'm not Ikkyu.

381
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:29,940
And not even Ikkyu could do that.

382
00:21:29,941 --> 00:21:32,240
Oh?

383
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:34,440
What is this smell?

384
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:37,340
It smells like the cosmetics section of a department store.

385
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:40,541
Did Ms. Wakasa spill some of her cosmetics?

386
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,840
It's coming from Kojima's right hand.

387
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:47,140
What? Me?

388
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,041
But I'm not wearing any makeup.

389
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:53,640
I knew it.

390
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:55,240
Knew what?

391
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:58,040
Didn't I say I'm not wearing makeup?

392
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,740
No, I'm talking about the perp.

393
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,840
What? The perp?

394
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:05,940
Conan, have you already figured out who the perp is?

395
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,940
Who is that woman?

396
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:10,240
Tell us, Conan.

397
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:14,241
The person who killed the model, Kurumi Iiyama, is...

398
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:21,040
the professional golfer, Teigo Banno, after all.

399
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,641
-What? -What?

400
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,240
"Next Episode" -It's hard to imagine

401
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:50,240
someone could write so clearly on their own face.

402
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:51,940
That's the thing.

403
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:55,940
There really was a woman wearing a broad-brimmed hat

404
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:57,740
and sunglasses.

405
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:01,740
It was probably that woman in the photo with white hands.

406
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,040
Hurry up and find her.

407
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:08,041
These children claimed to have figured something out.

408
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:14,041
Next Conan, "The Woman with White Hands (Part 2)"
