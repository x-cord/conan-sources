1
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:07,751
As usual, Ran won the grand prize in a lottery,

2
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:11,092
so we took the Hokuriku Line to Kanazawa.

3
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:14,462
Muroo Saisei Memorial Museum

4
00:00:26,482 --> 00:00:29,652
Nishi Chaya Shiryokan Museum

5
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:31,942
Shimada Seijiro

6
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:45,331
Let's get something to eat.

7
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:47,491
Someplace I can get a drink.

8
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:50,082
What? But it's still early.

9
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:53,701
We've experienced enough of Kanazawa's history.

10
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:56,071
Let's taste Kanazawa's food next.

11
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:59,701
Nope. We'll have lunch after we've done some more sightseeing.

12
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:02,301
No. Food comes first.

13
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:03,551
Sightseeing!

14
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:04,762
Food!

15
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:07,601
What do you want to do?

16
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:08,402
Huh?

17
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:11,562
Oh, uh...

18
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:18,131
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

19
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:19,811
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

20
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:22,051
Dining or sightseeing? This is Kanazawa!

21
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:23,941
Cases and new encounters can be found in spades!

22
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,471
Always determining the one truth

23
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:27,161
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

24
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:29,542
his name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:13,562
The Young Kaga Lady's Mystery Tour (Part One)

26
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,405
We're getting food. Follow me.

27
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:24,955
Ow!

28
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,545
Excuse me.

29
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:35,695
Are you hurt?

30
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,805
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

31
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:44,914
Your clothes are dirty.

32
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:46,815
Don't worry about it.

33
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,595
But they look expensive.

34
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:53,225
I won't be wearing it again. It's fine.

35
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,155
What a waste. Why not?

36
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,665
Because it's embarrassing to wear the same outfit over and over.

37
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:05,614
This is a pretty heavy bag.

38
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,165
What's in it?

39
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:11,754
How rude of you to ask a lady about the contents of her bag.

40
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:14,135
I'm sorry...

41
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:18,524
By the way, I'm trying to get to Yamanakaza.

42
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,435
Tell me the way.

43
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:23,324
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:27,315
We're here sightseeing and don't know exactly how to get there.

45
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:30,064
How useless.

46
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:30,955
What?

47
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,444
Then why don't you take a taxi?

48
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:37,445
If you tell them where you're going, they'll probably take you there.

49
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:39,714
A taxi?

50
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:42,214
Huh? Is something wrong?

51
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,585
Where can I get a taxi? I've never ridden one before.

52
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:47,555
What?

53
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:56,595
Take us to Yamanakaza.

54
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:57,745
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,345
Is this enough of a tip?

56
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:03,065
Seriously?

57
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:05,644
You're not traveling overseas.

58
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:07,355
You don't need to tip him.

59
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:08,785
Oh, really?

60
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,314
Aw, shucks.

61
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:19,584
If we had that 10 thousand yen, we could've eaten a luxurious lunch today.

62
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,865
Don't be stupid.

63
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:26,845
She's even more of a pampered lady than Sonoko.

64
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:31,085
Yamanaka Hot Springs Yamanakaza

65
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,255
Yamanakaza

66
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:54,025
We should meet up with your dad soon.

67
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:56,564
He said he'd get something light to eat on his own.

68
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,755
He has absolutely no patience.

69
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:04,864
Someone help!

70
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,165
Isn't that...?

71
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:10,045
I'm stuffed.

72
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:12,545
Mister, catch that man!

73
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,354
He's a thief!

74
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:15,175
What?!

75
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,144
Dad, are you okay?

76
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:30,544
Ow...

77
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:33,254
This bag is pretty heavy.

78
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:34,645
What's in it?

79
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,775
What?!

80
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:46,155
Thank you for getting it back from him.

81
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,414
No problem.

82
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:50,665
By the way, why are you carrying so much cash?

83
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,625
I...

84
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:55,645
Oh, no. The time!

85
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:01,255
She left.

86
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:04,595
I wonder why she had all that money.

87
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:05,994
Who knows?

88
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:07,724
She's a rich girl.

89
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:12,104
I'm sure it's not uncommon for her to carry around a few million yen.

90
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:14,105
Without a bodyguard?

91
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:17,475
What do I know about being rich?

92
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:22,845
She's back.

93
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:28,665
Huh? She doesn't have her bag with her.

94
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,415
You're right.

95
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:33,415
Hey, what happened to your bag?

96
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:35,264
I left it.

97
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:37,695
What? But why?

98
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,925
Why did you leave it?

99
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:47,175
The truth is, that was ransom money.

100
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:51,055
Where did you leave it?

101
00:07:51,365 --> 00:07:52,685
In the parking lot.

102
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,345
Where?

103
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,025
Over there.

104
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,485
We're too late.

105
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:09,725
Good. Now Manabu-san will be returned safely.

106
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,535
I did the right thing, right?

107
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:18,044
They'll release the hostage because I gave them the money, right?

108
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,045
No. It's possible that...

109
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:22,675
What?

110
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:26,254
It's possible the culprit has no further use for the hostage,

111
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,925
and no reason to leave them alive.

112
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,494
But...

113
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:34,104
Ran, call the police.

114
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:34,945
Okay.

115
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,865
Why didn't you call the police?

116
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:53,245
We simply followed the culprit's instructions.

117
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,204
We did our duty.

118
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:57,924
Sir, please calm down.

119
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,294
You're just an accountant.

120
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:01,504
How dare you talk back to the president?

121
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:02,815
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,675
This is Saikawa Manabu-san.

123
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:10,675
When was this sent to you?

124
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:14,014
It was sent to the office around 10 this morning.

125
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:16,184
And you received the kidnapping call then, too?

126
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,295
That's right.

127
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,735
Manabu-san is all right, isn't he?

128
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:25,695
Two hours have passed since the ransom money was handed off.

129
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:29,234
It's hard to be optimistic given the circumstances.

130
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,605
No...

131
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:35,115
I'm having the police review the security camera footage from the parking lot.

132
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:40,625
The culprit who carried off the ransom money should be visible.

133
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:44,755
But we're already one step behind.

134
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:49,935
Even if we find evidence that leads us to the culprit, by that time...

135
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:52,385
I did nothing wrong.

136
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:54,635
Anyway, who are you?

137
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:59,265
Me? I'm Mori Kogoro.

138
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,784
Oh, I've heard of you.

139
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:04,394
You're a famous detective from Tokyo.

140
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,274
The something Kogoro.

141
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,365
I believe it was...

142
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,605
Yes, that's right. The Drunk Kogoro.

143
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:16,075
Well, she's not wrong.

144
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:19,615
You're wrong. It's the Sleeping Kogoro.

145
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:23,415
Sir.

146
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,715
Rintaro, where have you been?

147
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,965
I'm sorry. I was busy.

148
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,965
Hagino Rintaro (34) Is the master all right?

149
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,644
We don't know yet.

150
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:35,844
Who is he?

151
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,484
Manabu's apprentice.

152
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,225
Apprentice of what?

153
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,194
Printed silks.

154
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:45,485
I see. Is the hostage a printed silk maker as well?

155
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,985
Yes. He used to be a famous artisan around here.

156
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:52,485
Used to be? Is he not anymore?

157
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:53,595
No.

158
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:56,314
Recently he had an accident in the storage shed.

159
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:58,495
He lost the use of his dominant hand.

160
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:09,385
He was forced to give up his practice.

161
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,635
That must be difficult.

162
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:15,934
Right now his safety comes first.

163
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:18,095
Is there anything we can do?

164
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:23,145
Unfortunately, for now we can only pray for his safety.

165
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,535
It could be the culprit.

166
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:34,535
Try to converse with them calmly.

167
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,165
Hello?

168
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,914
Sir, it's me.

169
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:43,915
Manabu? Is that you, Manabu?

170
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:56,212
I understand.

171
00:11:57,872 --> 00:12:00,621
After being released by the culprit,

172
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:04,712
Manabu ran to a nearby police box and was taken into their custody.

173
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:07,551
Then Manabu-san is all right?

174
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,592
Yes. He seems to be doing well.

175
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:14,722
He'll return here after being questioned by the police.

176
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:28,242
Manabu-san!

177
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:31,931
I'm glad you're all right.

178
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:34,492
Master, I'm glad you're safe.

179
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:37,742
Saikawa Manabu (55) I'm sorry for making everyone worry.

180
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,752
Your clothes are dirty. Change into these.

181
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:42,752
Thank you.

182
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:47,302
Sir, I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused.

183
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:51,762
How could you inconvenience us? You're a plague on this company.

184
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:56,932
Dad, Manabu-san didn't ask to be kidnapped.

185
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,352
Yes, but...

186
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:03,812
The president can't talk back to Mari-chan because he adores her.

187
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,192
Although it's a different story when it comes to boyfriends.

188
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:11,202
So she's your typical sheltered daughter.

189
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:18,571
Excuse the interruption, but Manabu-san, I'm glad you're all right.

190
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:19,742
Who are you?

191
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:23,361
I'm Mori Kogoro, a detective.

192
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:24,691
A detective?

193
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:28,002
I heard the kidnapper hasn't been caught yet.

194
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,542
I'll help in any way I can.

195
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:34,681
But I was blindfolded the whole time.

196
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,741
I didn't see the culprit's face.

197
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:39,081
Do you recall their voice?

198
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:42,772
No. They used some kind of device to modify it.

199
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,772
So we have no clues to the culprit's identity.

200
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:48,292
You truly are useless.

201
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:50,152
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:53,902
Manabu-san, where and when were you kidnapped?

203
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:57,911
I believe it was around nine this morning.

204
00:13:57,912 --> 00:14:00,332
I think I was on my way to the office.

205
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:06,542
Maybe that means the culprit was familiar with your regular routine.

206
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:11,361
If that's true, then it's possible the kidnapper is an acquaintance.

207
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:14,331
And it's possible they used a voice changer

208
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:17,682
because Manabu-san would've been very familiar with their voice.

209
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,932
You think we did it?

210
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,281
We're just discussing possibilities.

211
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:31,942
By the way, where were you around nine this morning?

212
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:35,051
I was still in bed.

213
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,382
Can anyone verify that?

214
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:43,371
I saw Mari-chan sleeping.

215
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:47,212
Her door was open while I was cleaning this morning, and I caught a glimpse of her.

216
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,081
I was preparing for work at the workshop.

217
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:54,092
I met Yuko-san when she came to clean.

218
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,021
That's right.

219
00:14:56,022 --> 00:15:00,331
Which means you're able to verify each other's stories.

220
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,212
You all have alibis.

221
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,352
Sir, what about you?

222
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:08,292
I was passed out drunk.

223
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:11,612
Yuko-san, did you see the president?

224
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:12,772
No.

225
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:16,862
In other words, you have no one to verify your alibi.

226
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:18,661
W-Wait a minute.

227
00:15:18,662 --> 00:15:23,851
Maybe so, but we were right here when the ransom money was handed off.

228
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:25,412
We couldn't have done it.

229
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:27,911
That's true.

230
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:31,542
Which means the culprit is someone not currently present.

231
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:35,741
Mari, don't you think he's suspicious?

232
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,151
He who?

233
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:40,552
That nasty pest that keeps bugging Mari.

234
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:42,821
Don't say that about him.

235
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,242
Takumi-san is my boyfriend.

236
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:48,062
I'll never accept it.

237
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,562
In any case, tell him to come here immediately!

238
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:04,872
Mari, why did you want me to come to...

239
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:09,462
Are you Kondo Takumi-san?

240
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:13,212
Kondo Takumi (24) Mari's Boyfriend Yeah. What's all this?

241
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,342
You're the culprit, aren't you?

242
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:18,092
What? What are you talking about?

243
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:19,561
Don't play dumb!

244
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,342
You're the one who kidnapped Manabu and took my 30 million yen!

245
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:27,521
You're accusing me of kidnapping? Give me a break.

246
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,651
He's right. That's awful.

247
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:34,312
You only approached Mari for my money, and you're still playing dumb?

248
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:36,571
It's not like that.

249
00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:39,201
I'm with Mari because I love her.

250
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:44,431
Kondo-san, where were you this morning at nine?

251
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:46,082
This morning?

252
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:48,781
I was still asleep.

253
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:51,321
Can anyone verify that?

254
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:54,212
I live alone. Of course not.

255
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:56,541
You don't have an alibi!

256
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,441
So it was you!

257
00:16:58,442 --> 00:16:59,761
Give me my money back!

258
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:01,222
Hey, calm down!

259
00:17:03,062 --> 00:17:04,472
Are you all right?

260
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:07,722
I'm feeling a bit exhausted.

261
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:10,971
You were held captive. It's no surprise.

262
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:14,102
You should rest for a while.

263
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:15,761
Excuse me.

264
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:18,482
I'll take you home.

265
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,382
Thank you.

266
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,622
I'm so glad Manabu-san didn't have a single scratch on him.

267
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:30,152
Since he was tied up, I was worried he'd been assaulted.

268
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:40,342
Yamashiro Hot Springs Kosoyu

269
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:43,472
Hattori Shrine

270
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:56,482
What are you planning to do with the money?

271
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,612
What are you doing here?

272
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:03,691
We followed you.

273
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:05,481
Why?

274
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:11,872
I noticed you were lying about the kidnapping.

275
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:15,881
That money you're holding proves it!

276
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:18,501
I just happened to find this.

277
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:20,301
Don't lie to me!

278
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:23,171
You made up the whole kidnapping!

279
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,432
I didn't do that.

280
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:29,141
Why aren't there any rope burns on your hands?

281
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,182
Weren't both of your hands tied?

282
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:34,191
They just disappeared because some time has passed.

283
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:37,852
No. You were never tied up in the first place.

284
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:43,962
If you look closely at this photo, you can see your back reflected in it.

285
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:48,242
You're just holding your hands behind you. You're not tied up.

286
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:57,042
It's too bad, but you can't deceive the eyes of Mori Kogoro.

287
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,341
I'm the one who noticed that.

288
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:03,611
It just looks that way because of the light.

289
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:09,041
Mister, did you know everyone's ears are a different shape, just like fingerprints?

290
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:11,352
What? What are you talking about?

291
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:15,871
The security cameras caught the culprit carrying off the ransom money.

292
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:20,511
Their face is disguised, but their ears are visible.

293
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:25,742
If their shape matches yours, then we'll know if you're the kidnapper.

294
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,242
Or will you still make excuses?

295
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:34,361
Manabu, you're unbelievable.

296
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:36,872
How could you repay my kindness like this?

297
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:39,451
This is your fault!

298
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:41,882
You withheld my retirement pay!

299
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:45,091
You can tell the police all about it.

300
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:47,762
Damn it! I'm not being arrested!

301
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:58,732
Stop!

302
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,152
Dad, are you okay?

303
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,482
This is the weight of 30 million yen.

304
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:08,152
Don't be stupid.

305
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:19,412
It's so good.

306
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:22,552
Dad, mind your manners.

307
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:28,172
Thank you for treating us to such a luxurious meal.

308
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:31,291
My 30 million yen was returned to me.

309
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,182
This is nothing.

310
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:36,142
But Manabu-san escaped.

311
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,911
The local police are looking for him.

312
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:41,192
It's a matter of time before he's caught.

313
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,312
Damn that Manabu.

314
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:46,262
I'll clock him good when they arrest him.

315
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:51,201
By the way, Manabu-san mentioned something about his retirement pay when he ran.

316
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,202
What was that about?

317
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:58,471
He was probably talking about how my dad reduced Manabu-san's retirement pay.

318
00:20:58,472 --> 00:20:59,452
Really?

319
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,861
He got himself injured and then quit.

320
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,981
But didn't he get injured on the job?

321
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:08,021
You're just a kid! What do you know?

322
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:11,672
I'm the one who suffered losses from his injury!

323
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:14,222
S-Sorry...

324
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,141
Good night.

325
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,772
Good night.

326
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:21,851
I'm stuffed.

327
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,691
A lot happened today.

328
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:25,081
Yeah.

329
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:27,831
The rest is the police's job.

330
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:32,331
Let's go home, get some sleep, and go sightseeing again tomorrow.

331
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,282
Yeah.

332
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:36,671
But before returning to the hotel, let's get some ramen to round off the night!

333
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,111
What?! You're going to eat more?

334
00:21:39,112 --> 00:21:40,842
Of course!

335
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:44,002
Let's go!

336
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:52,592
Why is this happening?

337
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,432
I just wanted my money.

338
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:13,242
You think you'll get away with this?

339
00:23:44,302 --> 00:23:46,832
Dad, how's Soichi-san?

340
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:50,422
Mister, what's that?

341
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,592
I didn't do it!

342
00:23:55,972 --> 00:24:00,472
Then why don't you explain why there was gold dust stuck to the president?

343
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:05,222
Seems like Rintaro-san really dislikes Manabu-san.

344
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,482
But if that's true, then why...?

345
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:13,112
The next episode of Conan is "The Young Kaga Lady's Mystery Tour, Part Two!"
