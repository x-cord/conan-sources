1
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:04,958
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:06,658
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:09,358
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:13,058
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:16,758
The Organization is trying to recover their member, Rena Mizunashi.

6
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:20,458
They sprung a clever trap.

7
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,358
The fake image of Rena Mizunashi

8
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:25,658
that the Organization aired on TV.

9
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:30,258
As a result, the FBI revealed her hospital room.

10
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:32,858
Now that we know, we'd better get out of here fast.

11
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,258
We will take the last resort

12
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:36,158
that we talked of this morning.

13
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:38,058
We're splitting up in three different cars

14
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:39,758
and going to confuse the Organization

15
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:42,158
while we make it out of this hospital.

16
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:43,758
It just dawned on me

17
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:45,558
after hearing what the boy had to say.

18
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:48,258
An excellent plan to deceive them

19
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,958
and get Rena Mizunashi out of here.

20
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,858
So, three cars that driven by Camel and two other agents,

21
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:57,158
start off with Rena Mizunashi inside.

22
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:00,158
It looks as if the plan had succeeded, however...

23
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:07,058
No, the one that we've gotta go after

24
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:10,158
is the third car that Vodka is pursuing.

25
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:11,558
Kir is in there.

26
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:19,458
Huh? Why?

27
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,958
Akai would never goof and overtake us in a single spurt

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,458
in an attempt to divert our attention

29
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,258
from the car he's guarding.

30
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:30,458
It's a trap that he used to lure us to him.

31
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,458
Trap.

32
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:37,858
But, boss...

33
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:41,258
The backseat of the car I'm pursuing is empty,

34
00:01:41,258 --> 00:01:43,858
and there are only two FBI agents sitting in the front.

35
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:48,258
It's true that an FBI agent is driving.

36
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:51,058
But the one sitting in the passenger's seat is Kir.

37
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:58,158
They expected us to assume that the unconscious Kir

38
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:02,258
would placed be on a stretcher in the back of the car.

39
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:05,058
So, they tried to making her hold a communicator

40
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,958
and put her in the passenger's seat to disguise her as an FBI agent.

41
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:13,158
But, wasn't that third car headed for the hospital again?

42
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:15,358
All the more, it made me come to this conclusion.

43
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:18,358
Although the FBI knew that we found out where Kir was,

44
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:21,258
they couldn't move her right away

45
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:25,258
because they had nowhere to take her in this situation.

46
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:27,658
So, they wanted to make it look like they moved her to another hospital

47
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:29,058
and returned to the same hospital

48
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:34,158
as if nothing had happened.

49
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,358
Because they figured...

50
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:39,358
we would never search that hospital again.

51
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,658
Sizzling hot suspense.

52
00:02:56,658 --> 00:02:59,258
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

53
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:00,958
It's a sink or swim contest.

54
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,758
Kir's secret is revealed.

55
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:04,258
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:06,058
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,958
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

58
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:38,650
"Red and Black Crash: Last Words."

59
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:09,056
What? A black Chevy and four motorbikes?

60
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:11,656
Don't tell me they found out?

61
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,456
Most probably yes.

62
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,156
But, I'm sure I can break them away

63
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:18,156
with my driving skills.

64
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,156
Hey, what's up, Camel?

65
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:54,756
Camel! What's up?

66
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:10,456
It's hurt.

67
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:13,956
Kir.

68
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,156
What's the meaning of this?

69
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:19,856
What's with the car?

70
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,556
I found out that you came to save me

71
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:24,856
through the wireless of the FBI,

72
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:28,356
so I hit him with the bomb case I was holding

73
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,956
and pulled the side brakes.

74
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,056
Which means that the FBI hospitalized you

75
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,456
but you were conscious?

76
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:37,456
Yes, I regained consciousness two or three days ago.

77
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:41,556
Although the FBI seems to have thought I was in a coma all this time.

78
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:44,656
Well, since we got Kir back

79
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,556
and all shall we split.

80
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:47,856
Yeah.

81
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:50,656
After we get rid of this stupid FBI agent

82
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:53,156
who took on this fat role all alone.

83
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:58,156
Kill him, Chianti.

84
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,156
Okay.

85
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,256
If you must blame someone,

86
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:07,556
blame the FBI who thought up such a stupid strategy...

87
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,756
Explosion?

88
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:23,856
Don't tell me he had the bomb in his pocket

89
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,256
without removing the fuse?

90
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,456
Maybe the fuse coincidentally returned in tact

91
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,256
from the impact of the crash.

92
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,356
Huh, an accident?

93
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:39,956
Oh my.

94
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:42,056
Oh no. Gotta call an ambulance!

95
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:44,856
The mob...

96
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,256
Kir, get inside my car.

97
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:47,256
We're splitting.

98
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,656
Succeeded...

99
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:13,656
Great, good work.

100
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:19,356
"Haido Central Hospital" -What?

101
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:20,556
You deliberately handed Rena Mizunashi

102
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,456
over to the Organization?

103
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:24,956
Yeah, that's why I told Camel

104
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:28,256
to boast about his driving technique.

105
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:32,156
So that he would be chosen as the driver of the car

106
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:34,556
that would help Rena Mizunashi escape from this hospital.

107
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,356
Then we made the Organization pick out the car

108
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:39,656
and made them get her back.

109
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:43,356
We made them think that they outfoxed us

110
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,056
after figuring out what our plan was.

111
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:47,156
I thought it out together with this boy here,

112
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:49,556
after racking out brains.

113
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:51,056
Then, what?

114
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:54,456
-Gorilla? -You mean this gorilla hitting me...

115
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:56,256
was also part of the plan?

116
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:59,356
Yeah, I ordered him to silence anyone

117
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,656
who would get in the way of this plan.

118
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:06,756
Besides, this time we were fortunately able to make them think

119
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:09,756
the driver died because of their bomb.

120
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:11,256
At that time...

121
00:09:13,956 --> 00:09:15,856
He had the car drift

122
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,156
in order to face the driver's seat towards the guardrail,

123
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,456
and stop the car at the best position possible for the door

124
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:23,056
to be for escaping.

125
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,356
Moreover, he had to match the timing of explosion

126
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:27,656
and escape at the right time.

127
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:30,356
Otherwise, he had no chance of succeeding.

128
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,056
I couldn't possibly have made you

129
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:37,656
who have no driving technique to do the job, right?

130
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:44,456
But, Rena Mizunashi was the only line connecting them to us.

131
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:48,056
Why did you hand her over to them just like that?

132
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:51,456
I made a contract with her last night.

133
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,156
I asked her to become not a plain line

134
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:56,656
but a fishing line for us the FBI.

135
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,156
I was maneuvered into doing so by this boy.

136
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:08,556
Oh... you never fail to surprise me, sonny.

137
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:11,256
I'm glad you're on our side, Mr. Akai.

138
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:12,756
Same here, sonny.

139
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:18,756
It's time you get some rest.

140
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:19,756
We've got a long night ahead of us.

141
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:21,356
Yes, sir.

142
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:36,456
And? What do you say, Mr. Akai?

143
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:40,356
Do you want to try this sink or swim plan?

144
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,956
Of course.

145
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,556
First, please bring the Prince

146
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:46,056
that will be waking Sleeping Beauty here.

147
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,856
Mr. Akai, emergency conference.

148
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,356
A strategy meeting?

149
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,356
Yes.

150
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:00,756
I sure hope they have a great plan.

151
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:18,456
Hey, wake up, Rena Mizunashi.

152
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,256
If you don't get up,

153
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:23,756
I can't ask you how Hidemi is right now.

154
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,256
Hey, wake up!

155
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:26,456
Wake up, please!

156
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,556
They're going to take you some place again, aren't they?

157
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,156
Before that happens, open your eyes!

158
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:35,456
Hey, I'm telling you! Open your eyes!

159
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:40,556
No, Ei-chan.

160
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:42,056
I told you, didn't I?

161
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:44,956
That you should never become a person who hurt other people.

162
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:46,956
Big sis?

163
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,856
Yes, right, Ei-chan.

164
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,556
So, don't ask any questions now

165
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:53,956
and just get out of this dangerous place.

166
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:55,456
Please.

167
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:58,656
No! You have type AB blood!

168
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:00,956
If you're big sis who gave me blood,

169
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:02,256
you should have type O blood!

170
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:04,156
Because I am her younger brother

171
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,656
who can only receive blood from others with type O!

172
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:10,356
Your blood changed to type AB

173
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,356
during the bone-marrow transplant

174
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,856
for treatment of leukemia.

175
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,756
Your older sister's bone-marrow was used for the transplant

176
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,056
was the H.L.A.

177
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:20,156
In other words, the bone-marrow of siblings

178
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,056
often have a higher matching rate of human leukocyte antigen.

179
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:27,656
At the same time, Eisuke's type O blood that was infected with leukemia

180
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:30,256
was destroyed using X-rays.

181
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:33,856
They transplanted bone-marrow from your sister who has AB blood.

182
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:37,156
That's why your blood type

183
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,056
changed from O to AB, Eisuke.

184
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,456
I am type AB?

185
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:45,156
Yep, I'm sure there's no mistake about it.

186
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:47,856
The nurse who was present during your surgery

187
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:50,556
told me that you had leukemia.

188
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:53,156
She also told me that the wound on your chest

189
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:56,956
is the mark left behind because of repeated needles injected there

190
00:12:56,956 --> 00:13:00,556
to examine the condition of the tumor cells within the bone-marrow.

191
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:02,456
But, if so...

192
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:04,056
Why?

193
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:06,556
Why didn't you tell me about it?

194
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:07,856
Why did you even change your name

195
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,556
and work as an announcer?

196
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,256
Ei-chan.

197
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:13,656
Sis!

198
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,856
It can't be helped.

199
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:19,056
Because your sister...

200
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:21,156
is a CIA agent.

201
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:31,597
CIA?

202
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:33,107
What're you talking about?

203
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:35,407
Why would you be doing something like that?

204
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,007
Not only your older sister,

205
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,007
but your father was one too.

206
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:40,407
Father too?

207
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:41,407
Yeah.

208
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:44,907
They snuck into a certain Organization to make investigations.

209
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:49,407
And, she was forced to become an announcer to suit their needs.

210
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:51,507
She pretended to be someone else,

211
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:53,207
and deliberately didn't explain anything to you

212
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,107
to keep you from coming to see her after seeing her on TV.

213
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:59,107
I guess that's what it was.

214
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:01,207
Well, it turned out the way she didn't expect

215
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,607
because you came to see her anyway.

216
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:07,807
Hey, hold it. I can't make it out.

217
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:10,807
What on earth is that certain Organization anyway?

218
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,607
Enough.

219
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:15,107
That's as far as you need to know.

220
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,307
Camel, do your thing.

221
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:21,807
-Yes, sir. -Huh? Hey...

222
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,107
I'm still not finished!

223
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:28,007
By the way, I think the strategy meeting is about to start.

224
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:31,307
Lock that boy inside a vacant room and go on ahead.

225
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:33,607
I'll be right over when I'm finished here.

226
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,607
Just do as I asked you to over the phone.

227
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,207
Roger.

228
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:41,507
So, do you know me?

229
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,607
Yes, I do,

230
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,007
Shuichi Akai.

231
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:48,307
The FBI agent that the Organization fears the most.

232
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:50,007
Okay, then I guess it won't take much time,

233
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:53,007
then I'll get right to the point.

234
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:55,407
Before that tell me,

235
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:59,007
how did you know that I was a CIA agent?

236
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:02,607
First, the method of detecting lies that you tried on me at the park

237
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:05,707
when you were interviewing Mr. Domon.

238
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,207
Don't tell me you followed me here?

239
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,807
Nope, I just happened to come here.

240
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,207
It's just a coincidence.

241
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:13,207
You tried to check whether I was lying

242
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,007
by checking my pulse,

243
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:17,407
steadiness of breathing and whether my pupils were dilated.

244
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:20,207
These are methods that the CIA usually use.

245
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:21,607
And later...

246
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:25,107
Thank you, you're a life-saver.

247
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,007
Thank you so very much.

248
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:31,607
You knowing that I was lying to you

249
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:33,707
about being there coincidentally,

250
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:35,707
but thanked me anyway, right?

251
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:36,707
You were actually saying,

252
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:39,407
thanks to you, I didn't end up killing Mr. Domon, right?

253
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:43,707
And besides, the words you mumbled before Gin and the others.

254
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:47,607
Our achievements never see the light.

255
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:50,907
But when we fail, everything is disclosed.

256
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:54,307
That's a CIA cliche, right?

257
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:58,207
Well, it seems that Bellmot sort of knew already.

258
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,707
Don't tell me you're...

259
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,807
like this?

260
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:06,607
That knocking was a play on words Vermouth

261
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:09,607
used for non official cover or NOC, wasn't it?

262
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:12,507
She wanted to ask if you were a CIA agent.

263
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:15,007
Actually back then a communicator and wiretap

264
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,707
was on the sole of your shoe.

265
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:18,807
It coincidentally happened to be there,

266
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:21,607
the one that you used trying to catch the prankster

267
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:22,707
who rung your doorbell and fled.

268
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:26,507
Oh I see.

269
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,707
But, how did you find out about father?

270
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:31,107
Since we already knew his name was Hondo,

271
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,607
it was simple.

272
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:34,907
Besides, this boy had already informed us

273
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:38,307
that he maybe a member of what was called the Company too.

274
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:42,907
But, you didn't think I could do it, did you?

275
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:44,707
That I could kill...

276
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:46,707
You own father, you mean?

277
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:47,907
Huh?

278
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:51,907
He bit his own wrist and shot himself under the chin.

279
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:55,707
Rather, he made it look that way, is more correct.

280
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:59,907
Your father, Ethern Hondo did so to protect his daughter.

281
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:03,907
He also prepared an MD that had a recording of him questioning you.

282
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:05,407
He made it just in case,

283
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:08,907
under the assumption that they found out you were a CIA agent.

284
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,307
Isn't that right?

285
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:13,607
Yes. It was all father's idea.

286
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:16,507
I was so involved in melting in with the Organization

287
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,207
that I couldn't handle anything more than that.

288
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:19,207
At the same time,

289
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,907
I wasn't planning to stay that long in the Organization.

290
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,807
Yes, my mission as a CIA agent

291
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,607
was to find a new person to act as connection

292
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:28,507
for my father who snuck into the Organization,

293
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,507
and introduce him to them.

294
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,207
The former person was killed

295
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:34,707
and all contacts were severed.

296
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:36,007
After all was done,

297
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,607
I was supposed to look like I died

298
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:41,607
and leave the Organization.

299
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:42,807
But...

300
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,907
He's the new connection.

301
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:49,607
Barney. You know him, don't you?

302
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:51,307
He'll be here soon.

303
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:54,907
Okay. You haven't been followed, have you?

304
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,207
No, I was taping a TV program,

305
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,107
but I said that I'd go to take a quick nap for about an hour

306
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:03,907
because I wasn't feeling well.

307
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,307
Since this place is near the station

308
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:08,607
as well as the next transaction site of the Organization,

309
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:10,807
I figured it was my chance to see you

310
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:13,107
since I heard you were coming.

311
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:14,607
Did you change your clothes?

312
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:17,207
No, I didn't.

313
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:18,607
Don't move.

314
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:21,007
Come on, father, nothing's on me.

315
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:22,207
Look.

316
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,207
It's a communicator.

317
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:28,007
I never had anything like that put on me before.

318
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,207
It's a specially developed item

319
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,807
and will vanish in 24 hours.

320
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,607
It's a bell that they use on newcomers to watch them.

321
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:43,507
That's a Porsche.

322
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,207
It's Gin.

323
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,607
Father.

324
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,807
Just what're you...

325
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:55,407
Endure it, this is the only way out.

326
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,507
You...

327
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,207
Listen, this is the story.

328
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:10,507
You found me who was acting suspicious,

329
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:12,407
so you pursued me and cornered me.

330
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:16,007
But, you were caught by me instead and interrogated.

331
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,507
And you bit my wrist,

332
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:20,607
took my gun and blew my head off.

333
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,107
If you shoot from under my chin,

334
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:25,107
the blood in my mouth won't be suspected.

335
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,407
In case for times like this,

336
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:30,607
I have an MD of me questioning you

337
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:33,207
in the chest pocket of my jacket.

338
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:37,707
All you have to do is say I didn't say anything.

339
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,107
And this is...

340
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:40,507
a truth serum.

341
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:42,407
I'll inject a little in you,

342
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:44,207
so they believe you.

343
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,807
I don't want you to go confessing everything, you see.

344
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,607
Don't give up, Hidemi.

345
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,307
If you keep waiting,

346
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,107
people on your side will surely appear.

347
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:57,707
Fulfill the mission for me!

348
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:05,107
Soon later Gin and Vodka came along.

349
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,207
I told them what father told me to say,

350
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,007
so I wasn't killed.

351
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:13,207
Barney who came later saw them

352
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:16,107
and killed himself on the spot.

353
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:18,207
Then, you wanted Pops...

354
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,607
to look for the prankster that kept ringing your doorbell,

355
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,107
because you wanted to find a new person to act as connector?

356
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:28,207
No, I just wanted to know how to contact the renown detective.

357
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:31,407
I wanted to ask him to guard Eisuke.

358
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:34,107
He kept calling the station repeatedly

359
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,407
that I thought he'd end up coming to see me one day.

360
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:41,007
Of course, I wrote him an honest mail,

361
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,707
telling him that approaching me

362
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:45,807
would mean getting involved with a dangerous organization.

363
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:49,907
I wasn't sure if he was going to believe me though.

364
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:53,607
But, maybe I should've wrote to you instead?

365
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:57,107
You knew that I had regained consciousness, didn't you?

366
00:20:57,107 --> 00:21:00,107
Yep. Remember the time I came back to this room

367
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:02,707
saying that I forgot something?

368
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:08,307
I realized back then.

369
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:09,907
Because the wrinkles of the sheets around your neck

370
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:14,207
were slightly moved from when I first left the room.

371
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,407
By the way, I also knew that Eisuke

372
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:20,107
was hiding some place in this hospital.

373
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:23,807
His classmate Nakamichi

374
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:25,907
just happened to be hospitalized here.

375
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:28,907
Because when I asked him if he saw Eisuke, he said no.

376
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:32,207
No, I didn't see Hondo,

377
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,707
but if it's a member of my soccer club Eisuke Aizawa,

378
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,607
he came to see me right away.

379
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:40,607
With only that much information, how?

380
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:43,607
Because all I said was Eisuke

381
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,207
and he knew that it was Eisuke Hondo that I was looking for

382
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:47,807
and not Eisuke Aizawa.

383
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,607
So I could tell that Nakamichi knew but was hiding it from me.

384
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,707
That's how I knew for sure

385
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:58,407
that he was letting Eisuke hide in his room.

386
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:01,507
You sure are really something.

387
00:22:01,507 --> 00:22:06,407
Yeah, he's awesome to the point of amazing even the FBI.

388
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:08,307
And what do you plan to do?

389
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:11,107
The Organization is coming to get me back, aren't they?

390
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:14,007
Yeah, this is what I propose.

391
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:18,007
I hope you're not going to tell me

392
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:22,007
to go back to that Organization again?

393
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,407
Of course.

394
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:26,507
That's exactly what I want you to do.

395
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:52,607
"Next Episode."

396
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:55,507
Rena Mizunashi returns to the Organization.

397
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,507
Although quite thin,

398
00:23:57,507 --> 00:24:00,807
the string that is drawn taut finally connects to them.

399
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,507
We must be extremely careful

400
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,407
and keep on the look-out

401
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:06,507
that this string is not severed.

402
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:09,807
However...

403
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:13,807
The ominous Friday the 13th arrives.

404
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:17,307
Next on Detective Conan,

405
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:21,307
"The Red and Black Crash: Suspicion."

406
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:39,007
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,607
Foreign talents.

408
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:42,907
This is the 500th episode that has been aired.

409
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:44,207
Thank you, everybody.

410
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:46,707
This is no more than a point of transit, though.
