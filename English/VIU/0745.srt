1
00:00:01,484 --> 00:00:02,784
Although we were planning to play tennis in Karuizawa,

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:05,084
it was cancelled since it began raining,

3
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:07,884
and we decided to go bowling.

4
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:12,684
So? Who is it that you want me to meet?

5
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:15,484
It's someone who's been waiting for 4 hours

6
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:17,284
at the tennis court in the pouring rain.

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,084
I think he'll be showing up soon

8
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:20,784
after he changes into dry clothes.

9
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:23,484
Stop keeping me in suspense and tell me.

10
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:27,484
I came all the way here in this rain on my motorbike, you know?

11
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:33,384
Who are you?

12
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:38,284
Jeet Kune Do?

13
00:00:38,284 --> 00:00:39,784
He dodged me?

14
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,784
Very interesting.

15
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:50,284
I'll beat you to a pulp!

16
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,684
No, Masumi!

17
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:53,884
He's the one!

18
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:58,084
The one whom Sonoko wanted you to meet!

19
00:00:58,084 --> 00:00:59,384
Although Masumi and Kyogoku

20
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:03,284
were about to have it out because of Sonoko,

21
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:05,284
we had a good time bowling with Jr. High School teachers

22
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:07,584
whom we became acquainted with.

23
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,084
However, the PE teacher

24
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:13,084
who was supposed to be sleeping in the car disappeared,

25
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:15,784
so we all ended up going to look for him.

26
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:22,984
What... What's the matter?

27
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,384
The... The toilet door was unlocked.

28
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:29,584
So I opened it, and inside it...

29
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:39,584
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

30
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,384
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

31
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,284
Masumi is suspiciously reading a mail?

32
00:01:43,284 --> 00:01:45,284
Clear Makoto Kyogoku of the charges against him!

33
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:46,784
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:48,584
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,884
His name is Detective Conan!

36
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,969
"Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part 2)"

37
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,198
"Saturday Bowl"

38
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,498
What? He was undoubtedly drowned to death?

39
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:43,498
-Really? -Yes, sir.

40
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:46,198
We got a report from the medical examiner

41
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:48,498
saying that water was found in the airway of the corpse.

42
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:52,598
But it doesn't matter if you made him pass out using a stun gun.

43
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:57,098
To drown such a strong man to death without even tying him up,

44
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:59,498
it'd require two to three guys to team up and kill him, right?

45
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:00,798
That's true.

46
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:03,398
Well, if it was the Iron Karate Man,

47
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:05,998
I think one person would have been enough.

48
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:08,998
What's with you? You mean you're still suspecting Makoto?

49
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,398
Not really.

50
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:13,098
Besides that, we received a report

51
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:14,898
that there was a strap-shaped surface imprint

52
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,098
on the lower abdominal part of the corpse.

53
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:18,298
-The lower abdominal part? -Yes.

54
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,598
The surface imprint wasn't found all around the hips,

55
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,798
so the culprit probably used the belt of the corpse

56
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:25,698
and carried it along.

57
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,398
I see.

58
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:31,498
That means the culprit has great muscular strength.

59
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:35,798
Like that of an Iron Karate Man.

60
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:39,298
I... I was just stating an instance.

61
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:41,398
It was an example.

62
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:44,198
Come to think of it, you said that the victim

63
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:46,298
was going through all kinds of things.

64
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,998
What happened?

65
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,398
"Sunami Masaki (29)" -Mr. Tanba was going to

66
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:54,098
"Jr. High Science Teacher" -get married to my younger sister,

67
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:56,698
"Michiko Monna (30)" -but his parents were against the marriage.

68
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:59,598
It seems that his parents had arranged a fiance

69
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,898
for him to get married to.

70
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:04,398
The two of them were shocked when they learned about it,

71
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:07,898
and they seemed to have considered eloping at one point.

72
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:11,198
Eventually, only my younger sister jumped into the water

73
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:14,198
and committed suicide.

74
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:17,098
Did you also know that she wanted to elope?

75
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:20,398
Yes, I received a mail from her.

76
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:23,398
It said, "We're going to journey off, just the two of us".

77
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:26,398
I received the same text mail from her as well,

78
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:29,898
since we were classmates and best friends.

79
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:31,398
It began since then, didn't it?

80
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:35,498
Mr. Tanba started getting violent each time he was drunk.

81
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:39,498
Yes. That's why I thought that he woke up

82
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:40,898
while we were bowling,

83
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:43,698
and got into a fight, and then...

84
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:47,998
Did you all come to this bowling alley a lot?

85
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:52,498
Yes. My late best friend loved bowling.

86
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:54,098
Come to think of it, the last time we came,

87
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:56,098
it was raining, too.

88
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:58,898
Inspector Yamamura!

89
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:01,198
A wet towel and four strange empty cans

90
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:05,198
were found in the trash can of the toilet.

91
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,298
-Empty cans? -Yes, sir.

92
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:10,398
The mouth of all four cans have burn marks on them.

93
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:13,198
Maybe somebody used them as ashtrays?

94
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:17,298
No, but it smelled like kerosene inside the cans.

95
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:19,198
Kerosene?

96
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,898
Wait! Conan?

97
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:26,398
"Parking lot"

98
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:30,998
Forensic officers!

99
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:33,898
Could you check out

100
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:36,298
-the shelf up there... -No! No!

101
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,098
Children should stay away.

102
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:42,598
But Pops Kogoro said that there may be something

103
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:45,598
behind those spare toilet paper rolls!

104
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:47,698
What an obstinate boy.

105
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,898
If the Sleeping Kogoro's asking us to do so...

106
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:54,998
There's a burn mark on the ceiling?

107
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,998
Hey! Pictures, take pictures!

108
00:06:56,998 --> 00:06:58,198
Okay!

109
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:00,898
It's just as I thought.

110
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:03,298
This explains why the area

111
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,298
below the toilet wall was strangely wet.

112
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:07,998
There's no mistake about it.

113
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:10,798
That person is the culprit.

114
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:15,298
It looks like he has arrived at the truth, too.

115
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,798
I've got to confirm whether my deduction is the same as his.

116
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:22,298
Recently, I've lost a bit of my confidence.

117
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,498
I've got a reply really quickly.

118
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:32,198
He said, "Who is he"?

119
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,598
I knew that was how he'd reply me.

120
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:45,098
"Mail received"

121
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,598
"This is him. Surprised? Masumi."

122
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:51,498
Here it comes.

123
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:58,398
"If it's him, there will be no problem"?

124
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:03,298
A fight! He got into a fight!

125
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,898
The victim who was drunk and asleep in the car,

126
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:08,998
got up and got into a fight with someone

127
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,998
at a pub he went to have another drink at.

128
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:14,498
Then, he was taken somewhere and was killed.

129
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:15,998
But you mentioned that

130
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:19,498
while you and everyone else went out searching for the victim,

131
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:23,798
nobody mentioned seeing the victim, right?

132
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:26,698
They were all just playing dumb!

133
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:29,798
If word spreads around that customers got into a fight at their shop,

134
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:32,498
the reputation of that shop would go down.

135
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:36,898
But I wonder why the culprit carried a stun gun around?

136
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:38,798
Besides, we don't even know

137
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:41,298
where and how he was drowned to death.

138
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:42,698
Moreover, it's totally incomprehensible

139
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:45,198
why the victim was taken from the car he was asleep in

140
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:50,098
over to the make-shift toilet at the same parking lot.

141
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:52,698
How would I know?

142
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,898
At any rate, the victim, Mr. Tanba,

143
00:08:55,898 --> 00:09:00,098
was brought to the car at the parking lot by Ms. Masaki

144
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:03,198
to sleep it off.

145
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,098
About an hour later,

146
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:08,998
Ms. Monna went to check on the situation in the car at the parking lot.

147
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:11,498
But by that time, he had left the car.

148
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:14,498
After hearing that Mr. Tanba was gone,

149
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:17,598
we went looking for him around the pubs.

150
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,998
Meanwhile, he got into a fight with somebody

151
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:21,998
and was drowned to death.

152
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:25,398
There's no mistake that when we returned to the parking lot,

153
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,698
he was already moved into the toilet there.

154
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:32,198
Well, it's not that this Iron Karate Man

155
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,198
who was asleep in a car in the same parking lot

156
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:38,998
is not suspicious either.

157
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:42,398
But taking into consideration that the culprit used a stun gun,

158
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:43,798
chances are that he's innocent.

159
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:46,898
That's why I told you a while ago

160
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:49,198
to carefully check out the pubs in this area!

161
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:51,098
I think you're right.

162
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,598
Inspector Yamamura!

163
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,998
The preparations for the experiment are ready!

164
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:56,798
Experiment?

165
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:58,898
Yes, sir. Detective Mouri indicated

166
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,398
that it was necessary to do so in order to solve the case,

167
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:04,398
and forensics said that you gave permission

168
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:05,998
to carry out the experiment.

169
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:07,798
What are you saying?

170
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:10,798
I don't remember saying anything like that!

171
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:13,398
But according to the forensic officers,

172
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:15,298
that boy over there...

173
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:17,098
At... At any rate, let's go and see it!

174
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,998
I love experiments!

175
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:20,898
You're still a first grade brat in elementary school,

176
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:23,498
but you've already done experiments?

177
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,998
But he might have been doing some at Doc's house.

178
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:29,298
Well, let us go and hear what they have to say.

179
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:30,698
I guess so.

180
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:38,498
"If it's him, there will be no problem."

181
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:39,998
Why?

182
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:42,998
How would he know that?

183
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:45,698
How did brother know about him?

184
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:54,365
Hey, hey! What is this?

185
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:57,565
The area around the toilet is soaked in water.

186
00:10:57,565 --> 00:11:00,265
But you were the one who instructed us

187
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:02,965
to do so, didn't you, Detective Mouri?

188
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,865
You told us to place a towel over the drain

189
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:08,365
to stop the rain water and let it accumulate!

190
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:09,665
I see.

191
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:13,065
They said that this area is tilted because of ground sinkage.

192
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:17,565
Water accumulated because of the rain that was pouring until a while ago.

193
00:11:17,565 --> 00:11:21,565
But the important details of the crime scene will go down the drain.

194
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,265
If it's the toilet that the corpse was found in,

195
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,965
it's been moved to another place

196
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:27,265
-and is under investigation now. -What?

197
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:29,765
This is another make-shift toilet.

198
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,365
As for this, I was also informed

199
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:34,665
that Detective Mouri had instructed us to do so.

200
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:38,165
Like I said, I never...

201
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:46,965
Dad! There's a water puddle over there!

202
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,965
Like I was saying, I never care

203
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:52,965
whether my slacks are wet or not

204
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:56,265
if I can show you how this trick works.

205
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,365
Trick?

206
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:01,365
Don't tell me that he was drowned with the rain water

207
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:03,465
that was accumulated?

208
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:06,365
But for this much rain water to accumulate,

209
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:09,065
it would take quite a lot of time.

210
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,965
Even if a stun gun was used to knock him out,

211
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,265
to make a grown man drown forcibly in a place like this

212
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:18,365
without even tying him up...

213
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:19,365
The culprit has to be

214
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:23,165
someone with great muscular strength after all, right?

215
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:26,265
I'm telling you that Makoto isn't the culprit!

216
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:28,465
Right, Makoto?

217
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:30,265
Makoto!

218
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,265
-He fled! -Let him be!

219
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:35,465
He probably went to use the toilet or something.

220
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:38,165
Besides, he has nothing to do with this case.

221
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:40,465
-But... -Why?

222
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:43,365
Because muscular strength isn't necessary to carry out this trick.

223
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:46,065
The culprit locked the victim in the toilet,

224
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:50,465
and drowned him without even laying a hand on him.

225
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:53,765
Just like magic.

226
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:57,965
Magic...

227
00:12:57,965 --> 00:13:00,465
Seeing is believing.

228
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,665
Let's actually try it out

229
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:06,965
and test whether a person can actually drown in the toilet.

230
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,865
And of course, Inspector Yamamura,

231
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:10,765
you're the one to be experimented on.

232
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,765
What? Me?

233
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:15,165
You'll be fine

234
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:18,865
since some oxygen has been prepared for you.

235
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,765
Isn't this a can of oxygen?

236
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,265
Hey, tomboy.

237
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:26,765
You help set up the trick.

238
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,665
You know how to work this trick too, don't you?

239
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:31,865
Yeah, sort of.

240
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:35,865
First, put the victim into the toilet.

241
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,965
Seal the ventilation hole on the back of the toilet

242
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:40,465
with masking tape.

243
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:43,565
Next, fill four empty cans with kerosene

244
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:46,065
and cover the mouth of the cans with cloth.

245
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:48,265
Set fire to the cloth,

246
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,365
then line them up on the shelf inside the toilet.

247
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,865
Finally, all you have to do

248
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:57,265
is close the door and seal it tight with masking tape.

249
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:59,965
So, how did he drown?

250
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,465
Well, just watch.

251
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,365
Geez.

252
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:19,965
The water only rose up to my ankles.

253
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:23,665
How the heck can someone drown in a place like this?

254
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:27,965
But it sure is getting hot in here.

255
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:29,465
The fire went out.

256
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:36,865
What? What's happening inside?

257
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:47,065
Watch closely now.

258
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:56,765
Are you all right?

259
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:00,565
Mr. Mouri, just what do you think you're making me do?

260
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:04,065
I was about to drown to death, you know?

261
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:07,665
But why was there so much water inside the toilet?

262
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:10,965
It's because the air pressure inside the toilet dropped.

263
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:14,365
Don't you remember doing it in science class?

264
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:16,865
You pour water into a deep dish

265
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:18,765
with a burning candle inside it,

266
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:20,465
and place a beaker over it.

267
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:22,365
Then the flame of the candle goes out.

268
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:27,265
And before you know it, water is sucked up into the beaker.

269
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,265
It works in the same way.

270
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:31,665
The cans were left burning on the shelf

271
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,365
of the toilet that was sealed.

272
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,065
The air becomes warm and expands,

273
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:38,365
thus decreasing the density of oxygen.

274
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:41,165
The flame will then go out, and the air is cooled and decreased.

275
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:43,265
Because of the decrease in air,

276
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:47,765
rain water is sucked up through the ventilation hole under the door.

277
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:51,165
This explanation is correct, isn't it?

278
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:56,265
Our science teacher, Ms. Sunami Masaki.

279
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:58,965
While you were bringing Mr. Tanba

280
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:00,965
to the car at the parking lot,

281
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:03,765
you first made him go inside the make-shift toilet.

282
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:06,865
You probably said something like you forgot the key to the car,

283
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,165
so you told him to wait in the toilet

284
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:11,465
and take shelter from the rain.

285
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,965
After you got him inside,

286
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:15,565
you immediately knocked him out using a stun gun,

287
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,665
pulled a string through the back of his belt,

288
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:20,065
and tied it onto the joint of the lid of the toilet seat

289
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:22,965
so that Mr. Tanba couldn't stand up.

290
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,965
You put the four cans with kerosene inside

291
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,865
on the shelf of the toilet,

292
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:29,065
locked the door with a padlock,

293
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:31,265
and posted an "Out of Order" sign.

294
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:33,965
After that, you sealed the ventilation hole behind the toilet

295
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:35,665
with masking tape,

296
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:38,465
and place a towel onto the drain of the parking lot

297
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:42,265
to accumulate rain water. Now, all is set.

298
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:43,865
You lied to Ms. Monna,

299
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:46,965
telling her that he fell asleep in the car

300
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,065
and waited for the rain water to accumulate.

301
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:52,165
After a while, Ms. Monna who is a worrier,

302
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:56,365
went to check on Mr. Tanba like you had calculated.

303
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:59,665
Well, if she didn't voluntarily do so,

304
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:04,765
you were probably planning to go with her to check up on him anyway.

305
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:06,165
Just as you expected,

306
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:09,865
she came back to tell you that Mr. Tanba wasn't in the car.

307
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,765
You, who ended up having to search the parking lot

308
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,465
confirmed that enough rain water had accumulated,

309
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,465
tore off the sign on the toilet door,

310
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,465
unlocked the padlock,

311
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:22,865
lit the cans that were on the shelf,

312
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,865
and sealed the door using masking tape.

313
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:27,565
Later, just as in the experiment,

314
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:29,865
rain water was sucked into the toilet.

315
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:32,465
And just about when Mr. Tanba drowned,

316
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:36,165
you and Ms. Monna were searching around the pubs.

317
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:38,865
Having established your alibi in this way,

318
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,065
your goal was achieved.

319
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:43,765
After that, you returned once again to the parking lot,

320
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:45,765
removed the towel from the drain,

321
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,865
drained off the accumulated rain water,

322
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:50,165
and tore off all the masking tape.

323
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:52,765
You threw the burned cans on the shelf into the trash can,

324
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,165
and cut the string on the belt.

325
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:58,365
In order to hide the fact that water had accumulated in the toilet,

326
00:17:58,365 --> 00:17:59,465
you inserted the toilet paper

327
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:03,165
that was on the shelf onto the toilet paper holder.

328
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,065
Then, you screamed and acted like

329
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,465
you had just found the corpse.

330
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:10,265
The key to this crime

331
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:12,965
is how quickly the corpse was found.

332
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:14,465
If discovery was delayed,

333
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:17,565
and the longer the time span of estimated time of death was prolonged,

334
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:20,265
your alibi would go down the drain.

335
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,165
That's why the only possible culprit is you,

336
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,665
the first person who discovered the corpse.

337
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:28,265
You were also the only one who had time

338
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:31,165
to accumulate the rain water.

339
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:32,665
Well, I guess

340
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:35,865
forensics would have found the masking tape with your fingerprints

341
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,465
from the toilet tank by now.

342
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,465
If it wasn't in the trash can,

343
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:42,365
you must've flushed in down the toilet.

344
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:45,865
And masking tape is hard to peel off unless you use your bare hands.

345
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,165
That's correct, isn't it?

346
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:50,565
Sleeping Kogoro?

347
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:51,865
Yeah.

348
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,265
This must be some kind of a mistake!

349
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:59,465
Because... Because Sunami had no reason to kill Mr. Tanba.

350
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:01,365
I did.

351
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,465
That man left my best friend to die

352
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:09,765
and didn't do anything about it.

353
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:12,665
That was my motive.

354
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,665
Best... Best friend?

355
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:16,765
Do you mean my younger sister?

356
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:20,565
Yes, the person who was engaged to marry that man,

357
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:23,365
your younger sister.

358
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:27,965
But my sister jumped off a cliff by the ocean.

359
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,665
She even left a suicide note, too.

360
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:33,065
You received a text mail from her before that.

361
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:36,265
It said, "We're going to journey off, just the two of us".

362
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:37,265
Yes.

363
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:40,165
That wasn't a mail saying she was going to elope,

364
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,365
but a mail telling you that she was going to die

365
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:45,865
and crossover along with him!

366
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:47,065
And yet...

367
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:50,565
And yet, that man suddenly got scared of dying

368
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,265
and left the cliff without even going in

369
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:54,665
to save her from drowning.

370
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:57,065
Is that true?

371
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:58,665
Yes.

372
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:03,365
Tanba blabbered on and on about it to me when he was drunk.

373
00:20:03,365 --> 00:20:08,365
He cried, saying that he was a hopeless coward.

374
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:13,365
Well. Although he was that kind of a guy,

375
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:17,165
my best friend loved him enough to die for him.

376
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:21,565
So I led him

377
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:25,265
to the water where she's waiting for him.

378
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:49,465
What? You went to look for the culprit?

379
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:51,665
-Yes. -But...

380
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:54,565
you didn't know who the culprit was, did you?

381
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,465
And how did you...

382
00:21:56,465 --> 00:22:00,965
No. Since the culprit seemed to be pretty strong,

383
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:05,465
I thought that I could tell from the murderous air that he gives off.

384
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:08,865
And I'll bet you thought that if you had the chance,

385
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:12,365
you wanted to compete with him?

386
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:17,165
Well, sort of...

387
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:19,365
He was going to fight it out.

388
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,665
Well, just as expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

389
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:29,065
You solved the case so perfectly!

390
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,965
Well...

391
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:33,065
Just as expected of the real me.

392
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:35,265
But regarding that experiment...

393
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:36,765
-That klutz is back... -if you had told me about it beforehand,

394
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:39,465
-I could've acted a lot more awesome. -to his usual way of talking.

395
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:42,365
But I guess she was the one

396
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:45,265
who got the frosting and the cake.

397
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:47,165
Come to think of it, dad.

398
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,665
Hurry up and change your slacks or you'll catch a cold.

399
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:55,665
You sat on a water puddle when making your deduction.

400
00:22:57,165 --> 00:23:00,165
What... What's this? I'm drenched!

401
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:01,565
But Pops, you said,

402
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:05,365
"I never care whether my slacks are wet or not".

403
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:08,065
I said something like that?

404
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:09,465
You did, you did!

405
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:11,765
You were super awesome!

406
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,665
Super awesome?

407
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:17,765
A mail? It's from brother.

408
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:23,465
I see. So that's the story.

409
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:29,465
A postscript?

410
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:32,365
"P.S. Have you already met the wizard?"

411
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:40,365
Well, I guess so.

412
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,365
I heard about it, you know!

413
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:47,165
Thief Kid is coming again, isn't he?

414
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:49,065
Thief Kid?

415
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:55,365
Mr. Kyogoku and Thief Kid are going to confront each other?

416
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:58,865
Well, you'll see once we get there!

417
00:23:58,865 --> 00:24:01,265
"Okay, let's have it out fair and square. Thief Kid"

418
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:04,465
Yes! I will protect it over my dead body

419
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:06,965
with these fists of mine!

420
