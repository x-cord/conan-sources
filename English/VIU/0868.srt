Thank you. You're a great help.

hurry and close this shop down, will you?

Yes. I only found out recently, too.

-What? -What?

97
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,526
But there aren't any rails.

98

That's not it. The wheels move in place.

I see.

100
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,326
And when is it going to move?

101
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:13,526
I hear it moves twice a day at 11:00 and 3:00.

102
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:15,626
We've still got a little more time.

Mitsuhiko, what's that?

112
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:40,826
I borrowed it from my father.

113
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,926
I wanted to take a picture when the locomotive starts moving.

114

Yes. You can count on me.

117
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:55,726
We're waiting for the locomotive to start moving.

00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,326
Is that right?

119
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,526
What are doing here, Mr. Ichiro?

120
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:01,426
Since I work the late shift today,

121
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,527
I thought that I'd take a walk around and kill the time.

124
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:28,427
It was!

125
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,926
-The shop! -What?

126
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:36,627

I wonder if Mr. Tamaki's all right?

He's in no danger. I'm sure he'll be fine.

I'm glad.

"Tamaki Used Bookshop"

135
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,333
The clock stopped at 3:00.

136
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:26,432
It's the same time when we were all watching the locomotive.

137
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,733
That's why we didn't hear this place collapsing.

138
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,732
Judging from the circumstances,

139
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,232
the shelf at the very end collapsed

140
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:41,132
and the rest fell one by one domino style.

141
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,632
After all, the deterioration was pretty bad.

142
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,533
I guess this was an accident waiting to happen.

All right, all of you.

You've come to visit me?

151
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,632
Yes. Are you all right?

152
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:19,432
Yeah, it's just a slight concussion.

153
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,332
I should be out of the hospital soon.

154
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,332
That's good to hear.

155
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,732
How unfortunate that the bookshelves fell down.

156
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:32,932
Well, I'm sure glad that no customers got hurt.

157
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,832
I guess I was lucky.

158
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,932
What?

159
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:39,932
The truth is, I wasn't supposed to be at the shop that time.

160
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,632
I left the shop to purchase books,

161
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:46,332
but I realized partway that I forgot my wallet.

162
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,932
When I went back to get it, this happened.

163

I see.

164
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:55,532
If I'd closed down the shop like Ichiro told me to...

165
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,432
What? Are you going to close down the shop?

166
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:01,532
I did think it was time to quit,

167
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,932
but I just couldn't make up my mind.

168
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,432
Although the accident was unlucky,

00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,533
it gave me a good chance to make up my mind.

170
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,332
Well, I guess that's an appropriate choice.

171
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,632
Ai.

172
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:16,632
That shop is much too deteriorated.

173
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:18,932
If they want to return it to how it was before,

174
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:21,832
they would have to renovate from the foundation

175
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,532
and that would cost several millions of yen.

176
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:29,332
They don't look like they have that much money.

177
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,632
It's just as she says.

178
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:35,132
Then what about the books?

179
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:38,232
It's sad, but I'll auction them.

180
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,132
Then I know that the books

181
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,033
will go to the person who wants them.

182
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,632
That's right!

183
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,032
Would you like to look at the pictures?

184
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,732
We took a lot of pictures of the locomotive.

185
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,432
Really?

186
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,233
I'd like to see them, then.

187
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,733
They're good pictures.

188
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,432
This is the best picture.

189
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,233
I think so, too.

190
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:12,333
That picture... Will you show it to me?

191
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,233
What's the matter?

192
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,732
Thank you very much...

193
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,232
I heard you went to visit Dad at the hospital.

194
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:33,332
Yes, it was a slight concussion so he'll be out soon.

195
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,532
I see.

196
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:37,433
But he says he's going to close down the shop.

197
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,332
You don't look too happy.

198
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,532
What?

199
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,432
You wanted him to close down the shop, didn't you?

200
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,432
Well yeah, but...

201
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,533
Ichiro.

202
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,833
Michiko.

203
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,932
She's my girlfriend, I guess.

204
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,832
What do you mean by "I guess"?

205
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,732
"Michiko Yoshikawa (27)" -I'm Michiko Yoshikawa.

206
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,232
Nice to meet you all.

207
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,232
Hello...

208
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:06,532
What are you all doing here?

209
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,032
They went to visit Dad at the hospital

210
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,532
and came to tell me how he is.

211
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,732
Is your father hospitalized?

212
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,732
Yeah. He hurt himself in an accident.

213
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,132
Is he all right?

214
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,632
The old man is fine.

215
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,733
I see. I'm glad.

216
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,632
You're his girlfriend?

217
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,132
Yes, I am.

218
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,132
We've been going out for 5 years already.

219
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,332
What? That long?

220
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:39,032
What do you like about Mr. Ichiro?

221
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:41,532
Gosh, you're precocious.

222
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,632
I guess I like him because he's kind.

223
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:47,232
And how much he cares for his father.

224
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,332
He sure didn't look like it.

225
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,332
They were arguing at the shop, too.

226
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,832
He's awkward,

227
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,533
especially in front of his father.

228
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:00,833
Thanks for waiting.

229
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,532
This is delicious.

230
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:12,032
I have something to tell you later after work.

231
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,332
Tonight, I have to...

232
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,332
You're going to visit you father in the hospital, right?

233
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,832
-I'll go with you. -I'm sorry.

234
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,832
There's a lot of preparations to be made and paper works to fill out.

235
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,032
Can we meet tomorrow?

236
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:27,932
Okay. Call me when you're settled.

237
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,033
Keep up the good work.

238
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:35,732
Don't worry about the shop.

239
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,932
I'll wait as long as you need me to.

240
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:42,032
Tell your father that I can't wait to see him well again.

241
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,332
Okay.

242
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,133
-Bye. -All right.

243
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,333
Wait. What did she mean when she said "shop"?

244
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:53,732
Michiko and I are planning to open a cafe.

245
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:58,032
I'm working here to earn money for the cafe and train.

246
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,732
I see.

247
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,233
If that happens, Mr. Yujiro will be alone and lonely, won't he?

248
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,632
I really wish he would close down the shop

249
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:09,732
while I can still look after him.

250
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:12,032
You were saying the same thing before,

251
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,933
but is there a reason why you want to close down the bookshop?

252
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,732
A bookshop requires heavy work load

253
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,632
so it's a burden for aged bodies.

254
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:24,132
I was worried about making Dad work

255
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,732
in a deteriorated shop like that all alone.

256
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:29,332
Well, although there was an unfortunate accident,

257
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,833
it all worked out the way you wanted to, right?

258
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,632
I guess things have settled.

259
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,232
Ai, you shouldn't have said that.

260
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,832
Really?

261
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,233
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,133
Don't go in there, it's dangerous.

263
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,433
Conan?

264
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:56,633
And...

265
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,633
Mr. Ichiro, what are you doing here?

266
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:09,032
I dropped something when I came here this afternoon.

267
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,632
I was looking for it.

268
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,432
Without even turning on the lights?

269
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,732
More importantly, why are you here?

270
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,532
It's dark already, so you should head home.

271
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:21,432
Aren't you the one who triggered the accident that happened?

272
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,832
What?

273
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,032
The accident couldn't have happened

274
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:27,232
if there wasn't something intentional behind it.

275
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:30,032
What are you talking about, Conan?

276
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,833
Try to remember.

277
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:36,932
There were no books in the last bookshelf, right?

278
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,532
Then do you think that empty bookshelf

279
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:45,132
can make all the other bookshelves fall?

280
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:48,232
You're right.

281
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:51,032
Since that entire place was deteriorated,

282
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:56,232
I see nothing strange about accidents like that happening.

283
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:59,032
Besides when the bookshelves fell, I was...

284
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:02,132
You were with us.

285
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,332
This picture was taken at 3:00 sharp

286
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,532
when the locomotive started moving.

287
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:09,532
And from looking at the broke clock at the bookshop,

288
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:13,232
the accident happened at the same time.

289
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,532
See?

290
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,232
So it would've been impossible for me

291
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,232
to push the bookshelves down at that time.

292
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,932
Maybe not directly,

293
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,932
but if you use a trick, it's possible.

294
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,632
Trick? What's that?

295
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,633
Take a good look at this picture.

296
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,232
It looks like an ordinary group picture to me.

297
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:36,732
This picture was actually taken by continuous shooting mode.

298
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,732
Let me play it for you.

299
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,232
Please watch the movement of the butterfly

300
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,433
that you see at the corner.

301
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,632
Don't you think that the movement of this butterfly is odd?

302
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:57,632
It's weird that it's not flapping its wings,

303
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:01,233
but it suddenly jumps into the air.

304
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,032
I think that the butterfly was on a string

305
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:11,232
that was not in sight and bounced up because of impact.

306
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,333
Mr. Ichiro.

307
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,532
You had the wheels of the locomotive and the bookshelf

308
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,132
connected by a string, right?

309
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:22,333
When the wheels of the locomotive start turning at 3:00...

310
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:49,532
The bookshelves will fall one after the other.

311
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:53,432
After the wheels wind the string to some extent,

312
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:57,532
the string was cut and the butterfly bounced up.

313
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,332
When you came over to us,

314
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,532
you had a leaf on you

315
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:05,933
because you went into the bush to pass the string through.

316
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:09,332
You're wrong.

317
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:13,133
Then show me what you're hiding behind your back.

318
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,632
If my deduction is correct,

319
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,332
what you're hiding is the evidence

320
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,532
you used to cause the accident at the bookshop.

321
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,032
Am I wrong?

322
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:26,232
You wouldn't do anything bad

323
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,332
because you were so kind to us!

324
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,733
Right?

325
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:42,132
There are burnt and scratched parts everywhere.

326
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:46,133
I'm sure they will match the marks found on the bookshelf.

327
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,032
Enough already.

328
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,432
I did it.

329
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:53,732
It's a lie.

330
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:57,232
You would never think of killing Mr. Yujiro.

331
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,032
Mitsuhiko.

332
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,032
He wasn't trying to kill him.

333
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,032
Mr. Yujiro has said before,

334
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:07,732
he just happened to go back to the shop to get his wallet.

335
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,232
Now that you mentioned it, yes.

336
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:13,432
Mr. Ichiro just tried to destroy the bookshelves.

337
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:17,732
But Mr. Yujiro unfortunately got messed up in it.

338
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,732
I really did something stupid.

339
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,432
Then why did you do something like this?

340
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:27,632
I didn't want Dad to push himself any further.

341
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,032
What?

342
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,632
He wouldn't listen to me no matter what I said.

343
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:35,133
I thought that he would stop working if the shop disappeared.

344
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:42,732
After that, Mr. Ichiro confessed what he did

345
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,033
and turned himself into the police.

346
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,332
This used to be Tamaki Used Bookshop, right?

347
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,333
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

348
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,932
Welcome.

349
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,332
Oh, my.

350
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,633
You're the children from back then.

351
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,032
Here you are.

352
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,632
Mr. Yujiro!

353
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:33,332
Thank you for your help.

354
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,832
Mr. Ichiro.

355
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:35,833
Long time no see.

356
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,832
You got to open the cafe that you have always wanted.

357
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,932
Yeah.

358
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:43,932
We talked it over and decided that it was the best for us three.

359
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:46,232
It's a really nice shop.

360
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,532
Don't you think so too, Ai?

361
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,733
Well, I guess so.

362
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,832
Thank you.

363
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:58,732
Mr. Ichiro was taken into the custody of the police for a while,

364
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:01,432
but since Mr. Yujiro understood how Mr. Ichiro felt,

365
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:04,432
he did not file claim.

366
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,633
Therefore, Mr. Ichiro was acquitted.

367
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,233
That's right.

368
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,232
These are for you.

369
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:17,432
I didn't get the chance to give them to you back then.

370
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:20,032
"The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes" -No joke!

371
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,532
Are you sure it's all right?

372
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,533
Yeah.

373
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,332
All right!

374
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,232
I want that one.

375
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:28,533
Me, too.

376
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,933
Come on. Didn't you guys get your own books?

377
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:36,232
-I want that one! -Hey, wait!

378
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:37,832
No way! Absolutely not!

379
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,632
-Don't fight, you guys! -I said no!

380
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:41,733
Let go!

381
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,032
"Next Episode"

382
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:46,132
Where did he go?

383
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,433
Conan went out with Ai and the other kids.

384
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,633
He's seriously hurt, but still breathing.

385
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:12,733
Next Conan, "Conan Disappears Over a Cliff (Part 1)"
