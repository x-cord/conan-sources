1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,138
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,038
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:05,338
A fun-filled masquerade party suddenly

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,438
takes a turn and turns into a homicide!

5
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:09,438
A sad story of a clown.

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,938
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,838
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,839
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:59,026
How about it? Pretty good, don't you think?

10
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:03,525
You do know that huge theme park called "Anime Land", right?

11
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:06,825
I was appointed one-day theme park chief there.

12
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,125
I figured that it's no fun just doing the part,

13
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:10,325
so I decided to add some "fizz" to it.

14
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:13,225
That surprise "fizz" that I added took on extremely well.

15
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:16,025
And I was asked to be one-day theme park chief the next year,

16
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:17,525
the year following and forever!

17
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,525
I'm going to come rent costumes again when the time comes

18
00:02:19,526 --> 00:02:20,726
so don't go out of business!

19
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,525
Nobody said anything like that.

20
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:30,126
Because you're strange old man, they couldn't differ you from an idiot.

21
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:37,926
"Picture Mail from a Clown."

22
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,625
I guess this is good.

23
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,825
I'll give it to you as a gift, with my autograph on it.

24
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,325
No, thank you.

25
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:47,825
What's this dance?

26
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:50,825
This was taken around 3 pm when the earthquake occurred.

27
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:52,625
It sure was a big shake.

28
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,826
I'm sure that was about five on the the seismic intensity scale.

29
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:03,725
Are you all one-day theme park chief?

30
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,825
"Minoru Kijima (30)" -No.

31
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:06,625
"Make-up artist" -We going to a party.

32
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:09,025
They're engagement party for these two!

33
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:11,225
Oh, a costume party?

34
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,425
"Jiro Ishikawa (28)" -Well, it's quite embarrassing, though.

35
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,425
"Cameraman" -But, there's a person saying that "a mere party is boring."

36
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:18,525
"Yoko Nakamura (25)" -We can't refuse the request,

37
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:20,225
"Fashion model" -because she's a big shot.

38
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:22,525
Smiling on the outside, crying on the inside.

39
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:26,126
Tears are hidden by make-up, just like a clown.

40
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:29,025
Oops, I forgot the hat.

41
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:32,425
I wonder what kind of costume I should wear next time.

42
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:34,226
This? No, maybe this...

43
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:38,225
It's from Ms. Umeda.

44
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,125
It's from the host of the party.

45
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:42,225
I was surprised at the earthquake

46
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:45,225
but preparations for the party are in progress.

47
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,525
The chief editor hates earthquakes.

48
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:50,126
She said, "This is my costume."

49
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:53,225
A clown.

50
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,726
Yes, this is the chief editor, Umeda.

51
00:03:56,726 --> 00:03:58,725
Great, don't you think?

52
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,325
It's a mail from Ms. Umeda

53
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:02,325
saying that she'll leave the door open,

54
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,025
so to come in on your own.

55
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:05,425
Roger.

56
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:08,326
It's 4.30 pm now, so we'll get there at 5 pm sharp.

57
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,725
A party.

58
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:17,825
Well then, kid.

59
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,425
Let's go play pachinko,

60
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,125
and go eat something good afterwards.

61
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:23,725
Yes!

62
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,125
Excuse me.

63
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,225
Could you keep this for us too?

64
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,925
Okay.

65
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:30,125
See you then.

66
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:31,526
Bye.

67
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:40,425
What about going to eat something good?

68
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:43,225
You used all the money you had on pachinko.

69
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:45,225
Talk about heartless.

70
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:48,525
What's the big deal about picking up balls on the floor?

71
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:50,725
What a wretched world, really.

72
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:52,726
I wonder who's more wretched.

73
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:07,725
Yes. A picture of a woman dressed in a clown outfit was displayed

74
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:10,826
on the women's cell phone at around 4.30 pm.

75
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:25,125
The cause of death is suffocation from the neck being choked.

76
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:27,025
In other words this is murder by strangulation.

77
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,726
This is the woman I saw on the display of the cell phone.

78
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:36,225
Mr. Mouri had seen the mail from the victim at 4.30 pm.

79
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:38,425
The dead body was found at 5 pm.

80
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:40,825
Judging from various angles,

81
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:44,825
I guess it would be safe to say that she was killed between 4 pm and 5 pm.

82
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:47,225
Hey, what do you mean by various angles?

83
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:50,525
Conan, sticking your nose in from the side again.

84
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,725
I'm sorry, just ignore him.

85
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,425
Oh no, it's okay.

86
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:58,725
The muscles of people become hard when they die.

87
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,825
It's rigor mortis, right? I read about it in a book.

88
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:06,025
The body usually starts to harden from about 2 hours after death.

89
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:08,425
But, if outside during summer

90
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:11,825
or in places that are warm like this room

91
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:13,826
where the heater is on, it starts much faster.

92
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:19,225
But, this person has begun to harden at all.

93
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:23,425
Which means not much time has passed since she died.

94
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:24,925
Since it's 5.30 pm now,

95
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,925
we can deduced that she died after 4.30 pm,

96
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:30,025
that is, about an hour ago.

97
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:34,125
And, who is this Ms. Umeda?

98
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:38,125
A competent chief editor of a women's fashion magazine.

99
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:42,725
Ms. Kijima who found the corpse is a popular make-up artist.

100
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,325
The victim is the one who found him

101
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:47,825
and brought him to where he is now.

102
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,825
And, Mr. Ishikawa who was with her,

103
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,525
is a cameraman for that magazine.

104
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:55,426
Likewise. Yoko Nakamura, who was with her used to be a fashion model.

105
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:01,025
Rings and necklaces seem to be missing

106
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:03,726
from the victim's jewelry box.

107
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:09,125
Maybe the young man that we saw stole them?

108
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,925
Did they see the killer?

109
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:16,125
They seem to have seen a man fleeing out of the condo

110
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,325
when they all got here.

111
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:19,025
It was 5 pm.

112
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:21,225
Just when we parked the car in the parking lot

113
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:23,526
and was heading for the condo.

114
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:28,526
He was wearing a black leather jacket.

115
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:31,325
A robber?

116
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,025
Looked like it.

117
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,425
Or, maybe a killer.

118
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:36,925
Come off it, Mr. Kijima.

119
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:38,126
He's only kidding.

120
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,825
Good evening, Chief editor.

121
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:43,125
Wow, it sure is warm.

122
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,525
It's cold outside, so it sure is relieving.

123
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:47,825
What's this?

124
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:49,826
Footprints? Don't tell me that!

125
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:55,925
Chief editor, there are footprints on the corridor,

126
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:58,026
but what seems to be the matter?

127
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:00,626
Chief editor?

128
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:02,826
Chief editor!

129
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:06,125
Don't move around!

130
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:08,425
We don't want to erase the killer's footprints.

131
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:09,526
Where'd the phone?

132
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,425
Darn!

133
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:19,325
The killer did this.

134
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,425
I didn't bring my cell phone with me.

135
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:22,525
What about the chief editor's cell phone?

136
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:24,425
There' s no way it would be here.

137
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:27,025
Ishikawa, let's us two split up

138
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,925
and go look for a public phone.

139
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,525
No, we can't leave Yoko alone here.

140
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:34,326
Please stay here, Mr. Kijima.

141
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:39,925
So, they both went to look for a public phone.

142
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:41,725
It wasn't easy to find.

143
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:43,426
But we finally found one in front of the station.

144
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,225
The case was reported to the police at 5.15 pm.

145
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:51,925
We arrived here at 5.30 pm,

146
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,325
and Ms. Umeda was already dead.

147
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,125
How come nobody had their cell phone with them?

148
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:00,325
You had it on you a while ago, miss.

149
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:03,525
You keep out of this, kid.

150
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:06,825
Yes, that's what I was just about to ask you too.

151
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,225
We left our phones at the rental costume shop

152
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:09,925
that we were at a while ago.

153
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,625
The chief editor never liked cell phone all that much.

154
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:16,025
Because she would be chased around everywhere at all times.

155
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,825
Especially when it came to parties,

156
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:21,225
she never allowed people to bring in their cell phones.

157
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,325
She even cautioned me against receiving e-mails.

158
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:24,725
I see.

159
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:27,025
About 5 years ago,

160
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:29,825
you could find public phones almost anywhere.

161
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:32,425
But now, they're not easy to find.

162
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,125
It sure has become a strange world.

163
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:36,525
I don't know if it's gotten more convenient or not.

164
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,225
So much for that.

165
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:40,025
Whether the killer knew about it

166
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:41,225
or whether it was a mere coincidence,

167
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:44,426
he entered this roomed that happened to be unlocked.

168
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,025
Ms. Umeda was absorbed in making preparations

169
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:58,826
that she didn't notice the killer sneaking up on her.

170
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,625
She was attacked from behind

171
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:04,426
when she was setting the things for this seat.

172
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:07,225
I'm sure she would've noticed

173
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:09,325
if someone came in from the front door.

174
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:10,826
And, she fled.

175
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:20,425
But there are no signs of struggle in this room.

176
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:22,425
The room is in exactly the same condition

177
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,525
it was when you all got here, rigtht?

178
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:26,425
Right, I recalled a scene

179
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,826
in a mystery program that was on TV.

180
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:31,125
I don't know!

181
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:32,925
I didn't do it!

182
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,125
I didn't do anything.

183
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,526
It's him! He's the one!

184
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:40,225
He's the one that came running out of the condo!

185
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:41,725
I saw him at the park in front of the station

186
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,625
and since he looked jittery,

187
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:46,725
I questioned him, then he tried to flee on me,

188
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,525
"Masataka Shimizu (25)" -so I nabbed him on the spot.

189
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,425
"Underemployed" -I don't know anything.

190
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:53,925
He had these on him.

191
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:55,125
Officer Sato,

192
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,725
could you have Mr. Kijima and the others take a look at this?

193
00:10:57,726 --> 00:10:58,925
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:02,026
It matches exactly even the way the sole has worn away.

195
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:05,225
Yes, there's not mistake about it.

196
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:08,825
These are all her favorite jewelry.

197
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:10,425
Thank you very much.

198
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,625
Please wait here just a little while more.

199
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:15,225
You were asked to do so, on the Internet?

200
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:18,925
Yeah, I just happened to find something good written.

201
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:21,925
The content of the job was to come here at 5 pm,

202
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:24,525
and take the jewelry that is on the table

203
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:26,925
to the park in front of the station.

204
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:28,925
Stop making up stories.

205
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:30,825
You killed her because you were after cash, isn't that it?

206
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,325
No!

207
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:36,025
When I got here that clown was already dead!

208
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:38,626
I fled because I didn't want to get involved.

209
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:43,325
What a stubborn guy.

210
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,425
But, isn't it strange

211
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:47,325
that he didn't flee too far away from the scene,

212
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:49,025
and stayed sticking around the park?

213
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:52,726
It could be that he was really hired by somebody.

214
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:59,725
Serving one-day theme park chief can sure be tiring.

215
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:03,025
I'm starting to get sleepy.

216
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:05,726
Hey, hey. He fell asleep.

217
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:15,426
Beef stew.

218
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:21,625
It's cold.

219
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,725
The fire's been out for quite some time.

220
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,925
But the dial shows that it should've been on simmer.

221
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:29,025
Officer, please believe me.

222
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,125
All right.

223
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,825
What's this?

224
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,725
What's the matter?

225
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:36,426
Conan. Be quiet.

226
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:39,525
Mr. Mouri's going to start his show soon, isn't he?

227
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,625
I wonder.

228
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,525
Nothing's going to start, because he's really asleep this time.

229
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:46,625
It's the usual.

230
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:49,426
By the way, do you happen to know what this is?

231
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:52,325
This is...

232
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:55,025
I asked the manager of this condo about it,

233
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,425
and was told that it's an earthquake detector to switch off the gas.

234
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,325
An earthquake detector?

235
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:01,525
Yes, when an earthquake occurs it will automatically

236
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:04,425
switches off the gas to prevent fire.

237
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:07,425
Ms. Umeda seems to have requested to have it installed yesterday.

238
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:09,725
It switches the gas off when it detects a intensity of 3.

239
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:12,425
Oh, it probably switched off because of the earthquake in 3 pm,

240
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,725
and she forgot to turn the fire back on.

241
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:17,125
She forgot to turn the fire back on?

242
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:20,025
Rather, maybe she couldn't.

243
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,525
She may have been dead by 3 pm when the earthquake occurred.

244
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:27,326
But, the estimated time of death is between 4.30 pm to 5 pm.

245
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:31,025
If she died around 3 pm,

246
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:33,325
rigor mortis would've already happened

247
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:35,326
when Inspector Megure and the others got here at 5.30 pm.

248
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:38,825
The heater was on in this room,

249
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:41,825
and rigor mortis would've occurred even faster.

250
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:44,225
However, there were no signs of rigor mortis at all.

251
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:46,025
What does this mean?

252
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,126
Was it left in a cold place?

253
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,225
It can't be.

254
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:55,626
But the only cold place thinkable in an ordinary house is...

255
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:01,726
In order to delay rigor mortis...

256
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,325
What're you looking for?

257
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,025
Shall we help you look for it?

258
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:11,526
No, I'm fine. I'll look for it myself.

259
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:19,725
There's no space under the bed.

260
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,726
It's also impossible in the closet.

261
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,226
Could it be here?

262
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:36,425
Hey, is there a ladder in this house?

263
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:38,525
A ladder? I don't know.

264
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:41,025
Wait, it should be on the veranda.

265
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,825
I used it to take pictures last week.

266
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:44,726
On the veranda, right? Thank you.

267
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:49,825
It's grease paint.

268
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:51,126
It's still new.

269
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,025
It's so cold.

270
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,626
Conan? Where's Conan?

271
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:08,725
Artificial hair?

272
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:10,725
The ladder was not needed.

273
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:12,826
That person's the killer!

274
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,829
Please wait, officer.

275
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,530
Please believe me.

276
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,529
You came here. But, you didn't kill the victim.

277
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,129
Who's going to believe something like that?

278
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,929
We'll hear you out all you want at headquarters.

279
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,529
Hey, Officer Takagi!

280
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,629
Officer, may we be excused too?

281
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,729
I guess so. You may go.

282
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,629
What a disaster.

283
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,329
Your costume party's gone down the drain.

284
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,530
More than that, you've lost a precious person...

285
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,530
Mr. Mouri.

286
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,829
I wonder if he just fell asleep again?

287
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,729
No, the previous one was just a rehersal.

288
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,630
Now, let me show you the Sleeping Kogoro cut the Gordian knot.

289
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:14,129
Mr. Kijima, we can't have you leaving just yet.

290
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,629
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

291
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,429
Mr. Ishikawa, where at what time did you meet Mr. Kijima today?

292
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,329
At 3 pm in front of the Beika Department.

293
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,129
Mr. Kijima, before 3 pm,

294
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,129
where and what were you doing?

295
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,029
Well, I was doing a lot of things.

296
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,929
It sort of sounds like you're checking on my alibi?

297
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,229
Exactly, I'm checking on your alibi.

298
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,329
Inspector, Mr. Shimizu who was brought in a while ago

299
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,629
is not the killer.

300
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,629
The one who killed Ms. Umeda is.

301
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,429
Mr. Kijima, over there.

302
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,129
Just what are you talking about, all of a sudden?

303
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,029
Mr. Kijima was with us right through.

304
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,129
He had no time to kill the chief editor.

305
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,029
The only time we acted separately

306
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,029
was when we went to look for a public phone.

307
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,030
But, chief editor was already dead at that time.

308
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,229
No, Ms. Umeda was killed much earlier.

309
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,729
Most probably, even before you both met Mr. Kijima.

310
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,929
But the estimated time of death is between 4.30 pm to 5 pm.

311
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,329
And besides,

312
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,730
didn't you see the mail from Ms. Umeda too?

313
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,829
All he did was use Ms. Umeda's cell phone.

314
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,529
It doesn't necessarily mean that she sent it herself.

315
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,829
But, Mr. Mouri, rigor mortis hadn't started.

316
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,229
Ms. Umeda's body was not in this room.

317
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,829
It was somewhere in a cold place until just before you came here.

318
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,929
In order to delay rigor mortis.

319
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,529
Just what are you talking about!

320
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,829
I saw the dead body here together with everyone else!

321
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,829
What was that dead clown that we saw supposed to be then?

322
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:02,829
A doll with the make-up of a clown of a size similar to Ms. Umeda.

323
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,829
Who is the one that suggested today's party was to be

324
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,929
a costume party, in the first place?

325
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,029
The chief editor.

326
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,029
Mr. Ishikawa, did the editor tell you directly?

327
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,930
No, Mr. Kijima told us that the editor said so.

328
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,729
By the way, Mr. Kijima.

329
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,929
Did you know that gas appliances in this house

330
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,129
were equipped with an earthquake detector device?

331
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,529
Earthquake?

332
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,929
You didn't know, did you?

333
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,729
Officer Sato, will you bring the pot

334
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,329
with the half-cooked stew in it over here?

335
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,430
Yes, sir.

336
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,629
Please explain the contents of the pot to us.

337
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,529
She seems to have been making beef stew,

338
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,229
but it is not cooked yet at all.

339
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,729
If left as is, I don't think it would've been ready

340
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,429
for the party to be held at 5 pm.

341
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,629
Ms. Umeda was making preparations to make it in time for the party.

342
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,929
As proof of this,

343
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,429
the dial of the gas stove was set at simmer.

344
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,929
She was probably planning to cook it slowly on simmer.

345
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,629
However, the fire went out because of the earthquake detector.

346
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,029
But, she never turned the gas stove back on.

347
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,429
Rather, she couldn't.

348
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,229
Why? Because she was already dead.

349
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,229
Mr. Kijima, killed by you.

350
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,629
What proof do you have?

351
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,230
This is ridiculous, I'm going home!

352
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,330
Mr. Mouri hasn't finished what he is saying.

353
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,929
Mr. Kijima, before meeting with Mr. Ishikawa and Yoko,

354
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,329
you came here strangled and killed.

355
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,829
Ms. Umeda who was absorbed in making preparations,

356
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,729
from behind and switched her

357
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,130
with the doll you had prepared, beforehand.

358
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,429
Why did you do that?

359
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,529
Yes, you did so because

360
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,029
you had to leave Ms. Umeda's body in a cold place.

361
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,729
In order to make everyone believe

362
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,829
that she was killed before you all arrived,

363
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,230
you couldn't leave her body in a room that was heated.

364
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,829
Mr. Kijima, you left the room without turning off the gas

365
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,229
because you had to make sure that the stew was ready

366
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,529
when Ms. Umeda's body was found later.

367
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,829
However, there was an earthquake at about 3 pm,

368
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,930
and the gas stopped.

369
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,429
Unaware of this, you went shopping,

370
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,130
then went to the rental costume shop.

371
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,929
With Ms. Umeda's cell phone that you had taken from her,

372
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,529
you sent the mail just to make

373
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,729
it look as if she were alive.

374
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,230
And finally, made everyone give you their cell phones.

375
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,829
Then you tried to go look for a public phone

376
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,029
together with Mr. Ishikawa.

377
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,029
But, that was already what you had calculated beforehand.

378
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,729
You knew that Mr. Ishikawa would not leave his girlfriend behind

379
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,029
with a corpse.

380
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,329
That is, you remained in the room,

381
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,229
under extremely natural circumstances.

382
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,429
You then, finally brought the actual body of Ms. Umeda

383
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,629
that you had hidden out on the veranda inside,

384
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,030
and got rid of the doll.

385
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,029
The grease paint of the make-up of that clown...

386
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,429
Was found on the curtain.

387
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,629
That's a lie!

388
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,329
It's all just assumption.

389
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,929
You have no proof!

390
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,729
There is proof.

391
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,930
Please go out to the veranda.

392
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,030
Officer Takagi.

393
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,530
Mr. Kijima, this is your car, isn't it?

394
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,729
Darn!

395
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,929
That woman's to blame!

396
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,229
It's true that she brought me to where I am now.

397
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,729
But, each time I find a new girlfriend she gets in the way.

398
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,029
She tells me that if I split with her,

399
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,929
she'll make sure that I can't find a job in this line of work.

400
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,929
I was a indeed a clown.

401
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,229
No more than a clown.

402
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,230
That always hid my true feelings under my make-up.

403
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,629
"Mouri Detective Agency."

404
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,429
One-Day Chief of Firefighters?

405
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,530
He sure never learns.

406
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,330
Maybe this is...

407
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,930
Just as I thought.

408
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:57,230
"Firefighters."

409
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,029
"Next Episode."

410
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,130
The transmitter switched off.

411
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,229
Which means that they're going to assassinate somebody after all.

412
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,829
Pop is in danger!

413
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,429
90 m more!

414
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,830
Please make it in time!

415
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,029
Haibara, do you know?

416
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,630
Who's DJ?

417
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,629
Next Conan Special,

419
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,929

420
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,329

421

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,329
for the opening of the 10th year!

423
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,230
We will finally make contact with the Black Organization!
