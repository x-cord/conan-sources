1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,633
"Haido Central Hospital"

2
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:01,932
Camel!

3
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,233
Jodie!

4
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:06,032
Is everything okay?

5
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,832
What do you mean?

6
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,432
That guy who is a member of the Organization, Amuro.

7
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:15,732
I hope you didn't leak any information out taken in by his glib talk?

8
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,732
No.

9
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:20,832
Rather, you said the same thing just a while ago too, didn't you?

10
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,733
What? A while ago?

11
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,333
And how did it go?

12
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,432
That guy called Kusuda.

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,133
Just as you assumed.

14
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,433
He seems to have shot himself to death.

15
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:50,533
In his own car.

16
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:56,632
So, it was just as I thought.

17
00:00:56,633 --> 00:01:00,132
What? Vermouth did?

18
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,532
Are you saying that the Jodie I saw a while ago

19
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:05,333
was Vermouth in disguise?

20
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,032
There was such an incident.

21
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,933
About the time the whereabouts of Kusuda became unknown.

22
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,232
Just about the same time,

23
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:27,132
there was a man who was shot in the head and burned.

24
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,732
Right.

25
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,033
FBI agent,

26
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:37,133
Shuichi Akai.

27
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,332
Don't tell me.

28
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,932
That he's alive?

29
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:46,733
Yes. If my deduction is correct.

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,233
"Kudo"

31
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,932
Yes.

32
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:00,533
Delivery.

33
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,632
Good evening.

34
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,232
How do you do?

35
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,232
I'm Tohru Amuro.

36
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,232
I see.

37
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:17,033
But, this is not our first meeting, is it?

38
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,432
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

39
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,832
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

40
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,732
A battle never seen before.

41
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,432
A one-to-one fight between Amuro and Okiya.

42
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:33,932
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,932
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:38,333
His name is Detective Conan.

45
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:33,822
Next up is the award for Production Design.

46
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:36,922
-The presenter is Mr. David Carpenter! -Please have a seat.

47
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:38,123
Thank you.

48
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:46,322
David, the work you've done this year has been fantastic.

49
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:49,823
Your performance in your latest film was incredible.

50
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:59,222
Your voice was trembling when you received the award last year.

51
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:00,522
Thank you for waiting.

52
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:01,922
You ended up with the nickname

53
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:04,122
-Do you like mysteries? -"Trembling David".

54
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:06,122
Yes, sort of.

55
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:08,822
Then, let's start from there.

56
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:13,122
Well, it's just a simple exchanging the corpse trick.

57
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:16,523
It's a common mystery plot.

58
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:27,323
"The Scarlet Return"

59
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:33,022
A man was shot in the head at Raiha Pass.

60
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:36,322
He was burned along with his car.

61
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:40,522
The fingerprints taken from his right hand, which barely escaped the fire,

62
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:43,222
matched the fingerprints on a boy's phone

63
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:47,522
he had picked up while he was still alive,

64
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:51,422
verifying the dead man's identity.

65
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:53,522
But, it's strange.

66
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,522
Strange?

67
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:59,022
The fingerprints that were left on the cell phone.

68
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:01,022
That man was a lefty

69
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,322
but for some reason

70
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:06,323
the fingerprints found on the cell phone were of the right hand.

71
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:10,222
Don't you think it's strange?

72
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:12,022
Maybe he just happened to be using his right hand

73
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:15,722
at the time he picked up the cell phone?

74
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:20,222
Or maybe he had no choice but to pick it up with his right hand.

75
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:22,822
Why is that?

76
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:28,822
Because that cell phone was picked up by another man who was right handed

77
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:32,522
before that man in question picked it up.

78
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:34,722
Another man?

79
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:35,823
Yes.

80
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:39,622
It seems that they were actually trying to make

81
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:43,623
three people pick up that cell phone.

82
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,922
Now, here's a question for you.

83
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,922
The first man they wanted to pick up the phone

84
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,522
was a fat man with greasy hands.

85
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:58,822
Next, a skinny man with braces on his neck.

86
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:03,522
And finally an elderly man with a pacemaker

87
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:08,022
Out of these three, there were only one whose fingerprints remained.

88
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:10,322
Who do you think it was?

89
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:13,622
The second skinny man.

90
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:15,822
Because the fingerprints that remained

91
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:20,822
after the first fat man picked it up were wiped clean.

92
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:22,622
I'm sure they'd be hesitant

93
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,522
to make the other two pick up a greasy cell phone.

94
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:30,322
And the third elderly man, afraid that the cell phone

95
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:33,522
may affect his pacemaker

96
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:36,923
so he probably didn't even pick it up, I guess?

97
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:41,122
Yes.

98
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:45,322
But the skinny man who came after the man in question who was killed,

99
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:47,722
was also holding the same cell phone, wasn't he?

100
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:50,522
Then the fingerprints of that man would also be there.

101
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:53,922
What if something was done to keep the fingerprints from being detected?

102
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,522
That man probably figured that

103
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:57,622
something like this would come up

104
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:00,422
and put something on his fingertips beforehand.

105
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:02,422
Coating.

106
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:03,722
That's right.

107
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:04,922
I'm sure that Shu back then,

108
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:08,922
coated his fingertips with a transparent adhesive or something.

109
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,922
And just to be safe, he coated the fingertips of both his hands.

110
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:14,222
What do you mean?

111
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:16,922
When he held Conan's cell phone!

112
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,422
By coating his fingertips,

113
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:23,022
he would be able to keep his prints off Conan's cell phone.

114
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:26,822
That's why Shu dropped the canned coffee back then.

115
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:31,523
The coating made his fingers slippery.

116
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:38,522
Then what about the prints that were on that cell phone?

117
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,222
They weren't Shu's.

118
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:44,722
They were the prints of Rikumichi Kusuda who held it before he did.

119
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:49,922
Which means the corpse that was shot in the head

120
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:51,422
and burned at Raiha Pass...

121
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:55,522
Yes, it was the corpse of Rikumichi Kusuda.

122
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:57,422
I'm not sure of the circumstances

123
00:08:57,423 --> 00:09:02,522
but Shu probably dressed the corpse with the same clothes as his,

124
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:05,522
and pretended to be shot by Rena Mizunashi.

125
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:08,623
Then, he switched places with the corpse with precise timing!

126
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:11,522
I see.

127
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:14,422
It's quite an interesting mystery

128
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,822
but that man who pretended to be shot,

129
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:20,722
how did he leave the place later?

130
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,722
Before I answer your question,

131
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:25,122
will you turn the TV off?

132
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:27,622
After all, we're having an important conversation.

133
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:29,322
What's the problem?

134
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:32,523
I'm interested in the Macademy Awards.

135
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:39,622
So, how did that man leave?

136
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:43,422
I think that man and woman were in this together.

137
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,422
He probably snuck into that woman's car and fled.

138
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:51,522
By deceiving the eyes of the man

139
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:54,622
who was standing guard watching from a distance.

140
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:56,822
A man was standing guard?

141
00:09:56,823 --> 00:10:01,823
Yes, so the man who was standing guard was totally deceived.

142
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,822
After all, the man who was shot

143
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:09,022
bled from his head and fell to the ground.

144
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,922
Bled from the head?

145
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,922
But that was also fake.

146
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:17,722
Because the man who was shot was always wearing a black knitted cap.

147
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:22,722
I hear that there is a professor living in this neighborhood

148
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,422
whose inventions put even the MI6 to shame.

149
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:26,822
It would be extremely simple for him

150
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:30,822
to invent a gadget that would make blood splatter out from his knitted cap

151
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,122
even if shot with blanks.

152
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:35,522
So you're saying that

153
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:40,222
he asked the woman working with him to shoot him in the head with blanks?

154
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,222
No, the one who ordered her to shoot him in the head

155
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:45,322
was the man who was standing guard.

156
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:47,622
He had already foreseen what was going to happen.

157
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:51,122
He knew that the man who was standing guard would unmistakably do so

158
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:53,722
when finishing someone off.

159
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:56,122
It's unbelievable.

160
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,822
But Mr. Akai touched that cell phone

161
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:03,622
only before he let them recapture Rena Mizunashi, right?

162
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:05,922
Does that mean that Mr. Akai had already assumed that

163
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:10,922
she would be ordered to kill him at that time?

164
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:12,422
Yes.

165
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:15,422
Shu would have.

166
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:19,022
That man's pretty good, isn't he?

167
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:22,022
It's as if he's the main character of a spy novel.

168
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:26,522
But the one who schemed this plan is someone else.

169
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:29,622
Why don't you use the cell phone with his fingerprints on?

170
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:33,622
I'll lend you my cell phone for a while then.

171
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:36,322
No. It's not Shu.

172
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:37,722
Right.

173
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:40,522
It's someone else.

174
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:42,622
Don't tell me that it's.

175
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:44,523
Ms. Jodie.

176
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,322
What I'm trying to say is...

177
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:50,822
Hang in there, okay?

178
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,322
As proof of that,

179
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:58,022
the man mumbled the following before he was shot.

180
00:11:58,023 --> 00:12:00,722
I didn't think you'd go this far.

181
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:01,723
Is what he said.

182
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:05,222
"I didn't think you'd go this far"?

183
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:09,922
To me, it just sounds like he's lamenting his misfortune.

184
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:13,122
Yes. Under ordinary circumstances.

185
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:16,623
But if you add certain words to it...

186
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,323
The meaning drastically changes.

187
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:31,523
"I didn't think you'd go this far..."

188
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:36,423
"in your prediction".

189
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:41,023
Right.

190
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:47,522
They were words he used to praise a certain boy who set up this plan.

191
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:49,022
I see.

192
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,423
Interesting.

193
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,522
I'm going to press on the gas a bit.

194
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:59,823
Unknown cars are pursuing us from behind.

195
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:09,422
And where and what has Mr. Akai been doing since?

196
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:12,022
Don't you have anyone in mind?

197
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:14,522
Like somebody who has the same habit of talking.

198
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:15,822
Same habit of talking?

199
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:19,622
Remember? Mr. Akai used to always say,

200
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:23,422
"The odds are 50/50, so we're in the same boat."

201
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:25,922
I'm sorry, are you okay?

202
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:29,422
But we're both at fault and the ratio is 50/50.

203
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:33,323
You were negligent of the things around you so you're to blame too.

204
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,722
Figuring things out from there was easy.

205
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:39,722
After the Raiha Pass incident,

206
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:44,822
all I had to do was find a suspicious person who appeared around that boy.

207
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,522
And this is where I landed.

208
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:52,122
I haven't figured out what the relationship

209
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:56,522
between that boy and Yusaku Kudo is yet but...

210
00:13:56,523 --> 00:14:02,523
It's certainly clear that you're living here thanks to that boy.

211
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:05,722
It's him, him!

212
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:07,623
I told you before, haven't I?

213
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:16,322
About the weird man wearing glasses

214
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,323
that I bumped into at Beika Department store.

215
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,422
I'm waiting to be contacted.

216
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:24,422
My people are pursuing your friends at this moment

217
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:27,022
in order to capture and confine them.

218
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:30,222
I figured that you would be more cooperative

219
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:33,322
if you feel that your friends' lives are at stake.

220
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:36,522
But I'd prefer that you'd take that mask off

221
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:39,822
before they contact me.

222
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:41,823
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

223
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:45,922
No.

224
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,923
FBI agent.

225
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:54,223
Shuichi Akai!

226
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,881
But I'd prefer that you'd take that mask off

227
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:05,681
before they contact me.

228
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:07,382
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

229
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,381
No.

230
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:12,382
FBI agent.

231
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,282
Shuichi Akai!

232
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,081
If that's what you wish,

233
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:20,582
I have no choice.

234
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:24,182
I'd appreciate it.

235
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:38,581
No joke.

236
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:40,681
They're barricading us with their cars?

237
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:42,481
Take care not to bite your tongue.

238
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:44,682
Clench your teeth!

239
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,881
What're you doing? After them!

240
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,181
Yes, sir!

241
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,481
Just as expected of you, Camel.

242
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:17,281
Who are they, anyway?

243
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:19,281
One of them I guess.

244
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,681
Since they found out that Shu is alive,

245
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:23,481
I guess they're trying to get a hold of us

246
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,381
to use us as bait to lure Shu out.

247
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:27,881
Which means,

248
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:31,481
just because I leaked the information about Kusuda kills himself,

249
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:33,981
I jammed up Mr. Akai's plan.

250
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:36,281
You've no time to be bothered about it.

251
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:39,481
Concentrate on shaking them off for now!

252
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:42,481
It's the same as what happened two years ago.

253
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,481
I did it again.

254
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:47,182
I'm sorry. Mr. Akai.

255
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:54,982
Just what're you doing?

256
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,781
I've got a slight cold.

257
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,181
May I put my mask back on?

258
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,181
I don't want you to catch my cold.

259
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:06,081
It's not that mask.

260
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:10,281
I'm telling you to tear that disguise off, Shuichi Akai!

261
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:13,381
Disguise? Shuichi Akai?

262
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:16,281
What on earth have you been talking about all this time?

263
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:20,981
Now, let's go on to announcing the Best Script Award.

264
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:26,881
The winner of this honorable award is the best seller novelist,

265
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:31,681
who says this is the first time he has ever written the script for a movie.

266
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:34,581
The star of the Night Baron series.

267
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:36,981
Mr. Yusaku Kudo!

268
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:40,481
The title of the piece is "The Scarlet Agent"!

269
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:41,881
He did it!

270
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:45,181
Shinichi's father really won the award!

271
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,281
"Award for Best Original Script Author Kudo Yusaku wins Macademy"

272
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:49,881
There's a news flash about it too!

273
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:52,182
Don't you think it's fantastic, dad?

274
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:55,881
He's asleep and drooling.

275
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:58,882
How can two fathers be so different?

276
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:01,881
We've got trouble.

277
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,681
The steering wheel keeps veering to the right.

278
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:05,981
What do you mean?

279
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:09,081
Just a while ago when I made it up the rock,

280
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:12,081
the tire and foil were damaged and the rim bent,

281
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:14,281
so air is leaking out of the tire.

282
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:15,382
What?

283
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:20,881
They'll catch up with us if things go as is!

284
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,481
Just what are you up to?

285
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:27,781
What do you mean?

286
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,881
I just took a quick glance

287
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:32,281
but there are two at the front entrance,

288
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:34,281
three in the corridor

289
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:39,581
and there seem to be five hidden cameras set up in this room.

290
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,581
Are you planning to record this scene

291
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:44,881
and send it over to the FBI or something?

292
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:51,082
Or is somebody else in another room watching us?

293
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:01,981
Camel, do something!

294
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:04,081
They're right over there already.

295
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:06,382
Do what, though?

296
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,382
I'm sure that Mr. Akai would do something to get out of this situation.

297
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:16,581
Shu...

298
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:22,081
Does this person resemble me or sounds like me to begin with?

299
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:25,282
You can disguise the face and use a voice changer for the voice.

300
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:29,181
Just where on earth are you and what are you doing?

301
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:30,682
Voice changer?

302
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:37,181
I went around this vicinity at noon today and did some research

303
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:40,481
to see if there's any inventions that Dr. Agasa, your neighbor, invented,

304
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:46,081
that was well reputed but not marketed.

305
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:48,481
And found that it was the choker type voice changer.

306
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:51,081
It is wrapped around the neck and uses the vibration of the throat

307
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:53,281
to create any type of voice at will.

308
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:56,582
It is useful to cope with phone calls from stalkers.

309
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:02,082
Why didn't you tell me?

310
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:07,982
And the size of it is just right to hide...

311
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:13,581
Answer me, Shu!

312
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:15,682
under your turtle neck!

313
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:56,482
Darn it. The tire's going to run out of air.

314
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:02,981
I guess this is it.

315
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:04,282
We're doomed.

316
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:13,081
Open the roof.

317
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,181
What?

318
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:16,181
Open it, Camel.

319
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:17,582
Yes, sir!

320
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,481
Shu!

321
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:44,282
Mr. Akai!

322
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,281
Akai?

323
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:49,581
What the heck?

324
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:51,481
Hey! Back the car down.

325
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:53,282
We've got to wait for orders.

326
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:57,282
"Incoming call"

327
00:22:57,982 --> 00:23:00,582
Your phone's ringing.

328
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,582
What's up? What took you so long?

329
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:11,881
Akai, what?

330
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:13,881
-Five seconds. -What?

331
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:17,481
Drive a little more and there'll be a straight road of 200 m.

332
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:19,281
When you get there, hold the steering wheel steady

333
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:21,581
and drive at fixed speed for five seconds.

334
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:24,581
I'll put an end to this ridiculous chase.

335
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:26,281
Roger!

336
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:29,481
I mean, where and what were you doing all this time?

337
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:31,981
Why are you in the car?

338
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:36,782
Everything worked out as the boy said it would.

339
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,581
"Next Episode" -You mean Conan?

340
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:45,582
Yeah.

341
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:50,181
Knowing that you were suspicious of whether I was dead or not,

342
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:52,281
he assumed that you'd be coming to Raiha Pass,

343
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:53,981
and he was definitely right about it.

344
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:54,982
Too reckless!

345
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:58,081
The tire's flat and the car's swerving, you know?

346
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:00,881
As long as the movements are regular,

347
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:02,382
they can be calculated.

348
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:12,682
Next Conan, "The Scarlet Truth"
