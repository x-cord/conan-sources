1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:03,494
Friday the 13th.

2
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:07,694
On that day, a man died.

3
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:11,294
He was FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

4
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:16,194
Back then, when he intervened with the Black Organization's plan

5
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:18,994
of assassinating Mr. Yasuteru Domon,

6
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:20,494
he took custody of one of the people of the Organization,

7
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:23,494
a woman announcer called Rena Mizunashi.

8
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:25,494
However, she turned out to be a CIA agent

9
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:27,694
who managed to sneak into the Organization.

10
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,194
Although we deceived the Organization

11
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:33,594
that tried to get her back,

12
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:37,394
and succeeded in sneaking her back into the organization again.

13
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:41,594
In order to prove her innocence,

14
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:44,594
she was ordered to shoot Shuichi Akai to death.

15
00:00:46,894 --> 00:00:50,194
He was summoned to come see her at Raiha Pass and...

16
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:01,394
I didn't think I was going to end here.

17
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,194
I'm surprised too

18
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:07,294
that everything worked out so smoothly.

19
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:23,594
As such, the FBI has driven into the Organization.

20
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:27,594
A steel wedge that was never to be removed.

21
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:31,194
A large wound that was never to be erased

22
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:33,994
was also carved into their hearts.

23
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:39,194
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

24
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,894
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

25
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,394
The Detective Squad and a band of robbers.

26
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,394
The bank falls into panic with the FBI.

27
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:46,894
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:48,794
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:51,694
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:38,384
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Clamorous."

31
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:42,624
Give me a break, boss.

32
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:46,124
I'm already past the age of celebrating birthdays.

33
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:48,124
Don't be like that.

34
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:50,924
We're just going to have a sip to drink.

35
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:52,824
But...

36
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:55,424
No need for concern, Camel.

37
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,724
We just want an excuse to go take a break

38
00:03:57,724 --> 00:04:01,524
since investigation of the Organization's taking so long.

39
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,824
It's your treat of course, isn't it, James?

40
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:05,924
Yeah.

41
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:08,924
Now that we know, we'd better go choose good liquor!

42
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:12,524
Hey... nothing too expensive now.

43
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:24,424
A new member of the Organization has started moving.

44
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:27,424
He's good at gathering information, very observant,

45
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:28,624
and has great insight.

46
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:30,924
He is dreadfully good at probing,

47
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:32,424
and his code name is...

48
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,424
Bourbon.

49
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:37,724
It's been a while since I got that information from Rena Mizunashi

50
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:40,624
who snuck back into the Organization.

51
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:42,924
He hasn't shown up at all yet.

52
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:45,024
That detective-like guy.

53
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:46,924
Nope.

54
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:49,224
Bourbon's target is probably that girl

55
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:52,524
who is called Sherry by the Organization.

56
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,924
Judging from the chain of events till now,

57
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:58,124
it's no wonder if the Organization thinks

58
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:01,024
that we the FBI are involved with her.

59
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,624
Therefore, I was thinking that

60
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:06,124
he would try getting in touch with us somehow.

61
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,824
I guess so.

62
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:09,824
Because in the past, we used a wire-tap

63
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:12,024
like the one that girl set up,

64
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:13,524
and lured the Organization

65
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:15,624
over to the Mouri Detective Agency too,

66
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:18,824
and we, the FBI ambushed them there and attacked them.

67
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:22,424
Although it seems that the one who actually set up the wire-tap

68
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:25,024
was that boy called Conan Edogawa.

69
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,824
Come to think of it,

70
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:28,524
he liked that liquor too, didn't he?

71
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:31,624
-Huh? -Mr. Akai.

72
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,624
He was also the one who shot at the guys

73
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,024
from a building 700 yards away

74
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:39,324
after luring them out, wasn't he?

75
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:44,024
Huh? It wasn't him?

76
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:47,224
Yeah... I mean, it was, but...

77
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,724
If Mr. Akai were around,

78
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,024
we wouldn't have to be afraid of this guy called Bourbon.

79
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:53,924
We're not afraid!

80
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:55,724
We're just waiting for the Organization

81
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:57,824
to get impatient enough to make their move!

82
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,624
Besides, Shuichi Akai is already dead!

83
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:04,124
Don't you mention that name ever again!

84
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:06,124
I'll see you guys back at the car.

85
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:07,724
Oh, yes, madam.

86
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:14,124
Be more considerate, will you?

87
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,524
Because to her,

88
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:19,824
Mr. Akai was not just another FBI agent.

89
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:21,024
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:31,524
Huh? You're going to go steady?

91
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,624
You mean with a member of the Organization

92
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:37,024
that you mentioned the other day named Ms. Akemi Miyano?

93
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:38,424
Yeah.

94
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:40,924
So, I'd like to end my relationship with you.

95
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:43,424
Wait, Shu!

96
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:44,624
You're going with her

97
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,224
in order to investigate the Organization, right?

98
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:48,924
I don't see why we have to end our relationship.

99
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:51,124
It just means that it's an Organization that I have to crush,

100
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:55,324
even if it means sacrificing you to do so.

101
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:58,924
I'm not a lover man who's capable

102
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:01,424
of loving two women at the same time, you see.

103
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,124
That would've been okay with me.

104
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:09,124
To be able to work together with you was enough for me.

105
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,624
But why, Shu?

106
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:12,724
Why did you have to...

107
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,024
leave so soon...

108
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:25,124
Shu?

109
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,224
Wait up.

110
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:31,724
Shu, wait.

111
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:34,624
Shu...

112
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,024
No doubt about it.

113
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:43,024
That's Shu.

114
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:45,124
But, he's supposed to dead.

115
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:47,924
Don't tell me he's another man who just resembles him?

116
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:50,624
I've got to go and make sure.

117
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:52,924
I've got to meet him and make sure.

118
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,324
What's up?

119
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,924
I don't remember parking my car over here.

120
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:05,224
Oh well...

121
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:08,224
Don't tell me you saw someone from the Organization?

122
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,224
It's nothing like that.

123
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,824
I just got lost.

124
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,224
Did you get to buy good liquor?

125
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:20,224
No, I couldn't use my credit card at that shop.

126
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:23,124
I didn't have any yen on hand either.

127
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,924
I hate to do this to you,

128
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:26,624
but could you pay the bill for us?

129
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:29,824
What? I was thinking of withdrawing money today,

130
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:31,524
so my wallet's empty.

131
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:34,024
Is that so...

132
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:36,524
I'll go to a nearby bank then,

133
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,024
so please wait for me at the shop we just went to.

134
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:40,024
Yeah, thanks.

135
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,824
No...

136
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,424
I'm sure that he's someone else.

137
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,124
That was just an illusion,

138
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:49,124
it wasn't Shu.

139
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:54,124
"Teito Bank."

140
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:56,324
Mitsuhiko, you're going to deposit

141
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,024
all of your New Year's allowance.

142
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:02,124
Yes, because my parents made a bank account for me the other day.

143
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,924
You said that you got a lot.

144
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:06,824
Don't you think it's a waste?

145
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:09,024
I've got sound judgment.

146
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:11,624
Then, what did you do with your allowance, Genta?

147
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:14,324
I'm having Mom keep all of it for me.

148
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:16,824
She told me that she'd keep it for me

149
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,724
until I find something expensive that I want.

150
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,424
And... did she ever buy something for you?

151
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,424
Come to think of it, no.

152
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,824
She'd always say that it's too extravagant

153
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:27,124
or something like that.

154
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:29,224
Genta's mother's pretty shrewd.

155
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:32,624
Well, she could be saving it for the time

156
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:35,024
when you fall ill of a serious illness or something.

157
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,524
That's the same as putting the money in your bank account.

158
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:39,824
I'm going to get all the money

159
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,824
that I have her keeping for me back.

160
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:45,324
-Hey... -Besides, I never get sick.

161
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:50,924
It's hurt... my stomach suddenly...

162
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,024
Are you all right, Genta?

163
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,824
Are you sure you didn't eat something that you shouldn't have?

164
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:59,024
I had two servings of curry rice for lunch.

165
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:01,324
But, when I went to get you a while ago,

166
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:03,124
you had kinako around your mouth, right?

167
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,324
After I ate the curry,

168
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:07,324
I wanted to eat something sweet,

169
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:09,424
so I grilled the rice cake that was in the refrigerator

170
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:10,724
and made kinako mochi.

171
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:12,824
I ate four of that.

172
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:16,524
Then, I started craving for something salty next.

173
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,324
So, I put soy sauce on them,

174
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:20,724
and ate three of them wrapped with seaweed.

175
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:22,324
You just ate too much.

176
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,424
I tell you, Genta.

177
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:28,124
I'll go to a nearby pharmacy

178
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:29,924
and get you some stomach medicine then.

179
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:30,924
Go to the bathroom

180
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,124
and let out what you have to.

181
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:34,124
Okay.

182
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:38,124
I'm sure that all his allowance will disappear

183
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:39,624
just paying for his food bills.

184
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:40,924
You can say that again.

185
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:45,424
-Wasn't that... -Your teacher, Jodie?

186
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:51,324
She didn't notice us.

187
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:53,324
Maybe she had something on her mind?

188
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:02,824
Excuse me, miss,

189
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,024
when using the ATM,

190
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:07,124
please refrain from using your cell phone.

191
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,924
This is to prevent swindling cases that have been increasing lately.

192
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:13,024
Cell phone...

193
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,224
Just like you said,

194
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:16,924
his fingerprints were found on that cell phone

195
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:20,324
together with yours and Conan's.

196
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:23,824
The fingerprints of the man who burnt to death just a while ago.

197
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:29,724
Right. He died.

198
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,424
You told yourself over and over again.

199
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,124
And yet...

200
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:36,324
to see an illusion like that?

201
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:39,124
I've had enough.

202
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,424
I never want to go through what I went through back then.

203
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:45,424
Yes, just like being shot right through the chest with a bullet.

204
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:50,024
What was that?

205
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:57,924
Lock the entrances and exits and close the shutters!

206
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,624
All of you, gather in one spot!

207
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:01,724
"Restroom."

208
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:04,524
What's going on? That sound...

209
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,324
I sure was loud.

210
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:09,224
A gunshot. Don't tell me...

211
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:12,224
Hey, is anything wrong?

212
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,024
Genta, stay as you are.

213
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,224
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi, you two stay here too.

214
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:17,624
I'll go check things out.

215
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:19,024
Oh, Conan!

216
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:26,024
Hey! Get over here quick, and sit down!

217
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:36,524
Get it?

218
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:39,624
Hurry it up if you don't want to get hurt.

219
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:40,824
Listen!

220
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:42,424
If you're here with a friend or with somebody accompanying you,

221
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:44,424
stay together!

222
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:47,424
Stay with your friends or the person you came with?

223
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:53,624
Huh?

224
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:55,024
Is anything the matter?

225
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,724
Well, the door is locked.

226
00:12:57,724 --> 00:13:00,624
Besides, things don't look right inside.

227
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:04,924
Even the shutters closed!

228
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:05,924
What's going on?

229
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:10,124
Hey, what's going on?

230
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,724
Don't tell me that...

231
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:16,024
This is a bank robbery?

232
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:20,924
Okay! Hurry and put the cell phones

233
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,824
that you have inside this bag!

234
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:28,324
I remember that I experienced something like this

235
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,824
in the past too.

236
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:34,024
Right. That bus jack.

237
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:38,524
But back then...

238
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:40,224
you were there, Shu.

239
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:45,724
Hey. You foreign lady over there.

240
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,724
Don't you understand Japanese?

241
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:50,824
No, I do, a little bit.

242
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:53,624
Then, get your cell phone out, hurry and sit down.

243
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,424
Okay...

244
00:13:57,424 --> 00:13:58,424
Sorry.

245
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:08,324
Shu...

246
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:11,124
Shu...

247
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:22,238
Shu.

248
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:23,238
Are you Shu?

249
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,938
You're Shu, aren't you?

250
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,138
Tell me that you're sure!

251
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:31,338
Can't you tell who I am?

252
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,738
Can't you talk?

253
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:39,538
A burn mark...

254
00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:42,338
Don't tell me that...

255
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:45,238
you escaped from that burning Chevy?

256
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:46,638
You must've lost your memory and ability to talk

257
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:49,238
from the shock back then.

258
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:50,938
Hey!

259
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:54,038
What's all the fuss about, foreign lady?

260
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,938
Hurry up and put your cell phone inside this bag!

261
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,138
Okay...

262
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:03,238
Hey, you too! Hurry up, out with it!

263
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,238
Darn, you wanna get blasted away or what?

264
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:10,238
No... he can't talk

265
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:11,938
because a shock from accident!

266
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,238
The burn marks, they proof!

267
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:18,138
He cannot talk,

268
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:21,638
so I think he can't use the phone even if he has it.

269
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:23,838
Okay...

270
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,938
Just sit still right there!

271
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:27,838
Hey, you next!

272
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:29,438
Okay.

273
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:33,238
Either way I've got to take him to everybody at the FBI

274
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:35,438
and help him get his memory back.

275
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:37,738
I have to ask him about how he made it out alive

276
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:40,838
and the burnt body remains in the Chevy.

277
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:43,638
In order to do so, I guess I have no choice

278
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:45,938
but to take care of these robbers first.

279
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:49,238
Hey, is the head of this branch here?

280
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:53,038
Okay, get over here.

281
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:54,138
Hurry it up!

282
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:56,138
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,938
No need to panic.

284
00:15:57,938 --> 00:15:59,538
All I need you to do

285
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,738
is put all the cash in this case over here.

286
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,138
Easy, huh?

287
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:05,538
By myself?

288
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:06,538
Yeah.

289
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:09,538
You seem to know the details of where the money is.

290
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:14,438
Okay, next, all those with nobody or no acquaintances with them!

291
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:15,738
Stand there on the spot!

292
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:21,938
You guys come get this masking tape!

293
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:23,938
Tape the eyes and mouths

294
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,538
of those with somebody or acquaintances with them,

295
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:27,938
then tie their hands behind them with the tape.

296
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:29,238
They may be easy on the people

297
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,838
if know them even a bit.

298
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:33,438
Here!

299
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:36,938
Of course I'll tie you guys up later myself.

300
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:56,238
That...

301
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:58,138
I'm sorry, I'm sticking the tape on you.

302
00:16:58,138 --> 00:17:00,638
Oh! Before that...

303
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:03,038
please let me go to the restroom!

304
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:05,338
I'm going to leak!

305
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,938
The foreign lady again...

306
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:10,238
Please!

307
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,138
Okay.

308
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:15,138
But, first I'm going to cover your eyes, mouth

309
00:17:15,138 --> 00:17:16,838
and tie your hands before you go.

310
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,938
Okay, thank you.

311
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:27,338
Hey! Hurry up and walk!

312
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,238
"Restroom."

313
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,938
Stop!

314
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,138
Oh well, I guess I can let her use the men's room.

315
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:40,838
There's nobody here and it can't be seen.

316
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:43,738
Get in!

317
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,938
Okay, let me know when you finish.

318
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:01,638
I see, with both hands tied,

319
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,938
you can't pull down your panty.

320
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:06,538
I got no choice then.

321
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,938
Just as would be expected of an FBI agent on duty.

322
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:30,338
You're pretty good.

323
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:32,438
What brings you all here?

324
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:33,638
We all came along with Mitsuhiko

325
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:35,638
because he wanted to deposit money into his account.

326
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:36,838
But, Genta came down with a stomachache,

327
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,438
so we took him to the men's room.

328
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:40,838
Then, we heard a loud bang.

329
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:43,338
So we stayed hiding in the men's room.

330
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:46,738
My stomach's okay already, though.

331
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:49,338
And? How many robbers are there?

332
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,638
Five of them.

333
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,238
They're all armed with guns.

334
00:18:53,238 --> 00:18:55,238
So, they're after the money?

335
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:57,338
Yes, they were saying to put the cash

336
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,338
in the case that they brought.

337
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,338
Something smells fishy.

338
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:05,238
They divided the customers by the friends and acquaintances.

339
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:06,638
And when collecting the cash,

340
00:19:06,638 --> 00:19:09,038
they made the branch manager do it alone.

341
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:10,838
Besides, for some reason,

342
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,838
they were all concerned about the time.

343
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:13,838
Time?

344
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,238
They seem concerned,

345
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,638
but it's no problem if I take them all alone and beat them up.

346
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,038
Hang in there, Jodie!

347
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:24,538
Victory is yet to come!

348
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,538
It's okay.

349
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:28,438
You don't need to do anything.

350
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:37,538
I got worried, so I came by to check things out.

351
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:39,238
And here he is like this.

352
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:42,138
No good, he's completely passed out.

353
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,138
It'll be a pain carrying him, though.

354
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:45,938
We don't have that much time.

355
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:47,838
Let's take off his mask and jacket

356
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:50,138
and seat him on the toilet seat.

357
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:51,938
It'll look like a customer who was hiding in the toilet

358
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:55,038
got hit by the robber, right?

359
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,038
Hey, hold the other end!

360
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,238
Okay.

361
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:03,038
But, I wonder who that lady is.

362
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,138
Beats me.

363
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:12,438
Well, who cares who she is at this point

364
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:14,538
because they're all going to blow up.

365
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:16,938
That's true...

366
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:34,738
What shall we do? Jodie got caught.

367
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,738
We've got no choice, but to beat them up ourselves.

368
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:41,138
But, they've got five on their side.

369
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:43,338
No, four.

370
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,138
"Teito Bank."

371
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:03,738
Really bad, something really bad happened.

372
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:06,638
We surrounded the bank entirely.

373
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:10,038
And? Did the robbers make any demands?

374
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:11,638
Nothing yet.

375
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,438
I see.

376
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:19,838
Strange.

377
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:21,038
Huh?

378
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:22,638
At this point,

379
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:24,438
it's usual that the robbers use the hostages as their shield

380
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:28,338
and demand ways to make it out of the bank.

381
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:30,438
That's true.

382
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:33,338
I'm sure they'll give in soon and come out.

383
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:35,538
Besides, they have no way out anyway.

384
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:36,938
I wonder about that.

385
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:42,138
I got a look inside before the shutter closed

386
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:45,638
and saw several guys armed with guns wearing masks.

387
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,238
In order to raid a bank dressed like that,

388
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:50,638
they would've had to arm themselves, get into a large vehicle,

389
00:21:50,638 --> 00:21:52,138
parking it right beside the bank

390
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:55,438
and stampede in at once.

391
00:21:55,438 --> 00:21:57,738
Being as well prepared as they are,

392
00:21:57,738 --> 00:22:00,038
they take the money, yet don't split right away,

393
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:01,838
but rather make no demands,

394
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,738
and are still keeping themselves locked up in there.

395
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:05,238
Isn't it strange?

396
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:08,738
Maybe there's something more to this.

397
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:10,338
Maybe they already have a way thought out,

398
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:13,838
out of there splitting with the money and all.

399
00:23:58,138 --> 00:23:59,938
"Next Episode."

400
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,938
What a fox.

401
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:05,638
A bank robbery is never worth it.

402
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:07,638
All you do is lose out.

403
00:24:07,638 --> 00:24:10,638
They're saying something about not having enough time.

404
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:13,538
In the first place, why isn't this guy wearing a mask?

405
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,338
Don't tell me that...

406
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:19,138
The contents in the case...

407
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:20,938
is probably a bomb.

408
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:22,738
A Bomb...

409
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:24,138
Next Conan,

410
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:31,138
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Silence."

411
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:47,199
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,299
"Hostage."

413
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:50,999
It's finally show time for us!

414
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,999
But, first, I've got to eat eels over rice.

415
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,399
Hey...
