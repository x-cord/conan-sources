1
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,787
Today, everyone encounters a real pinch.

2
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:24,287
The tent is mistaken for another.

3
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:26,087
And Ran encounters an unexpected pinch!

4
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:27,587
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:29,387
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:31,488
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:02,773
"We're going driving, driving."

8
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:05,173
It's hard to believe it was raining so hard yesterday!

9
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:07,574
True, not even a cloud is in sight.

10
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:12,674
I guess this is what you call a passing typhoon.

11
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:24,373
Did you finish reading it?

12
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:27,073
It was so interesting I stayed up all night reading it.

13
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:29,073
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

14
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:31,273
"Sleeping Princess in a Pinch"?

15
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:34,873
Yes. It's a story about many men trying to wake a princess

16
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:37,673
who has been asleep for many years.

17
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,674
The one who succeeds in waking her up gets to marry her.

18
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:43,673
How romantic.

19
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:48,173
Well, but she wouldn't be alive if she were sleeping for so many years.

20
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:51,373
If she gets nutrition through intravenous drip, she'll be fine.

21
00:02:51,374 --> 00:02:54,173
I'll bet she just pretended to be asleep all the while, right?

22
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,674
Because no man of her choice happen to come by.

23
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:00,073
Conan, did you read the book?

24
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:01,974
You're spoiling my dream.

25
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:11,574
"Time Limit is 15:00."

26
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:23,074
Let's take the best place.

27
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,373
Under the tree has been taken.

28
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:34,373
That's the only place with a shade.

29
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:36,473
All set.

30
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:39,573
"Shoji Horikoshi (20)" -Misa, can you get that peg over there for me?

31
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:41,573
"Misa Tsuneyama (19)" -Huh? Peg...

32
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:42,574
What?

33
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:45,073
That little stick to poke into the ground.

34
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:46,574
That one.

35
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:50,273
Why don't you say so in the first place?

36
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:52,373
After all, this is the first time I've come camping.

37
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,173
Sorry, sorry.

38
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:56,173
Never mind, I'll get it myself.

39
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:59,073
By the way, why do we have to stay in such a cheap tent.

40
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:01,673
Couldn't you get something like that? You see, like that!

41
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,973
There are no such rental tents.

42
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:07,673
That's why I'm asking you why our tent is a rented one?

43
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:10,073
Why didn't you go out and buy one?

44
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:13,973
If you're going to bring me to camp, isn't that plain common sense?

45
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:16,573
Go and buy one right this minute.

46
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:19,773
She's super unreal, that lady.

47
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,873
You know I can't do that.

48
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,973
Let's go to a pension then!

49
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:26,373
I don't like this tent.

50
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:30,273
What? I brought you to camp because I wanted to show you

51
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:31,573
how enjoyable it would be!

52
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:33,273
Seems like we've got guests already.

53
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,373
We've got no choice,

54
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:37,573
so why don't we set it up somewhere around here.

55
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:40,474
Okay, hurry! Let's go get the rental tents!

56
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:50,374
All done!

57
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:55,073
Okay, let's set up the tent for the girls on that side next.

58
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:57,573
Hey, wait up!

59
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:59,773
No! I can't take this anymore.

60
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:02,673
Don't be like that, Misa.

61
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:04,373
I'm really going home.

62
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:05,374
Misa!

63
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,773
All right, it seems that they're leaving.

64
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,974
How lucky! Hurry, let's go, Conan!

65
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:15,974
Slave driver.

66
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:18,873
You really set it up fast this time.

67
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:22,074
Yes. The second time around is easy.

68
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:29,273
Don't push yourself. Maybe you should sleep for a while?

69
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:30,873
I'm fine.

70
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:33,873
I'll stick it out until I finish making the curry,

71
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,474
because I'll bet you're all hungry, right?

72
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:43,073
Hey, what's going on here?

73
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:45,373
How come there's a tent standing in our place?

74
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:47,674
This is our place.

75
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:53,273
You said you were leaving, didn't you?

76
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:54,474
Miss.

77
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:56,973
You did say so, didn't you?

78
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:59,773
Well, I guess I did.

79
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:01,174
You changed your mind.

80
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:06,073
Hey, what's this? No joke.

81
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,973
This is our place!

82
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:10,573
But we already put up our tent.

83
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:12,873
I just went to exchange the tent

84
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,973
because there was a hole in the one I just got.

85
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,573
Get on with it and move your tents out of the way!

86
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:21,174
Okay, let's clear the tent out of the way.

87
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,574
Well, it is a fact that they were here first.

88
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,974
Okay, so hurry on and get it out of the way.

89
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:38,773
You can leave it as is.

90
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,773
Huh? What do you think you're saying, Misa?

91
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:43,873
They're saying they're going to move, you know.

92
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:45,973
We can set the tent up somewhere around there.

93
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:48,773
This is the best place there is,

94
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,574
right under this tree!

95
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:54,274
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:01,674
Darn it!

97
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,273
You should cut it into smaller pieces.

98
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:14,573
Huh?

99
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,273
When you make curry at home,

100
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:18,373
you can spend a long time boiling the contents.

101
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:20,373
But you can't do that here, right?

102
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,973
You seem used to this.

103
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,673
Here let me do it.

104
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:26,774
I may not look it, but I'm pretty much a homemaker, too.

105
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:34,973
Amazing!

106
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:36,674
What happened to your boyfriend?

107
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,373
Who cares?

108
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:40,873
Huh?

109
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,074
It's over with us.

110
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:49,574
Women can sense things like this.

111
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:55,073
I guess this is it.

112
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,873
Just great.

113
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:59,373
They sure have everything here.

114
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:01,673
These recent camping grounds.

115
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,074
Yes.

116
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:28,574
Oh, I wonder if she already woke up?

117
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:38,373
Somebody!

118
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:40,574
Somebody, come quick!

119
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,673
-What seems to be the matter? -Ran was kidnapped!

120
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:47,074
My God!

121
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:52,873
-Ran! -Ran!

122
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:55,773
Darn it, where did that guy go?

123
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:58,273
They're not over here!

124
00:08:58,274 --> 00:09:00,474
Darn it! Why'd he take Ran?

125
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:12,874
Ran!

126
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:15,874
Conan!

127
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,774
I wonder who he is?

128
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:39,473
There is a smell of a drug inside.

129
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:42,173
It seems she was put to sleep with a drug.

130
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:46,173
The car that fled was reported to be a stolen car,

131
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:48,573
so I'm sure we'll be able to find it right away.

132
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:50,773
I sure hope so.

133
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:54,773
The point is why the culprit kidnapped Ran.

134
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:58,473
There are so many other people on this camping ground, and yet...

135
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,873
What a thing to say! How irresponsible!

136
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:03,473
You're the one who said you wanted to stay over at a pension,

137
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:04,773
so let's hurry up and head over.

138
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:07,273
A friend of the people we got to know on the camping ground was kidnapped!

139
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,573
I can't just leave.

140
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,873
Misa, this has nothing to do with us.

141
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,174
Yes, it does.

142
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:19,374
He's still breathing!

143
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:30,973
Is this the sneaker that the man who kidnapped Ran was wearing?

144
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,273
No doubt about it.

145
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:34,273
It's the same as the one the man was wearing.

146
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,573
Which means that you caught the kidnapper?

147
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:40,173
A car fell over a cliff near here.

148
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,373
This is the shoe that the driver of the car was wearing.

149
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:45,873
His unconscious and in the hospital now.

150
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:47,973
Then, Ran...

151
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,473
Doc, what about Ran?

152
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,773
I don't know about Ran.

153
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:55,773
The car was a regular sedan and Ran was nowhere in sight.

154
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:57,773
We found from his driver's license

155
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:00,373
that he is Masayuki Takada, age 25.

156
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:03,373
There seems to have been a half-written mail that hasn't been sent out,

157
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:06,173
hinting that he had committed the crime left on his cell phone.

158
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:08,773
The police seem to have concluded that the accident was caused

159
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:11,873
probably because he was keying in mail while driving.

160
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,574
And, what about that mail?

161
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,473
He seems to have an accomplice.

162
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:21,273
I guess Takada was the one who carried out the crime for somebody else.

163
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:24,373
There seems to be another file.

164
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:26,074
Doc, will you lend it to me?

165
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,374
Sneaker.

166
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:35,473
This is rubber boots used when fishing.

167
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:37,573
Why's this thing here?

168
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:40,674
Ran? No, it's not.

169
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:59,073
I see! The tent.

170
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:01,274
It's the tent!

171
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:06,784
If you insist on going home just like that,

172
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,884
I swear I'll despise you forever.

173
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:11,184
Go ahead and suit yourself.

174
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:14,985
I don't intend to stick around with a stuck up like you for life.

175
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:18,884
I'm nothing more to you than some slave to humor you,

176
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:20,585
so I'm done with you.

177
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:25,984
Why didn't you answer the call?

178
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,584
I've tried calling you many times.

179
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,685
You kidnapped the wrong woman.

180
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:38,584
Masayuki Takada is hospitalized now because of the car accident.

181
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:41,384
The police called from his cell phone.

182
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,884
Hey! Where's Ran?

183
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:46,685
I don't know. I don't know.

184
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:55,984
I asked Takada to get the woman who was in the tent under that tree.

185
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:57,884
But thanks to a small mistake,

186
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:00,484
the place was taken by someone else.

187
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:02,284
I tried to contact him about it,

188
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:04,684
but Takada had his cell phone turned off.

189
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,384
This picture is pretty blurred.

190
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:10,584
Depending on how you look at it, it sort of looks like Ran.

191
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:13,284
What's your connection with Takada?

192
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,784
One morning at a certain station,

193
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:19,385
I saw the man called Takada, kick a man onto the railroad.

194
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:23,684
I reflexively followed Takada

195
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:25,885
and made sure that I could contact him.

196
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:31,884
Several days later, when I asked him to kill Misa,

197
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,184
he didn't refuse

198
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:36,484
because I told him I'd pay him 1,000,000 yen.

199
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:38,784
Why'd you want to do such a thing to Misa?

200
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,484
She was in the way.

201
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:44,184
I couldn't live my own way.

202
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:48,584
She's selfish, extravagant and to top it off, a busy-body.

203
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:51,084
I just couldn't call it off with her.

204
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:54,984
I wasn't going waste my life just for her.

205
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:57,284
That's for Misa to say.

206
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:59,684
You're the pits.

207
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,984
I don't mind you holding a grudge against me.

208
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,984
But I won't ever forgive you for endanger the life of someone

209
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,384
that has nothing to do with us.

210
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:08,184
Where is she?

211
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:10,985
Beats me. She may already be dead.

212
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,984
I know that Ran's alive.

213
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,585
Conan.

214
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:22,185
At least until 15:00.

215
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:24,984
Written on the mail that wasn't sent out,

216
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:28,084
it said, the woman dies at 15:00.

217
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:29,684
Let's go look for her.

218
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,684
We've only got 30 minutes!

219
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:33,285
Let's hurry!

220
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,584
Shall we go then?

221
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,485
We'll hear you out at the station.

222
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:43,984
Why are we looking by the river?

223
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,484
The executor of the crime, Takada,

224
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,584
had long rubber boots used for fishing.

225
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:51,084
It was approximately 40 minutes from the time

226
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,484
when he kidnapped Ran to when he had the accident.

227
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,284
They couldn't have gone far.

228
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:55,384
Right.

229
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:57,284
In the mean time, he changed cars

230
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:00,384
and wear long rubber boots that went up to his chest.

231
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:01,685
It has to be somewhere around here.

232
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:06,084
20 minutes to go.

233
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:10,384
If Takada changed cars, Ran is probably left as is.

234
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:13,084
Let's look for the 4WD!

235
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,684
Okay...

236
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,284
Don't do anything reckless.

237
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:18,785
Let me know when you find her!

238
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:35,485
Where on earth are you, Ran?

239
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:42,184
A dam?

240
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:43,884
The reservoir lake of the dam.

241
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:45,684
Doc, the dam!

242
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:46,885
Let's search the reservoir of the dam.

243
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,584
All right.

244
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:52,185
But there isn't enough time so I'll go.

245
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,885
"Drainage Alert."

246
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:15,185
The water's going to be discharge!

247
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:26,284
So this was what 15:00 that was written in Takada's mail meant.

248
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,784
I got it.

249
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,685
It's where the water will be released and the car will sink!

250
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:34,384
Doc! Doc!

251
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:36,284
No good, I can't get through.

252
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:37,984
Look at that!

253
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,184
There's moss on it.

254
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:43,184
Which means that water level will come to that point.

255
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,185
Even cars will sink.

256
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,384
There it is!

257
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,984
No joke!

258
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:56,285
Conan!

259
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,284
You guys stay here!

260
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,785
Stay right there.

261
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:15,985
Ran. Thank goodness.

262
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:21,285
No good, it's locked.

263
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:25,285
Let's try cracking the glass with this.

264
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:30,085
It's so hard.

265
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:39,684
Execute periodic water discharge!

266
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,685
Roger!

267
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:48,784
What's with this siren?

268
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,585
No, don't tell me that...

269
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,885
All right!

270
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:12,285
Ran, wake up! Get up!

271
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:18,884
The alarm...

272
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:20,585
Stopped.

273
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:38,784
Looks bad, Conan!

274
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,984
It seems like the water level is rising!

275
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:43,684
Both of you go back.

276
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,384
-But... -Never mind.

277
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:47,185
Just leave everything to me and go.

278
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,385
Hey, wait up!

279
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,884
Just what do you think you're doing?

280
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:10,684
This is an authorized personnel only zone!

281
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:12,885
I'm fully aware of that.

282
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:17,284
The riverbank. The children are at the riverbank.

283
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,684
Stop the water!

284
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,185
What?

285
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:25,885
Conan!

286
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:34,085
I've got only one chance to try and make an escape.

287
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:51,684
Conan's really in trouble.

288
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:54,985
It's dangerous here, too. Let's go up the bank!

289
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:05,285
-Conan! -Conan!

290
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:10,985
Now!

291
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,185
Genta, catch this!

292
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:26,485
Okay, leave it to me!

293
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,584
Okay, everybody. Pull!

294
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:50,384
Okay! Leave it to me.

295
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:51,385
-Okay! -Okay!

296
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:06,085
Are all of you all right?

297
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,684
Conan.

298
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,185
-Conan. -Conan.

299
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:22,584
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:24,385
It's all because of me.

301
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,584
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:19,884
I guess I really overslept.

303
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:22,385
I'd like some curry, too.

304
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:25,484
What's wrong everybody?

305
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:28,884
Nothing. We're just tired.

306
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:31,584
Where is Conan?

307
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:34,684
He's exhausted and asleep in the boy's tent.

308
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:38,484
He's always like that.

309
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,984
He doesn't think of what happens

310
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:44,184
after he exhausts himself playing and sacks out.

311
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:46,284
Oh, well...

312
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:50,084
Why am I wearing pajamas?

313
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:52,585
How come? How embarrassing.

314
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:56,885
Hey.

315
00:23:57,985 --> 00:24:01,485
"Next Episode" -The view has been kept as it was in the Edo period.

316
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:08,985
You guys are like Momotaro.

317
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:12,684
This is just like the Momotaro legend!

318
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,784
Let's do it! Let's do it!

319
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:15,785
Hey, hey.

320
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,384
A peach?

321
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:19,184
It's a Momotaro's peach!

322
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,285
It can't be!

323
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:27,885
Next Conan, "Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 1)"

324
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,984
Next Conan's Hint:

325
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,984
"Mirrored image."

326
00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:50,384
-In the next episode... -I'll tell only you about it, Conan.

327
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:52,084
The fact is I...

328
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:53,085
Huh?
