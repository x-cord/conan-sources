1
00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:09,469
-Bull's Eye! -Strike!

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,169
Awesome!

3
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:20,769
It feels kind of uncomfortable being invited

4
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:23,869
to the client's birthday party

5
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,169
when the case isn't solved yet.

6
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:27,769
What're you talking about?

7
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:29,669
You were the one who was all excited

8
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:32,269
saying that Asako from Strawberry invited you to come!

9
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:35,169
After all, they're one of the most popular

10
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,869
comedian couple around now.

11
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,969
"Jiro Imaoka, Asako Fujimori" -Strawberries taste of love.

12
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:45,769
"Fujimori"

13
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:46,869
I'm Mouri.

14
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:49,769
Thank you for inviting us over tonight.

15
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,569
What's the matter, Asako?

16
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:04,369
A man suddenly broke in from the veranda and I...

17
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:06,969
Asako!

18
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,669
Hey, Conan!

19
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:19,769
Zombie?

20
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,269
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

21
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,569
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

22
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,569
A popular man and woman comedian.

23
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,969
The key to this difficult case is strawberry.

24
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:31,669
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:33,669
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:35,769
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:20,555
"The Night the Zombie Died"

28
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:22,523
"Mouri Detective Agency"

29
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:25,323
It all started a week ago.

30
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:26,623
Ms. Asako Fujimori of the popular man and woman

31
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,923
comedian couple, Strawberry,

32
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:32,223
came to the Mouri Detective Agency asking to have a job done.

33
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:34,323
Keisuke Numata?

34
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:36,023
He's a man I used to go out with

35
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:40,223
about 15 years ago when I first came to Tokyo.

36
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:42,623
He didn't have a good personality,

37
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:46,523
so I parted with him right away though.

38
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:50,023
The moment that Strawberry won the Spring Comedian Grand Prix

39
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:52,223
and your popularity started to grow!

40
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:55,623
I got repeated calls from asking to lend him money.

41
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:58,923
I refused and he started giving me a bad time.

42
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:00,323
Started giving you a bad time?

43
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,923
My mailbox was messed up.

44
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:06,823
When I walk the streets at night, I feel like someone is following me.

45
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:07,823
The other day,

46
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:11,023
I found marks on the front door attempting to be forced opened.

47
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:16,923
Your pendant is cute.

48
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,923
This is a medicine case.

49
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:21,623
-Medicine case? -Yes.

50
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:25,123
I've had a weak heart since I was a child.

51
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:29,323
So I always keep medicine in here and carry it around with me.

52
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:30,723
Unforgivable.

53
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:34,723
Targeting such a fragile woman.

54
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,623
I see.

55
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:41,823
So, she asked you to look for that guy called Numata?

56
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,123
Yes, sir. I checked everywhere,

57
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,223
but I still can't come up with where he is.

58
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:48,123
To start with, I told her to change the lock

59
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:52,023
that is hard to do picking on.

60
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:54,523
I think that Numata found out about this,

61
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:57,023
and decided to force himself in.

62
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:02,923
Asako, your left arm is bruised.

63
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:05,523
That guy grabbed me.

64
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,023
Asako.

65
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:12,423
"Minoru Hisamatsu (60)" -You really surprised me, really.

66
00:05:12,423 --> 00:05:15,323
-Are you all right? -Mr. Hisamatsu!

67
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:18,123
Mr. Hisamatsu, Strawberry's manager.

68
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,723
Why on earth...

69
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:23,623
A man suddenly came in with a pistol.

70
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,023
I got desperate and...

71
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:28,623
Take off his mask.

72
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:30,023
Yes, sir!

73
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:39,523
No? It can't be!

74
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:41,623
Jiro!

75
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:48,323
Why? Why, Jiro?

76
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:49,923
Jiro!

77
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:54,023
It's a model gun.

78
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:58,923
Can you give us the details of when Jiro came inside?

79
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,623
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,923
Today's my birthday.

81
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:06,223
I invited him to come at 7:00 pm to have dinner

82
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:08,323
with Mr. Mouri who has been looking after me.

83
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:11,123
Hamburger, right?

84
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:12,523
What's this?

85
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:14,223
It's fruit punch.

86
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:16,423
I made it for dessert.

87
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:18,723
It was when I was cutting strawberries...

88
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:24,523
I heard glass crack.

89
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:37,423
I'm going to kill you!

90
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:39,123
No!

91
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:42,323
-No! -Stay still!

92
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:44,023
You're Numata, aren't you?

93
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:45,223
Shut up!

94
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:47,223
No!

95
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:06,223
That's when Mr. Mouri and the others arrived.

96
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,223
You should cool it.

97
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:09,723
Thank you.

98
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:16,123
Inspector! According to the calls received record,

99
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:19,723
the victim before breaking in here at about 6:45 pm,

100
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:21,423
made a call somewhere!

101
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:24,223
K?

102
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:27,523
Check out who it is right away.

103
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:28,823
Yes, sir!

104
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:33,523
Didn't you invite Jiro to come today?

105
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:37,023
He told me that he had to meet somebody today.

106
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,023
Why did Jiro do something like this?

107
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:43,023
-Do you have any idea? -No.

108
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:46,423
Mr. Hisamatsu, how about you?

109
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:48,823
Well...

110
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:54,223
Jiro was trying to quit being a pair with Asako!

111
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,323
-What? -What?

112
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:58,823
What? It can't be...

113
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:00,823
Jiro entered the world of comedy

114
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:02,823
right after graduating from high school.

115
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:04,023
Although he had good looks,

116
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:05,323
he didn't have guts going on stage.

117
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:07,923
So things didn't work out.

118
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:11,323
Asako insisted that Jiro had talent,

119
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,023
aggressively established being a pair with him

120
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:14,723
and after 10 years of hard work,

121
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:17,623
everything starting to bloom.

122
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:21,423
Being busy worsened Asako's heart condition.

123
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:23,223
She began to take off from stage performances and TV,

124
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:26,223
or her reaction during their act would be delayed.

125
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:29,923
It seems that Jiro couldn't tolerate that.

126
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,623
Come to think of it, I too,

127
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:34,623
during the time I was guarding Asako...

128
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:37,323
-Jiro! -Hi, Jiro!

129
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:39,823
"Strawbery" -Well, it was really good!

130
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,523
No! No good!

131
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,823
You didn't react on time, three times!

132
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,323
Just what do you think you're doing?

133
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:50,623
I'm sorry, my heart wasn't feeling right.

134
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:52,123
Who cares?

135
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,623
We're professionals, you know?

136
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:54,923
Come now...

137
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:57,723
Asako has a lot on her mind too and is tired.

138
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:59,823
I can't go on like this anymore.

139
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:01,623
Hurry on up and quit already!

140
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:09,123
-Did he tell her to quit? -Yes, sir.

141
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:10,423
Come to think of it,

142
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:13,623
I've seen a lot about it in the weekly magazines and stuff.

143
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:16,023
Oh, here.

144
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,023
"Get together party with girl announcers"?

145
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:20,023
"Dating idols"?

146
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:23,023
It seems he was pretty open about going out with women.

147
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,823
Asako and Jiro were not only comedy pairs,

148
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:30,023
but were they were also lovers.

149
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:33,423
Yet, as soon as they started getting popular, Jiro...

150
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:35,923
Not being able to tolerate it any longer,

151
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:38,723
I too, warned Jiro about his actions.

152
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:41,223
That's when he said...

153
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:42,823
Dissolve being a pair?

154
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:47,223
Yeah, with Asako the way she is, we can't possibly continue, right?

155
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:50,323
I've had enough of being held back by her!

156
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,623
After all Asako did for you,

157
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:54,923
how could you talk like that?

158
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:58,223
That's a totally different story.

159
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,523
After dissolving being a pair, just what do you intend to do?

160
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:05,223
With my looks I could probably stand alone, don't you think?

161
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:09,123
At any rate, it's better if our ages are not so close.

162
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:11,423
You...

163
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:15,523
Regardless, I don't want to do comedy with Asako anymore!

164
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,723
Her time's up already, time to withdraw!

165
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:21,123
Mr. Hisamatsu, tell her that she should think about retiring too!

166
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:23,123
Won't you?

167
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,823
The one that helped him to get where he is now is Asako.

168
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:32,423
Why did Jiro have so many rubber masks?

169
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,623
Yeah, it seems he was thinking of doing

170
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,623
a one-man comedy using rubber masks.

171
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:40,323
One-man comedy?

172
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:44,323
Do comedy while changing masks one after the other.

173
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,223
He showed me a bit of it,

174
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:47,523
but it wasn't anything you could laugh at

175
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:50,123
even as a flattering remark.

176
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,223
Inspector!

177
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:54,323
The person the victim called has been identified!

178
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:55,723
A locksmith!

179
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,623
You mean like the one who helps you

180
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,023
get the door open when you lose your key or something?

181
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:04,123
Yes. But according to them,

182
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,723
the call was dropped soon after they answered.

183
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:09,623
They thought it was a wrong number.

184
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:13,923
I heard from the resident who lives on the 2nd floor here,

185
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:18,323
just when the weather forecast was aired at around 6:50 pm,

186
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:22,323
the resident witness a man climbing up the veranda to her room.

187
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:23,623
No mistake about it?

188
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:25,523
No, because the witness said

189
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:29,823
he had seen the victim and Asako practicing in the park many times.

190
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,523
So, no mistake about it.

191
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:34,723
You mean he wasn't wearing the zombie mask at that time?

192
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:36,823
What? Yes.

193
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:40,223
Which means he put the mask on after he got to the veranda.

194
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:47,323
A piece of glass?

195
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,823
What's up?

196
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:57,723
Hey!

197
00:11:57,723 --> 00:12:00,423
Kids stay in the corner and stay put!

198
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:04,723
Hey, there's something on the hem of Jiro's pants!

199
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,023
What?

200
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:08,123
It's cocklebur, isn't it?

201
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:11,823
That stuff can get stuck anywhere, can't it?

202
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:14,323
It hurts.

203
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:17,923
Asako, did you go out somewhere today?

204
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:21,823
No, I was in the room all day today.

205
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:23,023
But...

206
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:28,523
Inspector! Regarding the truth of this case,

207
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:30,423
I, the famed Kogoro Mouri,

208
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,423
has figured it out!

209
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,846
"Strawberries taste of love" -As his popularity grew,

210
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:42,046
people started pampering him and Asako was in the way.

211
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:47,146
But, if he conspicuously parts with her, it may ruin his reputation.

212
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,946
Therefore, he came up with an idea.

213
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:51,246
An idea?

214
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:55,346
Asako was being stalked by a man called Numata.

215
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:58,246
Jiro took advantage of this.

216
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:00,846
He would break in pretending to be Numata

217
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,746
and shock Asako out of her wits.

218
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:08,046
It would certainly affect her heart, forcing her to resign!

219
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:09,146
What?

220
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:11,546
Jiro would never do something like that!

221
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:16,146
But, if you think of it that way, everything falls into place.

222
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:18,146
The reason Jiro put on a zombie mask

223
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:22,946
and armed himself with a model gun, cracking the window to break in here!

224
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:26,846
It was all so that he could cut ties with you!

225
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:28,346
It can't be...

226
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,746
However, Asako who resisted,

227
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:32,646
stabbed him with the knife she was holding.

228
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,446
Inspector.

229
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,046
It would be more accurate to say, that the knife poked into him.

230
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:41,846
Asako had no idea that the attacker was Jiro.

231
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:43,746
That's why she resisted.

232
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:46,546
No matter how you look at it, this is a case of self-defense.

233
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:48,246
I see.

234
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:52,846
Pops's deduction is logical and thinkable.

235
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,146
But...

236
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:01,546
Just as I thought.

237
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:04,946
He called the locksmith at 6:45 pm,

238
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:09,146
and was witnessed climbing up the veranda at 6:50 pm.

239
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:11,046
Judging from the time known,

240
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:14,046
he must've called from around here.

241
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:15,246
Found it!

242
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:19,446
This cocklebur is what was on Jiro's pants.

243
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:22,246
This grassy area is so stepped on all over.

244
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:25,546
Was somebody looking for something in the grass?

245
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:27,446
I get it!

246
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:30,046
So, that's what it was!

247
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:34,046
Asako, I'm sorry about this unfortunate case,

248
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:37,546
but please come to the station for statement details on the incident.

249
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,246
Yes, sir.

250
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,046
Conan. Where were you?

251
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,446
Somewhere.

252
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:47,046
There...

253
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:54,846
-Just as I thought. -What is it?

254
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:57,146
Really greedy when it comes to food.

255
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:02,346
Cold enough to make your teeth sting, that's what's so good.

256
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,646
-Shall we go, then? -Yes, sir.

257
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:14,146
Inspector!

258
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,546
Will hear me out a bit longer?

259
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,846
You mean there's something more?

260
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:23,146
The thing I said a while ago was the exterior scenario.

261
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:27,246
The true scenario is hidden behind.

262
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:29,446
The scenario behind?

263
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:33,246
Yes. The scenario that goes

264
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:36,146
Asako feigns killing Jiro in self-defense.

265
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:37,746
That scenario!

266
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:41,746
-What? -What're you talking about?

267
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:45,546
Asako, a man named Keisuke Numata

268
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:48,046
doesn't exist in this world, does he?

269
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:50,046
He does!

270
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,546
I showed you his picture, didn't I?

271
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:56,546
All you had to do was pull out some old pictures,

272
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:58,646
that would do the trick anytime.

273
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:03,346
You made up a make-believe character named Numata,

274
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:06,546
and showed me how terrified you were.

275
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:08,146
You led me to think that you mistook Jiro,

276
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,646
the masked zombie, for Numata.

277
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:13,646
You made up a scenario of the knife mistakenly as a self-defense

278
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:16,146
and had me deduce it, likewise.

279
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:18,046
That's enough!

280
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:21,046
To begin with, if Jiro didn't wearing that zombie mask

281
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,846
and break into this room,

282
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:25,346
this wouldn't have happened!

283
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:28,746
You're the one who set it up to be this way, is it not?

284
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:31,846
Asako, at sundown around 6:00 pm

285
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:35,446
you met Jiro in the park, didn't you?

286
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:39,146
No. I was here preparing dinner.

287
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:42,446
You said you were making fruit punch.

288
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:46,146
-Ran, taste it, will you? -What?

289
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,046
You're good at cooking, right?

290
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:50,446
So taste it and let me know what you think.

291
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:51,546
Okay.

292
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:59,146
How about it?

293
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:02,846
It's a bit too sweet and maybe a bit too cold.

294
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:04,546
I'm sure she had it in the refrigerator

295
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:07,546
with the contents soaked in syrup.

296
00:17:07,546 --> 00:17:08,546
But, this...

297
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:12,346
Right, if she made that just before the incident occurred,

298
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:14,046
she wouldn't have had to make it that sweet,

299
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:16,746
nor would it have been that cold.

300
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,346
In other words,

301
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:21,646
Asako made it part way and put it in the refrigerator.

302
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:25,446
And then, went to the park to meet Jiro.

303
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,746
How can you be so sure?

304
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,246
Cocklebur.

305
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:32,346
It can be found on the hem of Jiro's pants.

306
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:38,346
It's a plant that is rarely seen in Tokyo recently,

307
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:42,846
but there are some growing in that park over there.

308
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:47,146
And on Asako's sneakers at the front door,

309
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:50,046
cockleburs are also attached.

310
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:51,546
You lied to Jiro at the park

311
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:55,546
saying that you dropped your room key.

312
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,146
The cocklebur stuck onto you when you were looking

313
00:17:57,146 --> 00:18:00,746
for the key together in the grass, right?

314
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,546
Jiro called the locksmith

315
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:07,446
in order to have him open the door.

316
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:10,546
But, since they were lovers,

317
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:13,246
Jiro also had the key to this room.

318
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:15,146
Just the other day, I told her to change the lock

319
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:17,446
to cope with the stalker problem.

320
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:21,146
This was also a part of Asako's plan.

321
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:25,646
She probably hadn't given the spare key to Jiro yet.

322
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,846
And you went on to finish your plan.

323
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:31,346
What's wrong?

324
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:33,146
An attack? Where's your medicine?

325
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,046
I think, I forgot it in the room.

326
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,946
The locksmith's not going to make it here in time!

327
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:41,446
Jiro... Please...

328
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:45,746
The window of the veranda isn't locked,

329
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:48,046
so can you go up the scaffold used for construction.

330
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:50,346
Really, what a nuisance!

331
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:55,946
While Jiro was using the scaffold used for construction and climbing,

332
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,846
you beat him to the room by using the elevator

333
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,246
and with the key that you hidden and went into the room.

334
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:13,046
Asako. Why?

335
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:18,946
And after you killed Jiro,

336
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:21,846
you took the hamburger and fruit punch that you half made

337
00:19:21,846 --> 00:19:25,546
out of the refrigerator.

338
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,546
Even if that were to be true,

339
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,646
we don't have enough proof.

340
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,846
The bruise on Asako's left hand.

341
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:36,546
If you grab left arm of a person you're confronting with your left hand,

342
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:41,046
the mark of the thumb should be left on the outside of the arm, but...

343
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,946
The direction of the bruise is opposite!

344
00:19:43,946 --> 00:19:48,346
She bruised by grabbing herself firmly with her right hand.

345
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:51,746
The other is the zombie mask.

346
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:53,746
Please take a good look at it.

347
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:56,946
There are little pieces of shattered glass on the inside.

348
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,846
What?

349
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:00,446
It's true!

350
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:04,446
If Jiro broke into the room wearing the zombie mask,

351
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:08,246
glass pieces wouldn't have been found on the inside of the mask.

352
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:11,346
In other words, after she killed Jiro,

353
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,546
she cracked the glass herself

354
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:18,946
and made him wear the zombie mask after that.

355
00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:22,546
And the only one who could've done that is Asako.

356
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:25,546
You're the only one who could've done that!

357
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:28,046
Asako.

358
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:31,946
I couldn't forgive Jiro.

359
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,846
What you said a while ago, Mr. Hisamatsu,

360
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:38,746
-I heard about it too. -What?

361
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:42,346
After you left the room, Jiro...

362
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:47,746
Our long days as lovers have already ended!

363
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:51,846
I'm making a new start!

364
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:00,546
We worked so hard together.

365
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:04,346
All our hard times just started to fruit and yet,

366
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,546
Jiro drank the sweet juice of that fruit alone

367
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,546
and was about to leave me!

368
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:11,746
I just couldn't forgive him.

369
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:43,446
Asako, this just arrived.

370
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,746
It's for you.

371
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,046
Are you having a good time at your birthday party?

372
00:22:56,046 --> 00:22:57,346
-Happy Birthday. -Happy Birthday.

373
00:22:57,346 --> 00:23:00,546
-Here's a gift for you. -Here's a gift for you, a ring.

374
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:04,246
Let's end our comedy pair relationship and going with each other.

375
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:07,246
Please marry me.

376
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:10,646
It's hard for me to tell you to quit being a comedian

377
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:12,546
but take care of your body,

378
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:15,846
and start a new life with me.

379
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:21,746
Strawberry will always live on in both our hearts.

380
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,446
This...

381
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,146
This can't be...

382
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:31,946
Jiro! I'm sorry, Jiro!

383
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,046
Jiro!

384
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:39,546
I'm sorry!

385
00:23:39,546 --> 00:23:43,146
At times the hearts of people go separate ways

386
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:45,746
and give birth to irreplaceable mistakes.

387
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:52,046
This case was one of those sad cases.

388
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:56,946
I wonder if she got to tell him what she wanted to?

389
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:58,146
That she likes him.

390
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,846
What? Why?

391
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:03,746
"Not being able to leave him alone",

392
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:06,146
I think it is the same as you like him.

393
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:14,946
The person was here until just a while ago.

394
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:18,446
The one who killed him.

395
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:20,046
Next Conan,

396
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:27,046
"Ms. Kobayashi's Love Affair"
