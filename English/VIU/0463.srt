1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,455
Trump!

2
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:04,655
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:06,155
The presence of the Black Organization is uncomfortably felt.

4
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:07,455
Solve the mystery of the shiny hammer,

5
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:09,055
and bring the case out in the light!

6
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:10,355
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:11,955
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:13,955
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:58,337
A father and son comes to the Mouri Detective Agency.

10
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:01,937
The son, Takumi, witnessed a body being thrown into the Teimusu River

11
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:05,037
from the bridge on the way to visit a shrine on New Year's day.

12
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:10,737
Moreover, he said that there's nail drawing on the arm of the culprit.

13
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:14,337
He also mentioned that he saw a big shiny hammer near the site.

14
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:22,737
And the dead body of a popular musician

15
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:25,237
named Roku Itagaki is found in the river.

16
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:33,737
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Queer Lightning"

17
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,737
This is the New Haido Bridge.

18
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:39,437
The bridge on the other side of this bridge is Central Haido Bridge.

19
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:42,837
And the one beyond it is Big Haido Bridge.

20
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:46,537
How about it, Takumi?

21
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:47,737
Do you remember anything?

22
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:49,037
Nope.

23
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:51,737
You can at least tell us

24
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:54,337
where the guy who threw the bag with the body inside was, right?

25
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:56,137
I don't remember.

26
00:02:57,437 --> 00:03:01,037
Did you see fireworks behind him, then?

27
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:04,337
If I'm not mistaken, that firework...

28
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:10,037
was supposed to have been shot up from this side,

29
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:12,737
so I thought that he could tell us where the fireworks went up.

30
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:16,137
We could tell which side the suspicious man was.

31
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:17,837
How about it, Takumi?

32
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:21,237
Fireworks?

33
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:22,737
I see!

34
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:24,737
Maybe...

35
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,237
The big hammer that Takumi saw

36
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:29,537
was the fireworks reflected on the surface of the water?

37
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:32,737
-Huh? -You know,

38
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:35,837
when fireworks go up, they create a tail of light

39
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:38,537
and that probably looked like the handle of a hammer to you.

40
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:40,737
But...

41
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:43,537
Then it's not the tip of a hammer.

42
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:47,337
The most fireworks would look like is a tadpole,

43
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:48,737
and even if it disperses,

44
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:51,337
it would look more like a frying pan than a hammer, wouldn't it?

45
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:52,537
I see.

46
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:54,037
Hey.

47
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,237
I didn't see any fireworks.

48
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,637
I heard the sound but I couldn't see it.

49
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,437
Which means the suspicious guy

50
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:03,637
was on the side where the fireworks didn't go up?

51
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:08,537
I hate to butt in, but I wouldn't be too sure about that.

52
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:10,137
Huh?

53
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,037
That day,

54
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,937
Takumi was sitting in the backseat,

55
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:16,537
but both lanes were crowded.

56
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:19,337
I was in the center lane.

57
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:21,437
So the window of my car was blocked by the car next to us.

58
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:24,137
That's why he may have been at an angle where he couldn't see it.

59
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:30,037
I guess we'll have to go on to the next bridge then.

60
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,837
This is the Central Haido Bridge,

61
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,637
which is in the center of the two other bridges.

62
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,337
Anything that comes to mind is a clue.

63
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:50,837
Yes, yes.

64
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:54,437
Hello.

65
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:56,337
Sonoko. What?

66
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,937
Ran, did you hear about it?

67
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:58,937
About what?

68
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:01,237
What? What do you mean by that?

69
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:04,037
Roku! Roku died!

70
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,837
Yes, I saw it on the news a while ago.

71
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:10,537
It seems he can't remember for now,

72
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:13,137
so shall we keep the shiny hammer on hold for a while?

73
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,337
Okay, okay.

74
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:15,437
I guess we have no choice

75
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:18,837
-but to search for those with a nail tattoo on his arm. -Sonoko, don't cry.

76
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:20,537
But unlike in the past,

77
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:24,937
tattoos have become a part of fashion nowadays, so many people have them.

78
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:26,337
Hey, Sonoko.

79
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:30,037
Does Roku Itagaki have anything to do with a nail?

80
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:33,637
Yes, a drawing of a nail that looks sort of grotesque.

81
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:34,737
What?

82
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:38,337
Sonoko, can you say that again please?

83
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:43,737
Like I told you, it's the logo for his old indies band, Nail Snake.

84
00:05:43,737 --> 00:05:46,937
It is a snake with its head pierced through with a nail.

85
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,737
Do you know anybody that is wearing a tattoo of that logo?

86
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:51,837
There are many.

87
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:56,237
There seems to be a tattoo shop that is also a fan shop of the band.

88
00:05:56,237 --> 00:06:00,437
So if you're a fan and want a tattoo, that's the place to go.

89
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:04,637
I'm sure that shop was somewhere near Central Haido Bridge.

90
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:06,337
Huh? Ran?

91
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:07,537
Ran?

92
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:08,737
Hey.

93
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,337
No!

94
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,337
This isn't the drawing that I saw!

95
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,837
Are you sure it's not this drawing?

96
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:20,737
It's true that this drawing isn't a grotesque drawing of a nail.

97
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:22,637
That logo of the band,

98
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,537
has it been changed to a new one?

99
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:26,037
Huh?

100
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,137
Look!

101
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,537
The thumb tack on the lower right that holds the flag in place isn't there.

102
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:33,037
You were just about to put a new one on, right?

103
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:35,537
Besides, there is a part of the wall that isn't discoloured

104
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:37,537
because it was overshadowed by that flag.

105
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:39,337
There are also places on other parts of the wall

106
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:42,037
that aren't discoloured, too.

107
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:44,537
So I thought maybe there must've been something there

108
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,437
that was recently removed.

109
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:49,337
I'm amazed you noticed, sonny.

110
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,037
That's right.

111
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:54,337
This is the new logo.

112
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:56,137
It won't be official until next week.

113
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:58,237
It's this drawing!

114
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:00,437
I saw this drawing on his arm!

115
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:03,637
Have you given this tattoo to anyone yet?

116
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:05,237
Huh? Yeah.

117
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:09,337
Some hardcore fans heard about the logo change.

118
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:13,537
They insisted on having the new logo tattoo.

119
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:14,737
Here it is.

120
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:18,037
Look. It was these three.

121
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,237
From the right, Mr. Kiritani,

122
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:22,437
Mr. Yasui,

123
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:24,537
and Mr. Kannai, I think.

124
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:28,837
The customers who get tattooed send us their pictures later.

125
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:33,237
Takumi, do any of these men look familiar?

126
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:37,037
It was dark and he was wearing a hat, so I can't tell.

127
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:42,637
But I saw the nail as he was getting into his car, which was nearby.

128
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:44,437
Car?

129
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:47,137
Does the person in the middle owns the foreign car

130
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:48,637
that he's leaning against?

131
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:52,637
Yes. I think he said that he's been riding it for 10 years.

132
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:55,237
Hey, wasn't it this car?

133
00:07:55,237 --> 00:07:56,337
It's black, too.

134
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:59,137
I can't tell.

135
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:02,337
What about the cap that the person to the right is wearing?

136
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:04,937
It wasn't that kind of hat.

137
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:08,337
Hey, why did they decide to change the logo?

138
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:13,937
Actually, this logo was designed by Roku, who debuted as a soloist.

139
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:18,037
It seems that many fans requested the logo to change.

140
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:20,737
Because of what happened to Roku,

141
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:24,437
Nail Snake is going to hold a memorial live performance tonight.

142
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,037
Despite all kinds of things happening, Roku was the leader's best friend.

143
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:32,837
The person behind this person is...

144
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:39,037
Yoko Okino.

145
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:40,437
I mean the thing that she's holding

146
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,037
is the pot I was talking about this afternoon

147
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:45,437
that you can get from buying the drip type coffee.

148
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:49,837
So Yoko was the one advertising it.

149
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:54,037
You didn't even see the commercial so how did you find out about it?

150
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:55,237
Well...

151
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,637
It's because of this.

152
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,837
The advertisement vehicle.

153
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,837
It was so cute that I took a picture of it with my cell phone.

154
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,337
Wait a second.

155
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:10,237
If there's an advertisement vehicle for the pot, maybe...

156
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:13,037
No, there couldn't be.

157
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:15,237
May I have a look at it, too?

158
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,237
Sure.

159
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:20,737
But it really is a cute coffee pot.

160
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:30,237
I'm sorry. I think I mistakenly pushed the wrong button.

161
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,537
No problem, really.

162
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:38,637
And here we are at Big Haido Bridge, the last bridge.

163
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:41,237
I guess you don't remember anything, right?

164
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:44,037
About which bridge you saw that suspicious man on.

165
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,437
Let's go to the police.

166
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:06,037
There are some things Takumi said that are incomprehensible,

167
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,937
but it seems that he's telling the truth.

168
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:13,437
But I'm sure the police will question him persistently

169
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:15,637
about the shiny hammer and all.

170
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,437
I see. So that's the story.

171
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,737
I've figured out

172
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:50,437
who put Roku Itagaki in the bag and threw him in the river.

173
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,570
But I really saw it!

174
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,970
A big shiny hammer.

175
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,370
You know what, kiddo?

176
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,170
I think he's talking about a dream that he had.

177
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,570
A dream?

178
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,970
It's not a dream!

179
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,470
The part about Mr. Itagaki being thrown in the river

180
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,370
was probably a coincidence.

181
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,370
But about him having seen Mr. Itagaki's face from inside the bag,

182
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,570
and the thing about the nail tattoo on the arm

183
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,570
were all probably what he dreamt, too.

184
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,170
Back then, it was about this dark, right?

185
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,270
You can't see a person's face or a tattoo.

186
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,370
I guess not.

187
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,270
Wait.

188
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,170
Maybe it's the fireworks?

189
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,170
He saw a lot of things because the place was lit up by the fireworks.

190
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,170
It seems that the fireworks were shot up at the start of the New Year.

191
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,970
Which means that the suspect was on the other side,

192
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,570
where you could see the fireworks.

193
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,070
If he was on the side where the fireworks went up,

194
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,470
it wouldn't be too easy to see that tattoo

195
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,570
because it would be overshadowed by backlight.

196
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,870
I see.

197
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,770
But if he was on the other side of the bridge,

198
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,970
he would be able to see the face that stuck out of the bag.

199
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,270
I don't think he'd be able to make out the tattoo drawing on the arm.

200
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,570
Even if the car Takumi was riding was in the middle lane,

201
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,570
it'd still be hard to see the handrail.

202
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,670
So how could he see the man's arm?

203
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,570
I told you, I saw it because the car's driver side window was down.

204
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,270
That means you saw the tattoo on the man's arm

205
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,970
when the man got in his car, right?

206
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,970
But he would've had to sit in the driver's seat.

207
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,370
If so, I don't think that you could've seen the tattoo.

208
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,170
But I saw it.

209
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,570
Maybe...

210
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,470
the man had his arm out of the driver's window?

211
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,970
Wait! That means that his tattoo is on his right arm.

212
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,270
If the car was in the other lane,

213
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,270
the car would be facing right if looking from this side.

214
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,070
His right arm can't be seen.

215
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,870
Okay, let's go to the tattoo shop that we went earlier

216
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,470
and have them show us the picture again.

217
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,770
I don't think we can.

218
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,070
Because they said they would be closing at 18:00 today

219
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,670
to go to a memorial live performance.

220
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,970
Hey...

221
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,470
Maybe...

222
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,370
there's a snapshot of them on your cell phone, Ran?

223
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,270
Right, Eisuke?

224
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,170
I found it! It's here!

225
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,970
I don't remember taking a picture like this though.

226
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,670
Well,

227
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,370
when I mistakenly pushed the button,

228
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,770
I guess I took it coincidentally.

229
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,870
Well, I guess it was an unexpected success born of failure.

230
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,770
Thanks to this picture,

231
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,670
the guy to the left with the tattoo on his left arm is ruled out,

232
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,570
so the culprit's been narrowed down to the guy on the right

233
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,770
and the one in the middle.

234
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,170
The culprit was riding his car, right?

235
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,470
So the person with his car in the picture is the most suspicious.

236
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,470
Idiot.

237
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,270
The guy to the right may be riding it, too.

238
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,670
But the sales clerk said he's been driving foreign cars for 10 years.

239
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,770
That's more the reason why the guy in the middle could be a car lover,

240
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,470
driving around in a foreign car and...

241
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,070
A foreign car?

242
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,970
The steering wheel of a foreign car is on the left.

243
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,870
That means if he had a foreign car, the wheel would be on the left.

244
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,370
The inside is dark so it cannot be seen from this side.

245
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,470
Ran, give that to me.

246
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,270
But he could've rented a Japanese car on that day.

247
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,270
No.

248
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,270
If he rented a car, he would've rented a foreign car.

249
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,470
Because everything would go to waste if he gets into an accident

250
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,170
while driving a car with the steering wheel that he's not used to

251
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,670
when transporting the corpse.

252
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,070
So the culprit is?

253
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,670
Yeah. The guy to the right, the one wearing the cap.

254
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,570
If I remember correctly, his name is Kiritani.

255
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,270
Let's report it to the police right away and have him arrested.

256
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,170
No. It's still impossible to get him arrested.

257
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,270
Everything we've come up with till now is just circumstantial evidence.

258
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,770
We don't have any conclusive evidence yet.

259
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,170
But with all that we have,

260
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,770
the police could take him to the station and interrogate him.

261
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,970
Possibly making him confess.

262
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,670
After all, there's Takumi's testimony, too.

263
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,470
However,

264
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,870
he shouldn't say anything about the shiny hammer.

265
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,470
Yes, I understand.

266
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,470
But I...

267
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,670
I really saw it!

268
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,870
Takumi.

269
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,570
Hey.

270
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,070
Maybe he's talking about this building?

271
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,570
Look. The lights on both sides of the elevator connects

272
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,770
and it looks like the handle of a hammer.

273
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,070
Hey, like I've been saying, unless there's the tip of the hammer,

274
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,670
it doesn't look like one.

275
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,670
What did the tip of a hammer look like?

276
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,070
I guess there are all kinds.

277
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,470
Cylindrical ones,

278
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,470
ones with nail removers on one side that look like an upside down boat.

279
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,770
Talking of upside down,

280
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,070
there may be ones that are inflated in the middle

281
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,270
that kind of looks like a pot turned upside down.

282
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,470
-Pot! -Pot!

283
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,770
Come to think of it...

284
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,570
Just as I thought. Look!

285
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,870
There are decorative lights around the pot.

286
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,670
Which means that the hammer was upside down, right?

287
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,570
What Takumi saw was the decorative lights on the advertisement vehicle

288
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,170
and elevator light overlapping each other,

289
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,770
resulting in what resembled a large hammer.

290
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,370
So you weren't dreaming after all.

291
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,670
I'm sorry, Takumi.

292
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,670
It's okay.

293
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,870
Why didn't he say it was upside down in the first place?

294
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,670
But the fireworks went up on this side, right?

295
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,870
If the culprit was on the side opposite the fireworks,

296
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,070
I don't think Takumi could've seen the building in question.

297
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,470
It's true that it doesn't look that way from this bridge,

298
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,270
but he can see it from Central Haido Bridge that is between that building.

299
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,870
Which means that the culprit threw the bag with the dead body inside

300
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,570
from Central Haido Bridge.

301
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,970
Yeah, most probably.

302
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,770
We'll probably be able to find some evidence over there.

303
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,470
Over there?

304
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,770
The elevator of that building is round and protruded.

305
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,370
In order for the light on the other side to come into view

306
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,070
and become two beams of light,

307
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,370
you've got to move along a bit.

308
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,870
But then if you move too much,

309
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,470
the pot will look too backwards that it won't look like a hammer.

310
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,370
So you have to be at a specific place to see a perfect glowing hammer.

311
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,770
So if we match all this,

312
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,770
the place where the culprit dropped the bag with the corpse inside

313
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,870
can more or less be specified.

314
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,870
But what kind of evidence could there be?

315
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,070
Probably...

316
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,970
If the culprit threw the lighter away,

317
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,570
the fingerprints of the culprit may at least be found on the lighter.

318
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,670
He may have been wearing gloves when he dropped the bag,

319
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,370
but if he drove off soon after he threw the lighter away,

320
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,470
I'm sure he took them off.

321
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,270
Since the tattoo was near his wrist,

322
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,670
Takumi couldn't see the nail tattoo if the culprit was wearing gloves.

323
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,070
Maybe he's at Roku's memorial live?

324
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,970
It could be, but we've got to find the evidence before we...

325
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,270
You know,

326
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,470
I've thought up an interesting way to make the culprit confess right away.

327
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,770
So the final song for today

328
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,770
is the song that my best friend, Roku, loved the most.

329
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,370
Just what do you think you're doing?

330
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,170
This is a parking lot, you know!

331
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,770
It'll be a disaster if the flames touch the cars.

332
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,470
Oh, just some kid.

333
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,670
Excuse me. I'm with the police.

334
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,770
I'm very sorry,

335
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,570
but I'd like to ask you to come with us for questioning.

336
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,870
Why?

337
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,970
We've got a witness saying that somebody who resembled you

338
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,270
threw a bag with a dead body inside from Central Haido Bridge.

339
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,970
He's watching you from the car on the other side

340
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,170
and he said that he's certain you're the one.

341
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,770
You mean he's saying he saw my face?

342
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,570
No, he didn't see your face.

343
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,270
He saw that tattoo of yours.

344
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,370
What?

345
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,670
And he also says he heard your voice.

346
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,370
Huh? The guy must be lying.

347
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,470
He couldn't have heard my voice

348
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,970
because there were fireworks at that time.

349
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,570
He couldn't have heard you because of the fireworks?

350
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,370
Officer Takagi, you heard him just now, didn't you?

351
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,570
Yes, sir! I definitely heard him!

352
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,270
The fact that there were fireworks shot up

353
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,070
is something that only the culprit and witness know.

354
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,970
We'd like you to explain at the station

355
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,770
why you made such a remark just now.

356
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,570
Don't tell me that you guys set up the fireworks just now, too?

357
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,270
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,670
We recreated the circumstances of what happened that day

359
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,870
and pretended to show you to the witness,

360
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,870
but we just wanted you to recall the events of that day,

361
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,070
to make you say the word "fireworks" from your side.

362
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,670
Well, setting up something as simple as this,

363
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,970
can only be thought up by a brat, though.

364
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,170
After that, Mr. Kiritani was taken to the station

365
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,870
and confessed without resisting.

366
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,570
His motive was a grudge he held against Mr. Itagaki

367
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,370
for betraying the band and debuting alone.

368
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,670
He firstly intended to dispose the corpse in a mountain some distance away,

369
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,370
but he noticed that the police

370
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,870
were checking for drunk driving on Central Haido Bridge

371
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,770
and decided instantly to throw the corpse over the bridge.

372
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,070
By the way, the thing he threw down from the bridge

373
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,370
was Roku's lighter after all.

374
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,970
In order to hide the blood that splattered on him while hitting Roku,

375
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,370
he seems to have worn Roku's jacket that was in the room.

376
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,370
When he disposed the corpse,

377
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,670
he absentmindedly used Roku's lighter that was in the jacket.

378
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,070
The lighter was also found in Teimusu River.

379
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,370
With Takumi's testimony, Mr. Kiritani is sure to be arrested, too.

380
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,170
With this in mind, we finished interrogation and head for home.

381
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,070
Today was really exciting!

382
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,970
After all, I was able to work and solve the case

383
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,170
where a famous person was killed.

384
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,570
No, no.

385
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,570
I bet you've disclosed various kinds of cases

386
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,970
involving famous people.

387
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,870
Or at least cases about them, right?

388
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,570
Of course.

389
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,570
Yoko Okino asked me to work for her several times.

390
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,870
What? You mean that top idol?

391
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,470
You're indeed a renown detective, aren't you?

392
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,770
I guess so.

393
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,770
Then I bet there have been cases with famous people that didn't go public.

394
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,570
You know, when a famous person comes to you in secret.

395
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,470
And you solve the case

396
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,370
even before it makes the news.

397
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,570
I wonder if I have ever handled a case like that?

398
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,570
What? Come on.

399
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,070
Please tell me without being bashful, Detective Mouri.

400
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,570
If it's okay with you, we can talk about it over dinner from now.

401
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,270
I'm feeling pretty sleepy.

402
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,570
I'm sorry, Eisuke. Can we make it some other day?

403
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,470
It seems that Conan's tired.

404
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,070
Okay.

405
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,070
No doubt about it.

406
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,770
There was someone recently, too.

407
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,170
Let's see...

408
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,970
You know, they were on TV a lot,

409
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,370
but is taking a rest and now they don't appear anymore.

410
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,570
This guy is trying to get information...

411
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,670
on Rena Mizunashi.

412
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,570
I can't be showing you our cards that easily.

413
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,270
So long as you keep your cards covered.

414
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,370
"Next Episode" -What? A case?

415
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,570
Toriya Town?

416
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,970
The boy back then...

417
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,470
No doubt about it.

418
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,770
Which means...

419
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,270
Don't tell me this guy actually took us here because of the boy?

420
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,370
Next Conan,

421
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,170
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Mysterious Hefty Reward"

422
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,170
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,370
"The Red-headed League"

424
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,770
I love Holmes!

425
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,170
You're just like a certain Holmes freak that I know.

426
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,270
That's true.
