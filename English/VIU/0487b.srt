1
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:03,809
Okay,

2
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:05,509
while we're waiting for the forensic officers to arrive,

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,709
I'd like you to answer my questions.

4
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:10,509
I would like to know where all of you were

5
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:11,709
and what you were doing

6
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:13,709
before finding Mr. Moroguchi's dead body.

7
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,609
First, let's start with you, Mr. Dejima.

8
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:17,909
I... I was in my room

9
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:20,609
fixing this tape recorder.

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,409
Something seems to be wrong with it.

11
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:24,809
The tape inside is all wrinkled

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,209
and when I try to rewind it...

13
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,209
See! This is how it sounds.

14
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,509
True. It does sound funny.

15
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,609
Next. How about you, Mr. Tarumi?

16
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,809
After I finishing setting things up for shooting,

17
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:39,809
I returned to my room

18
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,909
and was organizing the negatives for a different job.

19
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,809
I bundled them up with this rubber band.

20
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,209
Okay.

21
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:49,809
Then, next Ms. Anabuki.

22
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:51,309
I was also in my room

23
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:54,209
looking over the draft of another writer.

24
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:55,809
Ms. Anabuki.

25
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:57,909
You had a metal tape on you, didn't you?

26
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,109
Do you always carry it around?

27
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:01,709
What? Yes.

28
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,509
Because Mr. Moroguchi usually tells me

29
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,209
to measure things, like the size of the fonts.

30
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,909
But if it's to measure the fonts,

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,809
won't a ruler do?

32
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:13,109
Hey, Sonny.

33
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:14,909
She not only had to measure fonts,

34
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,209
but all kinds of other stuff too.

35
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:19,809
Like doors and windows

36
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:22,109
that were likely to be used as tricks.

37
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,509
You sure know a lot.

38
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,009
The late Akiba used to tell me all these things.

39
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:29,709
All three of us

40
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,509
joined the company together with Mr. Akiba, so...

41
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,509
I quit partway

42
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,609
and became a free-lance writer though.

43
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,909
I see. Is that right?

44
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,309
Officer Sato...

45
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:44,609
It has nothing to do with the case, but...

46
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,609
What is it, Ran?

47
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,509
That's probably the forensic officer.

48
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,309
I'm sorry, Ran.

49
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:53,709
Could you wait till later?

50
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,809
Sure.

51
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,209
It's genuine?

52
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,909
That ring was genuine?

53
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,009
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,609
It was brought back to the station

55
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,709
and taken to an appraiser right away,

56
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,409
so there's no doubt about it.

57
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,309
Which means, the culprit wasn't after the ring.

58
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:18,509
Yes, that's right.

59
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,309
Then, why?

60
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:24,209
For what reason did the culprit remove the ring?

61
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,409
And when the ring was removed,

62
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,309
there was a strange trace left behind.

63
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:30,809
A strange trace?

64
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:32,009
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,909
Over here.

66
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:36,109
Although it seems to be a very old mark...

67
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:39,309
It's a round, black mark.

68
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:41,109
I wonder if it's a trace of blood?

69
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:42,709
Blood...

70
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,309
Why would there be blood here?

71
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,209
He could've been shaving

72
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,009
and cut himself pretty deep.

73
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:53,109
Then he may have touched the place.

74
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:57,009
See, there's a cut spot under his right jaw.

75
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,009
No doubt about it.

76
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:00,209
By the way,

77
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,509
from the coffee cup,

78
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:03,009
the saucer,

79
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:04,509
coffee maker,

80
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:06,009
and the doorknob,

81
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,309
nothing other than the victim's fingerprints have been found.

82
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:10,809
I see.

83
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:16,009
Excuse me, Officer Takagi...

84
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,209
What is it?

85
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,509
I know this is a very inappropriate time to say something like this,

86
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,509
but I just have to say it.

87
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,609
What is it, Ran?

88
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,809
Congratulations on your engagement.

89
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,009
What?

90
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,409
Ran?

91
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,809
Because see,

92
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:35,209
isn't the ring that Officer Sato is wearing

93
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,209
on her left hand ring finger

94
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,309
an engagement ring?

95
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,509
It looks to be so.

96
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:46,709
Looks to be so?

97
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,109
Aren't you the one who sent it to her, Officer Takagi?

98
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,209
I'm sure she got it from somebody, somewhere.

99
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:53,809
You mean she switched to somebody

100
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,209
who's more reliable and good-looking?

101
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,609
Dad!

102
00:03:57,609 --> 00:03:59,109
Could be.

103
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:00,609
What do you mean, could be?

104
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,509
Why don't you go and ask her straight?

105
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,609
I wish I could.

106
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,909
I'm afraid what her answer might be.

107
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:10,909
Really.

108
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,809
I feel like I'm walking on a tightrope.

109
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:18,709
Maybe you already fell off the tightrope?

110
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,909
Could be.

111
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:23,509
-That's what it was. -Dad, stop teasing him!

112
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:27,209
That's why the culprit removed the ring.

113
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,509
The culprit did it

114
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,109
to carry out the "tightrope walk" in the locked room!

115
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:36,209
But something bothers me.

116
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,409
The door and the window of the room were locked.

117
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,109
Mr. Moroguchi is found in the room dead

118
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:45,609
after drinking coffee poisoned with cyanide.

119
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:47,209
In his left hand,

120
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,609
he is holding the key of the room that has no spare.

121
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:52,309
The only thing that was open

122
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:53,509
was the ventilation window

123
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:55,509
that a child can barely pass through.

124
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,909
With the information we have now,

125
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,809
it could be taken that Mr. Moroguchi committed suicide,

126
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:04,809
not wanting anyone else in this villa to be suspected.

127
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:07,309
But the question is,

128
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:11,209
why was the ring that he had on his left ring finger

129
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:15,109
on upside down?

130
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,509
If it's just as she says,

131
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,409
and Mr. Moroguchi didn't take this ring off

132
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:20,609
most of the time.

133
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:21,609
And taking into consideration that he was not the type

134
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:25,409
that would do something sloppy like wear his ring upside down.

135
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,109
After the culprit poisoned Mr. Moroguchi to death,

136
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:31,109
the culprit for some reason, took off the ring

137
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:32,309
and when putting it back on his finger,

138
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:35,209
put it back on upside down.

139
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,009
Maybe the culprit removed the ring

140
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,409
only because there was blood on it?

141
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,409
Well, there was blood under the ring

142
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,109
that got on when he shaved, right?

143
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:50,009
That's why the culprit may have taken it off once

144
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:51,709
in order to wipe the blood off.

145
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:54,009
No. But if so,

146
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,009
the blood on the finger would've been wiped off too.

147
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:59,009
Even if the culprit were to wipe the blood off the ring,

148
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,109
if the blood on the finger isn't wiped off,

149
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:02,509
it would be meaningless.

150
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,609
I think the culprit wiped the blood off

151
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:06,009
without taking the ring off, don't you?

152
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:07,509
I guess so.

153
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:10,709
Maybe that man...

154
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,409
was sewing?

155
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,209
Sewing?

156
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,609
Just what do you mean, Conan?

157
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:19,809
Yes, because you see,

158
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:23,109
the other day when Ran made me the rag to take to school,

159
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:25,409
she was also wearing a ring, right, Ran?

160
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,909
Are you talking about the finger shield?

161
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,509
When you wear it,

162
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,809
it makes it easier to pull the string

163
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,409
through the hole of the needle, right?

164
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,309
No! Conan.

165
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,609
A finger shield is worn

166
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:41,609
to hold the back of the needle down.

167
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,009
What?

168
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,309
I thought that you wore it

169
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:48,509
and pulled something through the hole of the needle!

170
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,709
I guess I made a mistake.

171
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:07,951
Pulled something through the hole of the key?

172
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:10,051
So, the ring?

173
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,951
I... I get it!

174
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:20,251
Pops!

175
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,751
Rubberband!

176
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,251
Rubberband?

177
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,551
First, you take the rubberbands

178
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:28,951
and hook them up together.

179
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,751
You pull the ring through the rubberbands

180
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,651
and make a sling.

181
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,651
Then the front and back part of the key

182
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:36,851
are hooked on to each end of the rubberband.

183
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:37,951
The key was then

184
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:40,251
flown from the ventilation window into the room!

185
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,651
The length of the rubberbands

186
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:42,751
can be adjusted to the desired length

187
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:45,251
just by connecting rubberbands!

188
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:47,051
Of course, the culprit did this

189
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,851
after poisoning Mr. Moroguchi,

190
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:52,251
locking the room up and leaving.

191
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,751
And the only one who could've done this is

192
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:55,851
the one who still has

193
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,851
a number of rubberbands around his wrist.

194
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,051
Cameraman, Mr. Tarumi.

195
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:02,951
You!

196
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,751
How about it? Am I wrong?

197
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:09,351
No. I... I didn't do it!

198
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,651
Pops, wrong.

199
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:14,851
But if he were the one,

200
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:18,451
the rubberbands should still be in the room, shouldn't they?

201
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:21,251
After all, they were flown in here together with the key.

202
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,351
Then, it must've been just one side!

203
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,651
The culprit held one end of the rubberband

204
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:28,651
and passed the key through the other end to fling it!

205
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:29,751
That way,

206
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,451
he can retrieve the rubberband

207
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:33,651
by pulling on the end that he is holding!

208
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,951
Even if the culprit were able to retrieve it that way,

209
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,451
the knot made in the rubberband

210
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,451
would hook on to the ring and be pulled.

211
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:41,551
So, I think that the victim's arm

212
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:44,351
would be hanging facing outward from the bed.

213
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:45,551
Besides,

214
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,051
I wonder if the culprit would choose to carry out

215
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:49,551
an extremely difficult feat as to fly the key into the room

216
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,551
and place it on the victim's hand?

217
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:54,451
If the method fails, it would just look as if

218
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,251
the key was thrown in from the ventilation window.

219
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,751
That's true too.

220
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,451
I mean, it couldn't be taken any other way!

221
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:06,451
Darn. I'd like to put Pops to sleep like always

222
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:08,551
and start a deduction show,

223
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:11,651
but since Officer Sato is here...

224
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,851
She almost saw through the other time too.

225
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:15,951
I guess I'll just have to

226
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:19,651
lead him into realizing what really happened.

227
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,551
Right, Pops!

228
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,451
I don't think that even a circus performer

229
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:26,151
could do something like that!

230
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:27,651
Circus?

231
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,451
You mean magician, don't you?

232
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:33,651
But Officer Takagi just mentioned it a while ago.

233
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:36,051
He said tightrope.

234
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,351
This means that you both

235
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,151
are going to do a circus performance, right?

236
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,451
Hey, Conan!

237
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,151
-That's... -What is it, Officer Takagi?

238
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:48,451
Conan.

239
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,851
-Much too cruel. -Wait. Tightrope?

240
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:53,551
Tightrope...

241
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,151
I see! There's the stuff!

242
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:57,951
The thing that can be used to retrieve the rubberband right away

243
00:09:57,951 --> 00:09:58,951
without getting stuck on the ring.

244
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:01,751
A long and slender thing!

245
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,451
You finally got it, Pops.

246
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:08,751
That is the thing that editor Ms. Anabuki...

247
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:12,451
The metal tape measure!

248
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:15,751
Are you saying that the ring

249
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,951
was pulled through the tape measure?

250
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,751
No, the ring was hooked on to the tip of the tape.

251
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,251
And then that tape measure

252
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,951
was pulled through the hole of the key

253
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:26,551
and was taken from outside the ventilation window

254
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:29,251
to the palm of Mr. Moroguchi's hand!

255
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:30,951
Just like in tightrope!

256
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:32,651
Hey, hold it!

257
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:35,051
When was that tape measure pulled through

258
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,451
the hole of the key?

259
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:37,951
That's of course,

260
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,951
right after the culprit poisoned Mr. Moroguchi!

261
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,251
The key was pulled through the tape beforehand,

262
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:45,351
then the ring was hooked on to the tip of the tape,

263
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:47,551
then extended over to the ventilation window.

264
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:48,751
If the tape measure

265
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:51,651
is hooked onto the rim of the window along with the key,

266
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,651
after committing the crime, all that needs to be done

267
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,851
is to pull the tape measure up.

268
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:57,451
Then the key will move along the tape measure

269
00:10:57,451 --> 00:11:01,451
all the way up to Mr. Moroguch's palm!

270
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:04,551
Of course, it can be retrieved with the push of a button too!

271
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,851
So,

272
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,151
if the culprit pulls the key through the tape

273
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:12,151
before leaving the room,

274
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,851
it would be impossible to lock the door, right?

275
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,251
Oh, I see.

276
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:18,551
No, no.

277
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:20,051
Maybe the culprit extended the tape measure

278
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,951
after committing the murder and leaving the room,

279
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:26,951
and after going over to the ventilation window from outside.

280
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:28,051
See!

281
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,751
Metal tape measures are stiff

282
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,151
so the culprit probably used it like a stick,

283
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,651
and hooked the tip of the measure nicely

284
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,651
onto the ring of the dead body.

285
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:37,951
Only up to 1 meter though.

286
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,451
If it goes beyond that, it'll break.

287
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:41,951
It's impossible to get it to reach the bed,

288
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,351
much less, the palm of his hand.

289
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:45,651
Besides,

290
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,451
if the culprit only had to hook the tape measure onto the ring,

291
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:49,751
there's no need to remove the ring at all, is there?

292
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,151
That... that's true.

293
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:54,451
Yes. If there's a narrow string-like thing,

294
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:56,551
then maybe it's possible.

295
00:11:56,551 --> 00:12:01,451
But the three suspects had nothing like that on them.

296
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:03,851
The vicinity around the villa is being investigated,

297
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:07,151
but there's been no report of anything like that being found yet.

298
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,451
Of course nothing would be found, right?

299
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:10,951
Unlike the rubberband,

300
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,751
there could never be something that won't get stuck by the ring,

301
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:16,151
that is thin and slippery like a long string,

302
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,451
that's so convenient

303
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:18,951
that it's usually wound around something

304
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,851
like a tape measure when not in use.

305
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,751
Wait!

306
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,651
Hey! Don't tell me that's...

307
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,551
-Cassette tape! -Cassette tape!

308
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,951
I see.

309
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,551
If a cassette tape were used,

310
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,251
the tape could be pulled out to quite a length

311
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,851
and put through the ring.

312
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:38,351
Then, if the tip of the tape and the cassette itself

313
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,751
are left outside the ventilation window...

314
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,751
After killing Mr. Moroguchi with poison,

315
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:45,051
the culprit can leave the room, lock the door,

316
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:47,051
put the tip of the tape that is left

317
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:50,051
outside the ventilation window through the hole of the key

318
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,551
and hold the tape up high...

319
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:54,451
Then, due to gravity,

320
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,651
the key would slide along the tape

321
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,151
and reach the palm of the dead man's hand.

322
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,151
Then, if the tape is wound back,

323
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:04,351
it will slide through the hole of the key and the ring,

324
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,851
and return to the cassette,

325
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,151
succeeding in locking the room up!

326
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:12,451
The one who could've used this trick is

327
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:16,251
someone who usually carries around cassette tapes

328
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:18,651
and wouldn't be suspected by the police

329
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:21,151
even if investigated.

330
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:23,651
Is there such a person here...

331
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:26,251
Mr. Dejima, the writer.

332
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:27,851
You're the only one thinkable.

333
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:31,451
You probably said something like,

334
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,051
wanting to make the finishing touches

335
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:36,751
on the talk show that was scheduled for this morning

336
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:39,351
and got Mr. Moroguchi to let you into this room.

337
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,351
And when he was off his guard,

338
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:44,551
you mixed cyanide into his coffee

339
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,351
and poisoned him to death.

340
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,851
Then you set up the locked room trick

341
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:50,151
using the method that was just explained.

342
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:52,351
Well? Am I wrong?

343
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:00,251
Well, we'll find out if we check

344
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:03,051
the cassette tapes that you have.

345
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,251
I'll bet you want to say that it'll be wrinkled up,

346
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:08,551
but did I say that myself?

347
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:09,751
This recorder...

348
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,151
is not working well.

349
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:16,251
There are many tapes that are wrinkled.

350
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:18,251
Besides, with all the noise it makes

351
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:19,951
when the tape is rewound,

352
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,051
someone is bound to have heard it!

353
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,151
If without using this,

354
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,551
the tape was rewound manually,

355
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,551
the wrinkled parts of the tape

356
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,151
would be spread over a large portion of the tape.

357
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:34,751
Please feel free to check them.

358
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,351
I have no such tape on me.

359
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:40,351
No.

360
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,451
A pencil!

361
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,051
If you use the pencil

362
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,451
that you borrowed from Mr. Moroguchi last night,

363
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,851
stick the pencil into the hole of the cassette

364
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:48,751
and wind the tape,

365
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:50,651
the recorder doesn't have to be used,

366
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:54,051
to rewind the tape in a short time

367
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,451
without damaging the tape that much.

368
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:59,751
I used to do it a lot when I was a kid too.

369
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,851
After pulling a lot of tape out for fun,

370
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:07,751
I rewound the tape by placing a pencil on my lap.

371
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,751
Besides, when Officer Sato mentioned checking the tapes,

372
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:15,451
she didn't say it to mean checking on wrinkled tapes.

373
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:17,251
Like mentioned before,

374
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,351
blood was on the base of the left ring finger,

375
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:21,851
where he wore the ring.

376
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,151
However, for some reason,

377
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:25,151
there was no blood on one part.

378
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,651
Therefore, among the tapes that you have,

379
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,751
there should be one that was used

380
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:32,151
to tightrope across the locked room

381
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:35,851
with Mr. Moroguchi's blood on it.

382
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,551
Mr. Dejima.

383
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:40,351
Don't tell me that you killed him because of Akiba...

384
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,251
Tightrope...

385
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:46,651
Akiba used to tell me too,

386
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:49,151
that getting along with Mr. Moroguchi

387
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:52,751
was always like walking on a tightrope.

388
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,651
Tightrope?

389
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:57,751
Akiba used to be a quiet man,

390
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,551
but ever since he became in charge of Mr. Moroguchi,

391
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:03,151
he always had bandages around him somewhere.

392
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,551
What do you think it was?

393
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:06,951
He was trying out

394
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:08,951
something that Mr. Moroguchi told him to try.

395
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:11,651
He was testing whether the murder trick

396
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:13,251
that Mr. Moroguchi thought up would really work,

397
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,651
using his own body.

398
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,151
Of course, he was very careful

399
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:20,751
so as not to really die doing it.

400
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,351
Hey, then don't tell me that you...

401
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:27,051
That thing about Akiba dying in a locked room...

402
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,651
I found it when I was cleaning out

403
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:31,051
Akiba's desk at the company.

404
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:33,051
"Mr. Moroguchi's Trick Note"

405
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:36,351
A notebook with the exact method of dying

406
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,951
that Akiba died of!

407
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:41,551
Then, why didn't you submit it to the police?

408
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,251
No use.

409
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,851
Mr. Moroguchi would probably say

410
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:48,951
Akiba did it of his own free will, even if he were questioned.

411
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,651
But it was an accident, wasn't it?

412
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:56,251
Mr. Moroguchi said the following at another interview.

413
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,751
At this age,

414
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,051
I'm finally beginning to understand

415
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,851
the feeling of a murderer.

416
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,251
Nothing can be more delightful than this

417
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,951
for a detective story writer.

418
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:07,351
That's what he said.

419
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:10,751
So that's when I was convinced

420
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:14,651
that what Mr. Moroguchi wanted to know using Akiba

421
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,051
was not reality

422
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,551
but rather, the mentality of a killer.

423
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:51,149
Well, something's been bothering me for quite some time.

424
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:53,049
What is it?

425
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,749
What do you mean what is it?

426
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,149
What's this thing about tightrope with me?

427
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,549
Just what does that mean?

428
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,549
Well, that's... You see...

429
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,949
The ring!

430
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:06,049
Officer Sato, you say that you don't like jewelry

431
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,449
and yet you're wearing a ring.

432
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:10,349
Officer Takagi wants to know why.

433
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,649
Maybe I should've come along with Pops by train.

434
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,849
You mean this good luck charm to keep away evil?

435
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,749
-Good luck charm? -Good luck charm?

436
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:23,349
That's all?

437
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:25,449
Just what do you mean?

438
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,749
Silver and turquoise.

439
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,349
Wearing this on the left ring finger,

440
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,449
keeps bad luck and bugs away from me,

441
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:33,449
so I get to kill two birds with one stone.

442
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:36,849
That's what Yumi told me, so I decided to get one too!

443
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:41,949
Because, you see, I'm cursed and hate bugs too.

444
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:45,849
Well, I don't think Yumi was really talking about bugs.

445
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,749
If... if so...

446
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,449
Officer Sato!

447
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:53,449
Please wear my ring on your left ring finger!

448
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:58,149
Okay.

449
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,049
Oh, boy, am I in trouble?

450
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:06,449
I'll bet I'm going to get it from everybody today.

451
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:09,949
I mean, after all, Officer Sato's going to be wearing my ring

452
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:13,349
on her left ring finger.

453
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:14,949
"First Investigation Division"

454
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:17,549
I guess I'll act upright

455
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,449
and be a man today.

456
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:24,349
Takagi!

457
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,649
I heard about Officer Sato's ring.

458
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:28,149
Here it comes.

459
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:30,349
That ring...

460
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:33,449
was a lucky charm to keep away evil, right?

461
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,649
Why does everybody know about it?

462
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:37,149
Don't worry about it.

463
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,849
No big deal!

464
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:41,349
But to think she didn't know what it meant

465
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,649
to wear a ring on her left ring finger...

466
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:47,149
Her being naive makes her even more attractive.

467
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,149
Come to think of it, I didn't tell her

468
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,449
what that ring means yet.

469
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:53,949
Oh, well...

470
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,949
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,849
"Take-out delivery service".

472
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,849
In the next episode, a famous person will appear.

473
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,449
A friend of ours is a celebrity!
