1
00:00:02,656 --> 00:00:04,556
Anytime, anywhere.

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:07,556
Whenever and wherever, Nijimura is the bag.

3
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:10,756
Wet with water, no problem.

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:13,456
Bash, struck or hit, worry not!

5
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:15,656
Anytime! Anywhere!

6
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:17,356
Whenever and wherever,

7
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:19,156
you need a bag.

8
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:20,656
Get Nijimura!

9
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,856
Anytime! Anywhere!

10
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:27,256
Whenever and wherever, Nijimura is the bag.

11
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:30,356
Are Nijimura bags really selling that well?

12
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:33,256
Yeah. It's their rainbow colored trademark

13
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:34,556
that makes them so popular!

14
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:37,956
This is that popular?

15
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,456
Besides, Nijimura bags are very sturdy

16
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:43,356
and highly waterproof.

17
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:47,656
See. This zipper is said to be the same kind

18
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,456
that is used for scuba diving suits.

19
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:51,356
Even if you drop it into the water,

20
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:53,656
the contents inside don't get wet.

21
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,956
However, no doubt this is a celebrity brand,

22
00:00:57,956 --> 00:00:59,856
there's one too many zeros...

23
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:02,456
No, two more than we can afford!

24
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:05,756
I was hoping to find an affordable pouch,

25
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:07,256
but I guess not.

26
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:08,556
Not too fast!

27
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:12,556
We've taken on President Nijimura's personal request.

28
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:15,856
If succeed seeing it through, pouch or poncho,

29
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:17,456
I'll buy you all you want!

30
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:21,256
They don't carry ponchos, you know.

31
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:23,156
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

32
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:25,356
President Nijimura should be here in a moment.

33
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:27,256
Someone! Help!

34
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:28,556
What was that?

35
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,456
Conan!

36
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:34,356
What are you doing?

37
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:35,956
Let me go!

38
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:40,056
Help!

39
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,456
President Nijimura!

40
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:45,456
A kidnapping!

41
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:52,356
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

42
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:54,956
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

43
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:56,956
Disclose the seven colored mystery

44
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,356
hidden behind rainbow colored bag after the rain.

45
00:01:58,356 --> 00:02:00,056
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:01,956
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

47
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,656
No cases is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

48
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:50,602
"Rainbow Colored Kidnapping."

49
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:05,196
We had roadblocks set up five minute

50
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:07,096
after the incident occurred,

51
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:09,096
but failed to locate any suspicious vehicles.

52
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,096
Perhaps you misread the plate number?

53
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,696
That's impossible.

54
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,196
By the way, you are?

55
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:16,696
"Kenzo Katsuragi, age 45" -I'm Inspector Katsuragi from SID,

56
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:19,296
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

57
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,796
SID?

58
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,596
First division of the police headquarters,

59
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,696
the Special Investigation Department.

60
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:27,396
It's a section for handling hostage situations

61
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:30,396
such as kidnappings or hijackings.

62
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,896
Oh, you know a lot, don't you, sonny?

63
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:37,496
But then, why is a kid like you in a place like this?

64
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:41,696
I also witnessed the crime scene, so...

65
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:45,296
I'm sorry, we won't interfere with your work.

66
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:48,496
Detective, may I ask you to leave?

67
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,296
Investigating kidnapping for ransom is our job.

68
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,296
But we can't be sure

69
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:54,596
that this is a kidnapping case asking for ransom.

70
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:56,596
No, it's been confirmed.

71
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,196
"Saki Nijimura, age 35."

72
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:02,596
This was inside our mailbox.

73
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:04,796
Excuse me, but you are?

74
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:07,396
I'm Nijimura's wife, my name is Saki.

75
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:09,896
I'm the vice president of the company.

76
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:11,196
Allow me...

77
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:18,196
We have President Nijimura.

78
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:19,496
If you want him released,

79
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:22,796
put 100 million yen in a Nijimura handbag

80
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,296
and have Saki carry it.

81
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:27,296
At precisely 2.00pm, go to Touto Ikebukuro Station

82
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,696
and board the Blue Sky express train,

83
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,396
have her get off at the last stop, Okuho Station.

84
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:35,396
However, anytime, anywhere,

85
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:38,196
we will be watching closely.

86
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:42,196
If we see any authorities, the hostage will die.

87
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:46,896
From Black Rainbow?

88
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,896
Darn those jerks.

89
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:51,996
A hundred million yen ransom?

90
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:53,796
Any idea who they might be?

91
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:57,096
To tell the truth...

92
00:05:57,096 --> 00:06:01,796
We've always had problems with copied products of our brand.

93
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,496
We have just began filing a lawsuit.

94
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:08,496
It could be that companies like those

95
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,496
have a grudge against you, because of this.

96
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,896
It's plausible, since that anytime, anywhere in the ransom note

97
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:16,896
is Nijimura's catch phrase.

98
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,196
And also the name with black added

99
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:22,296
in front of rainbow trademark.

100
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:24,996
It's something that an illegal copy business would do.

101
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:26,296
Stop right there.

102
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,096
We will take over the investigation,

103
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,396
so leave immediately.

104
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:32,196
Hold it. Detective Mouri was actually contacted by my husband

105
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:35,896
to collect evidence pertaining to the lawsuit.

106
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,896
I'm also afraid to carry that much money all by myself,

107
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:41,396
so I'd like him to be my bodyguard.

108
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:42,896
Just count on me!

109
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:50,696
Allow me to carry it outside.

110
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:52,596
Oh, no, thanks.

111
00:06:56,596 --> 00:07:00,596
Worry not! Anytime, anywhere...

112
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:08,396
"Touto Ikebukuro Station Inbound, Blue Sky express train."

113
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:15,096
Hey, why do you guys have to come?

114
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:18,596
As camouflage, didn't you say so yourself, Dad?

115
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:21,196
Yeah! Hiking...

116
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:24,496
Anytime, anywhere.

117
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:26,896
We don't know when or where the culprit may appear.

118
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:50,596
Understood.

119
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:10,696
Next stop is the last stop, Okuho Station...

120
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:12,296
You may transfer to the Koushu Express Line

121
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:14,596
or the Touto Okuho Line.

122
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,696
"Okuho Station."

123
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,396
Hey, let's hurry!

124
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:37,696
Oh, yeah...

125
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:39,296
Hurry up!

126
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:41,996
Yeah, right.

127
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,796
Madam, what did the culprit say?

128
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:44,796
Transfer now.

129
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:46,696
Transfer?

130
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,596
We'll be late for the train!

131
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,996
-We barely made it. -Thank goodness.

132
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,396
It would've taken forever to wait for the next train.

133
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:29,696
You're right.

134
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,196
I'll go this time.

135
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:48,796
Wow, it's so fast!

136
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,796
Let me see that paper.

137
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:53,996
Transfer to the Touto Okuho Line,

138
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:55,396
and when you reach the middle of the Nakatoro Bridge,

139
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,496
toss the ransom money bag outside.

140
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,796
What?

141
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:04,296
"Nakatoro Bridge."

142
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,296
This is...

143
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:09,996
What siren is that?

144
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:33,496
Shoots! The dam's being discharged!

145
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:34,496
What?

146
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,196
Oh, no! Darn, the culprit's plan is...

147
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,996
To flush away the bag!

148
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:50,196
I see, so that's why they demanded that the ransom

149
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:52,796
be put in a sturdy and waterproof Nijimura bag.

150
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:55,096
Darn, what a cunning criminal!

151
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:57,196
Contact the other squads! Downstream!

152
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:58,196
Have them go downstream!

153
00:10:58,196 --> 00:10:59,196
Yes!

154
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:07,296
Are you all right?

155
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:08,696
Oh, yeah.

156
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:11,296
I'm sure your husband is fine.

157
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,596
Thank you.

158
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,196
What's this? What's eating at me?

159
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,496
I have this terrible feeling.

160
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:20,596
You still can't locate the bag?

161
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,696
I see, continue the search.

162
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,796
Our transmitter bug planted on the name tag

163
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:27,496
seems to have been damaged by the water.

164
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,696
Unfortunately, the terrible feeling I had,

165
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,796
soon became true.

166
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,596
The handbag swept away by the dam,

167
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:42,996
was retrieved at the riverbank five kilometers downstream.

168
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:45,996
But the 100 million yen inside the bag

169
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,596
was apparently taken by the culprit.

170
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:50,596
All we had left to do was to wait

171
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:53,396
for the release of the hostage, but...

172
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:57,596
The next morning,

173
00:11:57,596 --> 00:12:00,396
along with the stolen vehicle that was used during the kidnapping,

174
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:04,396
the murdered body of President Nijimura was found.

175
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:07,596
Darling, why?

176
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,296
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,296
We will do everything we can to apprehend the culprit.

178
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:16,896
You're sorry? You don't even mean it!

179
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:18,896
It's because they spotted you police

180
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:19,996
that they killed my husband!

181
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:22,996
No, we didn't expose ourselves.

182
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:24,796
Madam, please calm down.

183
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:28,096
Then it was you! You were discovered by the culprit!

184
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:29,596
What kind of great detective are you?

185
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:30,896
No...

186
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:35,996
Inspector?

187
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:38,196
Regarding your husband's murder,

188
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:40,396
we've come across new information.

189
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:43,096
What?

190
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:53,223
The time Nijimura was murdered

191
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:57,323
was determined to be between 11.00am and noon yesterday.

192
00:12:57,323 --> 00:13:00,823
What? He was kidnapped around 10.30am, so...

193
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,823
Those jerks! Hostages only get in their way,

194
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:05,823
so they killed him shortly after kidnapping him.

195
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:09,023
And still worked up the nerve to demand a ransom.

196
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:10,523
How horrible.

197
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,323
This...

198
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,723
You can't, Conan.

199
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:16,923
Why's that kid here?

200
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:20,523
The name tag with the bag is missing.

201
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:24,123
Stay out of this! Here!

202
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:25,923
Sorry about that.

203
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:27,323
Let's go, Conan.

204
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:33,123
At any rate, the culprit is a cold, ruthless and sly.

205
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:34,723
This is a murder case.

206
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:38,623
Katsuragi, we will be joining the investigation from here.

207
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:39,823
Yes, sir.

208
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:42,423
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Why at a time like this, you may think,

209
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,723
but, no, because it is a time like this,

210
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,623
I have to respond to the love

211
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,323
and support shown to our Nijimura bags.

212
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:49,623
I hereby vow to work

213
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:52,523
to live up the reputation of the company.

214
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:55,223
And, regarding the fake products

215
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:58,423
that have been troubling our beloved customers,

216
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:00,723
I demand that law enforcement authorities

217
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:03,223
reinforce efforts to fight copyright infringement

218
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:05,123
until total annihilation has been achieved!

219
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:07,123
Where are you going, Dad?

220
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:08,623
Where else?

221
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:09,923
Recheck the crime scenes thoroughly.

222
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:11,123
It's the motto of the police,

223
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:12,723
no, rather for detectives too!

224
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,323
In that case, I'll go too!

225
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:16,423
Don't be stupid!

226
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,323
How can I work when a kid's with me?

227
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,923
However, I was at the scene from the beginning this time.

228
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:24,223
If you forget or miss something,

229
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:26,223
I might be able to pick it up.

230
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,223
Don't you dare talk back to me.

231
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:29,823
See, two heads are better than one.

232
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:31,423
Three heads are better than two.

233
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,823
-What? -I was at the scene from the beginning too.

234
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:36,623
So I won't let you leave me behind.

235
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,823
Okay.

236
00:14:42,123 --> 00:14:43,823
"Nijimura Office Backdoor."

237
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:45,923
The incident started here.

238
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,623
How scary,

239
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:50,323
to think that the kidnapping happened right in front of us.

240
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:56,723
The police set up road blocks immediately,

241
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,123
yet they failed to spot the criminal.

242
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:02,123
Carrying the ransom,

243
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,723
Saki boarded the Blue Sky express train.

244
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:07,723
"Okuho Station" -She then transferred here, at Okuho Station.

245
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:10,523
Most likely, this was the culprit's attempt

246
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:13,823
to distract the police.

247
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:15,623
Then, as the train she transferred to,

248
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,023
was just about to pass the bridge,

249
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:19,423
she tossed the bag into the river

250
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:21,923
from the window of the train.

251
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:25,923
That was just when the dam was scheduled to be discharged water.

252
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:28,023
Thus, the bag was swept away

253
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:30,023
by the increased amount of water and current of the river.

254
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:33,223
When it was finally found at the riverbank five kilometers downstream,

255
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:37,223
the ransom money had already been taken by the culprit.

256
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:45,123
By the way, the name tag that was rigged with the transmitter

257
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:47,123
wasn't found on the bag, right?

258
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:49,823
The bag tumbled downstream due to the force of the current,

259
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,223
so the tag must've fallen off.

260
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:55,823
The discharge from the dam was surprisingly strong.

261
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:58,123
To think it could have pushed a bag weighing ten kilograms

262
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,323
over a distance of five kilometers.

263
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:04,323
Yeah, Saki must've been carrying a lot of weight.

264
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,523
Come to think of it, at that time...

265
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:08,723
Allow me to carry it outside.

266
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:11,123
Oh, no, thanks, I'll be all right.

267
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:15,223
Don't tell me...

268
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:19,023
Don't tell me...

269
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,423
The rain stopped.

270
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:23,623
You're right.

271
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,723
Hey, look at that!

272
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,523
Oh, a rainbow!

273
00:16:27,523 --> 00:16:28,723
Beautiful!

274
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:32,223
Red, orange, yellow, green,

275
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:34,823
blue, indigo, violet!

276
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:41,723
I see, so that's what it is!

277
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:46,723
Hello, Nijimura speaking.

278
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:49,323
It's me, Kogoro Mouri.

279
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:52,523
I've figured out who kidnapped and killed your husband.

280
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:54,223
Are you sure?

281
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,923
Your press conference served as a hint.

282
00:16:57,923 --> 00:17:02,323
Tomorrow morning, I will reveal the truth at the riverbank

283
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:05,223
under the bridge where the bag was tossed.

284
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:06,323
Bye.

285
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:13,523
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What did you say?

286
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:15,123
You know who the culprit is?

287
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:17,523
Really, Inspector?

288
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:19,723
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

289
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:21,823
Under that bridge, you say?

290
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:22,823
Right that!

291
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,523
Now, for the finale.

292
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:54,723
-What? -The wife?

293
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:58,923
That's the ransom money?

294
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:03,023
But wasn't the bag swept away?

295
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,923
Explain this to us, Mr. Mouri.

296
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:09,023
What? Well, I'm the one who wants to ask, Inspector.

297
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,423
What exactly do you...

298
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:20,123
The bag we found downstream was a dummy.

299
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:22,823
If you toss the bag into a dam that is discharge,

300
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:26,823
people would think it'd get washed away downstream.

301
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:28,523
That was your diversionary tactic.

302
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:33,123
Detective Takagi, try emptying the bag.

303
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:34,223
Yes, sir, right away.

304
00:18:37,423 --> 00:18:40,023
This bag...

305
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:42,723
why is it so heavy even when it's empty?

306
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,023
What...

307
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:55,423
This is...

308
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:56,623
An iron plate?

309
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:58,323
Don't tell me...

310
00:18:58,323 --> 00:19:02,423
Correct because of the metal weight planted inside the bag,

311
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:06,023
the bag stayed under the bridge until now.

312
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:07,323
We have been fooled

313
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:11,023
by the culprit into believing the dummy bag

314
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:14,223
at the downstream riverbank was real.

315
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,323
You must've panicked

316
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:18,723
when you heard that I've reveal the truth here tomorrow morning.

317
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:21,423
As such, you came to quickly collect the money.

318
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:25,223
No, the bag that would've otherwise been unnecessary.

319
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:27,123
Because you didn't want us to find out that the bag downstream,

320
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:29,923
unlike the bag with ransom money in it,

321
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:34,323
was a fake.

322
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,123
A fake?

323
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:37,523
That bag was?

324
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:40,023
Although they look alike,

325
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,423
the fake bag has a slightly different color arrangement

326
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:44,623
than the real one.

327
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:45,623
Isn't that right?

328
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:52,823
This kidnapping case started off strange to begin with.

329
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:54,723
The kidnapper seated the hostage

330
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:58,023
in the passenger's seat without restraint.

331
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,523
In other words, the kidnapping was actually staged

332
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:03,723
by Saki and Mr. Nijimura.

333
00:20:03,723 --> 00:20:05,023
They wanted none other than me,

334
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:10,023
Kogoro Mouri to become a witness.

335
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:11,823
As to why the kidnapper's car

336
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:13,923
wasn't caught in your timely roadblock.

337
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:16,223
It was because they hid themselves

338
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:18,323
in a parking garage near the scene.

339
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:20,123
But immediately after that,

340
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:24,423
you killed Nijimura in the garage.

341
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:31,523
The rest was simply your solo play.

342
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,623
You mailed yourself the ransom note.

343
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,623
Then, you prepared the kidnapper's instructions yourself

344
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:41,523
while you were among the crowd of passengers at the station,

345
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:46,123
and made it look as if the culprit was really there.

346
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:51,323
But Saki, why did you use a fake bag as your dummy?

347
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:53,223
If you used a genuine bat,

348
00:20:53,223 --> 00:20:57,923
perhaps your plan wouldn't have been exposed.

349
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,723
I could never have done that.

350
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:06,223
Nijimura's products are my adorable children.

351
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,923
So...

352
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:11,823
I could never damage any of them.

353
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:14,323
Not ever!

354
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:17,023
That's why you used a fake.

355
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:20,623
After all, those fake items are to blame

356
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:23,323
for the financial deficit our company's been going through.

357
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,323
Despite this, that man cut a deal with the fake company,

358
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:28,623
getting dirty money from them.

359
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:30,323
He then used all the money up gambling

360
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,523
and ran deeply in debt.

361
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:34,423
I can't believe he came up with this staged kidnapping idea

362
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,123
to pay off his debts.

363
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:40,723
That's why I pretended to agree and took him down!

364
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:43,723
This brand is what I created to begin with,

365
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:47,823
and is a result of my design, you know?

366
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:51,423
I only wanted to take it back!

367
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,423
Anytime, anywhere...

368
00:21:57,423 --> 00:21:59,523
Since it was her handmade bag,

369
00:21:59,523 --> 00:22:03,523
be it submerged in the water or the dam discharge,

370
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,423
it would definitely protect the 100 million yen.

371
00:22:06,423 --> 00:22:08,823
Betting on her confidence and pride,

372
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:11,423
she committed the crime...

373
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:15,423
and lost.

374
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:39,523
"Mouri Detective Agency."

375
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:46,123
How beautiful! A rainbow across the sky!

376
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,223
Conan! Dad!

377
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:56,623
There's a leg across my head.

378
00:23:58,123 --> 00:24:00,823
"Next Episode" -Even if's means having to sacrifice you,

379
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:04,523
it's an Organization that I have to crush.

380
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:05,823
If only Mr. Akai were here,

381
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:09,323
we wouldn't have to fear that Bourbon guy.

382
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,323
We don't fear him!

383
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:13,623
In any case, Shuichi Akai is dead!

384
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:16,923
Shuichi?

385
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,523
A gunshot?

386
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:20,823
Don't tell me...

387
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:22,723
Bank robbers.

388
00:24:22,723 --> 00:24:24,223
Next Conan,

389
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:31,123
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Clamorous."

390
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:45,477
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:45,477 --> 00:24:47,377
"Masked eyes."

392
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:50,777
Stop it! If you cover my eyes, I can't see the truth.

393
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:52,677
You always can't anyway, Pops.
