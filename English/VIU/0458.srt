1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:01,497
My heart tingles!

2
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:04,897
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,897 --> 00:00:06,297
Trouble in a mountain full of maple trees with red leaves!

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,697
That man appears when Sonoko screams!

5
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:10,097
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:11,697
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:13,997
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:58,415
Invited by Sonoko, we came to view the red maple leaves.

9
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:01,515
However, Sonoko's real purpose

10
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:04,415
was to meet Makoto Kyogoku at the shooting site of

11
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,315
the popular drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"

12
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:09,215
after she ties a red handkerchief to the branch of a maple tree.

13
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:14,315
However, the trees of the mountain are full of red handkerchiefs.

14
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,915
And there,

15
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:19,115
the AD of the drama that we had met,

16
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:21,015
Mr. Hozumi was murdered!

17
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:33,215
"Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 2)"

18
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,215
Let's see.

19
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:42,515
Oh, it's you people who found the corpse?

20
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:48,615
Maybe you people did something to bring a curse upon you?

21
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:50,215
Just what do you mean by that?

22
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:55,715
Like turn a Buddhist altar upside down or kick a tombstone.

23
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:57,215
Goodness! Of course not!

24
00:02:57,215 --> 00:03:01,015
Oh, I'm sorry. And do you people know him?

25
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:03,715
No, we met him for the first time today.

26
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:05,115
He asked us to leave a message in his place,

27
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,115
so we went to the Akagi Inn in front of the station.

28
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:09,615
Then when we came back here...

29
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:11,015
What kind of message?

30
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:15,015
He's an AD for the TV drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

31
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:16,115
"Red Maple Leaves in Winter"!

32
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:19,315
Oh, I know. Yes, I know it.

33
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:23,615
They have a re-run of it here now in Gunma on local TV.

34
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:26,115
It's a love romance story, right?

35
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:29,215
My grandma in the country recommended me to watch it.

36
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:32,015
It's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"... got that?

37
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:35,515
I started watching the re-run, but I'm really hooked on it!

38
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:39,015
Every week on Saturday, from 9 pm to 10 pm,

39
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,515
I'm glued in front of the TV.

40
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:45,015
And today is Saturday, you see! So...

41
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:49,415
See! I secretly brought a portable TV with me.

42
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:52,815
Although I'm recording it at home, I just can't wait that long!

43
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,015
Oh...

44
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,115
And what sort of message did you leave behind?

45
00:03:57,115 --> 00:04:01,115
Oh, right. A fan of the program wanted to know

46
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,615
where the tree for the drama that the red handkerchief was tied on to was

47
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,115
so he wanted us to leave a message to the fan

48
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:08,315
who was staying at the Akagi Inn

49
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,715
that he found the tree and he would be waiting here.

50
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,215
Yes.

51
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:15,015
How lazy of him,

52
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:18,215
he should've given the message himself.

53
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,615
And did you get to meet that fan?

54
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,615
No, Sonoko just wrote the message in the message book

55
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:25,015
that was left at the inn.

56
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,815
Right! "I found the tree that you were looking for."

57
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:30,315
"Please come to the place where the rock used

58
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:31,915
"in the last scene of the drama is." That's what I wrote.

59
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:35,215
She signed his name, Hozumi, for some reason in katakana.

60
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,215
Yes.

61
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:39,115
Why in katakana?

62
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:41,015
Beats me, that's how he told me to write it.

63
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,015
Right.

64
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,315
Hey!

65
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:47,815
Maybe it was because that man used katakana often?

66
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:52,515
Even on his pocket diary that we picked up on our way here,

67
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:56,015
"Hozumi" was written in katakana!

68
00:04:56,015 --> 00:05:00,015
We found it on the ground about 100 meters away from here.

69
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:03,015
It was soiled with blood, so we rushed over here.

70
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:05,415
Soiled with blood?

71
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:08,415
Then we found him lying there on the ground.

72
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,415
Oh...

73
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:13,415
Let's see, there was nothing really worth noticing in his pocket diary.

74
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:17,215
A blood stain on April 1st.

75
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:18,515
April 1st...

76
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:22,815
April 1st is April Fool's Day, April fool...

77
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:28,815
Hey...

78
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:33,015
-Yes? -Maybe that's a dying message?

79
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,815
He's got blood on his finger.

80
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:38,015
Officer Yamamura!

81
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:42,015
The estimated time of death of the victim is around 5 pm today.

82
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,015
We've found out that he was stabbed in the stomach once,

83
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:47,015
then stabbed in the chest too.

84
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,615
Anything that would identify the victim

85
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,715
seems to have been taken away by the killer.

86
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:53,415
No need to worry!

87
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:56,315
Just call the production staff of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"

88
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,915
"Hozumi" -and have them look for an AD named Hozumi

89
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:00,815
and we'll be able to find him right away!

90
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:05,315
Oh, and they seemed to have found an empty tent up ahead.

91
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:08,815
An empty tent? Now that's quite suspicious.

92
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:11,315
Please continue investigations!

93
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:12,515
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:13,715
-Hey. -What?

95
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:17,015
Didn't those officers say something else?

96
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:19,215
Or were there are lot of suspicious looking people?

97
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:21,915
No. All that was found was this tent.

98
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:25,715
More than the tent, wouldn't it be better if you went to Akagi Inn?

99
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,415
-What? -This is the place

100
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:30,015
where the last scene of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter" was filmed,

101
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,815
so the fan that was waiting for him here is suspicious!

102
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:35,515
Oh, so the last scene of the drama was filmed here.

103
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:36,915
Yes, that's right!

104
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:38,215
In the last scene,

105
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:41,415
the young officer leans against the rock and hugs the young lady...

106
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:44,015
No...

107
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:46,215
I'm still in the middle of watching the drama,

108
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:47,915
so don't tell me!

109
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:50,515
"Akagi Inn"

110
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:53,415
What? 53 people?

111
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,615
You mean there are that many people staying here?

112
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,615
Yes, thank god!

113
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:59,715
Then how about the people who checked in this morning?

114
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:00,715
What?

115
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:01,915
Huh?

116
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,015
Please check!

117
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:08,015
Remember? The man said that he got a mail from that fan

118
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:12,015
saying that he checked in at this inn this morning!

119
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,515
Yes.

120
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:15,015
And how about it?

121
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:18,515
Oh. These are the three people

122
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,715
who checked in this morning.

123
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:23,115
"Isamu Okuma, Tatsuzo Watanuki, Hans Buckly"

124
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:26,115
Then could you ask

125
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:28,915
those three people to come here?

126
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,915
"Isamu Okuma (25)" -What is it, bummers?

127
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:35,115
"Tatsuzo Watanuki (63)" -The police here this late?

128
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,715
"Hans Buckly (41)" -What do you want?

129
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,115
Well...

130
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:40,815
What were you three doing

131
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:45,315
and where were you at around 5 pm today?

132
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:46,715
I was sleeping in my room.

133
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,215
I was taking a bath.

134
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:50,515
I was taking a walk nearby.

135
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:52,315
Is there anyone who can confirm that?

136
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:53,315
No!

137
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,215
I was taking a bath in my room so...

138
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:57,315
I didn't run into anyone.

139
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:59,615
A young man with a foul mouth,

140
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:01,615
an aged man with glasses,

141
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:05,115
and a non-Japanese man who speaks broken Japanese.

142
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:07,915
Hey, Ran! Don't you think that guy with the pierced nose

143
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,815
-looks suspicious? -What?

144
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,915
Maybe he asked the victim to write his name in katakana

145
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:15,215
because he can't read kanji.

146
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,315
If so, then that aged man is also suspicious.

147
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:19,415
Maybe he wanted the name written in katakana

148
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,415
because kanji is too cluttered together and hard to see.

149
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,415
Oh, wait!

150
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,015
It could be that non-Japanese man.

151
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:30,115
It's likely that he can read hiragana and katakana but not kanji.

152
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,315
Then who of you here

153
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:35,115
know the drama called "Red Maple Leaves in Winter?"

154
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,515
What the heck is that?

155
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,715
I've never heard of it.

156
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:41,615
Don't red maple leaves wither in winter?

157
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:45,915
Oh, maybe you're playing dumb despite knowing the program.

158
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,415
But no use!

159
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:49,615
Because if you're a fan of the drama, it'll show on your face

160
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:51,415
as soon as the opening comes on!

161
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,015
So, watch!

162
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,415
Here's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter!"

163
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:56,315
So, the time has finally come

164
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,615
for the Europe Karate Championship Tournament.

165
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:02,015
-Episode eight of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter!" -What? No?

166
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:04,015
-will not be aired tonight.-A special program?

167
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:05,415
You want us to watch karate?

168
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:08,115
-But the center of attraction of this tournament is -Oh, well, no...

169
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,215
-none other than the man, Makoto Kyogoku! -Yes...

170
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,215
-What? -What?

171
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:14,115
Let's take a look at his introductory video tape.

172
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:15,315
Lend it to me!

173
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:18,115
He just made 18 years of age but holds a 400 times straight win record!

174
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:21,415
The powerful fisted Makoto Kyogoku, apart from all others.

175
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,215
Makoto!

176
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:24,815
But Sonoko,

177
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,715
didn't Kyogoku tell you about the tournament?

178
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,015
Well,

179
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,615
he said that he'd rather commit "seppuku"

180
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:34,715
than to have me watch him lose, and wouldn't tell me!

181
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:36,515
"Seppuku" (Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment)?

182
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:39,215
I mean, he'd never lose.

183
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:43,015
Officer Yamamura! I contacted the movie production company.

184
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,715
But was told that no one by the name of "Hozumi" works there.

185
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:46,815
What?

186
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:50,015
Here's the copy of the namelist that they sent us.

187
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:51,715
Copy of the namelist.

188
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:55,515
Are you sure this namelist is correct?

189
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,715
It seems that the dates are mixed up.

190
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:59,515
See, at the very end of the line.

191
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,915
True.

192
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,215
I see! The date!

193
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:07,915
But if we're to believe what the production company says,

194
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:10,015
it would mean that the victim was lying.

195
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,115
Lying?

196
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:12,115
Come to think of it,

197
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:15,115
"April Fool" -April Fool is a day when it's okay to lie.

198
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:19,015
Which means that the killer is lying!

199
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:22,915
Oh, Officer Yamamura, the one who's lying is the victim.

200
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,215
-Hey, Sonoko. -I wonder

201
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:27,015
-Goodness, she's not listening to me. -when is Makoto coming on.

202
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,515
Hey, Conan...

203
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:31,215
Conan...

204
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:37,115
If my deduction is correct,

205
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,215
the killer still hasn't found it!

206
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:48,715
Found it! It's this tree!

207
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,715
The soil is still soft.

208
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:55,915
As I thought, Mr. Hozumi was digging here

209
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:57,815
before he met the killer.

210
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:03,415
I see.

211
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:05,015
The red maple leaves in winter

212
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:07,315
was simply to mark this grave.

213
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:15,115
"Akagi Inn" -Hey, Conan?

214
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:17,915
Where are you now? I'm searching for you!

215
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:19,315
You can go on home without me!

216
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:20,415
Go home without you?

217
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:22,215
Yes. I can't make up my mind

218
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,215
on what souvenir to get for Genta and the others.

219
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:28,515
Don't worry because Dr. Agasa is coming to pick me up!

220
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:31,915
Hey! What do you mean don't worry about you?

221
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:35,415
By the way, are the three guests still there?

222
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:38,515
All three of them are still here.

223
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:41,215
But they're going to continue interrogation again some other day

224
00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:43,215
because it's already late tonight,

225
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:45,415
Officer Yamamura said so a while ago.

226
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:49,015
I see. Oh, will you put Sonoko on the line?

227
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:50,015
Huh?

228
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,515
Conan wants to talk to you.

229
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:53,715
He wants to talk to me?

230
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,315
Yes.

231
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,715
Hello?

232
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,915
Yes, I remember.

233
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:04,215
You mean the tree that I thought my handkerchief was stuck on, right?

234
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:07,415
It was located way in the foreground of the forest

235
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:09,615
where the rock that appeared in the last scene of the drama is.

236
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,915
It was about ten minutes away.

237
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:17,015
That tree may have also been used for the drama?

238
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:19,715
Yes, because the handkerchief was also there

239
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:22,615
and the branch also looked very similar too.

240
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:26,515
Don't be silly! The handkerchiefs on that tree are those of the fans!

241
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:28,915
The only tree that was used in the drama is the maple tree

242
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,415
with red leaves near the rock!

243
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,515
It would be too confusing if there are two or three

244
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:34,215
of the same kind of trees around!

245
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,415
That's true. Thank you, Sonoko.

246
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:39,315
Oh, hey.

247
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,515
Oh, he hung up on his side!

248
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:43,315
No! You mean he hung up?

249
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:53,977
Ran?

250
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:55,677
Yes, that's right.

251
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:59,077
I was just about to go pick Conan up.

252
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:01,077
I discussed things over with Conan a while ago

253
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:04,677
and agreed to ride your car with Sonoko.

254
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:05,777
What? No way!

255
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:07,477
I called our car to come pick us up already.

256
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:12,377
So, will you tell me where you're meeting Conan?

257
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:14,777
It seems that Conan's cell phone battery went dead

258
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:16,777
in the middle of our conversation.

259
00:13:16,777 --> 00:13:20,877
Strange, Shinichi is supposed to be riding with me alone.

260
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:23,477
The entrance of the mountain path

261
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:26,377
that was used in the drama called, "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

262
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:28,477
I see, thank you, Dr. Agasa!

263
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:29,577
Yeah.

264
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:48,177
You should act happier.

265
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:50,477
You're meeting each other after a long while, aren't you?

266
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,677
Mr. Tatsuzo Watanuki?

267
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:01,777
I don't know who the skeleton is,

268
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:05,477
but you're the one who buried it there.

269
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,677
And you tied a red handkerchief on the branch,

270
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:11,777
so that you could move the body at anytime if something came up.

271
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:13,077
You decided on a red handkerchief because you figured that

272
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:15,977
it would blend in with the red leaves and be inconspicuous.

273
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:17,677
After all, in the past,

274
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:20,877
people used to come here only during the autumn season.

275
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:23,677
But ever since a drama called "Red Maple Leaves of Winter" was aired

276
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:26,777
using a red handkerchief,

277
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:29,477
regardless of the time of season, fans began swarming to this mountain

278
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,877
and tying red handkerchiefs to the branches of the maple trees

279
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,677
one after the other as was done in the drama.

280
00:14:33,677 --> 00:14:34,777
Therefore, you ended up not knowing

281
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:38,077
which tree you buried the body under.

282
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,477
Afraid that someone would eventually find the body if left as is.

283
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:44,477
You found out that the person who originally found the tree

284
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:46,477
was Mr. Hozumi, a production staff of the drama,

285
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:49,977
so you paid him to find the tree!

286
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:53,077
Just as expected, Mr. Hozumi found the tree.

287
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,677
You went to the place he specified he would see you

288
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,577
in the forest used in the last scene of the drama,

289
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:01,777
you paid him after he told you where the tree was,

290
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,177
everything was to end well.

291
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:07,277
However, before he met you,

292
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:08,977
Mr. Hozumi came across the bones.

293
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:14,977
He dug the root of this tree, like you just did just now.

294
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:20,177
Mr. Hozumi then decided to blackmail you about the bones.

295
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:22,177
However, on the contrary,

296
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:24,577
he was stabbed to death by you instead.

297
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:31,077
You killed him before asking him where the tree was

298
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:34,377
because if he had already found the skeleton of the body,

299
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:36,377
all you had to do was look for a maple tree

300
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:39,377
where the soil is soft near the root of the tree.

301
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:42,577
But you couldn't find it at the place of the last scene of the drama.

302
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:43,877
It's most natural

303
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:48,277
because the tree in question was here, more than 500 meters away.

304
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,377
Well, if you presume that it would be confusing

305
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:52,477
if two red handkerchiefs are in view when shooting the drama,

306
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,777
so he chose a place some distance away,

307
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:57,977
it's easy to figure out that it's this tree.

308
00:15:57,977 --> 00:16:00,677
Besides, the staff would never remove the handkerchief

309
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:03,777
that brought so much attention just because it's in the way of filming.

310
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:08,777
Boy, you seem to be pretty bright

311
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:13,277
but what were you planning to do if I didn't show up?

312
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:15,477
Just call the police!

313
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:20,077
Because it was written in Mr. Hozumi's pocket diary that you're the killer.

314
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:23,277
It can't be. All that was found in that pocket diary

315
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:24,977
was a blood stain on the April 1st page.

316
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:27,177
Right! April 1st.

317
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:29,277
In the old days, people used to remove the cotton

318
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:31,777
from their winter kimonos to change them to summer wear.

319
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:34,077
"April 1st" -Therefore, in the past,

320
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:38,477
April 1st used to be read as "Watanuki", meaning removing cotton!

321
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:41,277
In other words, April 1st stands for you, Mr. Watanuki.

322
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:45,477
It's none other than your name!

323
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:48,977
By the way, Mr. Hozumi wanted his name written in katakana

324
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:52,277
because his last name could be read "August 1st" as well as Hozumi.

325
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,477
The origin of the name came from the fact that on August 1st,

326
00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:58,477
people used to reap the ears of rice and offer it to God.

327
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,477
He probably thought that writing "August 1st" would not be read "Hozumi",

328
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:04,577
so he went out of the way and asked his name to be written in katakana.

329
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,977
The fact that Mr. Hozumi's pocket diary with your name written in

330
00:17:06,977 --> 00:17:11,177
was found some distance away from where he was lying on the ground.

331
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:15,277
Shows that you saw him writing in the diary, went back to him,

332
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:18,077
stabbed him in the chest, striking the final blow,

333
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:19,977
stole his pocket diary and fled

334
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:22,177
but unable to make out what "April 1st" stood

335
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:24,477
for you decided to throw it away on the way.

336
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,077
Who the heck... who the heck are you?

337
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,177
Conan Edogawa!

338
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:31,677
A detective!

339
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:36,577
Then tell me, detective brat,

340
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:41,577
why I left and fled leaving his body?

341
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:44,277
You figured it was already dark so no one would come

342
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,077
and was deciding to go back after getting prepared

343
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:48,577
and get rid of his body at around midnight, right?

344
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:50,977
Yeah, that's right.

345
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,277
Along with these guys.

346
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:57,077
40, rather, 50 people?

347
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,377
Who're these guys?

348
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:03,477
They were soldiers that I summoned to search this tree

349
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:06,277
but I guess there are too many of them to get rid of just one brat.

350
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:07,777
Conan!

351
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:08,777
Ran?

352
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:10,777
Conan!

353
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:14,577
Conan!

354
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:17,777
Come on, Ran! I think he'll do well on his own, don't you think?

355
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:21,477
-That glasses kid will be okay! -What're you talking about? No way!

356
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,877
I'm sure that curiosity got the best of him again,

357
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:26,177
and he's up to doing something dangerous!

358
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:27,177
So, it's finally time

359
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:29,277
-for contestant Kyogoku's first match! -Hey, Sonoko, are you listening?

360
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:32,777
Oh, Kyogoku didn't compete yet?

361
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:37,477
No! I don't know why but Makoto's being seeded one after the other!

362
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,977
What? Who is it?

363
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:44,177
Beats me...

364
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,777
Ran! Sonoko!

365
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:47,977
Conan!

366
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:49,777
Glasses kid?

367
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:52,577
Hey...

368
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:54,477
Who on earth are these people?

369
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:55,677
Beats me.

370
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,977
-Conan. -Glasses kid, who are these people?

371
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:04,677
They're not your friends, are they?

372
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:09,877
Well... I guess we need to dig three grave holes now.

373
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:10,877
Grave?

374
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:13,977
I'm sure they are not good people.

375
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:24,977
Ran, behind you!

376
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:29,177
Ran!

377
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:31,777
There are just too many of them.

378
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:35,577
Are you all right? Ran...

379
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:38,477
Only if Makoto were here.

380
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,577
Darn!

381
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:42,177
Makoto, please help us!

382
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:44,277
Makoto!

383
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:48,777
What's going on?

384
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:53,277
Something is beyond on the other side?

385
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:56,177
Makoto Kyogoku is not at the tournament?

386
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:58,577
His whereabouts have been unknown since three days ago?

387
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,677
Then where on earth is he?

388
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,877
What?

389
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,277
Makoto?

390
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:16,877
How come...

391
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:18,977
Oh, well, you see...

392
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:20,277
In front of you!

393
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:26,477
-Well, you see... -Behind you!

394
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:31,777
Darn. You brat.

395
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,777
How dare you make light of me?

396
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:44,777
A death battle continued for about 10 minutes

397
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,377
until Officer Yamamura who we called arrived at the scene.

398
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:51,777
After everything was settled, what we found out was that

399
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:54,377
those men are members of a gang called Deisankai

400
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,877
and the old man called Watanuki is the leader of the gang.

401
00:20:56,877 --> 00:21:00,077
The skeleton that was found was also the leader of that gang.

402
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:02,277
In other words, this seems to have been a fight

403
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:03,977
for who was to succeed the position of leader of the gang.

404
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:05,877
He seem to have killed the leader secretly and buried him here.

405
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:08,577
So, even if he manages to get out of prison,

406
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:11,377
he would have to face the gang.

407
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:14,277
Well, that's if he can get out.

408
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,177
It's so much like a hero

409
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:47,277
to have felt that Sonoko was in danger and come rushing over.

410
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,977
I went to the place that Ms. Sonoko had written in her mail

411
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:52,277
and was waiting there, but...

412
00:22:52,277 --> 00:22:53,677
Then you found out where the place was

413
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:56,077
by watching the drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"?

414
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:59,877
The fact is I was recording it for my sister on the video

415
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,477
but although it's embarrassing, I got hooked on it myself.

416
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:06,577
But I wrote in my mail that I would be waiting on the "Eve of Eve".

417
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,777
I couldn't understand what you meant by that.

418
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:10,077
What?

419
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:13,377
It means the day before Christmas Eve.

420
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,977
I figured all I had to do was ask you and feel embarrassed for a second.

421
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,177
But I didn't want to lose my pride as a man doing so.

422
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:21,177
That's why I set a tent up and waited over there.

423
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:24,377
Till that day came.

424
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:26,377
Was I a bit reckless?

425
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:28,277
No, not at all.

426
00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:30,577
He's really a free soul.

427
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,677
But how wonderful to come all this way just for Sonoko

428
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,277
despite having to put a stop to your successive wins.

429
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:37,577
Yes, I'm overwhelmed and touched.

430
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:39,977
So, the best four contestants of

431
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:42,077
the European Karate Championship game has lined up!

432
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:46,077
It's really disappointing that contestant Makoto Kyogoku is not here!

433
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:48,777
I'm sorry, but please speed over to Narita Airport.

434
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,777
Don't tell me you're going back to the tournament grounds!

435
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:54,577
Yes, I want to compete with the winner and determine who's stronger.

436
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:57,077
Gosh, he still wants to fight.

437
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:00,877
"Next Episode" "Burnable garbage, non-burnable garbage"

438
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:03,277
Genta, make sure you sort the trash correctly!

439
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:14,977
Is she the person called Ms. Misa?

440
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:18,877
Is this a recent picture?

441
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:28,177
Next Conan, "The Abominable Man of Rules"

442
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:46,177
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:48,477
"Moving house"

444
00:24:48,477 --> 00:24:50,177
The next episode is about a skinny man.

445
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:51,177
The abominable skeleton.

446
00:24:51,177 --> 00:24:52,977
-You mean square. -Oh, really?
