A murder is committed in a beauty salon.

What is the testimony of the lawyer who strongly backs up the suspect?

Now, for the next topic.

The wedding ceremony for wrestler Shiro Eisaku,

who will be confronting the champion next month is approaching.

13
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:07,812
Young one, I warn you,

14
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:11,112
the best time is before you get married.

15
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:14,112
Cut it out, dad.

16
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:17,112
Come on, Dad. Hurry up and get ready.

17
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:20,812
Huh? Wasn't dinner supposed to be at 10:00?

18
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,612
It's still 6:30.

19
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:26,112
So, let's leave early and go pick mom up.

20
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,112
Pick her up? You mean at her office?

21
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:30,912
No, at the beauty shop.

22
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:33,112
Beauty shop?

23
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:36,912
Wait a minute. You mean that dinner was delayed to 10:00

24
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:39,212
just so that she could go have her hair cut?

25
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:40,412
What's the problem?

26
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:43,112
After all, she's trying to look nice for you, dad.

27
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:48,712
Cut out the crap! There's no such side to her!

28
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,112
Come on and get dressed up too, dad.

29
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:55,212
I'm home.

30
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:58,312
Conan, get dressed too after you wash your hands, okay?

you're getting your hair cut at your ex-girlfriend's beauty shop,

she'll be outraged!

40
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:36,812
Is that why you're cutting my hair in the bathroom instead of your shop,

41
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:38,912
so you can avoid the eyes of other people?

42
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:42,012
I mean, I'm just trying to be thoughtful

Yes!

47
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:54,812
I'll be right there!

You gotta be joking.

49
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:58,412

I'm sorry, there's a customer who specially reserved tonight.

51
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:06,312
Okay then, I don't mind coming back some other time.

52
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,312
I mean, I don't intend to make today the last time I'll be coming here.

53
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:12,712
No. Today will be the last time.

00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,912
The last time I cut your hair.

55

Hello, Ms. Kisaki!

56
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:21,912
I'm sorry that you always have to take me at a time like this

57
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:23,412
because this is the only time I can make it.

58
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:24,612
No problem!

59
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,712
My, you're alone today?

60
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:30,412
Yes, the other staff seem to have had other matters to attend to.

61
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,412
I'll raise the volume of the BGM to high

62
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:35,012
to keep you from feeling lonely, though.

63
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:38,412
I'm fine, no need to worry about me.

64
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:45,612
You want to dye, cut and perm your hair like always, right?

65
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:49,512
Yes. I just need you to cut the ends of my hair evenly.

66
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:51,412
Okay, I'll start by washing your hair then,

67
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:53,312
so please go over to the shampoo stand!

68
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,112
I tell you, I don't get it.

69
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:00,912
Why do I, the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri

70
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,812
have to go and pick up an old lady

71
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:06,812
who is getting her hair cut at this time of day?

72
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:09,812
No big deal. After all, you've nothing to do, anyway.

73
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:13,412
Mom was saying her appointment is at 8:00,

74
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:16,512
so maybe you'll get to see mom with her hair down.

75
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:18,912
I've seen a load of her with her hair down

76
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,812
to the point of getting sick of it when I was young!

77
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:25,412
But you sure decided quickly to go and pick her up, Pops.

78
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:29,712
Okay, hair dye all done!

79
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,412
I'm going to leave you here for 10 minutes like this

80
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:35,812
till the dye sets in, so please wait a while.

81
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,912
Are you going out somewhere?

82
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:39,612
Yes. I'm going to drop by at the convenience store

83
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:40,712
after throwing out the trash.

84
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:44,312
I see. I thought I was going to get to talk to you like always,

85
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,012
but too bad.

86
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,412
I look forward to that each time you come too!

87
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:52,712
Stories about the cases that you've handled and all,

88
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,312
plus the stories about your famous detective husband.

89
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,412
Well, I'm going to be having dinner

90
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:00,212
with that famed detective after this,

91
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,912
so I guess I'll go get some good stories from him.

92
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:07,112
Then I've got to set your hair nicer than usual tonight!

93
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:08,712
I'll hear you out on your love stories about your husband

94
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,912
while I'm cutting your hair.

95
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,212
It's not lovey-dovey stories that I want to talk about, but complaints.

96
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:17,512
If I remember correctly,

97
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:21,412
the beauty shop was somewhere right up this slope.

98
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:22,812
It's been a while since you've both met,

99
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:26,212
-so talk nicely, okay, dad! -Yeah.

100
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:29,112
I'll make sure that I give it to that old lady tonight.

101
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,312
What was that?

102
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:33,712
Not again?

103
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:40,012
What was that sound all about?

104
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:44,212
It sounded like something bump into something then, dropped.

105
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:47,412
But nothing looks to have been dropped anywhere.

106
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:50,312
It doesn't seem like anything hit a car either.

107
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:52,512
Maybe it's that.

108
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,812
Look, on top of the trash below in the trash dump.

109
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:58,712
What is it?

110
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:05,512
Hey, isn't that the body of a person?

111
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:08,212
Call an ambulance and the police right away.

112
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:13,812
What? What's that sound?

113
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:18,112
How do you like it?

114
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:22,112
Thank you, it's perfect!

115
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:24,112
Thank for waiting.

116
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,312
Doesn't it sort of sound noisy outside?

117
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,712
It seems as if something has happened.

118
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:33,612
The sirens of police cars can be heard, too.

119
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:35,412
Would you like to go take a look?

120
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,112
Yes, I guess so.

121
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:40,512
But if it's a crime, it's more my husband's job than mine.

122
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,312
I guess so.

123
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:45,712
No. What I need is

124
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:49,212
to be defended by you, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

125
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,712
Back down, back down!

126
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:57,512
From the driver's license he had on him,

127
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:01,112
the victim is Mr. Shiro Eisaku, age 28.

128
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:05,112
The cause of his death is loss of blood from being slashed in the neck.

129
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:07,612
If we take into account, Mr. Mouri's story saying

130
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,212
that he coincidentally heard something drop,

131
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:13,012
after the victim was slashed in the neck,

132
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,512
his body was thrown over that guard rail on the road above over there,

133
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:17,512
then fell in here.

134
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:21,812
But when we heard the sound from the road above,

135
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,712
there was no one in sight.

136
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,112
-Is that true? -Yes.

137
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:31,812
It could be that the body was thrown from the bed of a vehicle

138
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:35,812
with a high body like a truck.

139
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:39,712
But I don't think I heard sounds of a truck.

140
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:41,212
Right.

141
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:42,412
What we heard were three sounds,

142
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:45,512
the sound of something bumping into something,

143
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:48,012
the sound of something falling

144
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:51,412
and a rattling sound like something was being rolled along!

145
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:55,312
So, you heard a crash, thud and rattling sound?

146
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:57,012
Well, so much for the sound,

147
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,412
but if a body were to be thrown over,

148
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,812
the culprit would most likely have had to be a man.

149
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:04,612
Right. And not just an ordinary man,

150
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,012
but a strong and stout wrestler or something.

151
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,612
A wrestler?

152
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:10,412
Inspector, don't you know?

153
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:13,712
The victim is Shiro Eisaku, a wrestler

154
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:17,012
who was scheduled to challenge the champion!

155
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:20,012
He was famous for not letting his opponents attack him from behind,

156
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:22,112
and weighed 90 kilograms.

157
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:23,712
Anyone who could've slashed the throat of this man,

158
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:26,112
then throw him over ever so lightly,

159
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:28,712
has to be someone who is nimble as well as super muscular.

160
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:30,312
No.

161
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:33,612
A woman could've slashed his throat too, don't you think?

162
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:35,012
Although that depends on the condition this man was in

163
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:37,512
during the time he was killed.

164
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:39,412
You!

165
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:43,912
Eri, why are you here?

166
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,812
That's for me to say.

167
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:47,712
I mean, the cafe that we were going to eat at

168
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,212
is not in this direction, is it?

169
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:52,212
Well...

170
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:54,712
We just happened to be here!

171
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:59,012
Well, at any rate, if the victim is a wrestler,

172
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,712
let's investigate all the wrestlers

173
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,412
that may have had a grudge against him to start!

174
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,612
Yes, sir!

175
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,612
How stupid can the police get.

176
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:10,212
They can go snooping around all the wrestlers they want.

177
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:11,912
No matter how hard they check,

178
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,212
they'll probably never track the culprit down

179
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,612
to a nobody beautician like me.

180
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,012
You live in the neighborhood, don't you?

181
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:25,312
Yes, I guess.

182
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:28,612
Do you know of any barber or beauty shop near here?

183
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,112
Conan, why are you asking her something like that?

184
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:38,112
Because, when I looked at the throat of the man who died,

185
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:42,512
I saw a lot of small cut strands of hair mixed with blood!

186
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:44,912
What? Really?

187
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:52,812
You're right!

188
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,812
I just thought that

189
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:59,212
maybe he went to get his hair cut before he was killed!

190
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:00,612
I see.

191
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:03,612
Besides, the blood flowing from his neck

192
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:06,312
has a strange looking uneven spot to it.

193
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:10,312
Now that you mentioned it!

194
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:14,412
Isn't this because when he was slashed in the throat,

195
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:17,412
he had a cape or towel on?

196
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:18,912
I see!

197
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,512
If the culprit is a barber or a beautician,

198
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,612
be it that the victim is a super strong wrestler,

199
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:26,612
it would be easy to poke a sharp object

200
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:28,912
from behind him without being suspected!

201
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:35,412
What's up, Takagi?

202
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:39,612
Well, Conan happened to notice something strange just now.

203
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,512
I see. In other words,

204
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:50,512
it is most likely that the barber or beautician is a super macho guy.

205
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:51,612
Yeah.

206
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:55,612
A man who could carry this man ever so lightly.

207
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:57,912
I'll go check to see

208
00:11:57,912 --> 00:12:01,312
if there's such a person in this neighborhood then.

209
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:03,312
If so, why not ask her?

210
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:05,312
She may know somebody

211
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:09,812
because she's also a barber or beautician herself.

212
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,812
Right, Miss?

213
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,612
What the?

214
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,612
What is it?

215
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,512
This boy...

216
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:20,812
What's with him anyway?

217
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,860
She's also a barber or beautician herself.

218
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,060
Right, Miss?

219
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,467
You are?

220
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:31,767
Yes.

221
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,967
Yes!

222
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:36,567
She was cutting my hair for me till just a while ago.

223
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,567
Which means that the beauty shop

224
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,867
that you had an appointment at today was...

225
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:42,867
Yes, at Ms. Hasaka's shop.

226
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:46,567
I hear that this shop is originally her late father's shop, though.

227
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,067
Conan, it's amazing

228
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,967
that you figured out she was a beautician.

229
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,067
Her hands!

230
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,467
She has a corn on the second joint

231
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:57,267
of her ring finger of her right hand, doesn't she?

232
00:12:57,267 --> 00:13:00,567
Excuse me, please show me your right hand.

233
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:01,967
Yes.

234
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:04,767
Excuse me.

235
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,067
Yes, she does.

236
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:09,467
That's corn was made because she has to let her ring finger

237
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:12,167
through the loop of the handle of the scissors all the time!

238
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,567
I see.

239
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:14,967
And if you look even closer,

240
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:18,367
the color of her nails are kind of brownish too, right?

241
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:21,367
That's because she's always using chemicals to dye

242
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,267
and shampoo the hair of her customers.

243
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:28,067
How come you know all this stuff?

244
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:31,967
I saw it on a TV special on beauticians.

245
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:35,367
TV again. You're watching too much TV!

246
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,467
It's way better than you watching the horse races, dad.

247
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,967
The horse races are a must for men!

248
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,967
Is that so?

249
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:48,667
Well, then how many barbers and beauty shops are there

250
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,967
in this area, do you know?

251
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,967
Well, you see, Mr. Shiro Eisaku who was killed

252
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,367
is a wrestler who weighed 90 kilograms!

253
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,667
Mr. Mouri and his party here, who happened to pass by

254
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,967
heard the sound of something falling.

255
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:07,167
Moreover, a lot of cut pieces of his blonde hair

256
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:10,467
was mixed in the blood around his neck.

257
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:11,567
And considering that

258
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,367
there was an uneven spot in the blood around his neck,

259
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,667
it can be deduced that Mr. Eisaku was having his hair cut

260
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,567
when he was slashed in the neck with a sharp object,

261
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,567
then thrown out from somewhere.

262
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:24,967
Will you please help us and tell us

263
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:28,567
if you know of any barber or beautician in this area

264
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:33,667
that would be able to carry a guy like him up?

265
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:37,767
Yes. Well, there are 2 or 3 others besides this shop here,

266
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:41,067
but I don't know if there's anyone that strong in any of those shops.

267
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:44,367
You're pretty mean, aren't you?

268
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,167
Because when I asked you a while ago

269
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,867
whether you knew of any barbers or beauty shops near here,

270
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:52,367
you didn't answer me!

271
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,167
Why didn't you tell me back then

272
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,267
that you owned a beauty shop too?

273
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,767
-That's because... -You're meaner,

274
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,167
asking her that question, despite already knowing all that!

275
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,367
But...

276
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,167
No buts!

277
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,767
Now, keep an eye on him

278
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,167
so he doesn't go running here and there!

279
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,267
Yes.

280
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:16,067
I couldn't answer you right away

281
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,667
because I was a bit flustered, you see.

282
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,867
-Flustered? -Yes, sir.

283
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:24,467
I came and found out that the victim was him, so...

284
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:28,567
Do you know the victim Mr. Eisaku?

285
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,967
I know you'll find out later anyway,

286
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,767
so let me tell you from my side.

287
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,967
We used to be classmates in high school.

288
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:38,367
There was a time when I used to go with him too.

289
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:41,767
Then, Mr. Eisaku used to come to your shop too?

290
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:44,367
Yes, he used to come here often to get a hair cut

291
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,067
until he got engaged.

292
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,867
Engaged?

293
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:50,667
Come to think of it, I saw an article in the sports newspaper!

294
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,267
If so, there could be a motive here too.

295
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,667
Ms. Hasaka.

296
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:59,667
You could also have a motive for wanting to kill Mr. Eisaku!

297
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:04,467
Hold it!

298
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:06,967
What a thing to say out of the blue, just like that?

299
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:12,267
If a woman lives near the place where her ex-boyfriend is found dead,

300
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,567
it's only natural to suspect her, isn't it?

301
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,567
How can you jump to such illogical conclusions?

302
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:20,067
-Officer Takagi. -Yes?

303
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:23,167
What is the estimated time of his death?

304
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:29,667
Mr. Mouri found the body at about 20:30.

305
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:33,367
So, it was probably about 20 minutes before that.

306
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,267
If so, she couldn't have committed the crime!

307
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:41,967
Because she was doing my hair all the while from 20:00 to 21:00!

308
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,867
Are you sure she was with you, right through?

309
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:48,467
Yes, she was beside me, practically the whole time through.

310
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,967
Well, she did leave to attend to some matters in between,

311
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,067
but that was just for about 10 minutes.

312
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,067
Then, she could've used those 10 minutes to...

313
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,167
No way!

314
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:02,167
Her beauty shop is farther up above this slope, you know!

315
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,967
It's too far a place for her to slash the throat of a big man,

316
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,667
then carry him over here!

317
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,867
But...

318
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,867
But what?

319
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,867
Oh no. Mom and dad are glaring at each other again.

320
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:25,367
But, if what Eri said a while ago is true...

321
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:30,667
Would you like to come to my shop?

322
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:41,467
I guess this kind of thing off and on is not bad.

323
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,867
Turn left at that intersection over there.

324
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,267
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

325
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:53,767
When making a turn at the intersection,

326
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,867
you're supposed to turn on your blinkers early, and check both sides!

327
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,867
Keep to the traffic rules, will you?

328
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,267
Oh boy. Then, why ride with me?

329
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,967
That's my shop over there.

330
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:05,167
What?

331
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,667
Conan!

332
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,967
What a terrible driving!

333
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,667
It would've been better to walk here than take the car!

334
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,267
-Are you all right? -Yep.

335
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:24,867
I see.

336
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,367
Ms. Kisaki, you were sitting here,

337
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:30,367
having your hair cut by Ms. Hasaka?

338
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:31,367
Yes.

339
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:34,767
She always cuts my hair for me after work,

340
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:38,067
and today I had an appointment at 20:00.

341
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,967
I got to the shop at 20:00.

342
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:43,467
She started then and shampooed me for 10 minutes.

343
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,767
Dying my hair took 20 minutes.

344
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,667
Shampooing me again took 10 minutes.

345
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,867
Giving me a perm took 10 minutes,

346
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,967
she shampooed me again for 10 minutes.

347
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,867
Then cutting my hair took 15 minutes.

348
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,167
Then the last shampooing took 10 minutes.

349
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,867
Finally, blow drying and setting my hair took 10 minutes.

350
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:02,267
It took about an hour to finish everything, didn't it?

351
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,467
Yes.

352
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,167
You sure have fantastic memory.

353
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,267
She always does it for me,

354
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:12,067
and besides, I was supposed to go out to dinner with somebody afterwards.

355
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,667
So, I kept glancing at the clock.

356
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:18,167
And? When and where did you go off to attend to your matters?

357
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,467
During the waiting time for the color

358
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,967
to set into my hair after she dyed it.

359
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:25,167
If I remember correctly, I think it was

360
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,367
for 10 minutes between 20:20 to 20:30.

361
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,067
Yes.

362
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:33,267
For 10 minutes, between 20:20 to 20:30...

363
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:37,267
Then, she probably used that time to kill him!

364
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,167
By car, it doesn't take 3 minutes

365
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,167
to get from the scene of the crime to here.

366
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,667
You know...

367
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,767
I don't have a driver's license,

368
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,567
and all I did was throw out the trash and go to the convenience store.

369
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,867
-Throw out the trash? -Yes.

370
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,967
I threw the trash out at the trash dump

371
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,067
beside the convenience store where I went shopping.

372
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,067
-The convenience store? -Yes.

373
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:59,167
It's close by, so shall we go there too?

374
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,867
Please come this way.

375
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,267
-A back road. -Yes.

376
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:09,067
This way is faster than taking the main road.

377
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,867
Whose scooter is this?

378
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:14,767
It's a keepsake of my late father, and I'm riding it now!

379
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,267
I used it when I went to the convenience store a while ago too

380
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,467
because I bought a bag of rice.

381
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,567
Then, you placed the body in the back of the scooter and...

382
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:25,067
-Idiot! -What?

383
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,067
It's more than difficult trying to just put a person

384
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,367
weighing 90 kilograms in the back of a scooter,

385
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,067
and you're saying that she fixed the body on

386
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,967
and moved it some place without anybody noticing? No way!

387
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:38,567
Just how do propose she threw the body down from that position?

388
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:41,767
That's why, I was just stating a possibility.

389
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,067
And how do you get to the convenience store?

390
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:48,867
Yes. If you take that side road over there,

391
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:51,367
it takes you to the road in front of the convenience store.

392
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,967
Hey!

393
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,367
Is that way the direction where the trash dump

394
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:57,967
that the body was found is?

395
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:59,267
Yes.

396
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,967
Hey, Conan.

397
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,167
Just as I thought.

398
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,767
The trash dump where the body was found

399
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:14,767
is two stories below right up ahead.

400
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:18,967
But, unless you use a crane or something,

401
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:21,267
it would be impossible to throw a person over into the trash dump.

402
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:26,467
A popular wrestler Mr. Shiro Eisaku is killed

403
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:29,867
and his dead body is found in a trash dump.

404
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:32,767
Back then, we heard three sounds.

405
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,567
I wonder what that sounds were of?

406
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,567
Mr. Eisaku was killed

407
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:46,567
when he was getting his hair cut at a barber or a beauty salon.

408
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:50,367
If so, the most suspicious person would be Ms. Minayo Hasaka

409
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,167
who runs a beauty shop in the neighborhood.

410
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:55,667
Minayo also used to be Mr. Eisaku's ex-girlfriend.

411
00:21:55,667 --> 00:22:01,367
However, Minayo was doing Eri Kisaki's hair from 20:00 to 21:00.

412
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,067
Minayo was away from Ms. Kisaki

413
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:07,667
only for 10 minutes from 20:20.

414
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,667
If Minayo is the killer,

415
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,167
how did she take Mr. Eisaku's body which is 90 kilograms

416
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:15,667
to the trash dump in a matter of 10 minutes?

417
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:20,267
Is Minayo really the killer?

418
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:23,267
And, what exactly were causing

419
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:26,567
the three sounds that we heard back then?

420
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:55,267
"Next Episode" -The traffic sign pole.

421
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,467
It's dusted off. There are tiny, thin lines.

422
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,167
What're these lines?

423
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,367
You're hurt, after all!

424
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,067
Hurt?

425
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,867
No way!

426
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:10,767
Do that after you get a court issued arrest warrant, will you?

427
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,967
Okay, so you want evidence,

428
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,567
proving that she could also have committed the crime.

429
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:22,667
Next Conan, "Lawyer Eri Kisaki's Testimony (Part 2)"

430
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,467
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,667
"A Motor Scooter."

432
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:43,867
This case is totally Greek to me.

433
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:44,967
Are you into greeking (gibberish) or something?

434
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,567
-Why? -You always look puzzled.

435
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:47,867
Hey, you!
