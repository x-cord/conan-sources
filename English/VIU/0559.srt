1
00:00:01,047 --> 00:00:02,847
The House of Hope.

2
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:07,147
Six young people once inhabited it.

3
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,447
However, three years ago,

4
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,347
ever since one of the women out of the six,

5
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:12,647
died due to a heart attack,

6
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:16,947
people began calling the House of Hope, the House of Death.

7
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:19,147
The only man who remained living in the house alone

8
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:20,747
called Mr. Shusaku Akashi

9
00:00:20,747 --> 00:00:24,047
was the husband of Aoi, the woman who died.

10
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:26,047
Mr. Akashi had been locked up

11
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:28,347
in one of the rooms of the house by someone

12
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:30,647
and left to starve to death.

13
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:34,947
Just before Mr. Akashi died, he left a queer message behind.

14
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:38,547
One side of the wall in the room was entirely painted red.

15
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:42,247
Moreover, a chair painted white faced the red wall,

16
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:43,547
while a chair painted black

17
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:45,647
faced the white wall on the opposite side

18
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:49,047
and both were nailed to the floor.

19
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:53,247
Mr. Akashi was found dead sitting in the white chair.

20
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,447
Rival of Inspector Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police Department,

21
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:58,247
Inspector Takaaki Morofushi

22
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:01,047
better known as Inspector Koume of the local police station

23
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:04,547
and we, ended up working to solve the mystery together, but...

24
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:08,747
What on earth is the red wall trying to relay?

25
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:13,247
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

26
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,947
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

27
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:17,547
Suspects of various color.

28
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:18,947
The incident heads in an unexpected direction

29
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:20,647
with the occurrence of a second case.

30
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,147
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:23,747
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:23,747 --> 00:01:26,447
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:08,114
He offered flowers?

34
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:10,914
Oh, I forgot to mention it,

35
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:13,714
but Inspector Morofushi and Inspector Yamato

36
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:17,914
were classmates with Aoi who died in this warehouse three years ago.

37
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:20,514
-Class... -Classmates?

38
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:24,014
Inspector Morofushi was classmates with Ms. Aoi Kobashi

39
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:27,514
who passed away in the warehouse of this house three years ago?

40
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:29,714
Is it just a coincidence that the same inspector turns out

41
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:34,014
to be the one to first discover the corpse of Mr. Shusaku Akashi?

42
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:41,114
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Mercy)"

43
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:43,814
I stopped over here

44
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:46,314
because that day happened to be the memorial date of her death.

45
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:48,414
I came to offer her flowers and was about to go home

46
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:50,814
when I noticed that below that window, that was cracked,

47
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,014
a lot of paint was scattered about,

48
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:54,414
so I got suspicious.

49
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:56,714
I rang the doorbell but got no answer,

50
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,714
so I went to the front door that wasn't locked

51
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:01,114
and went inside together with him

52
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:05,114
then found the corpse that was locked up in the room.

53
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:08,514
But I heard that the fingerprints of the victim

54
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,514
were found on the scattered paints.

55
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:14,514
Yeah. On every one of them.

56
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:18,114
But on the doorknob of the room and the spray can,

57
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:21,314
the fingerprints of your subordinate were found.

58
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:25,114
It's indeed like bamboo shoots in the snow.

59
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:26,714
Very interesting.

60
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:29,014
Huh, bamboo shoots in the know?

61
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:31,214
It's not in the know, but in the snow.

62
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:33,414
He said, bamboo shoots in the snow.

63
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:37,014
Why would bamboo shoots appear here?

64
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:39,314
Bamboo shoots appear in spring, right?

65
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:42,914
That's why in China, when something impossible happens

66
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:44,714
or when you get hold of something that is really hard to get,

67
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:47,014
that phrase is used!

68
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:49,814
But, what's impossible?

69
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:51,514
Can't you tell?

70
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:54,514
The victim was locked up in this room, you know.

71
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,514
He would naturally place his hands on the doorknob

72
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,114
attempting to go outside, wouldn't he?

73
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:02,614
The fingerprints of the victim should also be found on the spray can

74
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:04,714
that he used to paint the wall red too, right?

75
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:07,014
Besides, the very person who locked him in here

76
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:09,014
doesn't look to have returned here!

77
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:10,914
True.

78
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:13,314
And, the victim's fingerprints

79
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,714
not being found where they should've been

80
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:19,114
could mean that the culprit had to wipe them off for some reason.

81
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:20,614
Or...

82
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:21,914
At any rate,

83
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:26,114
maybe it may be a good idea to meet with the four

84
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:28,614
who used to live here before.

85
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:30,914
This time, we should con then into talking.

86
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,714
Go see them yourself if you want to!

87
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,614
And, while you're at it,

88
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:41,914
keep that eyesore brat and girl in your car for a while.

89
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:44,214
In the meantime, I want to get my head together

90
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:47,314
with the Sleeping Kogoro that I called all the way out here

91
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,914
and find out what really happened in order to solve the case!

92
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:56,114
Things that I wouldn't want kids to hear about may come up too.

93
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:01,514
Well, after you meet the four, drop the kid and the girl over at my house,

94
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:03,814
when you come back to report what you found.

95
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:07,314
Although I don't think you'll get much.

96
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:26,314
And? Shall we start talking about the case...

97
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:29,814
Hey, he's sleeping!

98
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,414
That's why Kan-chan sent Conan along with him.

99
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,614
"Midorikawa."

100
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:54,914
You're the inspector I met the other day.

101
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,714
I've told you everything I know about Shusaku who passed away.

102
00:06:58,714 --> 00:06:59,914
The thing is,

103
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:03,614
your fingerprints were found on the doorknob of the room

104
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:06,414
that Shusaku was locked up in.

105
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:11,414
But, six years have already gone by since I've lived there.

106
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:15,514
Fingerprints that old can still be detected?

107
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:18,614
Which means that you haven't been back to that place

108
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:20,714
since you left six years ago?

109
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:24,314
-Right. -Don't, Conan.

110
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:26,914
What's with them? These children.

111
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:31,814
Well, I'm taking care of them for a while, you see.

112
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:35,114
I told you, didn't I? To stay in the car.

113
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:40,914
Because I've got to tell Pops what kind of people you are.

114
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:43,014
I don't mean to be rude,

115
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:45,314
but you appear on TV a lot, don't you?

116
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,314
Huh? Yes.

117
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:50,914
Maybe the name Naoki Sone sounds better?

118
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:54,014
Oh! I know that name!

119
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:56,714
You appear as the bad guy in samurai movies.

120
00:07:56,714 --> 00:08:00,014
Sone is my mother's maiden name.

121
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,514
So, I changed my pen name to it.

122
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:06,514
When I was living in that house, I was called Midori,

123
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:09,114
so I figured that if I didn't change my name,

124
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,514
I couldn't stand on my own two feet after leaving the house.

125
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:15,414
So, you were called by color by the people who lived in that house.

126
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:16,614
Yeah.

127
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:19,414
But since Shusaku and I were childhood friends,

128
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:23,014
we called each other by our names.

129
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:35,514
"Yamabuki Design."

130
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,614
Oh my. My fingerprints

131
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:40,714
were found on the doorknob of Mr. Akashi's room?

132
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:43,014
Why, of course,

133
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:46,614
because I used to live there before, after all!

134
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:49,414
If you used to call Mr. Akashi Aka,

135
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:52,114
then he must've called you Yamabuki?

136
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,214
Yes. After all, that's my name as is.

137
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:59,814
But, I think that only Ao-chan used to call me Yama-chan.

138
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:03,114
That person called Aoi, what kind of person was she?

139
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:06,814
Well, to put it flatly, she was everyone's madonna.

140
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:09,714
After all, she was the only woman among the six of us,

141
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:11,714
and beautiful too.

142
00:09:11,714 --> 00:09:14,714
That's why when we found out that she was going with Akashi,

143
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:17,014
we were all surprised.

144
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:21,114
That's why everyone left that house.

145
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,814
It goes for me too.

146
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,614
I see.

147
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,814
"Studio Momo."

148
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:37,914
Huh?

149
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:41,614
My fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Aka's room?

150
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,814
Hey, don't tell me that you're suspecting me an inhabitant

151
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:47,314
that once lived there because of something like that?

152
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:50,014
I mean, who knows when it got there in the first place!

153
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:53,214
No. I'm only confirming just in case.

154
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:56,814
Did everyone used to call you Momo, sir?

155
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:59,014
Yeah. I hated it

156
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:02,014
because there was a dork who used to call me Pink at times!

157
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:03,914
Pink...

158
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:08,914
Which means that you never went back to the house after leaving it?

159
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:12,514
Oh, I forgot to mention it.

160
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,014
I went there once about four years ago

161
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,514
to deliver a game software that I helped create.

162
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,714
A game software?

163
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:24,514
Yeah. It was just a simple chess game.

164
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:28,814
Aka and Ao-chan both liked chess so...

165
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,314
What?

166
00:10:41,314 --> 00:10:46,914
My fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Aka's room?

167
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,314
Yes.

168
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,814
That's why I'm only confirming just in case.

169
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:53,514
That can't be...

170
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:57,714
I mean I used to live there before too.

171
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:59,714
Oh! Wait!

172
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:02,914
I dropped by the house about six months ago.

173
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:07,214
At that time, I may have touched Aka's art tools too.

174
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:10,114
Oh, Aka stands for Akashi, that's the way everyone called him.

175
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:12,914
Then, were you called White, sir?

176
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:14,814
Yeah.

177
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:17,314
I was never called by my last name!

178
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:20,914
Oh, no, I've got to go to a meeting with my band members!

179
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,314
May I be excused?

180
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,514
I've got to get going!

181
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:28,214
Then, see you later.

182
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,314
Yeah. It's me.

183
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:47,514
I see.

184
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:51,114
You conned everyone into talking by telling them

185
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:55,214
that their fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Akashi's room.

186
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,414
And? Did you get anything?

187
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:58,814
Yes. Well...

188
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:01,614
There is! A person who's really suspicious!

189
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:03,114
He was really flustered

190
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,114
and even volunteered to remark that he touched the art goods

191
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:07,814
when he visited although he wasn't questioned about it!

192
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,814
Who's that guy?

193
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,714
Mr. Shiro Naoki!

194
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,914
Shiro Naoki?

195
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:15,814
Come to think of it,

196
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:18,114
when we went to ask him questions the last time,

197
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:21,314
-he acted really uncomfortable, didn't he? -Yeah.

198
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:23,314
I had my eyes on him too.

199
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:25,714
But, I had no concrete evidence either.

200
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:27,814
Well, it's already late tonight.

201
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,914
Let's hit the sack tonight and then at the break of day,

202
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:34,914
let's have Shiro Naoki come to the police station voluntarily.

203
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:48,914
What? You found out who starved Shusaku Akashi to death?

204
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:51,014
-Seriously? -Yeah.

205
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,714
After sleeping one night and thinking things out,

206
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:54,714
an idea flashed through my mind!

207
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:57,714
And? Who is it, the culprit?

208
00:12:57,714 --> 00:13:02,314
It's the one you said was weird last night, Shiro Naoki.

209
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,914
The victim Mr. Akashi was sitting in the white chair

210
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:08,414
and right in front of him is the red wall.

211
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:12,214
In other words, the red color was meant to indicate himself!

212
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:14,014
Then, what about the black chair?

213
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:16,714
Black of course refers to the culprit!

214
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,614
What can the man see sitting in the black chair?

215
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:22,614
Oh! The white wall! I see!

216
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:24,414
He wanted to tell us that the culprit

217
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:27,114
was Mr. Shiro Naoki who was called, White.

218
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:29,114
Exactly.

219
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:31,714
I hate to put your words right back into your mouth.

220
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:34,514
-But that deduction... -Let him be, Uehara.

221
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,014
It's too much trouble.

222
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,314
But...

223
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:41,114
What the... in front of the apartment...

224
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:46,114
Is something wrong?

225
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:48,614
Kan-chan, that...

226
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:49,814
Koume?

227
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,414
Inspector Morofushi.

228
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:58,714
Hey. Don't tell me...

229
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,414
Yes. I had this strange ominous feeling inside of me

230
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:03,414
and rushed over here...

231
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:05,514
And this is what I saw.

232
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:19,414
Red... red wall.

233
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:22,114
He probably saw our moves last night

234
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,314
and quickly decided to take the upper hand.

235
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:27,514
Move as swift as a wind?

236
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:30,114
Yes. Something you have a hold of

237
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:33,314
may not really be what you have a hold of.

238
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:34,814
He beat us to it.

239
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:37,014
Huh? Let's drink shochu,

240
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:38,714
let's make sure to drink potato shochu. (Japanese rhyme)

241
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:40,214
Oh, it's...

242
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,214
Something you have a hold of

243
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,514
may not really be what you have a hold of.

244
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:47,814
Just because you have something in the palm of your hand,

245
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:50,014
it doesn't necessarily mean you can grasp it for sure.

246
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,414
Huh?

247
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:54,914
In other words, we were off our guard

248
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:58,214
and had the man who carried the key to solving this case murdered

249
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:00,814
right before our eyes

250
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:03,714
and lost the clue we could've had!

251
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:10,989
The man who was killed

252
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:14,753
was Mr. Shiro Naoki, age 36, a musician.

253
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:16,753
The estimated time of death

254
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:19,753
is last night between 10:00 to 11:00.

255
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:24,953
The cause of death is suffocation due to strangulation.

256
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:28,153
Judging from the fact that the victim was made to sit in a chair

257
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:31,453
and that in front of that chair there

258
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:33,253
was a closet with a door painted red

259
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:37,253
with a spray can that was found on the floor near the feet of the victim.

260
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:39,053
It is highly likely that the culprit is the same man

261
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,853
who confined Shusaku Akashi in his room

262
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:45,153
and starved him to death.

263
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,953
A red wall. Again.

264
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:50,353
Which means that

265
00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:53,853
this red wall is again a dying message left behind by the victim.

266
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,353
No.

267
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:58,553
In order for Mr. Shiro Naoki to have painted the wall red,

268
00:15:58,553 --> 00:16:01,553
he would've had to do it before he was strangled to death.

269
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,053
And again,

270
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:05,453
it's hard to believe that he would leave this room

271
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:09,653
in such a weird condition before he met the culprit here.

272
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,453
Then, what with this red wall...

273
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:13,453
Don't tell me...

274
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:16,953
Yes. I'm sure the culprit deliberately painted the wall red.

275
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:19,353
Hey, isn't it strange?

276
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,653
Why would the culprit leave a dying message indicating who he is behind?

277
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:26,353
He's making fun of us, the police!

278
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:27,553
Yes.

279
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,853
It could be that he re-did the red wall incident

280
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:32,553
that Mr. Akashi left behind at this site

281
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:36,253
in order to challenge us.

282
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:40,153
"Come solve this mystery, and catch me if you can."

283
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:43,353
At any rate, it's clear now that

284
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:45,753
the suspect is a former resident of that house

285
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:48,553
where Shusaku Akashi used to live.

286
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:51,253
Actor Naoki Midorikawa

287
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:54,753
and fashion designer Shoji Yamabuki.

288
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:59,353
CG creator, Takuto Momose. One of them did it.

289
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,953
Why?

290
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:07,353
We've only told those three and Mr. Naoki who was killed

291
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:10,453
about the wall being painted red

292
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:14,153
and the fact that Mr. Akashi was seated in a chair.

293
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:19,853
But, we haven't said anything about.

294
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:22,753
Mr. Akashi having been seated in a white chair,

295
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:25,553
and that there was a black chair behind it,

296
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:27,453
with both chairs being nailed to the floor.

297
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:28,753
Although the culprit tried to re-do

298
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:31,353
the site where Mr. Akashi starved to death,

299
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:36,153
it seems that all he could do was make him sit in the seat.

300
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:39,753
I wonder if the culprit got scared.

301
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:42,353
Because he tried to copy the dying message,

302
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,853
despite not knowing much about it!

303
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,253
I guess so.

304
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,953
Well, I'd like to go ask the three

305
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:56,153
where and what they were doing between 10:00 to 11:00 last night.

306
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,453
I want to discuss the truth of this incident

307
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:02,153
with Sleeping Kogoro here so...

308
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:03,553
Koume, I hate to trouble you

309
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:07,753
but will you keep that kid and girl in your car again...

310
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:12,153
If you warn someone for their own good,

311
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:14,653
but they refuse to listen, say no more and let them be.

312
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:17,553
That way, you don't have to embarrass yourself.

313
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:18,553
Huh?

314
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:20,753
Kansuke, it seems that

315
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:25,253
you want me to work together with that good-looking lad.

316
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:27,653
But, I guess I'll refuse this time.

317
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:32,253
I will go and investigate on my own.

318
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:36,553
But, of course I give you my word that as soon as I solve the case,

319
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:39,753
I will report it to you first thing.

320
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,453
Bye.

321
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:46,453
Gosh.

322
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:49,553
Hey, what was that thing just now

323
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:52,853
about a warning or something?

324
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:56,453
If I remember correctly, those are the words of Confucius.

325
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:58,753
When someone does wrong,

326
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:01,553
it's okay to warn of the wrongdoing with justice at heart.

327
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:04,653
But, if it proves futile, let it be.

328
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:08,253
Being too persistent will end up in yourself having to feel bad,

329
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:09,453
and will be ineffective.

330
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,153
I think that's what it means?

331
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:13,453
But what is the wrongdoing?

332
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,853
Remember, about the time when Kan-chan was pursuing a case,

333
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:18,253
and was struck by an avalanche.

334
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:20,253
He hurt his left eye and left leg at that time

335
00:19:20,253 --> 00:19:23,353
and his whereabouts became unknown?

336
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:27,153
Back then we weren't able to contact Kan-chan for days,

337
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:30,353
but Inspector Morofushi ignored his superior's orders,

338
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:33,053
went over to a police with jurisdiction in a different prefecture

339
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,853
and pursued the culprit that Kan-chan was going after

340
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:37,253
with aggressive investigation, took custody of him,

341
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,453
then made him spit out that they were struck by an avalanche

342
00:19:39,453 --> 00:19:42,053
and found Kan-chan in the hospital!

343
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:44,253
He had to take responsibility for what happened then

344
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:47,153
and was transferred to a local police station.

345
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,553
He owes him for that time too, so...

346
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,353
I think Kan-chan's trying to team him up with the boy

347
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:54,153
so that Morofushi won't go off again on his own

348
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,653
making rash investigations.

349
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,953
I mean, because you're really smart, Conan.

350
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:04,053
But he just investigated aggressively back then

351
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:07,153
because he wanted to find you as soon as possible.

352
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:08,353
In the case of this incident, this time...

353
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:09,853
There's a chance that

354
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:12,253
he may plunge into aggressive investigation!

355
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,453
Do you know?

356
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:16,253
About the book titled "Koume of 2nd grade class A".

357
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:18,753
Oh, I've read it before.

358
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:20,853
It's a story about a renown detective classmate

359
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,653
solving queer incidents that occur, right?

360
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:27,453
The author of that book is Aoi Kobashi

361
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:31,053
who died in the warehouse of that house three years ago,

362
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:33,053
as well as being Shusaku Akashi's wife!

363
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,053
What?

364
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:41,453
And, making an appearance in that book

365
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:45,053
is a model figure of the detective, her classmate.

366
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:49,053
Takaaki Morofushi!

367
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,453
Come to think of it,

368
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:53,953
a detective from the classroom next door

369
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,653
who spoke roughly also appeared...

370
00:20:56,653 --> 00:20:57,953
Could that have been...

371
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,853
I'm pretty sure that the model was Kan-chan.

372
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:01,553
At any rate,

373
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,553
if these serial killings were committed

374
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:08,253
because of a grudge against Aoi Kobashi's death,

375
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:12,353
Koume will at all costs get right to solving the case!

376
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,953
He still really treasures that book

377
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:19,353
and even keeps it in his glove compartment.

378
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:23,453
Uehara!

379
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:26,153
Hail a cab and go after Koume's car!

380
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:29,153
I'm going with Kogoro to meet the three in question!

381
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,353
Yes, sir.

382
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:32,053
I know you already know,

383
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:35,153
but don't take your eye off Koume even for a second.

384
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:36,953
Yes, sir.

385
00:21:38,953 --> 00:21:42,653
If you don't want him to get carried away in his investigation,

386
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:45,153
you should just go with him.

387
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:47,953
I think he wants to watch him in hiding.

388
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:50,453
Last night when we went to look over the place

389
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:51,753
where Inspector Morofushi and the suspects were,

390
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:54,353
there was a strange car following us too.

391
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:58,853
That's a car from the police, right?

392
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:00,153
Yeah.

393
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,153
But why would you want to keep watch?

394
00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:06,553
We just told you that the three in question

395
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:09,753
knew about the red wall that was left behind at the scene, right?

396
00:22:09,753 --> 00:22:15,053
Of course, we police personnel know of the facts.

397
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:18,553
Moreover, if that guy liked Aoi Kobashi

398
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:20,753
and worked in the police station,

399
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:22,953
wouldn't it be natural to keep watch over him?

400
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:25,153
Then, don't tell me...

401
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:26,553
Yeah.

402
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:31,553
Takaaki Morofushi is also a suspect!

403
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:01,253
What? You lost track of Koume?

404
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:03,153
I'm sure Koume is headed for the house!

405
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:04,653
Head there on the double!

406
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:07,153
What? What's written?

407
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:11,853
Koume... dies...

408
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:13,953
It's on fire!

409
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,653
The House of Death!

410
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:17,853
What?

411
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:19,453
Koume... don't tell me that...

412
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:22,053
He beat us to it again!

413
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:23,253
Next Conan,

414
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:30,653
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Koume Dies)"

415
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:44,698
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:46,698
"Surgical gown."

417
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:47,798
According to my deduction, the culprit

418
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:49,998
is the one with the color "black" in his name!

419
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:52,098
-No such person's made an appearance. -What?
