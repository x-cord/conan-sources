1
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:05,553
Just as you told us to we closed off the toll gate

2
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:07,853
but, are you sure that there was a dead person

3
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:09,753
inside the moving car?

4
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:12,653
Yeah. And on top of it, the guy seems to have been strangled to death.

5
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:17,153
Then, isn't the person that was in the car with him the culprit?

6
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:19,853
No, but the strange thing is

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,453
only the driver was in the car.

8
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:24,053
That can't be...

9
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:27,453
How can you strangle somebody who is driving a moving car?

10
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:28,753
I wonder...

11
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:31,453
But, Heiji was saying that.

12
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:34,053
The corpse's body was still warm,

13
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:36,553
so the culprit is somewhere nearby.

14
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:38,853
Shinichi also said that so long as the toll gate that is a kilometer away

15
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,253
from the murder site is closed off,

16
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:43,853
we can unmistakably arrest the culprit.

17
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:45,853
Heiji and Shinichi said so?

18
00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:49,553
And? Where are those two?

19
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,253
They said they were going to narrow down the suspects

20
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:53,653
and disappeared into the line of cars.

21
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,453
How?

22
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:58,653
When there are close to 100 cars?

23
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,853
Let's see what they can do.

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,553
The much rumored about high school detectives...

25
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:05,553
Three cars.

26
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:09,753
There are only three suspicious cars here.

27
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:12,753
A crisis is gracefully revived.

28
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,853
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

29
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:16,653
Deduction made by two. The case and love.

30
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:19,153
What is the real question Ran wants to ask Shinichi?

31
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:20,853
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,653
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:25,053
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:05,213
"The Real Question"

35
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:06,613
Three cars.

36
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:10,213
There are only three suspicious cars here.

37
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:11,813
All the other cars are in the way,

38
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:14,113
so you can let them go on their way.

39
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:16,013
Three cars?

40
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:19,713
The condition of the corpse tells us so.

41
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:22,513
It's an obvious fact that the victim's been strangled

42
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:24,013
while the car was on the move.

43
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:28,213
If so, the culprit's car must've approached the victim's car

44
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:30,513
and done something.

45
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:32,613
That's most natural, isn't it?

46
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,613
No matter what kind of method the culprit used,

47
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,613
what's for sure is that the culprit had to prepare beforehand,

48
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:42,513
and get on this freeway at roughly the same time as the victim.

49
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,913
I see.

50
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:45,613
So there were only three cars

51
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,713
that entered the interchange at the same time the victim's car did.

52
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:51,013
But, is that true?

53
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,013
I'm sure you were shown the ticket

54
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,113
that was given to them at interchange,

55
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:56,913
but nowadays there is a system called ETC (electric toll collection)

56
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:58,613
where you don't have to get tickets

57
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,613
to go through the gate, isn't there.

58
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:06,113
The victim got on the freeway using the same interchange we did,

59
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,413
the ETC device was out of order since before noon

60
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:13,313
and only the general gate where tickets were issued was open.

61
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:14,513
I see!

62
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,813
So you narrowed the drivers down to only those

63
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:18,813
who had the ticket of this interchange.

64
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:22,813
Moreover, after looking at the ticket the victim had...

65
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:27,013
We found that he got on the freeway an hour before us.

66
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,313
One hour before you?

67
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:32,013
They were probably eating at the parking area along the way or something.

68
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:33,113
In other words,

69
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:35,413
although they got on the freeway

70
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,813
at the same time from the same interchange,

71
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,913
for some reason, there were only three cars

72
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,013
driving around the car of the victim,

73
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,713
despite him taking an hour break

74
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:47,613
in the parking area.

75
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:49,713
-Right. -By the way,

76
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,113
the car with the corpse of the victim in it

77
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:55,513
is parked a kilometer ahead with its hazard lights on,

78
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:58,313
so please call forensics and have them make a detailed investigation.

79
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:00,513
Okay, shall we go over to the cars of the suspects

80
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,213
and listen to what they have to say?

81
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,313
Yes.

82
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:09,413
Officer Sato, about the dinner, let's make it some other time.

83
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:11,613
Officer Sato?

84
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:14,613
What... What's with...

85
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:17,013
What's with those boys?

86
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:22,713
Why's Shinichi wearing your cap, Heiji?

87
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:25,213
He asked me to lend it to him.

88
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:28,013
Did you like caps, Shinichi?

89
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:29,713
Yes.

90
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:32,113
It somehow doesn't look right.

91
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:34,813
Stop bugging me and shut up.

92
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,913
I'm just changing my image, you get?

93
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:43,213
Well, the guys that are after Shinichi thinks he's dead

94
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:47,213
so I put in on him thinking it best to keep his face hidden,

95
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:51,113
but I wonder how long he can stay the way he is?

96
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:54,813
Shinichi said the drug may keep for half a day.

97
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,613
But, I wonder if it's true.

98
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,213
These are the three drivers

99
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:11,813
of the three suspicious cars we mentioned a while ago.

100
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:13,113
"Riko Mizuhashi (25)" -I was just

101
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:16,113
taking a drive on the freeway with Gunpei.

102
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:18,813
After all, the victim Gunpei was my boyfriend.

103
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:23,913
Taking a drive? You were driving your own car, weren't you?

104
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:28,013
Yes, because Gunpei and I love to drive around by car.

105
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,313
What's wrong with that?

106
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:30,813
Did you both plan beforehand

107
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:33,113
that you would stop by at the parking area?

108
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:34,613
No.

109
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,613
Gunpei said that he suddenly got sleepy,

110
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:39,013
so he wanted to sleep about an hour.

111
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,013
So, I had no choice and went to kill time at the restaurant

112
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:43,713
of the parking area and woke him up when the time came.

113
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,413
I see.

114
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:49,313
Then, what were the other two of you doing in the parking area?

115
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:51,613
"Atsuo Chuda (34)" -I got a bit hungry

116
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:54,913
so came inside the parking area to eat.

117
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,813
Then, what about you?

118
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,213
My stomach...

119
00:06:58,213 --> 00:07:02,513
"Futoshi Shimodori(48)" -suddenly got queasy while I was driving, so...

120
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:05,113
so I went to use the restroom in the parking area.

121
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:07,813
I heard that someone seems to have died in his car,

122
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:10,413
but we've got nothing to do with him!

123
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:14,113
I... I think it's somebody I don't know, too.

124
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:18,213
Liar! You both know Gunpei very well!

125
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:19,213
What?

126
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,713
You're the leader of the Black Stars,

127
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:24,413
Gunpei's rival team!

128
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,813
You're the father of Akira, one of Gunpei's team members

129
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:32,813
who died the other day of an accident!

130
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:34,113
Hold on.

131
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:37,213
Is the victim Gunpei Furuki?

132
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:40,413
"Gunpei Furuki (32)" -The former leader of that street racing gang

133
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,313
that hangs out in western Tokyo, the Red Comets?

134
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:44,313
Yes.

135
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:47,713
Although he stopped dyeing his hair and shaved off his beard.

136
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:49,913
I heard that the leader of Red Comets quit

137
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:52,113
after feeling responsible

138
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:54,813
for the accident that occurred.

139
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:57,413
So, he was just taking his car out

140
00:07:57,413 --> 00:08:00,313
for a last spin.

141
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,913
And yet. He came up right behind Gunpei's car

142
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:06,213
and insistently flashed his passing lights!

143
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:08,013
I'm sure he was venting his anger out at Gunpei

144
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:10,413
because he never once won races on mountain roads!

145
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:11,713
Shut up!

146
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:13,413
That guy had the nerve to say

147
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,113
he was resigning after his winning streak.

148
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:16,913
I just kind of gave him a push from behind.

149
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,713
But, he refused to take the hint, so I passed him.

150
00:08:21,513 --> 00:08:23,213
Well, I guess after all he was taking a drive

151
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:26,813
with the woman he spilt with, so...

152
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:29,313
He tooted his horn so many times.

153
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:32,313
That's because after he overtook Gunpei,

154
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:35,613
I was right behind Gunpei's car.

155
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:38,913
But, he suddenly slowed down and I almost collided into his car,

156
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:41,213
so I tooted my horn.

157
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:44,413
Then he came out to the passing lane

158
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,813
as if to go after the car that overtook him,

159
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:48,813
so I sounded my horn at him again.

160
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:52,413
On the day of my sons funeral,

161
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:56,713
Gunpei swore that he was going to quit street racing,

162
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:58,613
so I got upset.

163
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:00,413
It was right after that...

164
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:04,313
that the car Gunpei was driving started moving strangely.

165
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:05,913
He didn't try to overtake any car

166
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,413
despite having gone into the passing lane,

167
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,213
and started driving slowly scraping the side of his car

168
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,613
against the guardrail.

169
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:13,813
Thanks to my swift and accurate judgment

170
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:15,913
of seeing that something was wrong,

171
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:17,913
you went in front of his car

172
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:20,713
and slowed down in order to stop his car,

173
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:24,113
and found the strangled victim.

174
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:27,113
You did that because Shinichi told you to.

175
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:31,913
So, you guys were the one who first found the body?

176
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:32,913
No,

177
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:35,013
she did.

178
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:38,413
I thought that something was strange about Gunpeis car, too.

179
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,213
That's why I parked my car behind him

180
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,013
and ran up to him right away.

181
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:43,413
Gunpei!

182
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:46,813
But, if what the three are saying are true,

183
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:50,313
they wouldn't have had a chance to strangle him.

184
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:51,513
Then,

185
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,813
will you take us to where the car of the victim is now,

186
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:55,113
Mr. Detectives?

187
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:56,713
Sure, of course.

188
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:58,813
I'll go too, then.

189
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:02,513
Officer Takagi, please end the road block of the toll gate,

190
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:04,613
and wait here together with these three people.

191
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:05,913
Oh, yes, ma'am.

192
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:09,513
Kazuha, you wait here with that lady too.

193
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:12,513
We'll be right back.

194
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:17,013
He's leaving.

195
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:19,313
Shinichi's going to leave me again.

196
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:29,113
See you.

197
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,213
You're not the only one.

198
00:10:57,213 --> 00:11:01,313
I've got stuff that I want to ask you and say, too.

199
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:05,113
So wait, okay?

200
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:10,213
Shinichi.

201
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,313
According to my deduction,

202
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,313
the stuff you want to ask me

203
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:20,113
is probably the same thing I want to ask you about too.

204
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:35,813
Hey, what with all that lovey-dovey stuff!

205
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:38,213
Oh, come off it, it's nothing like that.

206
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:39,713
Let's hurry and go.

207
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:41,713
I know.

208
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:43,213
Listen, Ran.

209
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:45,013
When Shinichi comes back,

210
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:47,713
don't you ever let him go!

211
00:11:50,913 --> 00:11:53,113
You've got to be joking.

212
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,913
Was the car really moving under this condition?

213
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:58,013
Yes. Strange, isn't it?

214
00:11:58,013 --> 00:11:59,413
What bothers me

215
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:00,913
are these thin lines here

216
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:03,713
on the rim of the edge of the window.

217
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:07,013
It seems that something was pulled from outside.

218
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:10,813
Hey, hey, don't tell me that a string or something

219
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,513
was wrapped around his neck, and pulled on,

220
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:16,913
while the car was moving.

221
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,813
Something like that is impossible, not possible!

222
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:22,613
Yes, if you pull on it with the strong force of a car,

223
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:26,713
before he suffocates to death, his neck bone would break.

224
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,213
That's what's bothering us.

225
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:33,513
But, I wonder why the window was fully open?

226
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:35,313
Because he was a heavy smoker, maybe?

227
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:39,213
See. The ashtray is full of cigarette butts.

228
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:42,913
Maybe he had the window open to let the smoke out?

229
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:46,313
But since he was driving on the freeway,

230
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:47,913
I would think he'd only open the window just a little,

231
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:49,613
so the top part would be open.

232
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:51,713
How much is just a little bit?

233
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:55,613
So, like I was saying... Just enough to let the smoke out.

234
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:04,113
Holes?

235
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:08,313
There are two holes on the very bottom of the window.

236
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:11,413
I see.

237
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:13,813
So, that's the story.

238
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:15,813
I know what trick was used

239
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:18,413
and figured out the culprit too, Shinichi.

240
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:22,213
Hey, how come you're sweating like that?

241
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:28,813
What? The effect of the drug may already have worn off?

242
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:29,813
Yes.

243
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:31,913
I can't come up with the exact figures,

244
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:35,713
but judging from the last time the drug was given to Shinichi

245
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:39,413
it's about time he get another attack.

246
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:43,113
Hey, Shinichi.

247
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,513
Don't tell me that...

248
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:50,813
No kidding. An attack already.

249
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:54,013
I may be building up resistance to the drug...

250
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,913
-but it's only been 24 hours yet. -Shinichi! What's wrong?

251
00:13:57,913 --> 00:14:01,513
Well, guess Shinichi'll somehow find a way to cope with it.

252
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:02,813
He did say that he could hold up about 30 minutes

253
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:05,713
after the attack hits him.

254
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:08,313
Oh, come on, you should know better.

255
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,913
The effect of the drug shortening means that

256
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:12,713
the time it takes for his body to become that of child

257
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:15,413
after the onset of the attack is also shortened.

258
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:17,513
I'm not sure if he can hold out for 10 minutes or not.

259
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,613
Ten minutes?

260
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:22,213
If he doesn't know about this,

261
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,013
that's it for him.

262
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:34,361
Hey, Shinichi, are you okay?

263
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:36,361
It seems you had a cold but...

264
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:39,661
I think you should have a doctor check you after all.

265
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,561
I'll do that after I solve the mystery.

266
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:45,261
Please bring the three people here.

267
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,861
You've figured out who the culprit is?

268
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:51,761
Yes, ma'am. I'll go over there with the three right away.

269
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:55,961
I'll take you by car, so please come this way.

270
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,661
Come on, let's go too, Ran!

271
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:01,561
I'll wait here.

272
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:04,461
Shinichi said that he'll be right back too.

273
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:05,661
I mean,

274
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:07,961
he always disappeared on you saying so, right?

275
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:11,361
But, I don't want to get in the way of his deduction, either...

276
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:16,161
-Run! -Hey, wait!

277
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:23,861
What? He was strangled to death?

278
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,461
You mean while he was driving on the road?

279
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:27,461
Yes.

280
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:30,761
Then, wouldn't it have been impossible for us to do it?

281
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:33,561
On the contrary,

282
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:37,561
if Gunpei is lured into taking a certain action, it's possible...

283
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,261
Hey, Shinichi!

284
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:40,661
Don't talk anymore.

285
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:44,361
A certain action... Just what is that supposed to be...

286
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,661
Ridiculous...

287
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,861
Just what can you do when you're speeding through the freeway...

288
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:51,661
Yes, you can!

289
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,361
If you use these two little holes made

290
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:55,261
at the very bottom of the side mirror

291
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:58,161
of the driver's seat.

292
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:00,261
Holes?

293
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,961
The trick's simple.

294
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,561
First you put both ends of a thin and strong fishing line

295
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:08,261
through these two holes and pull them inside the car.

296
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,661
Then you pass both ends

297
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:12,761
through the space in back of the headrest.

298
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:16,861
Then you slip one end of the line in the back of Gunpei's necktie,

299
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:20,161
which after you tie this end of the line onto the other end of the line.

300
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:23,161
Then, all that's left to do, is to make him open the window.

301
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:27,961
The line will be pulled and automatically choke his neck.

302
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,161
There's an automatic button on the driver's seat side

303
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:33,561
that will keep the window lowering until it's fully opened.

304
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:38,361
But boy, just how did the culprit make him open the window then?

305
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:42,961
All I did was tailgate from behind and overtake him.

306
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:47,461
All I did was toot my horn after that.

307
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:51,461
The first time was because Gunpei's car suddenly reduced speed

308
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:55,661
and the second time was because he tried to go after Mr. Chuda's car.

309
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:57,661
I've got nothing to do with

310
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:59,361
because I did nothing.

311
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:02,961
No. You slowed down, didn't you?

312
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:07,961
When you who were driving in front of Gunpei reduced speed,

313
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,361
he slowed down too.

314
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,861
Then, thinking that something was wrong,

315
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:14,661
he went out into the passing lane

316
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:17,061
and came alongside your car.

317
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,561
Wait a sec!

318
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,661
Are you saying I shouted for Gunpei

319
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:22,961
to open his window at that time or what?

320
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:24,761
Did you hear me shouting like that or what?

321
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:25,861
No.

322
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,561
You didn't have to make a sound.

323
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:31,261
All you had to do was make a panicky face

324
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:33,161
and pretend to be shouting

325
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:35,661
after aligning yourself with Gunpei's car.

326
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:38,461
I see.

327
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:41,261
He opened the window trying to figure out what you were shouting about.

328
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,061
The only person who could've carried out this trick

329
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:47,461
is you, Gunpei's girlfriend, lady.

330
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:52,061
You set the trick up when Gunpei was taking a nap in the parking area.

331
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:53,461
You probably had the key of his car

332
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,761
because you were going to wake him up.

333
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,561
I see.

334
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,961
You probably put Gunpei to sleep

335
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:03,361
with a sleeping pill or something beforehand.

336
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:04,961
You probably opened the holes in the window

337
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,461
before going on the drive too.

338
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,761
If Gunpei had the top part of his window open all the time

339
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:13,061
to let the smoke from his cigarette outside,

340
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:15,661
the holes would be hidden and out of view.

341
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,261
What proof do you have?

342
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:19,661
Do you have any proof that proves I did it?

343
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:22,461
After the corpse was found, the only time you were able to be alone

344
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:26,361
was in your car when you were heading for the toll gate.

345
00:18:26,361 --> 00:18:30,561
So, if we check your car, we should be able to find

346
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,961
the fishing line that you cut and removed

347
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:37,061
when you ran over to his car before we did.

348
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:42,061
It could be that the chloroform you used

349
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:45,661
to make Gunpei sleep sounder

350
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:48,461
and the bottle of ammonia that you used to wake him up

351
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,961
may still be in your car and be found.

352
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:59,161
The fishing line,

353
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,861
the chloroform, as well as the ammonia

354
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:05,261
are all in my car.

355
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:13,861
Well, I expected to at least be questioned by the police

356
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,861
but I had no idea that these two cute detectives

357
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,561
would suddenly see through my trick.

358
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,461
It's just as these detectives say,

359
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:27,661
I sent Gunpei to his grave

360
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:30,261
while he was at the wheels.

361
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:33,661
Yes, in the same way...

362
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,361
Akira died at the wheels.

363
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,561
What? Akira?

364
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,861
You mean my son, Akira?

365
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:42,261
Yeah.

366
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:45,861
I switched from Gunpei to Akira,

367
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:48,561
right after Gunpei lost the battle against Akira

368
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,261
when driving through the mountain path.

369
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:53,961
Because I like the fastest driver.

370
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:55,461
I see.

371
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:59,061
That's why Gunpei set up that race battle

372
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:01,161
on that rainy day?

373
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,661
It wasn't raining!

374
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,061
It was a storm!

375
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:07,561
That was no day that a battle could be held!

376
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:10,761
But Gunpei went and provoked Akira.

377
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:14,461
Just as expected, Akira's car

378
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:17,661
slipped on the wet rainy road and fell to the bottom of cliff.

379
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:20,061
But, weren't they both responsible for what happened then?

380
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:22,661
The one who was provoked most likely

381
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:25,361
knew of the risk he was taking too, right?

382
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:26,761
And the one that provoked the victim

383
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:30,561
felt sorry for what he did and was planning to go straight, right?

384
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,361
That guy go straight?

385
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:33,961
You've got to be kidding!

386
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:36,161
He's just feigning to go straight!

387
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:38,161
I agree too.

388
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:40,261
Once you become a street racer,

389
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:41,961
you can't quit until you die.

390
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:44,661
That's why I stopped him!

391
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,861
The cold-blooded red devil of the mountain road!

392
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:53,561
No. I think he was full of regret.

393
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:56,861
How the hell do you know?

394
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:59,561
On top of the meter panel of the driver's seat side

395
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:02,561
were a lighter and cigarette, right?

396
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,861
From the fact that the cigarette filter in the ashtray being damp,

397
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:10,961
it's definite that he was smoking until the time he was strangled.

398
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:14,761
He would've noticed as soon as he leaned over to take a cigarette,

399
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:17,761
that something was attached behind his neck.

400
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:21,761
Then, why didn't he... why didn't he cut the line?

401
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,761
Probably because he had made up his mind

402
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:30,061
to atone for what he had done by taking his own life.

403
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:32,961
No way.

404
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:36,761
Don't tell me that he did what he did, knowing what would happen?

405
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:40,961
Even so, I don't feel the least bit sorry for him

406
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:44,061
or for you who killed him.

407
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:46,361
The choice he made of turning you into a criminal

408
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:49,461
is more than unforgivable.

409
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:53,761
No matter what the reason may have been,

410
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:56,461
it's a choice he should've never...

411
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,961
sought to be the answer...

412
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,661
Shinichi!

413
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:02,661
Officer Takagi, call an ambulance!

414
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:04,161
Yes, ma'am!

415
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:08,161
-No. -Not the hospital!

416
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,161
Let's go to the hospital.

417
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:11,661
Ran?

418
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:15,661
Let's go to the hospital and after you're well,

419
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:17,761
you're going to have to tell me

420
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:20,161
the answer to the deduction you made, Shinichi!

421
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,661
Ran.

422
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:51,561
"Next Episode" -By the way, what do you want for dinner tonight?

423
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:52,761
Nothing special.

424
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:55,561
Anything that's edible is okay with me.

425
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,461
I don't know what happened

426
00:23:57,461 --> 00:23:59,061
but at least when camping, I wish...

427
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:02,361
An explosion?

428
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:04,261
If it's the car we saw a while ago...

429
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,861
Why did it explode?

430
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:09,261
This may not be a simple accident,

431
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:12,361
but rather a case of homicide.

432
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:17,661
Next Conan, "Blue Fireworks of Hate (Part 1)"

433
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,461
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:32,561
"Fleece jacket"

435
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:34,961
In the next episode, it seems like somebody's in a bad mood.

436
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:36,661
-Who? -Can't you tell just by looking.

437
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:37,861
See.
