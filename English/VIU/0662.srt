1
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:07,272
Pops is helping an elderly for free?

2
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:10,872
According to Mrs. Takae Kiritani who is the landlady of an apartment,

3
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:13,972
Pops visits her every week

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,772
and seems to be helping out with any problem or trouble

5
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:18,472
the people of the neighborhood may have.

6
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:20,672
Although Ran and I found it hard to believe,

7
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,772
we waited for him to come over to Mrs. Kiritani's house.

8
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,672
But the man who appeared, Ryohei Onda

9
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:28,672
"Ryohei Onda (21)" -was nowhere close to resembling Pops.

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,872
He turns out to be the boyfriend

11
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:32,272
of Mrs. Kiritani's granddaughter who was worried about her,

12
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:36,772
so he posed as Pops' imposter to keep watch over her.

13
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:39,872
Although the case of Pops' imposter was easily solved,

14
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:42,672
the real case was just about to begin.

15
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:47,372
A scream was suddenly heard from the apartment building next door.

16
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:49,872
When we rushed over, we found the resident of the apartment room,

17
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:53,672
Mr. Gensuke Denkawa had bled to death.

18
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,172
The other residents of the apartment

19
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:58,072
were the ones who screamed when they found the corpse.

20
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:01,572
The victim died the night before that.

21
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:04,072
Judging from the circumstances, it was first thought to be suicide.

22
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:07,772
But it's not. This is a homicide!

23
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:10,972
And the killer is one of the three residents

24
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:13,372
who discovered the corpse.

25
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:36,372
If all cases were men,

26
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:38,172
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

27
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:40,172
Even a fake Kogoro can make perfect deductions.

28
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,172
The mysteries behind the Death case are solved.

29
00:01:42,172 --> 00:01:43,772
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,772
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,772
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,181
"Kogoro is a Good Person (Part 2)"

33
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:22,481
"Junji Hyodo (28), Apartment Resident" -Hey!

34
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:25,181
Can we go now, officer?

35
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,781
"Kumi Bannai (22), Apartment Resident" -We've already found out that

36
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:29,681
the channel couldn't have been changed unless Mr. Denkawa was alive.

37
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,681
"Ken Ishigame (64), Apartment Resident" -Isn't it about time

38
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:33,581
you let us go back to our rooms?

39
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,681
Oh, but we haven't solved the problem about...

40
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:36,781
That's not our problem!

41
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:40,481
We just came back from the hot spring, and we are tired!

42
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,781
So...

43
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:44,981
That's enough, all of you!

44
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,281
Interrupting someone when they're talking

45
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:50,281
is nothing but plain arguing!

46
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:52,281
"Takae Kiritani (70)" -If you have something to say,

47
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:56,381
"Apartment Landlady" -do so after you hear the other person out!

48
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,581
Step aside, will you?

49
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,981
That goes for you too, officer.

50
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:06,481
There's a detective right before your eyes,

51
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,581
so why don't you ask him for his opinion?

52
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,781
Well...

53
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:16,981
Satisfying your own pride isn't going to get you anywhere.

54
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:20,481
Oh, no. Hold it there, mother.

55
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:21,881
"Mother"?

56
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,881
Oh... No, no. I mean granny.

57
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:29,481
You see, I haven't gotten my deduction together yet.

58
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:32,781
The landlady has a loud voice, doesn't she?

59
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:36,381
Yeah, but many elderly people are like that.

60
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:38,381
But that's because when they get older,

61
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:40,781
it becomes more difficult for them to hear, right?

62
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:45,581
The landlady seems to be able to hear us normally, doesn't she?

63
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,481
That's true.

64
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:50,381
Well, I hear there are older people who want to portray

65
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:53,281
that they are young, alive and kicking by raising their voices.

66
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,281
You see?

67
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,181
Oh. It sounds like a phone call.

68
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:05,381
Hello. Hello?

69
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:08,381
That's strange. It's not connected.

70
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,181
Maybe you got an e-mail? Please show me.

71
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:12,381
Okay.

72
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,581
Oh, my. You're good at it, little boy.

73
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:20,181
My granddaughter taught me how to use it,

74
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:23,881
but I just can't seem to remember the functions of the buttons.

75
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:25,581
I think if it was some time ago,

76
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:29,081
you could've remembered it like you do the keys of the piano.

77
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,881
I guess so.

78
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,781
Piano?

79
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,181
An e-mail from her granddaughter?

80
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,781
No way.

81
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:41,081
Because of her husband's work...

82
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,181
Her granddaughter is married?

83
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:46,381
She even has a child, and she doesn't look like a university student.

84
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:50,481
So, when he said he was the boyfriend of the landlady's granddaughter,

85
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:52,081
it was totally a lie.

86
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,581
Then, who on earth is he?

87
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:58,581
The mail's from your granddaughter.

88
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,981
Oh, it's from her?

89
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,681
Granddaughter?

90
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:04,281
Let's put that aside.

91
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,981
Do you remember what time was it when the zapping happened

92
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,381
at your house last night, landlady?

93
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:12,881
Well. I think it was around sunset.

94
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:16,081
Do you mean the channels changed one after another,

95
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:17,381
paused for a while

96
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,781
and then continued changing again?

97
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:22,481
Right, that's right. That's how it was.

98
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:26,981
That's why I thought some bad vibes came in from outside.

99
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,881
More so because it stopped when I closed the curtains by the window.

100
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,781
Just as I thought.

101
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,781
I've figured out the trick.

102
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:37,381
And the one who did it is probably that person.

103
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,381
But I have no proof.

104
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,781
If my deduction is correct,

105
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:44,681
the culprit should still be holding the evidence.

106
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:51,681
Hey, we're getting nowhere like this.

107
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,081
So I think we should...

108
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,881
"Kogoro Mouri"

109
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,881
Ask Detective Mouri, who is a professional

110
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:01,681
at solving criminal cases to deduce this case.

111
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,481
I think so, too.

112
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:06,681
-I agree. -What?

113
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:11,081
Why not? Let Detective Mouri handle this case alone.

114
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,281
No...

115
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:17,481
So, how about it? Mr. Sleeping Kogoro!

116
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:21,081
If this is a homicide and the culprit is among one of us,

117
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,481
-don't you think it's strange? -Right!

118
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,981
What was that loud sound

119
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,181
that we heard from the TV back then

120
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,681
when we were just about to leave for the hot spring?

121
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:34,081
Not only the sound. The channel was being changed too,

122
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:37,681
and he turned off the TV when we told him to.

123
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:42,181
So, Denkawa should still be alive then, right?

124
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:46,581
Mr. Denkawa died last night, didn't he?

125
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,381
If so, there's no way that the culprit could be any of us

126
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:51,581
who just got back from the hot spring a while ago.

127
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:53,681
If you want to detain us any longer,

128
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:58,081
then solve the case with the famous deduction that you're so proud of.

129
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:00,481
I... I still haven't...

130
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,181
Listen here.

131
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,281
Even if Detective Mouri can't solve the case,

132
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:09,281
we have no intention of letting the three of you go just yet.

133
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,781
When you broke down the door,

134
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,381
one of you threw the key near the corpse

135
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,781
and tried to make it look like this was a locked room.

136
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:18,281
This hasn't been cleared yet, you know.

137
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,481
Don't you think that's strange, too?

138
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:23,981
The police are always so reliant on Detective Mouri,

139
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:27,181
and yet you're ignoring him this time.

140
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:31,381
Don't tell me that the police are using Kogoro Mouri's imposter

141
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:35,581
as a means to get something out of us?

142
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:40,481
What are you saying? He's the real Detective Mouri!

143
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:43,081
Would you like me to disclose to everyone that he's an imposter?

144
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:45,881
But... But I promised Ran...

145
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:48,081
Forget the promise!

146
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,781
This guy lied to us that he's acting as dad's imposter

147
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,581
because the landlady's granddaughter asked him to do so.

148
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:56,381
We don't know what he's up to!

149
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:58,081
Well...

150
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,481
Then, I will do as you please.

151
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:05,181
I, Kogoro Mouri shall reveal the truth behind this case.

152
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,181
Very interesting.

153
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:13,081
No. That wasn't me, you see.

154
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,981
Hey, you're taking it too far despite being an imposter.

155
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:21,281
I'll help you, then, Pops.

156
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,181
Wait... What...

157
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:24,781
Don't worry.

158
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,781
I called the real Pops just a while ago,

159
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:30,881
and he told me the truth behind the case.

160
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:33,281
Play along with me, okay?

161
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,381
Conan!

162
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:37,181
Yes, okay!

163
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:41,181
I'll try asking the officers to do as you say, Pops!

164
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,281
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

165
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:46,281
Conan, no. He's not...

166
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,381
Help me too, Ran!

167
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:52,381
It seems he wants us to borrow a lot of things!

168
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:54,381
Conan?

169
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:55,981
Don't worry.

170
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:59,681
Because the real Sleeping Kogoro is right here with us!

171
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,568
Hey. Just how long are they going to make us wait?

172
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:15,168
It seems that they're bringing a lot of things into the room.

173
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:19,168
It's pointless using devices that weren't originally in this room.

174
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:22,268
We've only brought the same items as the ones that were in the room.

175
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,968
We were told not to use things

176
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:26,368
that were left in the room to test the trick.

177
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:29,568
The forensic officers who took the corpse away told us so.

178
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,068
A trick?

179
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:33,668
You're still saying things like that?

180
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:36,268
What do you have to say?

181
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,668
No... Well...

182
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,368
Don't worry!

183
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:44,468
Just say it like I told you, and it'll be okay.

184
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,268
Don't flinch.

185
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:51,368
Make them believe that you're Sherlock Holmes.

186
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,268
How about it?

187
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,768
Hello! It's July 2nd, Monday.

188
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,568
This is the 9 o'clock evening news.

189
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,368
Who turned on the TV?

190
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:05,668
Beats me.

191
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:08,068
But it's not one of us for sure.

192
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,268
Maybe somebody's still in the other room?

193
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:12,768
No, there isn't anyone.

194
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:16,068
Well, you can turn on the TV if you set the timer.

195
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:17,768
Just what are you talking about?

196
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:20,068
Now, here's the third question!

197
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:21,768
He hit it! It's a big one!

198
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,368
It's zapping.

199
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:25,368
What... What's going on?

200
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,268
Somebody is actually in the room, right?

201
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:32,468
-Wait! -Today is Christmas!

202
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,868
It's no surprise that a miracle may occur.

203
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:37,368
Fry the onion until it becomes brownish.

204
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,768
Big Osaka takes the lead, thanks to Higo's goal.

205
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:42,068
This is a homicide.

206
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,268
The remote controller of the TV is on the fan.

207
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,068
I... I see!

208
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:50,068
The clothes pin held down the channel button of the remote controller

209
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:54,068
that was fixed onto the fan with its neck facing downwards!

210
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:59,368
This way, each time the neck of the fan swings

211
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,268
and turns towards the TV,

212
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:05,768
the channel changes and it will sound like it's zapping.

213
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,368
I see.

214
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:10,468
The TV switched on because the programs were preset.

215
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:11,768
If it were a news program,

216
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:14,768
others would think that it was airing in real time.

217
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,068
If the timer of the fan

218
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,568
was set to turn on two to three minutes later

219
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:20,968
and the neck starts to swing,

220
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:23,668
it would sound like zapping.

221
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:26,568
But, how was the TV turned off?

222
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:30,868
We certainly heard the TV being switched off.

223
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:33,168
I think it was turned off using the off timer of the TV.

224
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,368
Idiot! If the TV was preset to switch on,

225
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:38,568
it should've been off till then.

226
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:42,068
And if the TV isn't on, the off timer doesn't work.

227
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,268
So he says.

228
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:46,068
Right. That's...

229
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:47,868
Don't worry.

230
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:54,868
How was that done, Mr. Mouri?

231
00:12:58,268 --> 00:12:59,968
As you can see,

232
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:05,268
another fan besides the one with the swinging neck was used.

233
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:06,968
The on-off switch of a TV remote controller

234
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:08,968
was held down by a clothes pin on this other fan.

235
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:11,368
Then, the other remote controller was placed on the stand of this fan

236
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:13,268
and turned towards the TV.

237
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:17,568
A leaflet was placed in front of the stand of the fan.

238
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:20,668
All that needs to be done after that is to set it so that this fan

239
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:24,968
would switch on a few minutes after the fan with the swinging neck.

240
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:27,568
The leaflet would be blown away by the wind,

241
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:30,468
and the sensor of the remote controller would no longer be blocked.

242
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:33,468
Thus, the TV would be switched off.

243
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:35,368
It would give off the impression

244
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:37,068
that someone had been watching TV while zapping,

245
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:41,768
but turned off the TV after getting complaints.

246
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,968
That's why the leaflet was found on the mattress.

247
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:46,368
By the way, the fan was operating for a while

248
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,968
even after the TV was switched off.

249
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:50,868
And since the model of the TV was coincidentally

250
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:54,668
the same as the one of the landlady's,

251
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,868
each time the fan turned towards her house,

252
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:02,368
it caused the TV in her living room to start zapping, too.

253
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,768
So, it wasn't caused by the books on the table?

254
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:09,368
No. It was a side effect of the trick the culprit used.

255
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:12,168
But who on earth would've schemed such a trick?

256
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:16,268
When we came into this room, there was no such set up.

257
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,368
Can't you see?

258
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:24,068
The remote controller of the TV is fixed to the fan with band aids.

259
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:26,368
If I remember correctly,

260
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:29,368
you said you fell when you tripped over the corpse's foot, right?

261
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,468
So what?

262
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:34,868
Don't tell me you removed the band aid from the fan

263
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:36,868
-and stuck it on yourself? -It's because I was bit

264
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:38,568
by a mosquito at the hot spring!

265
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:41,268
I showed it to you on the train when we came back, didn't I?

266
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:44,668
But I can't tell if it's the same band aid I saw back then.

267
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:47,068
You thought the culprit used it to commit the crime,

268
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:49,468
so you fixed it on with the band aid, right?

269
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:50,668
No.

270
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:52,868
It probably only took you all about 10 seconds

271
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:56,268
to bust the door open, turn on the light

272
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:58,368
and discover Mr. Denkawa's corpse.

273
00:14:58,368 --> 00:15:01,768
I wanted to try and see

274
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,568
if you could stick another band aid on in such little time,

275
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:07,468
so I intentionally used a band aid.

276
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:09,168
Very well, Officer Takagi.

277
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:11,568
I will turn my back for 10 seconds,

278
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,668
so can you try it?

279
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,468
Yes.

280
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:18,368
10, 9, 8...

281
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:21,368
7, 6, 5...

282
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:23,368
4, 3...

283
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:26,868
2, 1, 0!

284
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,668
-Wait. -How did it go?

285
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:30,868
-Did you stick it on? -No.

286
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,568
I was able to stick it on,

287
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,868
but it's all wrinkled as I was rushing.

288
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,768
The culprit could've had more time than that.

289
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:42,168
Mr. Ishigame was having trouble turning the light on right away.

290
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:45,168
It would be the same even if more time was available.

291
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:49,068
Because it would've already been dim before the light was switched on.

292
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,968
Judging from the way Mrs. Bannai was operating her cell phone,

293
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:54,868
she is likely right-handed.

294
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:57,968
It's tough to neatly stick something on her right elbow and finger

295
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:00,768
using her left hand that she normally wouldn't use.

296
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,968
The same goes for the compress that Mr. Ishigami has

297
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,868
on his right shoulder.

298
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:10,068
The same method is used when applying a compress and a band aid,

299
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,368
but it would be impossible to peel off either one

300
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:14,968
and stick it back on nicely without being seen by anyone.

301
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:18,368
Of course, instead of sticking the band aid or the compress back on,

302
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:22,368
the culprit could also have crumpled it up and hid it in the pocket.

303
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:24,168
But under such a circumstance

304
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:27,168
where it's very likely that the police would carry out a body check,

305
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:30,668
it is difficult to think that the culprit would hide it like that.

306
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:32,468
The only option left is something

307
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:34,568
that won't arouse suspicion even if it's somewhere on the person,

308
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:37,268
as well as something that is very easy to retrieve.

309
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:38,768
Mr. Hyodo.

310
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:41,568
That hair band that you used to tie your hair a while back

311
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:45,068
is the only possible answer!

312
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:49,668
If you use it as you can see right now.

313
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:52,268
It works seemingly well!

314
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:53,968
You tied your hair up on the spur of the moment

315
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:56,668
to make it difficult to check on later, isn't that right?

316
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:58,268
Well...

317
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,968
He's really going for it.

318
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,668
He's an imposter and yet he looks so genuine.

319
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,868
No. Maybe he's even more detective-like

320
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:07,068
because he's not asleep.

321
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,968
The key to using the trick is

322
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,068
how quickly the culprit could erase traces of the trick

323
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:16,268
and retrieve the tools used to carry it out after entering the room.

324
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,768
Since you were the one who entered the room first

325
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:21,868
to turn off the alarm clock,

326
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:24,268
you could remove the remote controller from the fan

327
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:27,468
after bumping into it and knocking it over.

328
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,968
If you bend down in order to stop the alarm,

329
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,468
you could also remove the clothes pin

330
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,668
that held down the remote controller without being suspected

331
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:36,468
as well as remove the hair band

332
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:39,868
that was hooked onto the back of the fan, right?

333
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:44,868
But, did you witness me doing that or not?

334
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:46,668
I'm asking if you have proof

335
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:50,268
that I used my hair band to carry out that trick!

336
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,168
Proof?

337
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:55,468
Come to think of it, I haven't told him anything about that.

338
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:58,668
If I remember correctly, there was blood

339
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:00,368
on one of the remote controllers, right?

340
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:04,468
Yeah. It looked like the blood was scraped.

341
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:07,368
In other words, if traces of the scrape touched

342
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:11,068
the hair band you used to attach the remote controller onto the fan,

343
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:12,868
it would stain the hair band, right?

344
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:17,668
The blood that splattered when you slashed Mr. Denkawa's neck

345
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:20,068
should also show up on your hair band.

346
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,368
Hearing those words,

347
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:26,768
as if the channel had suddenly changed,

348
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:29,168
Mr. Hyodo dropped his head

349
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:31,768
and started confessing what he had done.

350
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:33,268
Everything started

351
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:35,668
when Mr. Denkawa was finally unable to tolerate

352
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:37,468
Mr. Hyodo's phone that kept on ringing,

353
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:40,968
hence busted his door, barged into his room

354
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,568
and stopped the ringing.

355
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:45,968
Back then, Mr. Denkawa happened to find

356
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:50,668
a case filled with illegal drugs inside Mr. Hyodo's room.

357
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:52,268
It seemed that Mr. Hyodo

358
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:54,368
was a carrier for an illicit smuggling organization,

359
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,768
He was blackmailed by Mr. Denkawa who threatened to go to the police

360
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:00,868
unless Mr. Hyodo gave him half of his share.

361
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:03,568
Therefore, Mr. Hyodo made up his mind to commit homicide.

362
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:06,468
He got Mr. Denkawa drunk an hour before leaving

363
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:07,968
for the hot spring with the other two,

364
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:10,468
and killed him by slashing his neck.

365
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:14,168
After setting up the trick, he left the room and locked it.

366
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:17,368
He used sound from the TV to make it seem as if Mr. Denkawa was alive,

367
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:19,368
then left for the hot spring.

368
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,568
The alarm clock was set to ring

369
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,468
as soon as they came home from the hot spring.

370
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,868
So, in order to stop the bell of the alarm clock,

371
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:28,168
he busted down the door and went into the room.

372
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,968
Amidst the commotion of discovering the corpse,

373
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,768
he put the room key on the floor

374
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:33,968
and erased traces of the trick.

375
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:36,568
He had done exactly what I thought he did.

376
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:39,168
Well, at least for the sake of the landlady,

377
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:43,168
I'm glad that the fact that this man was an imposter wasn't disclosed.

378
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:48,768
Well, there's still one person who's not okay with that.

379
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:53,068
Hey, you!

380
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,768
What with you anyway, acting as dad's imposter?

381
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:58,968
I've already told you, haven't I?

382
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:01,968
The landlady's granddaughter who is my girlfriend asked me to do so.

383
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,668
That's a lie! Her granddaughter is married!

384
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:09,768
Thanks to Conan, it seems as if you have solved the case,

385
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:11,968
but you can't deceive me!

386
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:15,168
Well, like I said...

387
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:18,368
She was your teacher, right?

388
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:22,368
That landlady was your teacher in elementary school, right?

389
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,268
How... How did you know that?

390
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:26,968
Since the landlady who likes to take care of other people

391
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:30,368
wasn't helping her husband manage the apartment he owned

392
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,568
until 10 years ago,

393
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:36,368
she must have done some other jobs, right?

394
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:40,568
That's why I thought that the way she scolds people and her loud voice

395
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:43,568
might have had something to do with her job as a teacher before.

396
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,568
I see.

397
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:48,268
Teaching is a job in which you need to speak loudly.

398
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:51,068
Moreover, if she used to be a teacher,

399
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:53,768
she would've had to be able to play the piano, too.

400
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:55,568
I think if it was some time ago,

401
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:59,068
you could've remembered it like you do the keys of the piano.

402
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:00,968
I guess so.

403
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:04,268
Indeed, it seems like she used to play it.

404
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:06,168
But the determining factor was that

405
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:11,068
you unintentionally called the landlady "mother".

406
00:21:11,068 --> 00:21:14,068
Oh, no. Hold it there, mother.

407
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:17,568
For elementary school children, a teacher is like a parent to them.

408
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:21,968
And at times, children call their teacher "mother".

409
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:24,968
You probably inadvertently called her that

410
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:27,468
because you were reminded of the old times, right?

411
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:29,668
Conan, how do you know something like that?

412
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:34,068
Shinichi told me that in the mail!

413
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:36,368
You discussed the case with Shinichi?

414
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:37,868
It's written that this guy was

415
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,668
her granddaughter's classmate in their junior high school days.

416
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,768
At the class reunion that was held three months ago,

417
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,768
he probably heard from her granddaughter that the landlady was in a fix

418
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:49,968
and decided to become Kogoro's imposter.

419
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:53,468
Yes. I just couldn't let her be.

420
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:56,268
Then, you could've just come right out

421
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,768
and say that you used to be her student, couldn't you?

422
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:02,268
She always told me not to lie,

423
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:04,468
so I found it hard to come out and say the truth at this point.

424
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:07,968
It's true that lying is not right.

425
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:10,468
But if you lied out of consideration for someone,

426
00:22:10,468 --> 00:22:13,668
I'm sure that she will forgive you.

427
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,168
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Several days later,

428
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:45,368
we received a letter of gratitude with a photo from the landlady.

429
00:23:45,368 --> 00:23:47,068
The contents of the letter went as follows.

430
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:49,868
"Your disciple that you introduced to me

431
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:51,368
is a very nice young man

432
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:54,068
and is helping me out in many ways."

433
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:57,068
I have no disciples, though.

434
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,868
He's lying again.

435
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:06,768
For sure, we'll be able to catch lots of beetles and stag beetles here!

436
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:08,968
Thanks for coming all the way here, kids.

437
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:10,168
Hey!

438
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:13,168
That's not for sale. Don't touch it!

439
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,568
We were just looking around.

440
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:16,868
Get out of here right this minute!

441
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:22,968
Sir, please get a hold of yourself!

442
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:26,868
Miyama... Stag Beetle...

443
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:30,768
Next Conan, "Pursue the Miyama Stag Beetle".

444
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:50,368
Next Conan's Hint:

445
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:52,268
"Name"

446
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:54,168
Okay, we'll go catch beetles and stag beetles.

447
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,268
-Go for it. -Okay, I'll go get the culprit then!

448
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:57,468
Do your best.
