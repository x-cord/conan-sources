1
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:05,223
We, the members of the Detective Squad head for the Teimuzu River,

2
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:08,238
in hopes of winning an award at the kite-flying contest.

3
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,954
The song that Ai's listening to?

4
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:17,474
Yep. She sometimes hums the tune looking happy.

5
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:20,806
Maybe it's an anime song or something?

6
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:25,398
It sounded like Yoko Okino's new song.

7
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:28,645
Why don't you just ask her?

8
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:33,675
Of course, I did, but she said, "It's a secret".

9
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,172
Nothing to be concerned about.

10
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,957
It's probably some dumb song that's popular now.

11
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:41,885
Well, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,356
It's some dumb song that's popular now.

13
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,221
Haibara...

14
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:51,879
Why don't you stop keeping them in suspense and tell them already.

15
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:54,173
I want to know too.

16
00:00:56,667 --> 00:01:00,135
No way. Absolutely not.

17
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:05,668
No. There's still a way.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,061
We'll just wiretap.

19
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:15,438
After this and that's the kite-flying contest begins.

20
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:19,090
They, the man on the team next to us falls into the Teimuzu River.

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,987
"Renno Ryota (39), Participant."

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,162
-An accident? -Dear?

23
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:29,565
What's up, Dear? Dear?

24
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,294
Hey, answer me! Dear?

25
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:34,699
No, this is...

26
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:37,009
not an accident.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,931
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

28
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,636
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

29
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:49,436
Even kites are connected by a string. How about human relationships?

30
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,237
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:52,957
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:55,357
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:39,852
"Teimuzu River Kite-Flying Case (Part 2)"

34
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,583
What?

35
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:47,427
You're saying that I lured Renno to where the rope was cut

36
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,971
and made him fall into the river?

37
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:51,159
You gotta be joking!

38
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:54,771
I'm the one who warned him not to go too far, you know.

39
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,060
You boys were watching too, weren't you?

40
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,999
Yeah. He was shouting just before that man fell into the river.

41
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:04,243
Hey, what're you doing?

42
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:06,659
If you move back any farther...

43
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,736
He looked to be really worried.

44
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,444
But, we're not sure whether Mr. Renno heard him or not.

45
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:21,527
Others were shouting out loud, giving instructions to their teammates too.

46
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:23,709
Because we were some distance away.

47
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,629
-Is that so? -Yes.

48
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:30,129
I thought he could hear to some extent, though.

49
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:34,504
But after that, I walked backwards and pulled away from him.

50
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,647
But even if your voice couldn't be heard,

51
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:41,652
you could've gestured and given instructions to Mr. Renno.

52
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,289
No, I didn't do such a thing.

53
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,139
If you think I'm lying,

54
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,925
go take a look at the video that the event administrator took

55
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:51,790
to prevent cheating.

56
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,719
But, why did you have to stand so far apart?

57
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,750
That's because by watching how the kites were flying,

58
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,874
I could see that the wind was stronger higher up.

59
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:07,211
I thought I could send our kite shooting up by standing far apart.

60
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:10,728
Each team had a limited amount of time to fly their kite,

61
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:13,199
so we had to get it in one try.

62
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,469
I see.

63
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:17,835
By the way, what is your relationship with Mr. Renno?

64
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:22,400
I work at the cafe that Mr. Renno manages.

65
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,122
So today

66
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:28,432
we came to win the class award by using our kite with our cafe logo on it.

67
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:31,026
The winners' kite will be displayed in the city hall

68
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,166
and that would be a great advertisement.

69
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:37,866
We can act big when we attend the community meetings too.

70
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:39,347
I see.

71
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,446
Yeah, I talked to Renno a bit

72
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,535
before he fell into the river.

73
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:49,540
What did you talk about?

74
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:55,078
Despite being married, that guy had an affair with my sister

75
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:57,662
and drove her to commit suicide.

76
00:05:57,782 --> 00:06:00,709
I told him to come and talk after this event is over.

77
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:04,146
He was probably punished by heaven and fell into the river.

78
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:09,107
Which means you had a motive to make Mr. Renno fall into the river.

79
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,439
As for motive, same with Yatsukoshi.

80
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:17,375
He's been head over heels over my younger sister since high school.

81
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:20,852
Of course when I was talking to him about his affair with my sister,

82
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:25,472
his wife was super pissed. I'm sure she has as much motive too.

83
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:31,419
Does Mr. Renno really on the phone with his wife all that time?

84
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,545
Yeah, looks like it.

85
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:40,009
That's why if I tried to lure him to fall into the river...

86
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:44,019
His wife who was on the phone with him, would've heard me, no?

87
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:48,159
Well, we're both classified in the same kite-flying class.

88
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,958
I don't think he'd listen to advice from a rival.

89
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,879
But, you were watching Mr. Renno fall into the river, right?

90
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,237
Didn't you think of stopping him?

91
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:00,989
I was pretty far from him when he fell.

92
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:05,037
Besides, I thought he approached the river to dispose of trash.

93
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,509
Dispose of trash?

94
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:12,397
He was carrying an empty PET bottle under his arm.

95
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:17,439
By the way, what's your relationship with them?

96
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:21,519
Renno and Yatsukoshi were juniors of my high school baseball club.

97
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,279
Even after I graduated,

98
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:26,804
I visited the club and helped them out.

99
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:31,104
That's how I know Yatsukoshi despite our age difference.

100
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,899
Hey, wait a sec!

101
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,969
Why do I have to be suspected?

102
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,249
I was at home and on the phone, you know?

103
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,297
Moreover, I was using the cordless at home.

104
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:45,299
But you're the only one who could've

105
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,597
lured him between the posts by phone.

106
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,112
If you lived in a skyscraper,

107
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,212
and you had a good view of this area.

108
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:56,489
What? I live in a 2 story ordinary house.

109
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,545
But, if you use a TV telephone, you'd be able to what's going on, right?

110
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,259
Like the location of the posts.

111
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,889
What makes you think he'd listen to me give him instructions

112
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,534
like go farther back or move a little more to the left

113
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:12,899
from his wife, that's calling from home?

114
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,699
True...

115
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:19,525
Then did you hear Mr. Kakura's voice over the phone?

116
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:20,700
Yes.

117
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,566
He's the older brother of the woman my husband is flirting with, isn't he?

118
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,776
I heard him loud and clear.

119
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:32,299
Well, I knew that my husband was flirting with his younger sister, though.

120
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,236
Back then, did he make any remarks to lead your husband to the posts?

121
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:38,069
No.

122
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:41,593
My husband was desperately defending himself.

123
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,593
But maybe they were talking secretly to each other.

124
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,525
Because he pulled the phone away from him once and said, "Hold on".

125
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:52,962
Maybe it was a call-waiting?

126
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:55,642
I didn't hear the hold music for call-waiting.

127
00:08:56,109 --> 00:09:00,274
I did hear the sound of my husband doing something right through, though.

128
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:04,759
Then did he get mail from somebody while on the phone?

129
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,364
Since he was on the phone with me he couldn't have read it.

130
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:14,654
I threatened to divorce him if he hung up on me.

131
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,149
Like Mr. Yatsukoshi said,

132
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:24,718
he's not making any overt movements.

133
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:28,018
Yes. He's just drinking his beverage.

134
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:30,328
Hey, what're you doing?

135
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:33,351
If you move back any farther...

136
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:40,379
Mr. Kakura who was there just after Mr. Renno fell is also on-screen.

137
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:44,959
Like he also said, they're standing pretty far from each other.

138
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,349
He couldn't have lured him between the posts.

139
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:51,549
Then the only one left is his wife who was on the phone.

140
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,177
Just as she said, I think it's not possible.

141
00:09:56,297 --> 00:10:02,319
This means there may be another perp besides those three.

142
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,915
No, everything's clear now.

143
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,739
No mistake about it.

144
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:09,859
The perp is that person among the three.

145
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:15,004
But, there's no evidence to back it up.

146
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:17,480
Having a tough time.

147
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:20,417
-You eavesdropper. -What?

148
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,998
Yeah, Ayumi spilt the beans.

149
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:25,322
Because...

150
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:28,007
Well, but it serves you right,

151
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,929
since your cell phone's lost.

152
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,069
No joke. Ayumi, you don't have it?

153
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:39,229
I think I dropped it in front of the toilet and somebody picked it up.

154
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:43,379
-Why don't you try calling it, then? -Well...

155
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:45,779
Of course, we tried calling it but...

156
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,619
At first, it was ringing, but then cut off.

157
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:53,069
After that, it seems to have been switched off.

158
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:55,999
We can't get through no matter how much we try.

159
00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:00,969
We can't track it by GPS with the switch turned off.

160
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,671
Don't you remember who was near you when you dropped it?

161
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:06,019
Well...

162
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:11,119
Someone was tripping behind me, but I didn't see their face.

163
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:17,096
So, we think they took it thinking it was theirs.

164
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,369
Doc, when was the first time you called?

165
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:25,189
After the ambulance left.

166
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:29,443
We forgot about your cell phone because of this commotion.

167
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,669
I see.

168
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,349
Then it may still be left on the device.

169
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,969
The voice of the one who used this primitive trick.

170
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,223
The voice of the devil.

171
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:49,514
That's why I've been telling you over and over again

172
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:52,903
that we can't make Renno fall into the river!

173
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:55,203
Just like you say, detective,

174
00:11:55,323 --> 00:12:00,248
maybe the rope on the posts were rigged by somebody.

175
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:04,258
My husband may have been holding a kite and walking backwards...

176
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:07,110
We couldn't have possibly skilfully lured him between the posts

177
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,508
and make him fall into the river.

178
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:15,185
But the rope seems to have been rigged quite recently, you see.

179
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:19,298
I can only imagine it was done to make Mr. Ryota Renno fall into the river.

180
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:21,886
Just how did we make him fall then?

181
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,728
Explain it, will you?

182
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:27,351
The way in which we lured Mr. Renno between the posts!

183
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:31,014
I teamed with Mr. Renno and was flying the kite...

184
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,605
but when he fell,

185
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:35,614
I was so far away from him that he couldn't hear my voice.

186
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:39,884
I didn't try to lure him using big gesture either, did I?

187
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:44,243
I was pretty far away when he fell in too.

188
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,618
He was on the phone,

189
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:50,479
if I shouted at him, his wife should've heard me, isn't it?

190
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:55,392
I was on the phone with my husband, right through, until he fell.

191
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:58,761
But I was calling from home and wasn't here at all.

192
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:01,618
I couldn't have manipulated him at all, right?

193
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,218
So why you're still suspecting me?

194
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:11,108
But I'm sure there must be some way...

195
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:13,668
-I don't think there is. -What?

196
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:18,402
Maybe they could if they use psychic powers or something but...

197
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:21,529
Psychic powers?

198
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:27,883
Then, after you undergo a body check,

199
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:29,749
you may go for today.

200
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:31,649
You gotta be kidding!

201
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,204
Why do we have to undergo something like that?

202
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:36,668
After all, it's not like somebody died.

203
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:39,693
It's voluntary, isn't it? The body check.

204
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:42,591
-Then, I refuse. -What?

205
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:44,559
Me too, then.

206
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,608
I'm not doing it either.

207
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:48,187
Wait...

208
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:50,688
Well, it'll be okay.

209
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:53,376
When Mr. Renno regains consciousness...

210
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:57,575
we'll know who the perp is right away.

211
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:03,453
-Is that for real, Conan? -Probably.

212
00:14:03,573 --> 00:14:08,362
He probably tells us how he was lured between the posts too.

213
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,770
But what if he doesn't regain consciousness?

214
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,058
Then, we're done for.

215
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:17,090
There seems to be no clue either so...

216
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:21,614
Talking of no clue, anything on your cell phone, Conan?

217
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:22,973
No, not yet.

218
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:26,618
Maybe the one who picked it up threw it away someplace?

219
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:29,178
If it's in the river, that's trouble.

220
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:32,552
No problem. It's completely water-proofed.

221
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:35,758
I think we'll find out who threw it away too.

222
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:38,583
Because that cell phone was set on record.

223
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:42,750
The voice of the one who picked it up would be on it.

224
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,647
But what if the person takes it home and breaks it?

225
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:50,158
-I'll find it before that's done. -How?

226
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,968
There's a special built-in transmitter in the phone that Doc put in for me.

227
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:59,405
We will know where it is after checking the computer at Doc's house.

228
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,112
Right, Doc?

229
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,148
What? Yeah.

230
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:07,010
I don't remember inserting such a transmitter, though.

231
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,798
But what if the recorded data is erased?

232
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:14,394
No worry about that either, because it's locked.

233
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:20,599
Well, it's a four-digit number that you guys would never figure out.

234
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:27,525
Is it "This is Conan" written in numbers as 5794?

235
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,863
-Nope. -I know.

236
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,205
You're a Thief Kid killer,

237
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:36,244
so it could be his criminal number 1412, isn't it?

238
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:39,610
-No, wrong. -It's 110.

239
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,195
Because you always say, "Call the police".

240
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,410
I said it's 4 digits.

241
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:48,441
I hope it's not 4869.

242
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:51,779
-Because you're Sherlockian. -What?

243
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:55,295
No way.

244
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,625
-So, that's the number? -I'm telling you it's not.

245
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,545
Darn.

246
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:11,314
What's going on?

247
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,334
It's not 4869?

248
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,826
"Enter Passcode."

249
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:20,231
It doesn't unlock.

250
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:24,566
That brat...

251
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,308
Don't tell me he...

252
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,116
Oh, no!

253
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,502
I'm coming out now!

254
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:41,193
I've got no choice.

255
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:45,508
I'll take it home and crack it to pieces with a hammer.

256
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:54,398
So, it was you after all.

257
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:56,668
Mr. Takeshi Yatsukoshi.

258
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:00,858
Just what're you talking about?

259
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,278
You have Conan's cell phone on you, don't you?

260
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:09,020
You mean this?

261
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,975
I picked it up thinking it was mine.

262
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,666
The model and color's the same as mine, you see.

263
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:18,975
I can't activate the passcode, and I thought I didn't bring my phone today,

264
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,635
so I thought it was strange.

265
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,666
So, is that all?

266
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:27,841
No, everything's clear now.

267
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:31,891
You're the one who made Mr. Renno fall into the river.

268
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,913
That is, you're the perp.

269
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:40,035
Just what're you talking about?

270
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:45,478
Like I just told you, it's impossible for me to lure Mr. Renno.

271
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,678
I made no large gestures and yet how would I manipulate

272
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,363
somebody so far away that can't even hear me?

273
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,512
You called him, didn't you?

274
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,546
Call?

275
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,395
Because that way you can talk to somebody who's far away, right?

276
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:06,291
So back then, Mr. Renno was on the phone with his wife

277
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:08,458
and there was no call-waiting either.

278
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:10,668
Not that phone.

279
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,808
Hello, Ayumi! Can you hear me?

280
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:20,928
Yes, yes. I can hear you.

281
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:22,865
A string phone.

282
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,738
The things needed to make a string phone were all there.

283
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:33,828
A long string to connect and a PET bottle to serve as the receiver.

284
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:37,828
Each party tie a string onto the PET bottle.

285
00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:43,035
You pretended to drink a beverage and gave Mr. Renno directions.

286
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:47,265
A little more to the left. Move left, right.

287
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:50,088
Farther back. More!

288
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,525
-Like so. -Don't be ridiculous.

289
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:59,132
How can I use a string phone when I can't even hear him?

290
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,877
You agreed on an easy sign to begin with.

291
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:06,137
Like, if I pull the kite string twice, it means to use the string phone.

292
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:09,549
Back then, Mrs. Renno mentioned.

293
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,280
But maybe the two were talking in secret.

294
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,422
He told me to hold on and pulled away from his phone once so...

295
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:22,858
You gotta be kidding! Just where do you have that kind of proof?

296
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,612
To the right, the right.

297
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,086
Can you go backwards about 10 steps?

298
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:33,978
Thanks to you for having kept my cell phone in your chest pocket,

299
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,878
everything could be heard loud and clear.

300
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:38,178
Hey, what're you doing?

301
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:40,668
If you move back any farther...

302
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:42,915
What?

303
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,898
The devil's voice.

304
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:48,795
Go to hell.

305
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,746
Hey, somebody fell into the river!

306
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:03,953
A voice pattern profile will reveal whose voice it is immediately.

307
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:08,742
Well, it seems that Mr. Renno regained consciousness a while ago,

308
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:12,112
so we can ask him directly too.

309
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:14,314
I suspect that your motive had something...

310
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:19,106
to do with Mr. Kakura's younger sister too.

311
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,781
It's incredible, don't you think?

312
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,414
Conan.

313
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:38,515
We were able to solve the case thanks to him.

314
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,448
I suspected him from the start.

315
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:45,138
-Right. -Really?

316
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:48,588
Well, the trick was a string phone.

317
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,565
I'd say t's a uniquely childish idea.

318
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:55,588
So, what's your passcode?

319
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,041
I'm not telling you.

320
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,177
I see.

321
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:25,118
So, you never found out what Ai's favorite song is, after all.

322
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:26,248
Nope.

323
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:31,988
Be quiet. Yoko's being interviewed.

324
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:35,123
We have a special video message from someone for you.

325
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:37,387
Who? Who is it?

326
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:42,185
What? My type? In terms of celebrities?

327
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:45,354
No one in particular,

328
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:48,949
but there's a song that I often listening to when I do warm-ups,

329
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:52,035
but I'd like to keep it to myself.

330
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:56,496
I'll tell you. It's Yoko Okino's new song, "Dandy Lion"!

331
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:57,986
Takahiro!

332
00:22:58,106 --> 00:23:02,074
This bearded old man actually listens to idol songs.

333
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:03,958
What a guy.

334
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:08,148
I see. Mr. Higo, you're a fan of Yoko's?

335
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:12,630
Oh, well. We went to the same high school.

336
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,250
So I thought I'd give listening to her music I try, then I got hooked.

337
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,663
It peps me up.

338
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:21,807
It makes it easier to visualize my shots.

339
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:24,387
The lyrics remind me of dandelions.

340
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:25,871
I see.

341
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:29,348
It's called the "Dandy Lion" because it sounds like dandelions.

342
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:31,789
How witty!

343
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,043
Get lost!

344
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,298
So, this is it.

345
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:45,389
"Next Episode" -Juri, I don't agree.

346
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:47,319
Split up with him.

347
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:51,119
Let me show off sometimes, okay?

348
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:53,018
Masahiko.

349
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:56,336
It won't be easy looking for them in this snow.

350
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:03,598
A lot of snow remains on the mountainside where there's not much sunshine.

351
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:06,575
Please stop, Aya!

352
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:08,754
Next Conan,

353
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,954
"Lover Vanishes in the Blizzard."

354
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:30,703
Next Conan's Hint:

355
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:32,688
"Cooler box."

356
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,013
The next episode's staged in snow country.

357
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,560
-A snowman! -Snowball fights!

358
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,518
-Mystery. -Everything (dis)solves.
