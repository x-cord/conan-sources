00:00:02,317 --> 00:00:04,517
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:06,217
Yes.

4
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:08,417
Of course I do.

5
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:10,717
Yeah. Yes.

6
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:12,617
Yes, I see.

7
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:14,417
Understood!

8
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:18,517
I will gladly accept the offer to perform!

9
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:21,017
Yeah, that's right.

10
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:24,117
Ran, what show is that?

11
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:25,217
Well, they're asking dad

12
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,317
to appear on "The Most Useful School in the World" show

13
00:00:27,317 --> 00:00:29,117
as an instructor.

14
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:30,817
That's amazing.

15
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:32,017
For real?

16
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:34,417
Isn't "The Most Useful School in the World"

17
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,217
one of the most iconic shows on Nichiuri TV?

18
00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:41,517
May I inquire how much my appearance fee would be?

19
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:48,417
Well, that sort of amount is a little bit...

20
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,217
Is he planning to refuse?

21
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,317
What?

22
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,017
Yoko Okino will appear as one of the guest panelists?

23
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:55,617
I'm in! I'll do it!

24
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,617
Please allow me to participate!

25
00:00:57,617 --> 00:01:01,817
Appearance fee? I don't need that sort of thing!

26
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,817
Dad.

27
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:09,117
Looks like they're one step ahead.

28
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:12,417
Like the fog clears.

29
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,617
Let's see through love and crime as well.

30
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:18,317
Uncle Kogoro will appear as a lecturer on that popular show?

31
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:19,917
He sees through the one and only truth.

00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:19,972
Is this too gaudy after all?

37
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:24,672
Perhaps Yoko would like the necktie I usually wear better.

38
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,072
Nothing will change no matter which one you wear.

39
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,772
Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:33,572
Stop dilly-dallying. Hurry up and come!

Yes! My apologies, master.

42

Isn't that the leading figure in the enka realm, Noburo Kimijima?

43

"Noburo Kimijima (67), Leading Figure in Enka" -You're right.

44
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:46,472
But he looks kind of frightening and strict.

45
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:48,772
Noburo Kimijima is not only strict to others,

46
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:51,772
but is also famous for his self-discipline.

47
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:56,172
That's why he's still dominating the top seat in the realm of enka.

48
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:01,572
You're pretty supportive of him. Aren't you, Pops?

54
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,172
Yeah, it's all healed up.

Is that so?

93
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:09,072
There's no way she'll be placed in the same room as you, is there?

94
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:11,372
Well, then. I shall call you guys again

when it's time for our rehearsal.

Please enjoy your boxed lunches until then.

97
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:23,672
I see. So Yoko's waiting room is on the floor below.

98
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:30,872
I shall go and greet her now.

99

Yoko's waiting room is...

101
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:42,572
Hold it, dad.

102
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:45,872
Why are you taking your lunch with you if you're going to greet her?

103
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,272
What do you think?

104
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:50,372
Of course I plan to have lunch with Yoko!

105
00:06:50,372 --> 00:06:54,272
It wouldn't taste as good if I had to eat with those fellows.

I knew you were up to something like that.

Then again, we seem to have followed suit

108
00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:01,072

122
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:37,772
so I came along with him.

123
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:39,172
Is that so?

124
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:43,772
Well, Ms. Yoko Okino hasn't arrived yet.

128

Anyway, shouldn't you go and greet Principal Sakai before that?

129
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,572
You're right.

130

00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:20,772
Speaking of this vase,

137
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:24,572
it was made in China back in the Qing Dynasty.

The Qing Dynasty?

139

That's right.

140
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:30,672
This vase was made in the time when Qianlong,

141
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:35,572
the sixth emperor of the Qing Dynasty and an art enthusiast, reigned.

So Noburo Kimijima is also a guest panelist for today's filming?

148
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,672
Pardon our intrusion.

149
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:01,072
But actually, we saw you earlier as well, Mr. Kimijima.

150
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:03,672
And we were just talking about you.

151
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:06,172
I bet they weren't pleasant things, right?

152
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:07,772
On the contrary!

153
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:11,772
Actually, the first record I bought when I was in elementary school

154
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:13,972
was that famous song of yours, Mr. Kimijima.

155
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:16,972
"A man must have guts, so bring it on!"

156

Oh, that song?

157
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:23,272
I see you have quite a pair of trained eyes.

158
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:28,172
I see. So Pops is a fan of Noburo Kimijima.

Mr. Kimijima.

160

Very well, everyone. I shall see you later.

165
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:48,172
All right.

166
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,472
That guy's going to talk all day and night, so be warned.

167
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:54,472
-Okay. -See you all later.

168
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:59,072
Now, please come with me.

169
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:06,672
"Waiting Room 5, Noburo Kimijima" -You know, that song is a wonder!

170
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,372
I can feel the true spirit of a man!

171
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:12,372
Isn't that right?

172
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:17,172
Despite the warning, these two sure click well with each other.

173
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:19,672
Please let me help.

174
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:21,272
Shinobu!

175
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,372
Do not trouble the guests.

176
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,972
Hurry up and make the tea!

177
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:28,672
"Shinobu Oki (25), Kimijima's Disciple" -I am terribly sorry, master.

178
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:31,472
Sorry about that.

179
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:36,472
By the way, regarding that vase,

180
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:40,872
how much do you think it is worth?

181
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:45,572
I'll have Mr. Honma do an appraisal on that in today's lecture.

182
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:49,672
Who was Mr. Honma again?

183
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:53,172
The appraiser who seems unapproachable.

184
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:57,072
It's true that Mr. Honma is a difficult person.

185
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:59,572
However, on the subject of appraising relic antiques,

186
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,872
his keen eyes are tried and true.

187
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:05,772
Wasn't there a hack appraiser with the name Hanamura or something

188
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:09,972
who was behind that case involving Thief Kid?

189
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:13,272
Their difference is like heaven and hell.

190
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,872
In fact, the ceramics and porcelain in this era

191
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:19,372
are especially popular among connoisseurs.

192
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:22,172
I think the estimated value for this ranges from 100 million

193
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:25,072
to 160 million yen.

194
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:27,272
100 million?

195
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:28,872
That high?

196
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:34,372
A vase like that... I mean, that vase is worth 100 million yen?

197
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:37,872
Come to think of it, at a recent auction in the United Kingdom,

198
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:40,472
another vase from the Qing Dynasty like this one was auctioned off

199
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:45,172
for an equivalent of 5.7 billion yen, according to the news.

200
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:49,372
It's a super treasure that even Thief Kid would go pale thinking about.

201
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:53,972
But then again, he should have no interest in something like a vase.

202
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:05,274
So this is where they film "The Most Useful School in the World".

203
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:08,174
"THE MOST USEFUL SCHOOL IN THE WORLD"

204
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:10,774
It's just like on TV.

205
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,774
Of course.

206
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,274
However, this place is surprisingly small.

207
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:19,874
They say things appear to be more spacious on TV.

208
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:21,674
That's right, dad.

209
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,874
They've given us the script for today.

210
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:26,674
What? I don't need something like that.

211
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:29,074
You don't need it?

212
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:32,574
So that's a puffed grain candy machine?

213
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:36,674
Let's see. The second period lecture is

214
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:39,274
"Experience the Fine Traditional Puffed Grain Candy Machine".

215
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:44,274
Rice, wheat, and corn kernels will turn into snacks instantly.

216
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:46,374
So it says.

217
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:51,374
How exactly do you make snacks using this machine?

218
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,574
You have to stay tuned for that.

219
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,274
I bet you'll be surprised.

220
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,874
So this is a puffed grain candy machine.

221
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:59,474
If I recall correctly,

222
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:01,474
its formal nomenclature is "grain expander".

223
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:05,574
When grains like raw rice is poured into the rotating pressure chamber,

224
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:09,274
the machine will rapidly decompress them and turn them into snacks.

225
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:11,874
This is the first time I've seen the actual machine.

226
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,474
Well, isn't this Mr. Honma?

227
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:18,274
Please do your best today.

228
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,474
The class in the third period is

229
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:22,474
"Ascertain Real or Fake,

230
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:26,074
History of Counterfeiting and Modern Technology of Replica".

231
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:29,574
We've gone the extra mile and prepared real and fake antiques.

232
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:33,374
Mr. Honma will give a lecture on their differences.

233
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,174
The items lined up over there

234
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:39,674
are all counterfeits prepared by Mr. Honma.

235
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:43,274
And the artifact is the one Mr. Kimijima brought.

236
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,674
It's this one.

237
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:51,474
What do you think? It's quite a work of art, right?

238
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:54,774
This is... Excuse me for a second.

239
00:13:57,874 --> 00:13:59,774
Remarkable...

240
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,374
Where did you get this?

241
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,474
Well, well, Mr. Honma.

242
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:08,474
I can see that it caught your eye.

243
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:09,974
Apologies, Mr. Honma.

244
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,974
Please appraise it when we're rolling.

245
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:22,974
Well, then. We'd like to use these three as examples of counterfeits.

246
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:24,874
Understood.

247
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,174
So that's how it was.

248
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:30,474
That's why Mr. Kimijima bothered to go as far as

249
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:33,274
to bring his beloved vase to the TV station.

250
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,474
Principal Sakai, Vice Principal Ueda,

251
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:40,374
and Class President Arita have arrived!

252
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:43,674
How do you do? My name is Sakai.

253
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,874
I look forward to working with you for today.

254
00:14:46,874 --> 00:14:49,074
"Shinya Ueda" -I'm Vice Principal Ueda.

255
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:50,874
Nice working with you.

256
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:52,774
"Teppei Arita" -I'm Class President Arita.

257
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,874
It's a pleasure to meet you!

258
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:57,674
No, it's our pleasure to meet you.

259
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:59,974
Nice to meet you guys.

260
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,574
"Daisuke Tsuchiya (45), Director" -Now, if everyone is ready to begin,

261
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:05,774
I would like to start the rehearsal right now.

262
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,874
Let's start with the first period,

263
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,474
the lecture from Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

264
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,774
Good morning!

265
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,874
Yo... Yoko!

266
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,974
It really is Yoko Okino!

267
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:23,874
What? Ms. Yoko, you didn't have to come until the rehearsal

268
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:25,574
-for the second period. -Yes.

269
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,674
But when I read the script in the waiting room,

270
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:30,574
I learned that Mr. Mouri is the instructor for the first period.

271
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:33,274
Wait. Does that mean

272
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:36,074
you took the trouble just to see me?

273
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,974
No. I'm just here to say hello.

274
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,974
Let's get to the rehearsal!

275
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:44,074
For starters, what should I begin with?

276
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:47,974
Well, to kick things off...

277
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:51,274
Shall we start with your performance corner on the art of self-defense?

278
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:52,874
Understood!

279
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,074
Dad's really giving it his all.

280
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,874
I hope he doesn't give out too soon during rehearsal.

281
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,774
Conan, you guys also came?

282
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,874
-Yeah. -We're here as audience.

283
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:04,974
I'm all sweaty since I rushed here in a hurry.

284
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:10,074
Excuse us!

285
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:13,274
Don't you think it's rude to take pictures without permission?

286
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,374
No, I'm just...

287
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,574
Hey, bastard! You took sneak shots of Ms. Yoko?

288
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:20,674
-Dad. -I'm sorry.

289
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:23,074
I'm a fan of Yoko, so I couldn't help...

290
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:26,774
If you're a fan of her, you should respect her even more!

291
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:33,374
He broke it.

292
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:34,774
As a grown man,

293
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:37,574
it's insolent of you to take peeping photos of an idol.

294
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:38,874
You should be ashamed.

295
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,674
But still, you didn't have to break it!

296
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:46,374
Screw it! I'm going home!

297
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:49,074
Wait! Please hold on.

298
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,674
Now, now.

299
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:53,174
Mr. Yamazaki, calm down.

300
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:56,374
Ms. Yoko, we'll handle this, so please wait outside.

301
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:57,674
All right.

302
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:02,974
Mr. Mouri, please continue with your rehearsal.

303
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,174
Got it.

304
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:13,774
Mr. Kimijima, please do us a favor, too.

305
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:27,074
I'll buy you a replacement phone.

306
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:28,374
Learn from this lesson

307
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:32,374
and stop taking pictures of other people without permission.

308
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:35,774
I'm truly sorry for this.

309
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:38,874
Idiot! There's no need to apologize!

310
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:44,774
Darn it.

311
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:48,474
Here are Mr. Kimijima's vase and three counterfeit items.

312
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:51,274
And we still need...

313
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:54,674
Hey, they say there's an awesome relic vase on display.

314
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,274
Let me have a look.

315
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:57,774
You can't!

316
00:17:57,774 --> 00:18:01,774
This... This is epic! Let me touch it.

317
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:02,974
-Hey, you can't just go ahead... -It'll be fine.

318
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:04,374
-and take it! -It'll be fine!

319
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,574
I'll be in trouble if you touch it with bare hands!

320
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:07,874
Just for a while, just a while!

321
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:11,774
We shall proceed to the rehearsal for the second period.

322
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:14,274
Now, Mr. Yamazaki, would you please begin?

323
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:15,474
Yes.

324
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:35,374
Geez, Mr. Kimijima is hard to deal with.

325
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:38,574
Although we managed to restore Mr. Yamazaki's mood...

326
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:41,874
It was a close shave since we almost couldn't film.

327
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:47,274
Well, I guess the guy who took photos in secret was in the wrong, too.

328
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:49,274
Then, I'll go ahead.

329
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:53,474
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

330
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:55,774
I'm not interested in that.

331
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:59,174
He's saying things like that.

332
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:01,674
But the truth is he's scared, isn't it?

333
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,474
He's scared?

334
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:06,274
Well, Ms. Okino, please take the hammer.

335
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:07,674
Okay!

336
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:10,774
Please strike on this with full force.

337
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,074
What is this?

338
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:18,074
Well, just keep watching.

339
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,374
Ran, I think it'd be best if you covered your ears.

340
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:23,774
I'm asking what this is about!

341
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,474
All right, here we go!

342
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,074
That was scary.

343
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,974
Well, that's how it goes.

344
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:44,974
Wait. You knew about it, Conan?

345
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:48,674
Yeah. I've watched it on TV before.

346
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:51,474
That was some shocking noise.

347
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,974
It definitely surprised me.

348
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:55,674
Me, too.

349
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:58,074
Well, I want to apologize

350
00:19:58,074 --> 00:20:00,074
for saying unnecessary things in the waiting room.

351
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,674
Because of me, you were scolded by Mr. Kimijima.

352
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:06,274
It's all right. Please don't mind it.

353
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:09,574
Don't make me repeat myself!

354
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:11,074
Yeah!

355
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:14,274
I said there's nothing to worry about, didn't I?

356
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:18,174
Although Master Kimijima is a strict teacher,

357
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:22,374
I still have complete respect for him.

358
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,474
Something is troubling her, don't you think?

359
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:31,674
You see, since my name, Okino is similar to her name, Oki,

360
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:34,674
I somehow feel a sort of close bond between us.

361
00:20:34,674 --> 00:20:38,374
Sometimes, we even talk to each other when we're on the same set.

362
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:42,474
Is Ms. Shinobu Oki a disciple of Mr. Kimijima?

363
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,874
Yeah, that's right.

364
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:46,874
She said that the name Shinobu Oki was given to her by him.

365
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:50,974
I see. No wonder her name sounded like an enka singer.

366
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:53,874
However, although she's working harder

367
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,874
than everyone else to make her debut,

368
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:58,074
her effort is not paying off.

369
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:00,674
She also mumbled last time about how she should give up

370
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:03,374
and go back to her hometown if she really has no talent.

371
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:05,274
Is that so?

372
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:08,974
Mr. Kamisuwa! Something's gone wrong.

373
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:10,774
What is it this time?

374
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:15,974
What? Mr. Kimijima's vase has gone missing?

375
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,374
What?

376
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:19,974
The vase from the Qing Dynasty has gone missing?

377
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:26,174
We're in deep trouble. It seems nobody saw anything.

378
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:27,874
What's wrong?

379
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,974
Did something happen?

380
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:33,274
During the rehearsal of the first period,

381
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:35,874
it was definitely still here.

382
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:38,474
Isn't that right, Mr. Arita?

383
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:39,874
Yeah...

384
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:41,574
Why would you know something like that?

385
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:43,674
Oh, no. I'm just...

386
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:46,574
How did this happen?

387
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:49,474
Somebody must have stolen my vase.

388
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,974
No, we can't determine that just yet...

389
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:55,374
Who did it? Who stole my vase?

390
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:58,474
Principal Sakai! Don't tell me that you did it?

391
00:21:58,474 --> 00:22:00,274
Why... Why would I?

392
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:02,974
When I showed my vase to you,

393
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:05,374
didn't you express a great deal of interest?

394
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:08,474
Master, please calm yourself down!

395
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:10,774
Even if we assume someone did steal it,

396
00:22:10,774 --> 00:22:12,074
there shouldn't be anyone

397
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:14,274
who could carry a container with a vase hidden in it

398
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:17,474
and leave the studio during rehearsal.

399
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:22,574
That means the culprit is still in this studio.

400
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,074
And the missing Qing Dynasty vase

401
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:27,474
should also still be somewhere in this studio.

402
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:55,774
I have a request, Mr. Mouri.

403
00:23:55,774 --> 00:23:58,674
I'm sure Mr. Mouri can find the vase without fail!

404
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:01,374
Of... Of course, I will!

405
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,274
That man is definitely hiding something from us.

406
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:07,774
Please do excuse me.

407
00:24:07,774 --> 00:24:09,674
Does he know something else?

408
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:12,274
As for today's filming, we'll call it a day here.

409
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:14,274
Hold on for a moment!

410
00:24:14,274 --> 00:24:18,174
Before we call it a day, let's wrap up the case.

411
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:23,774
