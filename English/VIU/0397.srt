1
00:00:02,789 --> 00:00:04,388
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:06,288
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:07,988
Today's case has a slightly different taste.

4
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:09,688
Solving the trick consisting of three flavours.

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:11,688
Let's taste the joy of problem solving.

6
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,288
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:14,888
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,289
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,688
What's with that sigh?

10
00:01:58,689 --> 00:01:59,988
I didn't sigh.

11
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,988
I was just wondering if Ran's doing okay at the tournament.

12
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,488
Of course she's okay.

13
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,788
I mean she practiced as much as she did,

14
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:08,588
and went to sleep early last night, too.

15
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:10,588
She's doing just fine.

16
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,989
I guess so.

17
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:15,088
Huh?

18
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,089
What's up?

19
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,388
-I've been telling you... -It's the owner of the sweets shop.

20
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,188
-So, I'm saying that's not it. -The police officer is Mr. Kinoshita.

21
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:24,888
What seems to be the matter?

22
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:26,889
Mr. Mouri, what a good timing.

23
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,889
Mr. Mouri, please hear me out.

24
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:33,589
-Mr. Mouri, we're having a problem. -Mr. Mouri, we're having a problem.

25
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,489
Hold it.

26
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,389
I have this uncomfortable premonition.

27
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,689
"Spicy, Bitter and Sweet Flavour."

28
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:50,688
So what you're saying is...

29
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,888
Etsuko, you saw a man running out of room 105

30
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,888
on the first floor of this condo.

31
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:00,888
The time this happened was about two hours ago at 9:00 in the morning.

32
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,288
And Officer Kinoshita, you came here after Etsuko reported this to you.

33
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,289
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,988
Then you found the corpse of Ms. Fumie Ozawa, the woman renting this room,

35
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,688
and concluded that she committed suicide.

36
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,488
It can't be a suicide!

37
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,988
But...

38
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,188
Listen. I saw the scene with my very eyes.

39
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:23,688
There was a suicide note and the room was not messed up.

40
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,088
But...

41
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:28,688
Besides, there are no other eye-witnesses

42
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:31,388
who saw the suspicious man you saw.

43
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:34,088
But I saw him for sure.

44
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,988
Come on! Please tell him, Mr. Mouri.

45
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,388
Tell him to investigate the incident more thoroughly!

46
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,389
What?

47
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,488
Now, now.

48
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,288
And is there a possibility that it was made to look like suicide?

49
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:50,688
I had the medical examiner come over and investigate just in case, but...

50
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,588
Judging from the degree of post-mortem rigidity,

51
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,288
the estimated time of death

52
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,788
is thought to be between 6:00 to 8:00 last night.

53
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:01,288
If the man she says she witnessed committed the crime,

54
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,188
he would've had to stay with the dead body for more than 13 hours,

55
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:07,788
after killing the victim and setting up the suicide.

56
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,188
It is unthinkable under normal terms.

57
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,388
I'm getting nowhere talking to you!

58
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,588
Let's have Mr. Mouri decide.

59
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,888
Mr. Mouri! Please tell us what you think.

60
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,588
Well, I'm sure in a fix.

61
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,689
You don't look to be in a fix to me.

62
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:36,988
Officer Kinoshita!

63
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:40,588
This is the man I saw! There's no mistake about it.

64
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:42,388
Oh, don't touch it!

65
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,489
But...

66
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,188
The victim is the person who lives here, Ms. Fumie Ozawa, age 24.

67
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,988
She works for financial institution.

68
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,688
When I found the body,

69
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,088
she had a wire that was suspended from the shower nozzle around her neck,

70
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:04,088
with her body leaning against the wall and sitting down.

71
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,688
What a strange place to choose to commit suicide though.

72
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,689
Mr. Mouri, please look over here.

73
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,589
There is a will written using the computer.

74
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:18,188
"Chairman Shimizu of the loan department,

75
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,788
I am sorry for the trouble I have caused.

76
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,488
I will take my life so please accept my apologies."

77
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,988
The contents of the suicide note

78
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:27,388
is that she had embezzled more than 30,000,000 yen of company money,

79
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,288
so that she would like to apologize by taking her own life.

80
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,388
She addressed this to her superior.

81
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,988
Embezzlement?

82
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:36,988
She sent this mail out yesterday at 5:45 in the evening.

83
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:39,589
I think she died soon after that.

84
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,989
You stay out of this, brat!

85
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,688
Manner mode?

86
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:00,789
At home?

87
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,888
It seems that this will be concluded

88
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,688
as suicide just as Officer Kinoshita says.

89
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,788
Please look at the calendar!

90
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,488
She's got a dentist appointment.

91
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:16,889
Calendar?

92
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:25,788
It's true that she has a dentist appointment written for today.

93
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:28,788
You sure have good eyes, Etsuko.

94
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,588
You can see what's written from there?

95
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:33,888
Yes. Well, sort of...

96
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,488
A calculated suicide to the point of getting a wire ready.

97
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:41,488
Would such a person make a dentist appointment for today?

98
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:42,688
Wait a second.

99
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:47,188
Officer Kinoshita, this may possibly not be a case of suicide.

100
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,088
So she was killed by the man in that picture, right?

101
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,888
No, I can't really answer that yet.

102
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,288
Officer Kinoshita, was this room locked or unlocked when you came here?

103
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,288
The door was not locked.

104
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,888
Which means she committed suicide without locking the door.

105
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,688
Rather, a person who commits suicide

106
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,288
would probably be reluctant to be found in the act.

107
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,388
The picture that was found at the front entrance was peeled off from here.

108
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:15,588
Hey!

109
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:17,188
Hey, Pops.

110
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:21,588
The victim must have been close with the man in this picture,

111
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:24,988
but isn't there a suicide note addressed to him?

112
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:26,688
Huh?

113
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,489
Pops, I wonder what this is?

114
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:31,789
There's some kind of white powder here.

115
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:41,789
It hurts.

116
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:56,788
It has no smell and is dry.

117
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,089
I think this powder is edible.

118
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:03,488
I think this is cornstarch.

119
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:06,188
What else can you use cornstarch for other than cooking?

120
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,188
Well, for making Japanese sweets.

121
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,589
Rice cake filled with sweet beans is also covered with cornstarch.

122
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:18,188
Inspector, the money that Ms. Ozawa was in charge of at her company,

123
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,088
a sum of about 30,000,000 yen is missing.

124
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,988
Her superior, Mr. Shimizu is off today.

125
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:27,589
Which means he doesn't know that Ms. Ozawa committed suicide.

126
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:32,088
And we've also come up with something unexpected.

127
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,688
This man who is loading the cooler box is where she sent her mail to.

128
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:38,388
He is her superior, Mr. Shimizu.

129
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,788
You mean her superior was going out with her?

130
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,688
Nobody in the company seems to have known

131
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,588
that they were going out with each other.

132
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,088
Moreover, it seems that Shimizu liked gambling

133
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:51,388
and invested a lot of money into it.

134
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:52,588
Inspector.

135
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,088
It sounds fishy, don't you think?

136
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,589
Excuse me, Inspector.

137
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,988
It's him!

138
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,988
The one who came out of this room.

139
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,588
Tell the truth!

140
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,288
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,288
And excuse me for being rude, but who are you?

142
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:11,788
-Please get out of the way and don't interfere. -It's this guy. It's him.

143
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,688
Inspector, he is Mr. Shimizu.

144
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:16,489
He was resting at home, but I asked him to come.

145
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:27,288
Getting right down to business,

146
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,188
did you know that Ms. Ozawa who was working under you,

147
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:33,188
had embezzled a sum of 30,000,000 yen?

148
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,388
"Ryota Shimizu (30)" -No. The officer informed me of it.

149
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:37,688
I was utterly surprised.

150
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:42,588
Weren't you going out with Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

151
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,888
If so, it would seem natural that she would discuss the matter with you.

152
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,888
We weren't going steady or anything.

153
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,988
You're referring to that picture that you had?

154
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,288
Ms. Ozawa said that she wanted to try going fishing once,

155
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,888
so I took her fishing with me.

156
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:58,488
Where were you this morning, a little after 9:00?

157
00:09:58,489 --> 00:09:59,988
What do you mean?

158
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:04,488
Someone saw you come fleeing out of this room.

159
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,489
Me?

160
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,988
No use playing dumb!

161
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,788
I saw you clearly with these eyes of mine.

162
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,288
I'll be straightforward with you.

163
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:16,988
Didn't you come here this morning at 9:00 and kill Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

164
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:18,888
Are you trying to say

165
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,888
that I used Ms. Ozawa to embezzle money from the company and killed her?

166
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,688
Yes. After you sucked sweet honey, and sucked it all,

167
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,788
you got rid of her and...

168
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:30,088
Wait.

169
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,488
I didn't do it.

170
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:34,588
I had a class reunion with the classmates of my elementary school days

171
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,288
and was in Hiroshima yesterday.

172
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:37,888
So at about 9:00 this morning,

173
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:41,288
I was at the airport in order to board the plane headed for Haneda.

174
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,389
This is the cut half of the plane ticket.

175
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:51,488
Then, where were you last night from 6:00 to 8:00?

176
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:53,288
I was in the midst of the class reunion.

177
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,089
This is the name card of the person in charge.

178
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,288
Please let me have it for a while.

179
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,788
Sure.

180
00:10:58,789 --> 00:10:59,789
Go check on it.

181
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:00,789
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,188
Mr. Shimizu has an alibi.

183
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:06,788
But Etsuko insists that she definitely saw him.

184
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:08,389
If this is not a suicide case...

185
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,188
How was it?

186
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,789
Wasn't what that man said an outright lie?

187
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,588
It was just as Mr. Shimizu had said.

188
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:39,188
I confirmed with the chairman of the class reunion

189
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,989
as well as the airline company.

190
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:43,688
I see.

191
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:47,688
Etsuko probably mistook someone else to be Mr. Shimizu.

192
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:48,988
But Etsuko has good eyes, doesn't she?

193
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:53,588
Because she was able to see the words on the calendar from far away, right?

194
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,688
Then, are you saying that she wanted to set Mr. Shimizu as the killer?

195
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:57,989
For what?

196
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,088
It's totally Greek to me.

197
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,488
Where's Officer Horita?

198
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,088
He is questioning a courier at the entrance of the condo

199
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,188
because the courier seems to have seen something.

200
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:11,788
Since my alibi's been established,

201
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,789
I guess I'll get heading home then.

202
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:18,889
No, you don't.

203
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,388
Don't let him go. He is a killer!

204
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:23,888
Etsuko.

205
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,588
What a woman.

206
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:28,588
Do you have a grudge against me or something?

207
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,888
Do you have proof that I'm the killer?

208
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,488
I do.

209
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:36,288
I knew her since she was a little child.

210
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:40,888
She thought of me as her mother and told me everything about herself.

211
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,188
She told me that she was going out with a person called Shimizu.

212
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,888
She also confessed to me that she embezzled money from the company

213
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:49,288
under his orders.

214
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,189
What a thing to say.

215
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:55,989
Stop it.

216
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:03,188
It was on vibrator. That was ticklish.

217
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,388
Yes, this is Mouri.

218
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,088
The thing that medical examiner asked for?

219
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,488
She has no bad teeth? You mean Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

220
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,288
But she had a dentist appointment.

221
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,388
No. Thank you very much.

222
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:20,588
Nothing is wrong with her teeth, and yet she had a dentist appointment?

223
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:21,888
Excuse me.

224
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,888
I don't want to be a bother,

225
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:27,788
but I don't think this is Ms. Ozawa's writing on the calendar.

226
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:32,289
Since I'm her superior, I used to see her writing all the time.

227
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,988
We can't say for sure until we get it evaluated,

228
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:39,088
but it does look different.

229
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:41,889
Then who wrote in the calendar?

230
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,488
From what I hear, this woman here is the one who first found the body?

231
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,588
I see. I understand now.

232
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,988
It's not unusual for the first person to find the body is the killer.

233
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:57,788
Well, it's too bad that Etsuko is the killer.

234
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:00,088
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

235
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,688
Etsuko wanted to set Mr. Shimizu up as the killer.

236
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,688
That's why she set it up

237
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:08,088
so that it looked to be as if Fumie had a dentist appointment.

238
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,488
She also peeled the picture from the album

239
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:12,888
and put the picture at the front entrance for everyone to see.

240
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,888
Etsuko, just in case,

241
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,989
could you write the word dentist for me, please?

242
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:21,388
It's that woman over there, but are you sure?

243
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:23,888
Yes, I am.

244
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,489
She hid it here.

245
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:33,888
Inspector.

246
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,389
What is this?

247
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:38,689
What?

248
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,488
Etsuko,

249
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:46,388
you came into this room a little after 9:00 this morning today, didn't you?

250
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:47,389
No.

251
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,788
The driver of a courier saw you come out of this room.

252
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:56,789
Moreover, you seemed to be in a rush and bumped into him.

253
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,188
There's five million yen here.

254
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:04,988
Can you explain where this money came from

255
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:09,489
and why you hid it in the gas meter box?

256
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,688
I brought the money from my house.

257
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:18,988
I hid it because when I went to report Fumie's death to the police.

258
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:22,288
I didn't want to drop it just in case.

259
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,688
So you did come into this room after all.

260
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:26,689
No, I haven't.

261
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,688
You killed Ozawa yourself and tried to set me up as the killer.

262
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:32,488
Just what do you think you're saying?

263
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:35,888
Mr. Mouri, please don't listen to what this man is saying.

264
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:38,588
Well, what a predicament.

265
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,588
It's a lie. One of the two is lying.

266
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:44,789
Etsuko or Mr. Shimizu, which of them is the killer?

267
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,088
What's this?

268
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,088
The scale of a fish?

269
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:55,489
Why would something like this be here?

270
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,689
Maybe...

271
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,689
I see. So that's the story.

272
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,743
I did write it

273
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:15,643
and I am the one who put the picture there, too.

274
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:18,343
Was it to put the blame of the crime on Mr. Shimizu?

275
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,343
No, that's not it.

276
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:23,143
I did it to have Mr. Shimizu arrested.

277
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:26,043
I came to this room this morning.

278
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:27,843
I was going to accompany Fumie

279
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:29,643
who said she was going to turn herself into the police.

280
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:31,943
I brought money along with me

281
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:35,844
thinking that returning some money would make what she did a bit lighter.

282
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:43,743
I just knew that Mr. Shimizu was responsible

283
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:46,343
for the way I found Fumie.

284
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:49,943
She told me that she was going to confess everything to the police.

285
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:55,243
But there is nothing in this room that hints that Mr. Shimizu did anything.

286
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:57,643
That's why you put the picture in the front entrance

287
00:16:57,644 --> 00:17:00,843
and schemed writing what you did on the calendar.

288
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,944
The killer is Mr. Shimizu!

289
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:08,743
But Etsuko, that's your side of the story

290
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,343
and we can't believe it completely.

291
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,243
After all, Mr. Shimizu does have an alibi.

292
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:18,243
We'd like to know where you got such a sum as five million yen, too.

293
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,544
So would you please come to the police?

294
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,443
Mr. Mouri, thank you for waiting.

295
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:30,043
This is Mr. Inoue, who works at the ice making shop.

296
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:32,643
Ice making shop? What's this about?

297
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:37,443
Just as you had assumed, ice had been bought.

298
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,343
Officer Sato and Officer Horita,

299
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:42,743
take her to the police and hear her out, will you?

300
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:43,844
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

301
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,643
Inspector, please wait.

302
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,344
What is it?

303
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:05,543
Mr. Mouri! Did it start?

304
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,943
Let that person go right away.

305
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:13,343
The one who needs to go to the police is you, Mr. Shimizu.

306
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,243
Why do I have to go to the police?

307
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:19,443
Mr. Inoue, when did he come to buy ice?

308
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:20,843
Yesterday afternoon.

309
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:24,543
He came to buy four blocks of ice totalling 15 kilograms.

310
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:28,343
I remember him because he brought a large cooler box along with him.

311
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:30,643
At this time of year,

312
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:34,143
how long does it take for ice to melt and disappear?

313
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:37,243
At normal room temperature, about half a day.

314
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:39,843
Thank you for taking time out to come here.

315
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:42,943
No problem.

316
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:45,244
Thank you very much.

317
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,243
Officer Sato.

318
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:51,943
If you look underneath the bathtub cover, you will find a fish scale.

319
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:54,343
Please remove the wires from it and bring it here.

320
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,344
A fish scale in the bathroom?

321
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:58,743
Mr. Shimizu.

322
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,643
Around yesterday afternoon,

323
00:19:00,644 --> 00:19:03,543
you probably put Ms. Ozawa to sleep using sleeping pills.

324
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,143
Then you carried her into the bath tub.

325
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:09,043
You made her sit on the bench you made using ice

326
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:11,643
and the lid of the bathtub and left.

327
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:15,643
As the ice melts the bench lowers and chokes her neck.

328
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:19,043
At the estimated time of her death between 6:00 to 8:00 last night,

329
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,643
half the ice would've melted.

330
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:23,943
And this morning, when Etsuko found her,

331
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:27,344
the ice had melted and the floor of the bathtub was dry.

332
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,743
It may have been stuck to the cooler box that you loaded the ice with.

333
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:35,043
A fish scale was on the lid of the box.

334
00:19:35,044 --> 00:19:39,243
Does that serve as proof that I killed her?

335
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:44,143
Listen, Ms. Ozawa sent me mail at 5:45 in the evening.

336
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:49,343
How can a person who is asleep with wire around her neck do that?

337
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:50,643
Conan.

338
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:54,443
Will you put Ms. Ozawa's cell phone in the open space of the book shelf?

339
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,943
Stick about half of it out though.

340
00:19:56,944 --> 00:19:58,244
Okay.

341
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:09,243
The cell phone is on manner mode.

342
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:12,443
Officer Sato, please call Ms. Ozawa's cell phone.

343
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,844
Yes, sir.

344
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:27,243
If you look at the history of incoming calls,

345
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:30,943
you will notice that she received a call a little before 5:45.

346
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,943
No, but I didn't do it.

347
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,243
I was in Hiroshima.

348
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:38,143
You sure are obstinate!

349
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:41,643
Officer Sato, please look at the place where the wire is tied.

350
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:44,943
You'll see hair stuck to it.

351
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,544
Don't you see hair other than Ms. Ozawa's hair that is dyed?

352
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:50,744
There is.

353
00:20:50,745 --> 00:20:53,443
Something that looks like straight black hair.

354
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:57,143
Mr. Shimizu, when you carried Ms. Ozawa,

355
00:20:57,144 --> 00:21:00,843
your hair got tangled with Ms. Ozawa's hair.

356
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,843
However, you did not realize it.

357
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,943
Mr. Shimizu, it will be obvious whose hair it is

358
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:07,444
once we get it evaluated by the forensic officers.

359
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:13,943
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:13,944 --> 00:21:16,943
She said that she couldn't continue any longer,

361
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,543
and that she would turn herself in to the police.

362
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,644
That's why I...

363
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:30,543
You drank a lot of sweet honey,

364
00:21:30,544 --> 00:21:34,244
so from now you're going to have to drink a lot of bitterness.

365
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,143
You sure were fantastic!

366
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,243
Mr. Mouri, Inspector Megure was saying

367
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:39,143
that your plan of letting Shimizu suck sweet candy first

368
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:42,443
then giving him the blow was utterly splendid.

369
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:43,943
That a pinch of salt is necessary

370
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:46,344
to bring out the full effect of sweetness.

371
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:57,144
Maybe I should shake a little salt on you, too?

372
00:23:58,444 --> 00:24:03,243
"Next Episode."

373
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:05,443
It's been ringing for quite a long time.

374
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,043
It's that case that happened 12 years ago!

375
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:10,243
There was an incident that happened 12 years ago

376
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:12,644
that was very similar to this case!

377
00:24:16,044 --> 00:24:17,843
It's from Ran!

378
00:24:17,844 --> 00:24:19,343
Then, don't tell me...

379
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:20,743
Don't tell me that...

380
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:22,943
Oh, no.

381
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:28,544
Next Conan, "Request from a Queer Family (Part 1)"

382
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:45,843
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:48,443
"Cell phone lock."

384
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:49,643
Why isn't Officer Takagi in this episode?

385
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:51,443
I think it's because the title to this episode is sweet flavour.

386
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:52,844
Officer Sato.
