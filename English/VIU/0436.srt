1
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:02,288
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:04,188
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,189 --> 00:00:05,688
A surprising incident occurs at the interview site.

4
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,288
The Youth Detective Squad fight as one.

5
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:08,988
Their deductions surpass those of the police!

6
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:10,488
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,188
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:13,989
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:58,042
Popular freelance writer, Mr. Masato Sugimori,

10
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:00,942
comes to Teitan Elementary School wanting to interview the activities

11
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:02,543
of the Youth Detective Squad.

12
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:07,142
Some days later, we go with Ms. Kobayashi

13
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:10,142
to Mr. Sugimori's residence.

14
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:13,143
However, we found Mr. Sugimori's dead body there.

15
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,142
As a result of site investigation,

16
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,342
I deduce that the suspect is among the four who left messages

17
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:22,043
in the answer phone.

18
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:29,143
"The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 2)"

19
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:32,042
Inspector, the recording device has arrived.

20
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,543
Is that right?

21
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:38,643
Okay, let's hear the first message.

22
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,843
It's the sound of the railroad crossing nearby.

23
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,142
It's so long.

24
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,143
It's already more than two minutes since it's started ringing.

25
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:01,942
-It... -It stopped.

26
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:04,442
Let's hear the first one.

27
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:05,943
There are four messages.

28
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:08,942
Mr. Sugimori?

29
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:10,642
This is Haruka.

30
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:12,642
I seem to have drunk too much last night.

31
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:13,742
-I'm sorry. -There seems to be...

32
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,742
-I'm not angry anymore. -a lot of pollen in the air.

33
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:18,442
-I thought you were seeing someone else -How do you deal with hay fever?

34
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:21,742
-because you never take me to your room. -The information we'll provide...

35
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,142
-Call me if you receive my message. -for April 22nd is pollen allergy!

36
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:28,243
Received on Friday, 11:25.

37
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,842
Inspector, there's a sound of the television in the background.

38
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:38,042
Yeah. This is the program playing from 11:00 on Nichiuri TV, "Meippai TV".

39
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,942
April 22nd is yesterday,

40
00:03:40,943 --> 00:03:42,242
so we can call the television station

41
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:45,043
and confirm what time they aired the program.

42
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:48,642
This is Higaki.

43
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:51,242
-I'm heading over to your place... -The next station is Okuho. Okuho.

44
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:54,142
-because I want to apologize to you in person. -Please watch...

45
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:56,542
If you're not home, I'll go another day.

46
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,042
I'm really sorry about the car.

47
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:00,642
Later.

48
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:04,642
Received on Friday, 11:27.

49
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:08,642
The sound in the background is the announcement inside a train.

50
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:11,542
Okuho Station is quite some distance from here,

51
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,243
so it'll take him a little over 30 minutes to get here.

52
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,542
This is Inaba from Koeikan.

53
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:22,442
I wanted to ask you about your progress on the article we requested.

54
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:24,642
Chief, what's today's date?

55
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:28,542
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

56
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,442
The deadline is a week from now, so please keep up your good work.

57
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:35,442
-Chief, are you watching the game tonight? -If this is about the scoop,

58
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:36,443
I'm not upset about it anymore.

59
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:39,342
-Don't worry. It'll be held at Tohto Dome. -Continue work for us as always.

60
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:42,642
Received on Friday, 11:29.

61
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:44,642
This time it's the voices of other people.

62
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:47,142
It seems he called from his work place.

63
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:48,242
The chief and another person

64
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:50,942
seem to have been there other than the caller.

65
00:04:50,943 --> 00:04:53,842
Isn't Koeikan some distance away from here, too?

66
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:54,942
Yes.

67
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:58,842
If by train, you've got to transfer. It'll take an hour even by car.

68
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,243
Now for the last message.

69
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,742
I'm the one who called you a while ago,

70
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:09,143
the homeroom teacher for first grade, Class B, Kobayashi.

71
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,743
I'm sorry. It seems I have hay fever.

72
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:16,742
I have something I'd like to ask you.

73
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:18,743
I'll ask you when we go over to see you tomorrow.

74
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:22,542
I'll see you tomorrow.

75
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:26,042
Received on Friday, 11:30.

76
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:28,642
This is your voice, right, Ms. Kobayashi?

77
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:30,942
Yes.

78
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:33,642
Which means that Ms. Kobayashi is the killer!

79
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:36,542
-What? -No, hardly.

80
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:38,442
Because if Ms. Kobayashi were the killer,

81
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:42,142
she would've forced her way inside the room and run over to the body.

82
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:44,942
That way, when the police investigate later,

83
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:49,742
she could mislead them, even if they found her hair or her fingerprints.

84
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:53,942
-Hey, hold back a bit, will you? -Sorry.

85
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:56,342
By the way, what is this thing you wanted to ask about

86
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:58,442
that you mentioned in your message?

87
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:01,342
Right. It's about the interview of the children.

88
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:06,542
There's no mistake that you left your message at 11:30 yesterday?

89
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:10,942
Yes. You can also hear the bell ringing for the start of 4th period.

90
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,142
Yesterday, at around 11:22 right after 3rd period,

91
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:15,442
I called Mr. Sugimori to tell him

92
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:18,042
that the children have accepted to do the interview.

93
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:21,442
I remembered that I had a question and called him,

94
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:24,542
but his phone was already on answer phone at that time.

95
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:31,142
Then the crime was committed within 30 minutes from 11:22.

96
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:32,542
But, inspector,

97
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:36,442
according to Ms. Kobayashi, since the time on this phone is accurate,

98
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:39,242
it occurred in the three minutes between 11:22

99
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:41,742
and when the first message was left in the machine at 11:25.

100
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:44,742
Three minutes. What a piece of work.

101
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:46,442
True.

102
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:47,443
Come to think of it,

103
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:49,742
when I called him telling him that we'd accept the interview,

104
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,943
he mentioned that he was expecting someone to come soon.

105
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:55,242
Did you get the name?

106
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,243
No.

107
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:58,742
Police?

108
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:01,243
I already paid for my parking ticket.

109
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:04,842
No. It's actually about Mr. Sugimori.

110
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:08,142
Did you leave a message in his answer phone yesterday afternoon?

111
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:09,742
"Haruka Aida (29)" -Yes.

112
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:13,942
I got wasted last night and seemed to have picked on him a lot.

113
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:17,242
Do you remember where you called him from?

114
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,842
I called from my condo on my cell phone.

115
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:21,942
Is there anyone who can verify this?

116
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:25,142
No. But what is this all about?

117
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,442
Well, we'll give you the details later.

118
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:29,942
We'll send a car to pick you up, so could I have your address, please?

119
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,142
Yes. Gizencho I-chome...

120
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:33,942
Gizencho?

121
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:36,443
That sure is a place far from here.

122
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:40,542
What? Did I call Sugimori?

123
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,242
"Toshinori Higaki (33)" -Yeah. I did yesterday

124
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,942
from inside the Tohto Kanjo Line train.

125
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:47,642
But I only got the answer phone.

126
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:50,042
Were you with someone at that time?

127
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,742
No, I was alone.

128
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:55,742
Don't tell me that he went crying to the police

129
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,242
about the scratch on the bumper of his Ferrari?

130
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:01,742
I slightly bumped into a telephone pole when I borrowed the car from him.

131
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:03,842
He was pissed though.

132
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:06,942
I'm sorry, Inaba just stepped out.

133
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:09,442
I think he'll be back soon though.

134
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:12,042
Yes. I'm the editor-in-chief, Hayashi.

135
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,242
What do you police want with him?

136
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:18,642
Do you know where he was at about 11:30 yesterday?

137
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:22,642
No. Editors go in and out a lot.

138
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:26,242
He left a message in a certain person's answer phone

139
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:28,642
and we hear your voice in the background saying,

140
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:32,143
"It's April 22nd, 11:28."

141
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:36,142
Then I'm sure he was here in the editing room.

142
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:38,242
His cell phone isn't working well,

143
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:40,442
so he usually asks me for the date and time.

144
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:44,442
I've been telling him for the past year to hurry and buy a new one, but...

145
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:47,142
Chief, you're going to the ball game tonight, aren't you?

146
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:48,342
Is it going to be okay?

147
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:51,142
I'm worried because it's not going to be at the Tohto Dome tonight.

148
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:53,443
It's not about the game, but how're you feeling?

149
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:57,542
I slept all night and got over my cold right away.

150
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,542
My eyes aren't blood shot anymore either.

151
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:01,942
I must've been tired.

152
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:05,142
Inaba, there was a call from the police for you!

153
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,842
"Atsushi Inaba (32)" -The police?

154
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:08,143
I wonder what is it for?

155
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:12,142
Mr. Inaba, please wait at the editing room,

156
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:14,042
-until we go and pick you up. -Don't you think it's strange?

157
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:15,342
I agree.

158
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:16,542
What seems to be the matter?

159
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,442
The 2nd message in the phone.

160
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:20,642
Something's strange about the announcement in the train.

161
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,643
They usually say, "Please watch your footsteps when disembarking."

162
00:09:25,443 --> 00:09:28,042
-Because I want to apologize to you in person. -Please watch...

163
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:29,043
If you're not home,

164
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:31,742
-It's true that it's stopped at "Please watch..." -I'll go another day.

165
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:34,442
Let's call and confirm just to be sure.

166
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:37,542
What? The conductor that did the announcement

167
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,242
had hay fever?

168
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:42,642
Yes. That was me.

169
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:45,642
I came down with hay fever all of a sudden yesterday

170
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:48,942
that I couldn't hold up till the Tohto Kanjo Line made its round.

171
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:51,942
I had someone else take my place after noon time.

172
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:54,042
Is that right?

173
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:56,142
It seems that he stopped at "Please watch..."

174
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:58,842
because he was holding back sneezing.

175
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:00,742
I see.

176
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,742
I confirmed with my wife as to the 1st message where "Meippai TV"

177
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:05,542
was aired in the background,

178
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:10,542
and was told that hay fever information really started at around 11:25.

179
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,042
Which means they both seem to have an alibi.

180
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,242
No.

181
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:17,643
There's only one person who has a solid alibi.

182
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:24,342
The sound of the railroad crossing again?

183
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:25,742
Come to think of it,

184
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:28,142
that is also the tracks where the Tohto Kanjo Line passes.

185
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:31,442
It takes an hour for the Tohto Kanjo Line to make one round.

186
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,742
And on weekdays,

187
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:37,142
I think the departure and arrival times are the same.

188
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:38,842
Well, for the time being,

189
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:41,542
let's hear what the three who left those messages have to say.

190
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:43,643
-Yes. I'll go pick them up then. -No.

191
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,643
I think there's only one person...

192
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:50,743
you need to bring here.

193
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:57,816
What? Just one?

194
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,016
Yes.

195
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:01,416
After killing Mr. Sugimori, the killer

196
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:04,016
deliberately set the telephone in this room to answer phone

197
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:07,316
in order to leave his message inside to establish an alibi, right?

198
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:09,416
So from those three messages,

199
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:13,216
and the calls Officer Takagi just made to the three who left them,

200
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:16,816
can't you tell who's suspicious, and who's not?

201
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,617
The hint is hay fever.

202
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,116
Right.

203
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,816
Ms. Kobayashi is suspicious of me.

204
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:32,116
But I may be wrong because after all, I'm just a kid.

205
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,716
Hay fever?

206
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:37,416
Come to think of it, all of them had something to do with hay fever.

207
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:39,316
They're not listening to me.

208
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:43,216
At 11:25, in the background of Haruka's message,

209
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:46,516
the sound of the hay fever information program was heard.

210
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:49,616
At 11:27, in Mr. Higaki's message,

211
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:53,716
the strange announcement from within the train was heard.

212
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:56,516
The man who made the announcement had hay fever,

213
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,416
and due to him needing to try not to sneeze,

214
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:02,116
someone else had to take his place.

215
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:06,616
Although Mr. Inaba's message was left in the machine at 11:29,

216
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:08,416
when asked about what date and time it was...

217
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:12,016
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

218
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:15,216
There was only the voice of the editor-in-chief answering as such.

219
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:17,016
But he says nothing about pollen allergy.

220
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:18,516
True.

221
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:24,216
Hey. When Officer Takagi called the editor-in-chief just now, didn't he say

222
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:26,116
that he slept all night, his cold got better

223
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:29,316
and his blood shot eyes also improved?

224
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,616
You experienced the same thing too, didn't you, Ms. Kobayashi?

225
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,116
Yes.

226
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,817
But mine wasn't a cold, it was hay fever.

227
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:38,517
Hey.

228
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:43,616
That editor had hay fever.

229
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:47,116
What does that have to do with this case?

230
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:49,716
Maybe we'd better call everyone here after all, don't you think?

231
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,016
A little more than an hour!

232
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:54,416
-No! It's exactly an hour! -What?

233
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,317
-What's up, you two? -What is it?

234
00:12:57,617 --> 00:13:00,416
It's the time it takes for the Tohto Kanjo Line to go once around.

235
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,816
That's what the two are arguing about.

236
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:05,816
When I took that train before with mom on our way home,

237
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,616
we both fell asleep on the train.

238
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,516
It was too bothersome to transfer,

239
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,816
so we stayed on the train and went once around.

240
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,916
But we got home a little after an hour.

241
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:18,916
But I'm sure that according to the timetable, it was an hour.

242
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:21,416
Although the inbound and outbound trains are slightly different,

243
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,316
both are approximately about an hour.

244
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:24,317
Come to think of it,

245
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:28,216
from here to Okuho Station where the man who made the announcement at,

246
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:30,116
it would take at least 30 minutes

247
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:32,516
regardless of whether it's inward or outward bound, right?

248
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:33,716
Yeah.

249
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,516
Because Okuho is located right opposite here.

250
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,016
If that man got off the train a little after noon

251
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,916
before the train made its round,

252
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:44,116
he would've got on the train after 11:00 in the morning at the earliest.

253
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:45,516
Right.

254
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:46,917
-So? -So?

255
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,016
Hey, Ayumi.

256
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:51,416
I see.

257
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,417
Hey.

258
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:56,916
Maybe Mr. Higaki who said he called from inside the train

259
00:13:56,917 --> 00:14:02,316
recorded that announcement and played it while talking on the phone?

260
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:03,616
I see.

261
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:07,116
If so, it would sound as if he did in fact call from inside the train.

262
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,316
I don't think so.

263
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:13,616
The station employee said he suddenly came down with hay fever yesterday.

264
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:16,216
If the station employee got on the train after 11:00,

265
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,116
Mr. Higaki could've recorded the announcement

266
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:19,716
only from around the same time.

267
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:23,016
Mr. Higaki's call is at 11:27.

268
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:26,016
If he was close to Okuho Station, which is over 30 minutes away from here,

269
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:29,416
leaving a message of the train announcement is...

270
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:34,316
To come here and push the answer phone button after killing Mr. Sugimori

271
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,916
is impossible. Mr. Higaki isn't a suspect.

272
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,316
Right.

273
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:39,516
But...

274
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:41,016
Hold it, Genta.

275
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:42,017
Not yet.

276
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,316
Okay. Go ahead.

277
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,816
But the sound of the television that was heard in Haruka's message

278
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:52,616
can easily be left from inside this room, right?

279
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,516
-Okay! -I get it!

280
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:57,216
That television was used.

281
00:14:57,217 --> 00:14:59,516
If she turned the answering machine on after killing him

282
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:02,616
and called here while the television was playing in the background...

283
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:06,016
It would sound as if the caller were calling from a different place.

284
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:08,317
Which makes Haruka a suspect.

285
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,916
What's that? People are making a fuss outside.

286
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,916
True.

287
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,716
Hurry up and cross.

288
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,216
Is it going to be long again?

289
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,016
Maybe this is...

290
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,816
The railroad crossing?

291
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:21,817
Come to think of it,

292
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:25,016
it was ringing before we listened to the answer phone a while ago, too.

293
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,716
This railroad crossing seems to be closed

294
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,316
for more than two minutes.

295
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:32,616
I checked the timetable a while ago with my cell phone

296
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:37,416
and it seems that a train also passes here at around 11:24.

297
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:42,916
Haruka's message was left in the answer phone at 11:25.

298
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,016
According to Ms. Kobayashi's testimony,

299
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:48,716
the estimated time of crime committed is between 11:22 to 11:25,

300
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:50,116
which is only three minutes.

301
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,516
If it's Haruka,

302
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,616
she would've had to come here and hit Mr. Sugimori

303
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,616
with the camera tripod when he is off his guard and kill him.

304
00:15:55,617 --> 00:15:57,116
Pushing the answering machine's on button

305
00:15:57,117 --> 00:16:01,116
and leaving the room would use up almost all that time.

306
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:03,016
It's just as Conan and the others said.

307
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:06,816
She left the message with the sound of the television in the back.

308
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:09,416
It's impossible unless she did it from this room or somewhere around here.

309
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:13,516
But the sound of the railroad crossing is not heard.

310
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:15,216
Which means she left the message

311
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:18,216
from somewhere quite a distance from here.

312
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:20,916
It's impossible for Haruka to commit the crime.

313
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,516
So the only one left is Mr. Inaba.

314
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,316
Right, Conan?

315
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,217
I think so.

316
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:31,816
What? Mr. Sugimori?

317
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:37,616
The estimated time the crime was committed is between 11:22 and 11:25.

318
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:39,616
Where were you during that time?

319
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:41,516
I was here in the editing room.

320
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:44,216
You heard the message that I left in the answer phone, didn't you?

321
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,516
This is Inaba from Koeikan.

322
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:49,516
I wanted to ask you about your progress on the article we requested.

323
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:51,916
Chief, what's today's date?

324
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:55,916
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

325
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:58,616
See? The voice of the editor is in it, too.

326
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,216
So there's no mistake about it, is there?

327
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:02,116
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

328
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:03,616
Ouch.

329
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,416
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

330
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,216
My stomach hurts!

331
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:12,916
It could be the mini cup milk that I put inside my tea this morning.

332
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:16,116
The bag that had the freshness expiration on the bag was torn,

333
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:18,116
and I saw the month April written on it

334
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,016
but I couldn't read the rest of it.

335
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:22,716
You see, two or three days wouldn't be a problem,

336
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:24,416
but if the expiry date was something like a year ago,

337
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,616
it would really be a problem.

338
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:27,516
A year ago?

339
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:28,816
Hey.

340
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:31,216
I think this is a role that you should play after all, Genta.

341
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,516
I get it! A year ago!

342
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,016
That message that was left behind

343
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:38,316
could've been left on April 22nd a year ago.

344
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:42,516
The editor doesn't mention April 22nd of what year.

345
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:46,016
Moreover, Mr. Inaba doesn't say which article he's referring to either.

346
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:47,216
I see.

347
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,816
Which means he left something that was recorded a year ago

348
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:53,916
inside the answer phone a year later which is yesterday,

349
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,316
after he committed the crime to establish an alibi.

350
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:56,816
Hey.

351
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,916
How can you say that?

352
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:01,616
I really phoned from the company yesterday.

353
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,816
Ms. Kobayashi, I bet you don't feel like going out much

354
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,316
-during hay fever season, right? -No.

355
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:10,617
Come to think of it, the editor also had a bad case of hay fever, right?

356
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:14,716
He kept repeating that he had a cold yesterday though.

357
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:16,716
If he in fact did have a cold,

358
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:19,216
the more he wouldn't say the following, would he?

359
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:22,416
"Chief, are you watching the game tonight?"

360
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:25,216
"Don't worry. It'll be held at Tohto Dome."

361
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:28,516
He sounds like he's really set on going to the game.

362
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:31,116
The editor is a fervent baseball fan,

363
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,516
so he'll go even if he has a cold.

364
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:36,216
I don't know whether he went yesterday or not though.

365
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:41,716
But when Officer Takagi first talked to the editor on the phone, he said,

366
00:18:41,717 --> 00:18:44,916
"I'm worried because it's not going to be at the Tohto Dome tonight."

367
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,616
Maybe the editor made a mistake.

368
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:50,416
Then, I wonder if he was worried about the weather?

369
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,816
Yeah.

370
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,216
With a weather like today,

371
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,116
the game could be cancelled if there's no roof, right?

372
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:57,416
Then what about the...

373
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:00,916
"Don't worry because it's going to be held at Tohto Dome today."

374
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,716
I think he's referring to the weather.

375
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:06,717
But it was sunshiny all day yesterday.

376
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,516
I see.

377
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,916
It was raining on April 22nd a year ago

378
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,616
and there wasn't much pollen in the air, too.

379
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:18,616
No, that's...

380
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,716
That's just plain deduction.

381
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:23,316
There was no sound of rain in the message.

382
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:25,816
Besides, do you have proof that I did it or something?

383
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:29,216
Hey, your motorbike outside is really dirty,

384
00:19:29,217 --> 00:19:30,816
but don't you wash it often?

385
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,316
What?

386
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:34,616
Your boots are all scratched up and worn out,

387
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:37,016
so why didn't you go buy a new one together with it?

388
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:38,116
Together?

389
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:41,516
Because you just bought a new pair of gloves, right?

390
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:43,117
The price tag is still on it.

391
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,316
I see!

392
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,716
The gloves that you usually wear

393
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,716
are the ones that you had on when you committed the crime.

394
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:52,216
And you noticed blood on them, so you bought new ones.

395
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:54,416
Moreover, since the price tag is still on them,

396
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:57,316
you must've realized it on your way here.

397
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:59,816
Let's check for blood reaction on the places

398
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,916
that you may have touched then.

399
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:07,317
Let's start from the handle of you motorbike that you said you didn't wash.

400
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,116
Just as expected, Mr. Sugimori's blood

401
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:14,616
was found on the motorbike handle.

402
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:16,016
His motive for killing

403
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:18,816
was the exposure article that was left in the answer phone.

404
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,516
Both men had spent three years investigating

405
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:23,116
the embezzlement case of a big political figure.

406
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:25,316
But Sugimori sold it to another magazine

407
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:28,516
that offered a higher price for it.

408
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:32,816
Mr. Inaba insisted while sobbing and trembling that more than the money,

409
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:35,416
he wanted his magazine to be the first to publicize it.

410
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,316
It turns out that the story about interviewing the Youth Detective Squad

411
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,917
was just a trick to make his story seem coherent.

412
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,816
I'm sort of pooped.

413
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,816
I did so much talking.

414
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,316
I was so nervous.

415
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:49,816
If you were to hide a leaf, the best place to do so is in the forest.

416
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:52,116
So you divide the dialogue among the other kids

417
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,716
and distract her attention from you.

418
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:55,816
Sort of.

419
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:57,316
Now, if Ms. Kobayashi...

420
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,316
Hey, kids.

421
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:01,616
I'd like to ask you all something.

422
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:02,617
Here she comes.

423
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,916
Do you know Ranpo Edogawa?

424
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,016
Yes.

425
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:13,516
The one that Kogoro Akechi and 20 masks come out, right?

426
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:14,517
That's right.

427
00:21:14,518 --> 00:21:18,716
You're just like the Youth Detective Squad that comes out in the series.

428
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:20,416
I'm a great fan of the series.

429
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:23,016
So I'd like to ask you a favour.

430
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:24,116
What favour?

431
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,916
You want to tell us to stay away from danger or something like that, right?

432
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:30,516
We'll be just fine because we think before we act.

433
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:35,816
Nope. I'd like to join your Detective Squad.

434
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:36,817
Would that be possible?

435
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:40,116
Adults can't join.

436
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:42,016
Please keep your age in mind.

437
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,816
But my name is Kobayashi, you know.

438
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:46,417
There's no reason why I can't join, is there?

439
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:49,916
It seems everything's okay now.

440
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,517
True.

441
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,216
An interview again...

442
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:20,816
Yes. And of course,

443
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,316
I'll be going with you as the advisor of the Youth Detective Squad

444
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:25,116
so no need to worry.

445
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:26,716
When did she become our advisor?

446
00:23:26,717 --> 00:23:30,116
And the person who's going to interview you is the famous...

447
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,016
I've had enough with interviews.

448
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:34,016
I know I'm going to be pooped.

449
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:37,116
Is that so?

450
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:40,016
That's the story, so I'm very sorry.

451
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:43,617
No, don't be. I'm sorry to have troubled you.

452
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:47,916
I figured that Conan would take on the interview, but...

453
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:51,016
It's amazing that he'd knock off your golden special.

454
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:53,917
His homeroom teacher is probably one of a hard head.

455
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:06,116
"Next Episode."

456
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:07,917
Is it about some investigation?

457
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,517
Darn!

458
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:22,017
You have to make it, please!

459
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:28,117
Next Conan, "Aya Ueto and Shinichi, The Promise from 4 Years Ago".

460
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,316
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:48,416
"TV drama."

462
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,916
This year's movie is fantastic!

463
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,116
Yeah, it's fantastic!

464
00:24:51,117 --> 00:24:53,017
What? Did you see it already?
