1
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:08,864
What?

2
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:12,874
The great detective Mori Kogoro?

3
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:15,624
Y-Yes...

4
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:19,623
So, what does the great detective want with us?

5
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:23,884
This is the missing pet Armadillo-kun.

6
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:28,884
She's the pet of a Ginza barmaid who lives in Haido City.

7
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:39,854
Great detective Mori Kogoro-sensei.

8
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:44,093
I'd like you to find my Armadillo-kun.

9
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:46,253
This is a picture of him.

10
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,783
An a-armadillo?

11
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:49,744
Yes.

12
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:52,353
While on my way home yesterday,

13
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,994
he went missing around the Birinmon Bridge.

14
00:00:56,524 --> 00:01:00,004
I see. Birinmon Bridge.

15
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:04,184
It must be the Birinmon Fish Market in that area.

16
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:11,934
That fish market may have already prepared my armadillo for consumption...

17
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:14,683
Please, Mori-sensei!

18
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:19,684
Please find my armadillo!

19
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:22,734
Please!

20
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:25,513
That's the situation.

21
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:27,694
I see.

22
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,074
The Birinmon Fish Market...

23
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:31,074
What?

24
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:33,824
...prepares armadillos for consumption?

25
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:38,084
We're a tuna wholesaler.

26
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:43,183
I certainly don't believe that's the case either.

27
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:44,544
Don't ever come back here!

28
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:49,924
A fish market doesn't handle armadillos!

29
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,554
This is a fish market!

30
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:58,604
Armadillos aren't fish!

31
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:02,984
We don't sell those!

32
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,744
I guess we should head home.

33
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,214
Yeah.

34
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,534
Oof.

35
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,444
Beika City, please.

36
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:38,993
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

37
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:40,843
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

38
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,593
You won't find armadillos at the market!

39
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,673
A mysterious taxi appears during the search!

40
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:46,243
Always determining the one truth

41
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:47,923
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

42
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:50,364
his name is Detective Conan!

43
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:34,384
Follow Them! Detective Taxi

44
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:47,024
Anyway, where could her pet Armadillo-kun have gone?

45
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:51,854
You're the great detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

46
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:55,984
Indeed. I am Mori Kogoro.

47
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:59,404
I'm a huge fan!

48
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:00,953
Marry me!

49
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,273
Wh-What?!

50
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,704
Driver, the wheel! The wheel!

51
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:14,913
I'm sorry. I was just so excited.

52
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,264
I can't believe I asked you to marry me.

53
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:20,593
Don't get the wrong idea.

54
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:22,473
I'm just that big of a fan.

55
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:23,434
Face forward!

56
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,264
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:27,453
You're such a huge fan you want to marry me.

58
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:28,593
Are you happy to hear that?

59
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,104
N-No!

60
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,681
No, but...

61
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:36,571
You are happy.

62
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,951
Excuse me, driver.

63
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:43,361
What is it, Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei?

64
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:46,210
I'm in no hurry.

65
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:49,120
We can take the long way around.

66
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:49,961
What?

67
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,831
Thank you.

68
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,240
Oh, right.

69
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:59,091
Great Detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei.

70
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,820
What is it, driver?

71
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,860
"The long way around" reminds me...

72
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:06,830
"The long way around"?

73
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:09,101
...of the strange brothers in sunglasses.

74
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:11,481
Strange brothers in sunglasses?

75
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:13,971
Yes.

76
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:19,941
Yesterday I picked them up at the intersection near the Birinmon Fish Market.

77
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:27,981
How did I know they were brothers?

78
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,060
Keep...

79
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,780
...going...

80
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:33,671
...straight...

81
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:34,840
...straight...

82
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,841
...ahead.

83
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:43,341
Only brothers could achieve such impressive harmony.

84
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:46,160
What was their destination?

85
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,371
I'm not telling.

86
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,981
So, did those brothers in sunglasses take the long way around?

87
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:56,230
Impressive, Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

88
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:58,361
Marvelous deduction!

89
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:03,150
I know, Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei.

90
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:04,031
What is it?

91
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:08,911
To thank you for riding, I'll show you the long route they took.

92
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,751
You don't need to do that!

93
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:14,501
No, allow me!

94
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:17,001
Don't!

95
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:25,511
Birinmon Fish Market

96
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,511
This is the intersection where I picked up the strange brothers in sunglasses.

97
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:37,141
I drove straight ahead one light, two lights,

98
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:41,791
and turned left at the third light.

99
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:45,401
Around here was an industrial area.

100
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:53,161
I turned left onto the one-way along the concrete embankment on the Teimuzu River.

101
00:07:56,551 --> 00:08:01,671
After driving straight ahead for a while, we passed a rooftop park on the left.

102
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:08,600
We passed the park and drove one, two, three, four,

103
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:12,101
and turned left onto the fifth street.

104
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:22,561
After turning left onto the second road, there was a small coin-operated parking lot.

105
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,281
They asked me to stop here so I stopped the car.

106
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:27,391
Stop here.

107
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:29,531
Stop here.

108
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:38,291
Sir, if you wanted to come here,

109
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:43,370
there was a faster and cheaper route we could have taken.

110
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:46,590
It's fine.

111
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,801
It is?

112
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,051
It's fine. It's fine.

113
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,181
What?

114
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:56,070
Keep the meter running.

115
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:56,931
What?

116
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:58,670
Once we conclude...

117
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,010
...our business...

118
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:02,920
...we will return.

119
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:03,861
What?

120
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:06,020
The door.

121
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:06,941
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:17,100
At first I thought they'd skipped out on their fare, but they paid me later.

123
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,871
Where did the brothers in sunglasses go after getting off?

124
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:25,881
They climbed those stone steps down to the riverbank.

125
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:35,391
This must be the great detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei's sleeping deduction!

126
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:42,270
"Why did those strange brothers in sunglasses take a long route

127
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:45,940
to come to this parking lot and climb those steps to the embankment?"

128
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,640
He must be solving the case right now!

129
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:50,781
Oh, he's so cool!

130
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:56,141
I love the great detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei.

131
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:06,291
Open the door! Open this door!

132
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:14,871
Great detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

133
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:17,701
What's that sound?

134
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,480
Probably drum practice for the Ghost Chimney Festival.

135
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,461
Ghost Chimney Festival?

136
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:26,941
I knew it.

137
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:45,570
Before the war, in this place stood some large "Ghost Chimneys"

138
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:50,210
that produced smoke in a variety of colors.

139
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:54,350
They were destroyed in the war, and now this place is a park.

140
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:58,820
But the people of Birinmon City, nostalgic for the Ghost Chimneys,

141
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:01,221
starting holding the Ghost Chimney Festival.

142
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,411
There are shops, too.

143
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:09,200
Due to Halloween's influence, they sell ghost costumes and products.

144
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,891
The festival is a huge hit.

145
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,240
It was posted online,

146
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:19,840
and ghost-lovers from not just Japan but all over the world come.

147
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,981
Sounds like a lot of people.

148
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:29,311
That's why the Ghost Chimney Festival's executive committee headquarters got a big safe.

149
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,931
Executive Committee Headquarters

150
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,941
What happens to the money they collect in the safe?

151
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,571
The bank sends a collection car to come get it.

152
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:01,010
The bank's collection car?

153
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,031
This.

154
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:09,581
It's a flier for traffic restrictions on the day of the Ghost Chimney Festival.

155
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:16,341
The stalls close at 3PM, so the collection car comes around four.

156
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,721
Where can cars be parked in this area?

157
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,971
Just those two coin-operated parking lots.

158
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:29,071
I see. So that's how it is.

159
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:33,071
All better...

160
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:37,281
The great detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

161
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:41,950
Sensei, why did those strange brothers in sunglasses

162
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:46,911
take the long way around to this park?

163
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,230
Tell me what you've deduced, Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

164
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,360
Well...

165
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,421
Well?

166
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:59,410
The strange brothers in sunglasses were holding an endurance contest.

167
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,980
Endurance contest?

168
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,951
To see who could hold going to the bathroom longer.

169
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:07,280
I see!

170
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:09,960
Impressive as always, Great Detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

171
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:10,691
Clap, clap!

172
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,331
Clap, clap!

173
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:20,600
I know how the brothers in sunglasses took the long way around

174
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,121
by taxi on their way back.

175
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,361
What?

176
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:21,106
Ghost Chimney Festival

177
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:32,056
Armadillo-kun! Where are you? Hey!

178
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:35,406
Armadillo-kun!

179
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:41,066
Damn it. I'll find the barmaid's pet Armadillo-kun.

180
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:50,956
Huh?

181
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:54,436
Four eyes, where did he go?

182
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,815
He must've headed to the shops.

183
00:14:57,816 --> 00:15:00,285
Did Ran give him some spending money?

184
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:01,716
That brat...

185
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:12,036
This is the only place where cars can park near the festival grounds.

186
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:16,726
The bank's collection car parks here,

187
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,956
and the security guards go to the grounds to collect the money.

188
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:27,006
During that time, the brothers in sunglasses parked their own car in the adjacent space.

189
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:34,746
When the security guards returned after collecting the money...

190
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,756
They stole the money and fled.

191
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:43,756
Finders keepers!

192
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:04,116
Up!

193
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:05,266
Heave, ho!

194
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:08,476
It's not them.

195
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:19,926
The brothers in sunglasses won't be able to park their car here.

196
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,216
Where will they park instead?

197
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,526
There.

198
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,186
Finders keepers!

199
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:42,486
It's the only way.

200
00:16:43,596 --> 00:16:47,646
3PM. The shops should close soon.

201
00:16:57,836 --> 00:17:00,706
4PM. It's about time.

202
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,496
They're here.

203
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:27,046
The brothers' car should show up soon.

204
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:34,916
Huh?

205
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:37,616
Hey, Armadillo-kun!

206
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,126
The old man?

207
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:41,626
Armadillo-kun, where are you?

208
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,876
Armadillo-kun?

209
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:46,256
It's them!

210
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:52,426
Only brothers could achieve such impressive harmony.

211
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,306
It's a robbery!

212
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:56,606
Catch those men!

213
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,496
Huh?

214
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:04,146
Kid!

215
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:09,656
Damn! Their plan was to disguise themselves as the agents from the start and steal the money!

216
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:23,566
I know their escape route.

217
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:21,136
After that car!

218
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,146
I don't know what's going on, but...

219
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,286
Birinmon Fish Market

220
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:02,556
What's going on?

221
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:10,896
Damn you!

222
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,156
Take this!

223
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:17,666
Take this!

224
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,606
Armadillo-kun.

225
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:57,925
After picking him up at the Birinmon Fish Market,

226
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:00,485
the two of us

227
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:06,996
used Armadillo-kun to stop the bank's collection car

228
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:15,506
and hijack it!

229
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:21,516
They sneeze normally.

230
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,565
Thank you for waiting.

231
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:57,526
I found your missing pet Armadillo-kun.

232
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:02,606
Thank you, great detective Mori Kogoro-sensei.

233
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:05,656
But this isn't an ordinary pet.

234
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:06,976
What?

235
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:08,906
Not an ordinary pet?

236
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:17,666
I'm going to have Armadillo-kun earn money for me as an animal actor.

237
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:26,176
What?!

238
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:30,015
Why not team up with him, Mori-sensei?

239
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:32,196
No, thank you!

240
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:35,525
Oh, there he goes again!

241
00:23:35,526 --> 00:23:38,355
Mori-sensei, catch him!

242
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:40,026
No way!

243
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:42,496
Armadillo Kogoro...
