1
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:05,264
Conan!

2
00:00:05,264 --> 00:00:06,564
Ai!

3
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:07,864
Dr. Agasa!

4
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:11,664
Fantastic!

5
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:13,864
It's monster Gomera.

6
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:14,964
Beautiful.

7
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,864
It's sure made superbly.

8
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:20,264
It seems like their putting a lot of work into it this year.

9
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:21,664
Of course.

10
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:25,064
"Mika Itakura (27)" -It's been a long time, Dr. Agasa.

11
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:26,964
Mika.

12
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:30,464
All of you, she's Ms. Mika Itakura

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,164
who invited us here.

14
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:35,264
She's the executive chairperson of this festival.

15
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:37,764
Welcome to the Ice Festival.

16
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:39,264
Are you all enjoying yourselves?

17
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:40,564
Yes!

18
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:45,664
The two over there don't look too happy though.

19
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:46,664
Not true.

20
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,164
We are.

21
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:50,964
Ai is sort of a little snobbish at times, right?

22
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:53,264
Conan is sassy.

23
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:57,864
They both lack child like characteristics.

24
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:59,564
Oh, really?

25
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,264
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

26
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,464
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

27
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:08,164
The Ice Hotel where even the beds are made of ice.

28
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:10,064
What is the trick of the locked door murder?

29
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:11,664
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:13,764
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:16,264
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:02:56,493 --> 00:03:01,793
"Unsolvable Ice Trap"

33
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:06,193
I've been friends with Mika's father from long before.

34
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:09,393
My father used to be the village head for this village before.

35
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:13,693
I'm sorry about your father, though.

36
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,993
Yes, well...

37
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:18,293
You mean your father...

38
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:20,993
e died of a traffice accident last year.

39
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:24,093
The brakes of the car he was driving malfunctioned.

40
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:30,393
What the... What's with that man?

41
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:33,393
Mr. Shiota.

42
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,793
Super cool!

43
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,493
Mr. Shiota is a great ice sculptor

44
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,693
who has credits of winning first prize at world tournaments.

45
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:59,093
-Awesome! -Awesome...

46
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:00,193
"Tetsuya Shiota (43)" -Thank you.

47
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:03,693
Comments straightforward like yours make me happiest.

48
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,993
Almost all the sculptures here

49
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:08,393
are made by Mr. Shiota.

50
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:11,993
I was able to become a sculptor

51
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:15,293
only thanks to the support I received from Mika's father.

52
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:17,393
This is just a little token of my appreciation.

53
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:19,193
Mr. Shiota.

54
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,193
Besides, I didn't make it all by myself.

55
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:25,693
I made it along with all the people of the village.

56
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:29,093
It sure looks as if the whole village cooperated.

57
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:32,293
Yes, everybody loves this festival.

58
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:36,193
Well, it'll all end this year though.

59
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,293
Village head, Mr. Yamaguchi.

60
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:41,193
"It'll end this year", just what does that mean?

61
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,993
"Taro Yamaguchi(61)" -I'm saying that this year is the last

62
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,293
we'll see of a worthless festival like this.

63
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,293
What?

64
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,793
That's something only you alone have decided, isn't it?

65
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:52,093
Now that's not pleasant to the ears.

66
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:55,393
"Kazuyuki Ogi (34)" -It was decided at the village assembly.

67
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:57,193
After all...

68
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:59,693
Just because we continued this festival,

69
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:02,193
God knows how much burden it put on the finances of this village

70
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:04,493
and threw us into the red?

71
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:06,493
In order for this village to make it through,

72
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:10,793
there's no other choice than bring the Tohto Resort Hotel here.

73
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:14,493
And, thanks to the Ice Hotels that you built,

74
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,593
everything went well.

75
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:17,593
Yes.

76
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:21,693
The people of Tohto Resort really loved it.

77
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,193
Well, really go for it this time,

78
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:27,993
so as to decorate the end of all this.

79
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,793
Tomorrow, I'll be signing a contract with Tohto Resort.

80
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:34,693
So now, the financial rut of this village will be saved.

81
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:36,293
It's something that the previous village head, Mr. Itakura

82
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:37,693
never could've done.

83
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:38,893
To be honest,

84
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:41,993
it was good that he crossed over.

85
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:43,293
What a thing to say!

86
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,993
You're the one who killed him!

87
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,393
How dare you say that!

88
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,293
Not that again.

89
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:51,293
The police even said that it was an accident, didn't they?

90
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:54,893
But, father left saying that he was going to see you.

91
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:56,293
He couldn't have possibly gotten into an accident

92
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:57,593
in a remote rural place like that.

93
00:05:57,593 --> 00:06:00,293
Who I didn't see, I didn't see!

94
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:07,393
The main gate?

95
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:12,793
Cancel! Cancel the festival!

96
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:14,793
With the main gate the way it is,

97
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,493
we couldn't possibly continue.

98
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:18,693
I'll bet you did this?

99
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,593
In order to cancel the festival.

100
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:22,993
Enough! I don't have to do something like this,

101
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:25,093
because it's not going to be after this year anyway.

102
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,293
Hurry up and clean it up!

103
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:28,393
The festival is cancelled!

104
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:30,793
No, it won't be cancelled.

105
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:33,793
I'll fix it up by morning!

106
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,893
You don't have anything against that, do you?

107
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:41,193
Mika, you'll help me, won't you?

108
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,193
Yes!

109
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:50,393
Mr. Agasa, we'll take things from here,

110
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:52,093
so please go ahead and rest.

111
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:53,593
No, but...

112
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:55,193
Yes, please do so.

113
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:58,893
Besides, I'd like children to stay over at the Ice Hotel too.

114
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:02,093
-Ice Hotel? -Ice Hotel?

115
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:03,493
It's the hotel, right?

116
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:04,793
That's right.

117
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:08,093
The Ice Hotel is something that Mr. Shiota proposed

118
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,093
to heighten excitement for the festival.

119
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:13,393
But, that actually worked against me.

120
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,293
What do you mean?

121
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:18,593
It's true that the village is in grave financial trouble.

122
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:20,493
Therefore, the village head is planning

123
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,893
to call the Tohto Resort Hotel people over.

124
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:25,893
But, since there's nothing really attractive about this village,

125
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:28,793
they didn't really give a good answer.

126
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:34,093
However, the Ice Hotel that we made caught the village head's eyes.

127
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:36,393
So he used it to continue negotiations of them coming over

128
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:38,793
and captured their interest.

129
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,693
The Ice Hotel that I made for the festival,

130
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:46,093
ironically helped in driving the festival to end.

131
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:49,293
I shouldn't have made something like that.

132
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,693
Please don't say that.

133
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:54,593
That Ice Hotel is our pride and joy.

134
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:57,293
See, please take a look at it to all or you.

135
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:04,393
It's fantastic.

136
00:08:04,393 --> 00:08:05,393
It's splendid.

137
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,893
Is that all made of ice?

138
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:08,993
That's right!

139
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:12,593
Won't we freeze sleeping in a place like this?

140
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,793
There's animal fur on the bed

141
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:17,193
and if you sleep in the sleeping bag, you'll be fine.

142
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:22,393
Can't you even estimate something of this level?

143
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:26,293
When on earth are you going to become a full-fledged worker,

144
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:28,693
you good-for-nothing!

145
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:30,193
I... I'm sorry.

146
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,593
Go and fix it by morning.

147
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,193
Darn old fart.

148
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:39,693
Who the heck does he think he is?

149
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,493
Is the village head going to stay over here too?

150
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,693
Yeah, before the contract with Tohto Resort

151
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:55,693
he says he's going to confirm how it feels to sleep here.

152
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:58,893
So, the dome that you're sleeping in is this way.

153
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:02,693
This is fantastic!

154
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,093
It's super fluffy!

155
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,793
This sort of looks like a coffin.

156
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,193
What good taste, no?

157
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:20,793
Then, rest well, okay?

158
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,193
Yes!

159
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,793
It's cold.

160
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:05,593
I wonder if the gate's fixed already?

161
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:08,293
I'm sure it'll be okay, because everybody was helping.

162
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:11,893
I'm sure a fantastic one is being made.

163
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:15,393
-I'm excited. -What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

164
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:18,993
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko? Are you hungry?

165
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,393
-The thing is... -Village head!

166
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:23,493
Please get a hold of yourself! Village head!

167
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:28,893
What's the matter?

168
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:31,093
The village head...

169
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:36,993
This is...

170
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,493
It's burnt?

171
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,093
A strangulation mark.

172
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:46,993
But, this bed...

173
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,493
Something about it is...

174
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:51,393
Conan?

175
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:53,193
Call the police!

176
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:55,193
The village head's dead.

177
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:01,585
The cause of death is strangulation.

178
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:04,685
The estimated time of death...

179
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,485
"Inspector Haraguchi (31)" -is around 2:00 am?

180
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:07,485
Judging from the fact

181
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:09,385
that there are no traces of strangulation on the back of his neck,

182
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,785
it is thought that the culprit attacked the victim while asleep

183
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:14,585
using a narrow string as a weapon

184
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:17,385
and pushed it against his neck from on top the sleeping bag.

185
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,285
It bothers me that the neck part of the sleeping bag

186
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:21,585
has a string-like burn mark on it.

187
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,185
Are you saying that I killed him?

188
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,285
It's a fact that I suspected the village head

189
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,485
to be responsible for my father's death but,

190
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:29,585
that doesn't mean that I'd...

191
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:31,285
But...

192
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:33,085
it seems that you had a pretty violent argument with him

193
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:35,785
about the festival too, didn't you?

194
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:37,185
That's...

195
00:11:37,185 --> 00:11:40,685
What happened to your hand?

196
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,185
I burned myself last night when I was working

197
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:46,685
and mistakenly touched the barrel with fire.

198
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,885
You burned yourself.

199
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:50,485
To tell you the truth,

200
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:53,185
there was a burn mark on the village head's sleeping bag.

201
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:54,785
Just what're you trying to get at?

202
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:59,585
She was working with us all last night fixing the gate.

203
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:04,285
She would've had no time to kill the village head.

204
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:05,985
All night through?

205
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:10,085
I left to go get some tools twice,

206
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:13,285
but there are many other witnesses.

207
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:15,285
I see.

208
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:16,685
By the way, Mr. Shiota,

209
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,685
what time did you leave the workshop?

210
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:21,785
About 12 midnight and 4:00 a.m.

211
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:23,585
I left only for about 10 minutes both times.

212
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:25,685
Officer.

213
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:28,985
It seems that the entrance was locked,

214
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:31,785
but how did the culprit get inside?

215
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,485
I'm sure there's a spare key.

216
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,485
Mr. Ogi, the village head's secretary has one.

217
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:38,085
It's a specially made key,

218
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:41,685
so only two could be mad, including the master key.

219
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:43,885
Why do you have the spare key?

220
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:47,885
I was in charge of waking him up in the morning.

221
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:49,085
That's why...

222
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,285
In other words, after the village head locked the entrance,

223
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:56,285
the only one who could go in and out of the dome was you?

224
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:57,785
Hey...

225
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:01,285
Where you last night at around 2:00 am?

226
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:03,685
I was at the village office making documents.

227
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:06,485
Is there anyone who can verify that for you?

228
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,085
I was alone.

229
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:10,185
But, I didn't do it.

230
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:11,385
It's true.

231
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:16,185
Mr. Ogi was the only one who had the spare key.

232
00:13:16,185 --> 00:13:17,685
Nor, does he have an alibi.

233
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:20,385
But, I wonder if he'd commit the crime

234
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:22,485
knowing that he'd be the most suspected?

235
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:26,385
What's that hole?

236
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:28,085
Come to think of it, that bed...

237
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,885
there's something strange about it.

238
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:32,885
Did you find something?

239
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,685
Yeah, there's a strange hole here...

240
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:36,885
Trying to get all the credit again!

241
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:38,885
We've got to cooperate in the investigation too...

242
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,485
Hey, are you all right?

243
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:44,585
Really, it's dangerous to run.

244
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:47,785
But, I wonder why ice is so slippery?

245
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,785
It's not the ice that's slippery, it's the water!

246
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:52,085
Water?

247
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,885
Because ice has the characteristic of melting

248
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:55,985
when pressure is applied to it.

249
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:59,585
See! The weight of your body is on your feet, right?

250
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:02,385
So, that's why ice melts?

251
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:03,685
Exactly.

252
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:06,785
And because of that water, friction weakens,

253
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:08,985
making it slippery.

254
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:12,685
But, there's no water anywhere.

255
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,385
That's because when the pressure disappears,

256
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,585
it naturally goes back to ice...

257
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:17,785
Wait a second.

258
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:19,485
Maybe this hole...

259
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:23,385
Mitsuhiko, what is it?

260
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:25,185
You don't look too well.

261
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:27,285
To tell the truth, I saw it...

262
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,185
What did you see?

263
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:31,385
The village head's ghost.

264
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:35,685
It was around 4:00 this morning.

265
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,585
On my way back from the restroom.

266
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:39,985
It's cold.

267
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:50,785
A willo-the-wisp was flying around the village head's dome!

268
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:52,585
-No joke! -No!

269
00:14:53,585 --> 00:14:54,885
So that's it.

270
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:57,385
That's the story.

271
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:59,185
That's why I'm telling you, it's not me!

272
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:02,185
-Please believe me! -Well, you can tell us the details at the station.

273
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:03,585
Hold it there.

274
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:09,085
I've finally figured it out, the truth of the case.

275
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:10,885
Truth or no truth,

276
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:13,985
the only one who was able to go in the dome was Mr. Ogi.

277
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:16,085
He didn't have to go in!

278
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:21,285
The weapon choked the village head's neck on its own.

279
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:24,185
Hey!

280
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:25,385
Conan!

281
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:27,185
We found it.

282
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:32,885
What are you planning to start with something like that?

283
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:34,085
Oh, well...

284
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:38,185
You're going to explain the trick, right?

285
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:41,185
That's right, I'm explaining the trick.

286
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:43,985
That pillar of ice in the dome

287
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,285
where the village head was found dead.

288
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:49,285
The PET bottle and string are the weapons that killed him.

289
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,085
Watch closely, okay?

290
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:06,285
The string.

291
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,285
The string's going inside?

292
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:11,985
When pressure is applied to ice, it melts.

293
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:14,385
It's true that the string is going in on its own.

294
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:17,685
But, I wonder if things would work out all that well?

295
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,085
Won't there be traces of the ice having melted?

296
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:22,985
There's no need to worry about that.

297
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:25,685
Watch closely the part that has melted.

298
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:29,885
True.

299
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,285
It's frozen again!

300
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:32,685
This is?

301
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:35,085
I see, regelation.

302
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,285
Oh, well...

303
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:38,585
Melted ice immediately freezes back to its normal state

304
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:41,785
when pressure is removed.

305
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:45,285
The culprit, waited until the village head fell asleep

306
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:49,085
and set that trick up outside the dome.

307
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:52,385
This way, he could kill the village head

308
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:55,085
no matter where he was.

309
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:58,085
If so, the most suspicious person would be...

310
00:16:58,085 --> 00:16:59,285
Please wait.

311
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,985
She didn't have time to get rid of the weapon.

312
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:05,385
Did she need time to do that?

313
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,085
Just what are you talking about?

314
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:09,085
Mika is a woman.

315
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:11,885
In order for her to carry away a weight as heavy as to kill a person,

316
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,085
she would need a lot of time.

317
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:15,885
What if she didn't carry anything?

318
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:19,285
Hey, Conan! Is... is this okay?

319
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,285
Yeah.

320
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:26,085
That's the weight that the culprit used!

321
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:30,485
This is... Glass!

322
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,385
On first glance, you wouldn't be able to tell whether it's ice or not.

323
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:37,685
And, you can leave it behind at the site.

324
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:40,785
All that needs to be done later is to pull the string out of the dome...

325
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,285
It won't come off!

326
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:48,285
Of course it won't, because it's frozen.

327
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:51,885
Then, this trick won't do.

328
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:55,485
That's why the culprit used this.

329
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:59,085
I see. All he needed to do was burn the string.

330
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:03,185
That's why the village head's sleeping bag was burnt.

331
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:07,785
But, will a string that is in ice burn so easily?

332
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,185
It will!

333
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:13,185
Sonny, will this do?

334
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,085
Yes, thank you.

335
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:17,985
This magnesium ribbon was used, right?

336
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:19,585
Oh, I see.

337
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:24,485
If so, even if it's inside ice it'll burn violently.

338
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:31,785
So, this is the identity of the willow-the-wisp I saw.

339
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:35,085
So, this was why the sleeping bag was burnt.

340
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:39,185
This is

341
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,485
It's a chemical compound that is created

342
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:44,985
when magnesium is burned, magnesium oxide.

343
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,785
If you check, there should be the same thing

344
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:48,785
inside the dome too.

345
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:51,285
-Get the forensics! -Yes, sir!

346
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:54,585
If so, it wouldn't take five minutes to put everything away, would it?

347
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:56,085
But, I didn't...

348
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,985
Right. You're not the culprit, Mika.

349
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,285
But...

350
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:03,785
In order to carry out this trick successfully,

351
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,985
you'd have to determine the position the village head would sleep in,

352
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:11,085
because you can't tell in what position the bed is, from outside.

353
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,485
True. But, then...

354
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,985
The only person that has means to know this is...

355
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:22,585
the person who design this Ice Hotel, you, Mr. Shiota!

356
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:25,385
No.

357
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:27,885
Please wait.

358
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:29,385
Although I'm the one who designed this hotel,

359
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,785
I had no way of knowing where the village head would be sleeping.

360
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,585
The size of the bed in the VIP room

361
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:36,285
was the exact fit for the village head.

362
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:38,185
I thought it was strange,

363
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,585
that the dome being as large as it was,

364
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:41,885
the bed was a bit too small.

365
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:47,285
That bed was made to fit the small framed body of the village head.

366
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:50,385
Proof, do you have proof?

367
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:53,185
The proof is the white powder

368
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,185
that is on Mr. Shiota's sleeve.

369
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:58,185
That got on when he burned the weapon.

370
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:00,685
That's probably magnesium oxide.

371
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:04,385
Mr. Shiota, please say something.

372
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:05,785
It's okay already, Mika.

373
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,085
I thought that it'd work out okay.

374
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,985
Mr. Shiota.

375
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:14,685
Mr. Shiota why did you kill the village head?

376
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:18,685
I heard the conversation of the two.

377
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:22,785
It was the other day,

378
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,885
when I went to the village office to do something...

379
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:29,385
Get the contract, no matter what it takes.

380
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:30,485
Yes, sir!

381
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:34,485
I can't go on covering up using village money anymore.

382
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:36,085
There's no guarantee that somebody like Itakura,

383
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:37,785
who found out would appear again.

384
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:39,285
Rest assured.

385
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,485
If something like that should happen,

386
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:42,385
I'll rig the car again.

387
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:44,885
Oh no!

388
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,585
Yamaguchi had been using up the expenses

389
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,985
for the festival from before.

390
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:51,185
And, they had the nerve to do what they did to Mr. Itakura

391
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,285
who found out about it.

392
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,485
No, that's...

393
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:57,285
It's best that you be honest about it.

394
00:20:57,285 --> 00:20:59,685
It can easily be checked.

395
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,385
Father...

396
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:05,085
Father's life was taken by scums like them.

397
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:07,885
Moreover, Mr. Shiota ended up using his Ice Hotel

398
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:10,585
as a tool to commit murder.

399
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:16,285
He did it to get a hold of an iron wall alibi for you, Mika.

400
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:18,585
-For me? -Right.

401
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,685
If the village head is killed,

402
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:23,485
the one that would be suspected most is you, Mika.

403
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:25,885
He made you an alibi

404
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,985
so that you wouldn't wrongfully be suspected.

405
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,385
Mr. Shiota.

406
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:32,785
Mr. Shiota's probably also the one who schemed it

407
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:34,485
so that the gate would collapse.

408
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,985
I wanted to protect you.

409
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:42,885
The one that Mr. Itakura loved the most...

410
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,885
Mika, you.

411
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:15,885
So, that festival ended up being cancelled after all.

412
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:17,485
It can't be helped,

413
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:20,085
because of what happened...

414
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:24,185
But, I'll do everything in my power to make it happen again.

415
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,285
For the sake of this village.

416
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:32,185
When that time comes, let us make ice sculptures too.

417
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:33,685
Hey, can you make any?

418
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,485
I've already made one!

419
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:38,785
What 's this?

420
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:41,385
Something Genta likes the most, right?

421
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,985
-Yes! -Don't tell me...

422
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:45,285
Yeah! It's eels over rice!

423
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,185
Are there eels inside?

424
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:58,685
Takagi, let's me and you join hands.

425
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:01,685
If we tell them that I, a civilian picked it up...

426
00:24:01,685 --> 00:24:03,185
Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma.

427
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:05,485
He's the one who dropped the bag, correct?

428
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:09,385
It wasn't there?

429
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:11,285
The trace of this paint...

430
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:14,085
But it doesn't work out that easily, does it?

431
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,585
If that culprit were to appear...

432
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:18,185
