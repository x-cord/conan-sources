1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,336
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:00,337 --> 00:00:01,735
Hongo...

3
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:03,635
I don't think I'm going to make it.

4
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,135
Don't be silly!

5
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:06,835
It'll be morning soon.

6
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:09,135
Then the rescue squad will be here too.

7
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:11,135
Never mind comforting me.

8
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,536
My left leg that the guys bit won't move.

9
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:20,435
Hongo, you go on alone.

10
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:22,935
How could I ever do that?

11
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:25,635
Look to the window.

12
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:29,035
You can't even see outside because of the zombies.

13
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:31,035
Carrying an injured person like me,

14
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:35,036
you don't have a chance to get through that.

15
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:40,035
But if you're alone,

16
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:44,135
you can survive using the Zombie Blade.

17
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:45,935
So, Hongo...

18
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:48,435
You gotta live!

19
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:53,536
You gotta live on and and avenge my death, please.

20
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:57,135
Hey...

21
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,935
-Isn't Hayato acting strange? -Hang in there, Hayato! I'll take you home

22
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,535
-Quiet and watch. -even if I have to drag you along!

23
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:04,036
Come, stand up! Hayato!

24
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:09,035
I told you.

25
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,635
Hayato?

26
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:11,835
No.

27
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:13,536
Hurry and get out of there!

28
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,835
No...

29
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:19,736
Hayato?

30
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:28,735
A canvas stained black with crime.

31
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:31,435
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

32
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:33,235
Horror movies that Ran doesn't like.

33
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:35,735
The filming site is even more frightening!

34
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:37,435
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:39,435
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:41,836
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:26,021
"The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 1)"

38
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,005
Hey...

39
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,705
Despite it being summer vacation, you looked bored,

40
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:39,905
so I decided to bring you along for a drive,

41
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:41,205
and you're yawning on me.

42
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:44,905
It's because you went and borrowed that scary rental DVD, right, Dad?

43
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:47,605
I couldn't get to sleep till morning because of it!

44
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,505
I couldn't do anything about it, could I?

45
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:52,505
It's a low budget rank C horror movie

46
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:56,605
They won't air it on TV even though Yoko's acting in it.

47
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:59,206
By the way, how's your stomach?

48
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,705
You kept repeating that you were hungry earlier.

49
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:06,705
I'm fine now.

50
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,505
Don't eat between meals!

51
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:12,305
The doctor told you that you've got too much visceral fat!

52
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:13,605
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:16,206
And, where are we headed?

54
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:20,806
You'll find out when we get there!

55
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:25,405
Wait, isn't this...

56
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:29,405
the rental villa that we saw in the zombie movie last night?

57
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:32,305
Yeah! We're so-called pilgrims visiting a holy place.

58
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,705
Don't you know?

59
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,805
Fans go visiting locations used in movies and TV shows!

60
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:41,806
I do, but they're usually great memorable scenes...

61
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:46,705
This is the front door where Yoko coughed up blood!

62
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:50,905
That's the window Yoko kicked the zombie out of!

63
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:53,505
One treasure after another!

64
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,505
Hey, Conan.

65
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:57,305
Doesn't this forest seem like

66
00:04:57,306 --> 00:05:00,305
there could actually be zombies out there?

67
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:01,805
Don't worry!

68
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:03,405
Zombies won't appear.

69
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,605
It seems zombies do appear.

70
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,505
I tell you, they won't.

71
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,505
They appeared?

72
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:11,505
Hattori and Kazuha!

73
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,005
What brings you here?

74
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:17,005
There obviously here on a pilgrimage like me!

75
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,505
No, we're not, idiot!

76
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:22,805
Well, it's true that we're here on related business though.

77
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,205
What do you mean?

78
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:28,905
Well... There was this idiot couple that came here on pilgrimage.

79
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:31,505
They both went around checking out the rental villas.

80
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:34,005
When they started their car in order to head home,

81
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:36,705
something suddenly dashed out in front of their car

82
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,505
and they ran over it.

83
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:42,305
They thought it was an animal, so they got off the car to confirm,

84
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:45,605
but when they opened the door, they smelled rotten flesh,

85
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:50,105
so they looked under the car and it came crawling out.

86
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:54,206
A zombie with a broke neck wearing tattered clothes.

87
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:57,905
What happened to the couple after that?

88
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:00,005
-They got out of there as fast as they could -Let's go home.

89
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:03,205
and told their acquaintance Mr. Otaki about it.

90
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:06,605
-And he told me about it. -Let's go home.

91
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:07,805
Let's go home.

92
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:10,105
Well, I'm sure it's just a prank

93
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,905
-some idiot's pulling off, though. -Let's go home.

94
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:14,005
Let's go home and get out of this place!

95
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,305
What with you?

96
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,005
We just got here.

97
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:21,105
Besides, "Zombie Blade: Dinner Party of the Dead"

98
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:23,305
the movie we watched last night, has a cult following.

99
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,905
It's rumored that a sequel will be made,

100
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:29,805
so this villa may be used again.

101
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,805
Well, I'm not sure if they'll be making it.

102
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,405
There'll be a sequel.

103
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,605
What?

104
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:39,705
After all, we're here to shoot the trailer.

105
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,305
Excuse me...

106
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,605
Who are you?

107
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:46,405
"Tetsuto Naito (38)" -I'm Testuto Naito, director of "Zombie Blade".

108
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,105
If you're here to shoot the trailer,

109
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:52,405
does that mean you've got tons of crew packed in the back of your car?

110
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:53,705
Yeah.

111
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,605
The lead actress too?

112
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:56,806
Of course!

113
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:01,206
She's our lead actress, Ria!

114
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:05,905
It's not Yoko?

115
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,705
It's a sequel, isn't it.

116
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:11,205
Yes. I've known Yoko since she debuted,

117
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:14,305
so she appeared in the first one for the sake of our friendship but...

118
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,505
"Ria Kawabata (29)" -What's with this old man?

119
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:19,005
Don't you like the idea that I'm starring in the movie?

120
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,105
I don't like it at all.

121
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:24,605
Hey, isn't that Ria Kawabata?

122
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:27,205
The one that appears a lot in suspense dramas?

123
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:31,005
Well, Yoko actually said she wanted to appear,

124
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:35,005
"Takashi Harawaki (30)" -but her agency wouldn't let her.

125
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:42,705
So I convinced her, my friend, to star in this rank C movie.

126
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:44,605
I wish you'd stop saying rank C.

127
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:46,705
I hope you're going to film it properly?

128
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,305
Don't worry.

129
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:51,905
Since we're old friends, I'll make sure you look good.

130
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,805
"Kyoko Ejiri (30)" -Especially the scene where you're bitten by a zombie

131
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,305
and become one yourself.

132
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:58,305
There's no such scene, Kyoko!

133
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:00,805
Oh, really?

134
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:03,405
This movie is about the cousin of Yoko Hongo,

135
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:06,405
the role that Yoko Okino is playing, Reina Kazama,

136
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:09,205
"Orie Baisho (29)" -who inherited the Zombie Blade

137
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:12,605
and exterminating zombies.

138
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,805
That's what was written in the script, right?

139
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:18,305
So, there's no way that Ria would become a zombie!

140
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:20,105
But I...

141
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:23,605
"Masahaschi Ninomiya (29)" -I like that kind of bad twists too.

142
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,705
No...

143
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,105
This is not some school festival movie, you know,

144
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,005
so we can't keep changing the story!

145
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:33,006
But he would have.

146
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,405
That's right.

147
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:41,705
I'm sure he would have favored a crazy story

148
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:46,605
like the starring actress turning into a zombie

149
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:51,005
who massacres friend or foe in a bloody battle!

150
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,705
But, well, forget it

151
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,105
because he's not around anymore

152
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:56,505
and the script is already completed.

153
00:08:56,506 --> 00:09:00,005
I even decided on the subtitle this morning,

154
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,405
have it in an envelope and like always.

155
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:05,406
I'll announce it later, so wait a little while more.

156
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,505
Who's this "he"?

157
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:13,605
He's the president of our university horror research club.

158
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:19,606
Aside from the director, we're all former members of the club.

159
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,605
Then, shall we go inside and start filming?

160
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,805
-Yes. -May...

161
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:30,005
May I go inside with you too?

162
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,705
Dad!

163
00:09:31,706 --> 00:09:34,305
I'm sorry but you can't watch us.

164
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:36,805
We can't have noise.

165
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:39,305
No, it's not that I want to watch.

166
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:42,906
I... I need to go to the restroom.

167
00:09:48,106 --> 00:09:49,505
What's wrong?

168
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,605
You look like a zombie.

169
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:54,105
Maybe he ate something bad?

170
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:57,205
But we all ate the same breakfast.

171
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:59,805
And we're fine, right?

172
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:01,205
Come to think of it, Dad,

173
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:04,005
on our way here you said you had to go to the restroom

174
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:05,805
and went into the forest, right?

175
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,405
I'm sure he got stung by some insect at that time then!

176
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:10,905
I wasn't stung.

177
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:13,805
I was a bit hungry

178
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:17,005
so I took a bite of this delicious looking mushroom

179
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:18,405
that was growing in the forest.

180
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:20,605
That's a moon night mushroom!

181
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:23,605
It may be delicious but it's poison mushroom.

182
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:26,205
What?

183
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,905
We're going to be filming,

184
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:31,205
so please keep the noise down.

185
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,806
Okay.

186
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:38,205
But is he really going to be okay?

187
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:40,805
Yeah if he rests for a while.

188
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,105
People rarely die eating moon night mushrooms.

189
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:49,805
Well, we could take him to the hospital on my motorbike,

190
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:53,905
but he probably can't hang onto me till the hospital.

191
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,805
If you that worried,

192
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:59,205
maybe we should ask one of the staff to drive him to the hospital?

193
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,805
I guess so.

194
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:03,505
Hey, Ran, come!

195
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:06,905
They said so long as we keep quiet, we can watch them.

196
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,405
Don't you want to watch them filming?

197
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,005
What? But...

198
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:11,006
Let's go...

199
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:14,305
There's no point in us staying here.

200
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,405
Dad, we'll be gone for a while,

201
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,206
but stay quietly in bed, okay?

202
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:29,005
This is the sword that Yoko was talking about.

203
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:32,606
The cursed sword that turns zombies that touch it into ashes.

204
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:36,906
The Zombie Blade!

205
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:40,406
What?

206
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,605
What is this feeling?

207
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:45,606
Like something is entering my body.

208
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,806
-Cut! -Cut!

209
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:56,205
There was no noise.

210
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:59,405
The way the sword glowed was good too!

211
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:01,705
Director, the video is perfect too, no?

212
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:02,706
Yeah.

213
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,305
That was super intense!

214
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,205
Really! It was fantastic!

215
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:09,505
I can't wait to see how it'll turn out and want to go see the movie!

216
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:13,305
I really don't have to go watch it.

217
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:15,905
We'll have to wait till sundown for the rest of the scenes,

218
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:18,405
so although it's a bit early, shall we have dinner?

219
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,705
Yes, I guess so.

220
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,405
Okay then. Ninomiya, will you go get the food out of the car?

221
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:26,405
Okay.

222
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:29,205
Where is Harawaki?

223
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,505
This is strange.

224
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:34,105
He normally sticks around to complain about the shoot but...

225
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:36,405
Shall we go look for him?

226
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:40,105
He's probably somewhere inside this villa, right?

227
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,806
Yeah. Thanks.

228
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:44,005
But, with you around, Ria,

229
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:46,605
it really feels like we've gone back to our University days.

230
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:47,606
Really?

231
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:51,005
It'd be perfect if the president was here, though.

232
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:52,405
Yeah.

233
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:57,005
Well, but the president's older brother is shooting for us instead.

234
00:12:57,006 --> 00:13:00,505
So, I'm sure that the late president is happy too, won't he?

235
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:03,305
Hey. Where are you?

236
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:05,805
It seems they're all going to start having dinner.

237
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,205
Mr. Harawaki!

238
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,505
Geez. Maybe he's sleeping in one of the rooms?

239
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:12,605
Oh, well...

240
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:15,105
I guess we just gotta look into all the rooms then.

241
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,405
Yeah.

242
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:18,006
Mr. Harawaki...

243
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:23,605
Hey, you?

244
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:26,105
Are you okay?

245
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,605
Darn it! He's not breathing anymore.

246
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:32,705
What? He's holding something.

247
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:34,206
It's his cell phone.

248
00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:39,406
Moreover, take a look.

249
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,606
It's on record mode?

250
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:56,105
What? Harawaki's dead?

251
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:58,005
He swallowed poison?

252
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:59,205
Yeah.

253
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,505
The poison is hydrocyanic acid.

254
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,105
His mouth smelled like almonds.

255
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:06,405
Under the desk, there was a plastic bottle

256
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:09,705
and a bottle labeled potassium cyanide!

257
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:13,505
His jaws that were supposed to stiffen first are still soft,

258
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:18,105
and he had death spots too but haven't merged yet.

259
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:19,205
In other words,

260
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:22,905
his estimated time of death is around 30 minutes to an hour.

261
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:26,605
How do you know those things?

262
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,105
Who are you?

263
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:30,205
I'm Heiji Hattori.

264
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:32,605
In the Kansai area, I'm fairly well known as

265
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,305
the High School Detective of the West.

266
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:37,405
A high school detective?

267
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:41,105
If you're the west, is there a high school detective of the east?

268
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:43,005
Of course!

269
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,405
This boy that you see in front of you...

270
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:47,105
Hey?

271
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:51,205
knows him very well. A high school boy called Shinichi Kudo.

272
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:55,905
You know more about Shinichi, right, Ran?

273
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:57,205
Yep...

274
00:14:57,206 --> 00:15:01,005
Could it be that someone made him drink the poison?

275
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:03,905
No. Well it seems he drank it himself.

276
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:05,305
There was a video of it too.

277
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,405
Video?

278
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,505
Yeah.

279
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:11,505
Mr. Harawaki was found dead holding on to his cell phone.

280
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:13,805
And the video of him drinking the poison

281
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:17,206
and falling to the floor was in his cell phone.

282
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:23,905
It's really low angled, isn't it?

283
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,605
Yeah. It seems he propped the phone up on the floor

284
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,605
using a box of cigarettes.

285
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:33,305
The timer was set to automatically start recording after a while.

286
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:35,005
See. You can see it, right?

287
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:38,005
He's putting the poison inside the water of the plastic bottle.

288
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:41,805
Then, he drinks the poison in one gulp,

289
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,705
writhes in pain,

290
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:46,205
drops the bottle of poison and the plastic bottle on the floor,

291
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,305
staggers backwards,

292
00:15:48,306 --> 00:15:52,805
loses his balance in front of the cell phone that is on the floor.

293
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:54,705
And then, I don't know why

294
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:59,405
but he stretches his hand out and grabs the cell phone that is recording.

295
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:02,105
The cell phone falls to the floor and blacks out.

296
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:06,505
After this, the video's black for a while, but keeps on recording.

297
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:11,005
And about 50 minutes later, our voices are heard.

298
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:13,605
This means that the estimated time of death I mentioned earlier

299
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,205
-was more or less correct! -Hey, you? Are you okay?

300
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:18,905
Yeah. That's your voice, Heiji.

301
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:20,005
Right?

302
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:22,505
Darn it! He's not breathing anymore.

303
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:24,205
What?

304
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:26,605
Was that your voice just now, Conan?

305
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:28,905
It sort of sounded like Shinichi's.

306
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,605
This is bad!

307
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,405
He's copying me!

308
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:35,005
Since we're always getting involved in cases together,

309
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:38,706
he picked up my mannerisms without realizing it!

310
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:44,505
This kid really seems to look up to me, you see!

311
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:49,005
Yep. I want to be a detective like you, Heiji!

312
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:52,605
You two are really close like brothers!

313
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:56,205
I guess so.

314
00:16:56,206 --> 00:17:00,105
Hattori, nice follow, thanks.

315
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,205
You're a lifesaver.

316
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:05,005
Kudo.

317
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:07,705
This means you owe me one.

318
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:10,905
He still holding a grudge

319
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,006
against the recording of his confession to Kazuha.

320
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:19,505
But what did he take such a video for?

321
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,505
I don't know why yet,

322
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:24,805
but it's almost definitely suicide.

323
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:28,805
There was a memo in Mr. Harawaki's cell phone,

324
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:32,005
a creepy sentence that sounded like a will!

325
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:34,305
Creepy?

326
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:35,605
Sentence?

327
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:38,205
"To my old friend, Joji Naito."

328
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:45,105
"Though this poison will stop the beating of my heart and I will die,"

329
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:50,105
"my soul will remain in my body and gain an infinite amount of time."

330
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:55,305
"Just like the scenes of this film, "Funeral Procession of the Dead","

331
00:17:55,306 --> 00:18:00,605
"I shall invite the living in this house to join our world."

332
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:01,705
"Funeral..."

333
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,005
"Funeral Procession of the Dead"?

334
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,705
That's what was written on the paper

335
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:10,205
inside the envelope in Mr. Harawaki's pants pocket.

336
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:12,705
I think it's the subtitle for this movie.

337
00:18:12,706 --> 00:18:15,605
Because he was saying that he would announce it later.

338
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:18,905
Were the subtitles always decided on by Mr. Harawaki?

339
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:22,305
Yeah. He used to say it was a job for the producer.

340
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:26,005
He always decided on it alone, put it in a white envelope,

341
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:29,905
then opened it in front of the staff and announce it.

342
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:34,105
There was a time when Ninomiya mistakenly opened the envelope,

343
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:35,805
Harawaki was furious

344
00:18:35,806 --> 00:18:39,605
and went through the trouble of changing the subtitle.

345
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:42,705
Then, the sentence that was written in the cell phone

346
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,705
was probably written by Mr. Harawaki himself.

347
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:48,005
This paper is thick so that even if you put it up against the light,

348
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,305
you can't see through it.

349
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:53,205
There were no traces of the envelope being torn or wet either.

350
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:57,505
What bothers me more is what was written on the top of the sentence.

351
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:59,505
Joji Naito.

352
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,606
Who is he anyway?

353
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,005
Just before entering this rental villa,

354
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:13,605
we mentioned him once, right?

355
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:15,905
He was the president of the horror club

356
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,605
that we belonged to at the university!

357
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:23,805
And at the same time, he was my younger brother.

358
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:27,505
The way he died was really strange.

359
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:32,505
Maybe it influenced Harawaki.

360
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:36,605
And? How'd he die?

361
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:39,405
It was eight year ago,

362
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:44,905
we stayed here to film a horror movie for our school festival.

363
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:47,805
But Joji, our director and club president suddenly announced.

364
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,705
"Joji Naito" -A mystery!

365
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:53,305
Why don't we make this movie a mystery movie instead of a horror movie?

366
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:57,405
If we can only come up with mediocre movies because we're amateurs,

367
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:01,005
it's better to surprised the audience with a mystery!

368
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:04,205
There you go again with your crazy ideas.

369
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:07,305
There's not much time already before the school festival, you know?

370
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:11,005
We have to return the equipment we borrowed from your brother too.

371
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:14,705
You're the one who suggested we shoot a zombie movie, right?

372
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:17,205
It's not that there'll be no zombies.

373
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:19,605
The twist will be that the real murderer isn't a zombie,

374
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:23,705
but a living human!

375
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,305
If you think it's impossible,

376
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:28,105
I'll disappear from this room right now,

377
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:33,706
like a corpse that has returned to life as a zombie!

378
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:38,905
The president always had crazy ideas.

379
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:42,705
But they often made sense once he explained them to us.

380
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:46,505
So, we all went along with his idea.

381
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:49,405
Since he insisted, we wanted to see him do it!

382
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:50,805
I see.

383
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:52,705
And, how did it work out?

384
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:54,805
He told us to wait ten minutes.

385
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:58,605
So Ninomiya went outside to stand guard watching the window.

386
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:03,105
Harawaki, Kyoko and I stood in front of the door.

387
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:05,505
After ten minutes we re-entered the room,

388
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:08,205
we found that the president had really disappeared!

389
00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:10,205
He had completely vanished!

390
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:11,805
Did you look for him thoroughly?

391
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,305
Of course we did!

392
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:16,205
Under the bed and even in the wardrobe!

393
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:18,605
We even moved the wardrobe

394
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:20,905
to check if there was a hidden corridor behind it

395
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,805
that was connected to the room next door!

396
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:28,805
And we thought that maybe he went out through the window

397
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:32,005
while Ria and Ninomiya were going over to the window from outside.

398
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:34,605
So we searched the forest,

399
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:36,605
but he was nowhere in sight.

400
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:40,305
Since we were calling the president's name until our throats got parched,

401
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,605
we wanted to go get a beer.

402
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:44,105
So, we decide to forget the president for now

403
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:47,305
and go to town to drink some beer

404
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,405
on Harawaki's car!

405
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:54,605
Then Ria caught a cold and had to stay in bed for three days.

406
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:58,206
And when we returned to the villa on the morning of the fourth day,

407
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:02,005
he was there in that room.

408
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:05,205
His emaciated body sitting holding his knees in his hands!

409
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:09,305
His head was turned slightly as if he was saying,

410
00:22:09,306 --> 00:22:11,206
"You finally found me."

411
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,005
"Next Episode" -Why?

412
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,705
It's got to be somewhere.

413
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:48,805
It disappeared.

414
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:51,205
Just like the president did eight years ago,

415
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:54,405
he turned into a zombie and left the room!

416
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:55,705
No darn way!

417
00:23:55,706 --> 00:23:58,805
A dead person can never come back to life.

418
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,805
The corpse is gone.

419
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:05,806
There are zombies around the house.

420
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:12,206
Next Conan, "The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 2)"
