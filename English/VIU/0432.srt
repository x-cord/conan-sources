1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,049
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,849
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,449
Too absorbed in solving the case.

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,049
The incident and love affair take an unexpected turn.

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,949
Will you be able to do your thing today, Officer Takagi?

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,449
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,149
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,850
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,838
We coincidentally run into Officer Takagi and Officer Chiba

10
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:00,438
who were attending a social gathering.

11
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,238
However, in the midst of the gathering,

12
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,239
the cousin of one of the participants, Kouta, was kidnapped.

13
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,646
The kidnapper demands...

14
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:10,847
a million yen.

15
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:18,147
"Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 2)"

16
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:21,946
Ransom of a million yen.

17
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:24,946
Quite a small amount considering the outrageousness of the crime.

18
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:28,446
Yes. The culprit seems to be friends with Masashi

19
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:31,146
and he's probably taking his real financial situation into consideration.

20
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:32,546
Okay, got it.

21
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:36,246
I'll have investigators stakeout those three people's homes.

22
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:39,946
Kouta saw the live baseball game on March 26th.

23
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:42,346
The games during this time is either high school baseball

24
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,146
or the opening of professional baseball.

25
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:48,446
If we can figure out which game it was he referred to as boring that day,

26
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:51,046
we can probably figure out who the culprit by thinking out the time.

27
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,446
Yes, all right.

28
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:55,746
Officer Sato, I got it.

29
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:59,046
There was no professional baseball opening game that day,

30
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,846
but there were three high school games.

31
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,246
Then which of the three is it?

32
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:06,246
The score of the first game was 7 to 6.

33
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:09,546
This was a hot game with one come from behind victory after the other.

34
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,246
They played 12 extended games,

35
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:14,746
which took from 10am till 2pm.

36
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:17,146
The game is far from boring, is it?

37
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:18,846
I don't think so either.

38
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:21,546
The 2nd game ended...

39
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:22,946
at 4:30pm.

40
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:24,346
The score was 14 to 5.

41
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:27,446
One of the teams made one hit after the other and won a fantastic game.

42
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:31,246
It could be that game, because it's so one-sided and boring.

43
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,246
But the losing school

44
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,446
had a player who's gotten the attention of the professional leagues

45
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,746
who was at bats six times, hit six singles and two homeruns.

46
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:39,646
He's a great player.

47
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:40,647
What about the last one?

48
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:43,046
A competition of pitchers of a game scoring 1 to 2.

49
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:45,446
Both teams make it out of a pinch time and again.

50
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:48,746
Then in the bottom of the 9th inning, it is a game-ending homer.

51
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:51,646
The game ended at exactly 7:00pm.

52
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,246
This game is also interesting enough.

53
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:58,046
Maybe he was watching a baseball game

54
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:00,646
on a competing program in the same time slot?

55
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:04,146
You know, like on cable television and satellite broadcasts.

56
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:06,346
That's true.

57
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:10,146
Between 12pm to 1pm, there was a game on satellite broadcast.

58
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:12,046
A digest of a major league game.

59
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:16,046
From 3pm to 5pm was the "Falcons Road to Victory".

60
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,246
A re-run of last year's program on Nichiuri TV.

61
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:23,747
And on cable TV between 6pm to 7pm, was a special of player Kiyomatsu.

62
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:27,846
There's no way that the "Nice Game Selection" would be boring.

63
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,846
And "The Road to Victory" sounds like it should be interesting as it is.

64
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:35,646
Then could it be player Kiyomatsu's talk show?

65
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:37,946
Mother was watching that program.

66
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:41,346
It showed all of player Kiyomatsu's homeruns since his debut

67
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,646
and she said it was really good.

68
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,946
Then the only thing left is video tape.

69
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:49,646
The only thing thinkable is that he was watching video taped baseball game.

70
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,646
I don't think so.

71
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,346
Kouta told me that he turned the television on himself

72
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:55,646
with the remote controller.

73
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:59,646
In that case, maybe anticipating that Kouta would do that,

74
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,846
the culprit setup an unrelated baseball video earlier.

75
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,646
To hide what time it was.

76
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:05,946
Don't be silly.

77
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:08,546
Kouta's the one who's using the remote controller.

78
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:11,146
He would find out as soon as he changes the channel.

79
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:13,446
True.

80
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:19,246
Are you sure Kouta didn't tell you what time he went to the man's house?

81
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:23,646
No. It seems that the man strongly told Kouta not to tell anyone.

82
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:26,946
We somehow managed to get him tell us about the card that he received

83
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:29,146
as well as the fact that he was taken to the man's house.

84
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:33,746
Well, if the card that Kouta received was a rare Masked Yaiba card,

85
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:38,546
wouldn't Mr. Hikita, the modeler, be the most suspicious?

86
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:45,346
No. It may be a rare card, but it's sold for about 3,000 yen at stores

87
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:48,446
and can be bought by any adult.

88
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:53,846
It's far from the premium card that's selling for 800,000 yen.

89
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:59,646
I remember that Mr. Hikiya said that he sent you a card set,

90
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:03,546
but could a premium card have been inside the set?

91
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:06,046
Like I already said, it wasn't there.

92
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:11,346
Speaking of premium, Mr. Satsuka said he sent 30,000 yen to you by mail,

93
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:14,446
but could bills with matching numbers have been inside?

94
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:15,746
I wonder.

95
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:19,746
I don't really bother looking at the numbers on bills.

96
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:22,446
The same goes for the lottery tickets that Rokuda sent me.

97
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,147
I'm not interested in stuff like that.

98
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:27,146
Yes, it could be movies.

99
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:31,146
Maybe that baseball game was a scene in a movie or a drama?

100
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:33,446
Right. Could you check along that line?

101
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:36,946
Yes. Movies and dramas on that day are...

102
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:38,646
It's all love stories.

103
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,346
"Extramarital Affairs are Great".

104
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:43,646
One about an aristocratic group date, "Lovers Who Don't Jive".

105
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:47,446
One about lovers separating, "Fleeting Spring".

106
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:50,446
These are the programs that were aired that day.

107
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:53,247
I came for the food.

108
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,546
I came not knowing it was going to be a social gathering.

109
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:58,546
Unlike somebody I know.

110
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:01,246
Well, you see...

111
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:03,146
And what's with those clothes of yours?

112
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:04,746
Were you trying to show off?

113
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:08,746
Talk for yourself, Officer Sato. What's with the makeup?

114
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:09,946
This?

115
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:11,646
Yumi forced me to put makeup on!

116
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:13,046
Same with me!

117
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:14,946
Officer Chiba forced me, too.

118
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:17,546
Although it's not important at this point.

119
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:20,546
Right. It's not important.

120
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:23,347
Hey, what do you guys think you're doing?

121
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,847
Yes.

122
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,146
This is Megure. How are things?

123
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:35,146
Well, we can't seem to locate any boring game that was aired that day.

124
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:38,546
Hey. The officers are staking the houses of the three

125
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:40,946
and ready to storm in at any time.

126
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:43,647
The more time passes, the more the boy's life is in danger.

127
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,447
I'm back!

128
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:51,247
Kouta?

129
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:54,147
Are you all right?

130
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:55,846
Are you hurt?

131
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,946
Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:00,446
I was riding in the car of the man that I met the other day,

133
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,246
but I got tired and fell asleep.

134
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,446
Where does he live? Where is his apartment?

135
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,546
Who's this lady?

136
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:08,646
She's a police officer.

137
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,146
Please tell me, Kouta.

138
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:14,746
But I promised the man that I won't tell.

139
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:18,046
That man is a bad man who kidnapped you,

140
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,646
so please tell me!

141
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:20,647
But...

142
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:23,346
Who cares?

143
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:25,046
He's come home safely.

144
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,746
One of my friends played a prank after all.

145
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:31,246
Though the prank was in bad taste.

146
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:33,646
This is not something you can put aside as just a prank.

147
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,446
What's up? Is something wrong?

148
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:40,846
Well, the boy who was thought to have been kidnapped came home.

149
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,646
What? Don't tell me that you gave the 1 million yen?

150
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:46,846
No, the culprit hasn't contacted us at all yet.

151
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,847
Masashi doesn't even intend to hand over the money.

152
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:54,046
It's already late, Kouta.

153
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:56,746
Let's talk tomorrow. It's time to go to bed.

154
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:57,747
Okay.

155
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,147
Kouta.

156
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,846
What happened to your socks?

157
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,347
They look wet.

158
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:14,946
This?

159
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:21,046
I remembered that Masashi told me not to accept anything from strangers.

160
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:23,846
After saying goodbye to the man with the beard,

161
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:27,246
I went to give the card back to him.

162
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:29,946
But the man wasn't in the room

163
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,146
and a man that I didn't know was taking a bath.

164
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,247
A stranger in the bath tub?

165
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:39,846
So why don't we leave the rest to the police?

166
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,746
It's time for the sports news.

167
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,346
I'd like to see the results of the World Cup preliminaries.

168
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:46,746
May I watch the television for a while?

169
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:49,246
Yes, go right ahead.

170
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:53,646
Well, it's 0 to 0 and a draw, but it was a good game nonetheless!

171
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:55,746
What? It's 0 to 0.

172
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:58,446
I guess they did pretty good for an away from home game.

173
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:00,946
Scoreless draw.

174
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:04,146
I see. That's why Kouta...

175
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,447
He's the culprit after all.

176
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:23,221
Didn't I already tell you?

177
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,621
This is a stupid prank that one of my friends pulled off.

178
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:30,821
He probably just wanted to see me get all worked up by taking Kouta away.

179
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,721
Besides, Kouta is back, isn't he?

180
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:37,521
But on top of demanding a million yen,

181
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,121
the kidnapper sent mail saying,

182
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:42,021
"If you call the police, I'll kill Kouta."

183
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:46,421
This is obviously blackmail and cannot be overlooked as a simple prank.

184
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:49,021
Besides, it was your voice that was heard from the answer phone

185
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:50,421
of the culprit's home.

186
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:55,021
The suspects have been narrowed down to the three men that you called,

187
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,722
so we can't overlook this.

188
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:59,221
Come on, Kouta.

189
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:01,721
Let's go to the homes of the three men.

190
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:04,221
Even if the culprit were to have been under disguise,

191
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:07,221
if you go inside, you'd know whose room it is, won't you?

192
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:09,021
-But... -Hey!

193
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:10,921
I keep telling you it's okay already.

194
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:13,821
Don't tell me that when you went to the homes of the three,

195
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:15,121
you secretly gave away the ransom.

196
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:18,821
If I gave it away, the officer would've found out long ago.

197
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:21,521
But there must've been something.

198
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:24,421
Maybe there was something of value in the things they sent you

199
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,921
and you returned it or something.

200
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:28,021
Like I already told you...

201
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,221
Huh?

202
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,921
Look at this picture on Aya's mail!

203
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:35,021
Hey, what are you looking at Conan?

204
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:39,221
An illustrator friend of mine often sends me these joke messages.

205
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:41,421
Gosh. Behave yourself, Conan!

206
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:45,821
But it said to click on the mail.

207
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:48,221
If I knew what was inside before I opened it,

208
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:49,622
I wouldn't have done what I did.

209
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:51,922
You idiot!

210
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:55,421
You shouldn't open other people's mail no matter what the contents!

211
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:56,521
Wait.

212
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:59,121
The kidnapper snuck into the house

213
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:01,821
knowing that both Masashi and Aya wouldn't be home

214
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,921
and tried to steal something, right?

215
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:07,621
Which means that Mr. Hikiya who sent the Yaiba card is innocent.

216
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:12,421
He wouldn't go through all this trouble if he didn't know what was inside.

217
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:13,621
I see.

218
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:16,521
As for lottery tickets that Mr. Rokuda sent here,

219
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:20,521
if the winner was a number continuing from the tickets he had himself,

220
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,421
he would know the winning ticket was here.

221
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,821
Yes. And the same can be said of Mr. Satsuka.

222
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:28,821
If he lost the rare yen bill that he bought,

223
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:33,321
it wouldn't be strange if he thought that he may have sent it to Masashi.

224
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:34,821
Talking of sending things,

225
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:39,822
Pops also received a bottle wrapped in shiny paper the other day.

226
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:43,121
That's called champagne.

227
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:46,521
A client sent it to us as a token of thanks for solving a case.

228
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:49,121
It's juice, right? I want to drink it, too.

229
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:52,121
It's liquor, children can't drink it.

230
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:54,322
Besides, dad drank it all up already.

231
00:12:55,622 --> 00:12:57,221
I guess it can't be helped then.

232
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:58,521
That's right.

233
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:01,421
If it's liquor, Pops will open it as soon as he gets it

234
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:03,421
and puts into his stomach.

235
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:04,721
Wait a second.

236
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:07,421
If money is sent by using registered mail for cash,

237
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:10,221
we would open it right away and put the cash in our wallet.

238
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:15,521
If so, if there were any rare yen bills, it would be in Masashi's wallet.

239
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:17,821
So coming into the house to get it back won't help.

240
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:20,721
If so, the suspicious one is...

241
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:24,321
Mr. Rokuda who sent the lottery tickets.

242
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:26,221
It can't be.

243
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:30,021
Because I'm not interested in lottery tickets and I might throw them away.

244
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,321
I wonder.

245
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:35,621
You could've left it on your desk without opening the envelope.

246
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,121
I see.

247
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:39,921
Since you don't care about them, you might not notice if they were gone.

248
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:44,021
You might not even realize that they had been stolen either.

249
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,321
Hold it.

250
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:46,821
Aren't you forgetting something?

251
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:52,621
Kouta said he watched a boring baseball game at that man's apartment.

252
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:56,021
I called Rokuda's house on that day after noon.

253
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:57,821
The games that were playing then

254
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:01,421
was a hot high school baseball game with reversal after reversal,

255
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:05,121
and a Major League program called "Nice Game Selection". Only those two.

256
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:08,421
Hey, Kouta. The one you saw was boring, right?

257
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:11,221
Yes. It wasn't fun at all.

258
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:14,321
Look. There's no way that Rokuda is the culprit.

259
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:19,621
But "Safe Game" is written by the program "Nice Game Selection".

260
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:23,021
If it's "safe", maybe it's not exciting, but boring.

261
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:24,821
Stupid!

262
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,321
That Kanji character is read as "complete", not "safe".

263
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:29,221
In other words, it's a perfect game,

264
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:32,421
It's when the pitcher doesn't let the opposing batters score even one hit.

265
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,121
It's an exciting game.

266
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:36,122
Don't tell me that...

267
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:39,821
It's true that a complete game is exciting,

268
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:42,121
but it may look to be a boring game to children

269
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:44,621
who don't know much about baseball.

270
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,521
Moreover, with a broadcast slot of only an hour,

271
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:49,521
most of the offensive play of the players on the pitcher's team

272
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,021
were probably edited and cut.

273
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,421
It would only show scenes of the opposing batters getting out.

274
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:57,421
I can understand why he would think the game to be boring.

275
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:59,921
Kouta, that's how it was, right?

276
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,221
Yeah.

277
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:03,221
The batters kept getting three strikes,

278
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:05,322
so everyone was just getting outs.

279
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:10,221
Then I guess Mr. Rokuda is the kidnapper.

280
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:11,222
Wait.

281
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:14,121
Even if Rokuda were to be the culprit, it's attempted kidnap, right?

282
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,221
He didn't take money from me.

283
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:18,621
Besides, it seems as if he needs money,

284
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:20,621
so I'm sure he just impulsively did it.

285
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:25,821
You knew that a winning ticket was in there, didn't you?

286
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:28,121
Knowing that he was in need of money,

287
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:31,321
so you sent the tickets back to him that is still in the envelope.

288
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:34,921
But not knowing that, Mr. Rokuda came into the house,

289
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:38,522
panicked after seeing that the envelope was gone and kidnapped Kouta.

290
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:44,421
And because of his situation, you suspected Mr. Rokuda from the beginning.

291
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,021
Then you suggested going to his house.

292
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:50,321
Seeing the mailbox jam packed with mail...

293
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:56,521
Maybe there's something good in that bulging mailbox of yours.

294
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,421
Isn't this how it was?

295
00:15:58,422 --> 00:15:59,922
Am I wrong?

296
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:05,821
Yeah, you're right. Exactly.

297
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:07,521
Who cares?

298
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:10,121
He's the one who bought the lottery tickets to begin with anyway.

299
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:14,822
Besides, he's the only one that's still into music without quitting.

300
00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:17,321
It was our dream.

301
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,621
Our group from long ago.

302
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:23,321
We all quit because it's getting tougher.

303
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:25,421
Except him.

304
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:29,321
So please give him a break this time, officer.

305
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,621
No.

306
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,821
Kidnapping is a crime that's equal to murder, a very ruthless crime.

307
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,521
I can't forgive him.

308
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:38,521
Especially since it was just for money.

309
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:42,921
I can't sympathize with one who wants to realize his dream

310
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:45,121
at the expense of hurting the hearts of others.

311
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:47,621
Although I feel that it's unfortunate for him.

312
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:49,921
I guess so.

313
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:52,321
He's so stupid.

314
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:56,321
Officer Takagi, we're going to raid Mr. Rokuda's house.

315
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:59,921
Gosh! What's he doing at a time like this?

316
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:02,521
Inspector, we've figured out who the kidnapper is!

317
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,122
It's Masashi's childhood friend, Takuji Rokuda!

318
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:08,121
There is a possibility that he may flee.

319
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:10,321
If he refuses to come voluntarily, arrest him without a warrant.

320
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,921
No, I can't do that.

321
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:16,021
Just a while ago, he came running with a pale face.

322
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,622
Who did?

323
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:23,121
Officer Sato.

324
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:24,221
Inspector.

325
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:25,622
It was him. Over there.

326
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,321
Officer Takagi.

327
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,321
What's with all that blood?

328
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,521
Don't tell me

329
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:41,921
that you went in and fought with the culprit to try to look good.

330
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:46,121
No, that's the kidnapper blood.

331
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:47,821
He saved him.

332
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:50,822
Officer Takagi broke into the room and saved Mr. Rokuda.

333
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:54,821
Officer Takagi!

334
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:56,022
Just what do you think you're doing?

335
00:17:57,622 --> 00:17:58,722
Darn it!

336
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:09,921
Suicide?

337
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,421
He cut his wrist.

338
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:13,721
He's already been taken away by ambulance.

339
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:16,921
It seems that he'll make it because he was found early enough.

340
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:20,221
I guess we'll have him come in voluntarily after he recovers.

341
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:23,321
How did you know he was going to commit suicide?

342
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:26,221
Kouta's socks.

343
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,821
I asked him why they were wet.

344
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:31,121
Kouta said when he went back to Mr. Rokuda's place,

345
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:33,721
but there was a stranger in the bathroom.

346
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:38,521
Mr. Rokuda released Kouta, removed his disguise

347
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:42,121
and committed suicide in the bath tub.

348
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,221
The fact that Kouta's socks were wet,

349
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,521
means that he went into the bathtub

350
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:48,821
and went up to Mr. Rokuda.

351
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,721
If Mr. Rokuda were conscious then,

352
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:53,621
he wouldn't have let Kouta do so.

353
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:54,921
I see.

354
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:59,021
He found the lottery tickets that had been returned in his mailbox.

355
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,221
He realized Mr. Emoto still cared for him

356
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,821
and was unable to endure the weight of the crime he had committed.

357
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:08,721
It's amazing that you figured out that Takuji Rokuda was the culprit.

358
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:11,821
I figured that among the mail that was sent to Masashi,

359
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:14,221
the only thing you would know the value of beforehand

360
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:18,921
and could go in later to steal are the lottery tickets.

361
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:21,321
Then why didn't you tell me about it?

362
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:22,821
Well...

363
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:25,721
I wasn't confident about my deduction,

364
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:28,921
so I thought I'd go check things out first.

365
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:30,522
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:35,022
Inspector Megure, I'll leave the rest up to you.

367
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:37,522
Officer Sato.

368
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:43,121
Officer Sato, write a report to submit to headquarters, will you?

369
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:45,321
What? Yes, sir.

370
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:47,121
You too, Officer Takagi.

371
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,122
Yes, sir.

372
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:50,821
I've got to stay here and wait for the search warrant.

373
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,321
You can use my car. Have you been drinking?

374
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:55,522
I only had soft drinks.

375
00:19:58,422 --> 00:19:59,521
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:00,621
What's with you?

377
00:20:00,622 --> 00:20:02,721
Did you do something that you have to apologize to me about?

378
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:05,021
But you're angry.

379
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:07,121
Does it look like I am?

380
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,621
If it's about the social...

381
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:10,921
It's okay.

382
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:13,521
I bet Officer Chiba told you they were short on people

383
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:15,921
and you couldn't refuse, right?

384
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,821
Well, it did look as if you had some expectations

385
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:19,321
about the girls who were there.

386
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:21,321
So you're angry about the incident

387
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:23,621
that just happened after all, right?

388
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,621
I'm sorry for not telling you, my superior, about it,

389
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:27,921
and acted on my own.

390
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:30,521
But by the time I realized what I was doing,

391
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,221
my body was already running of its own accord.

392
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,922
I'm really sorry.

393
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:39,121
Don't apologize.

394
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:42,521
You did something way greater than just nab a person.

395
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:45,521
You did something fantastic.

396
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:50,421
I'm upset that I wasn't thinking about what the suspect would be feeling.

397
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:54,821
And I'm mad at myself for fixating only on apprehending him.

398
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:57,721
And when at the same time some other person could see the big picture,

399
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:59,121
I couldn't.

400
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:04,421
I only figured it out because I also buy lottery tickets frequently, so...

401
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:07,421
The odds are as low as buying lottery tickets.

402
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:08,821
I mean that both of us who are going out with each other

403
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:12,821
would be invited separately to a gathering and run into each other there.

404
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:14,221
That's true.

405
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,522
I mean, I've never even once won a lottery.

406
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:21,422
You mean that I'm a losing ticket then?

407
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:25,321
No, you're a smash hit! Super special huge hit!

408
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:26,822
Keep your eyes on the road!

409
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,721
You really think so?

410
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,921
Yes. I pledge my heart!

411
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:37,921
Then will you confirm if I'm a big hit or not?

412
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,822
Yes, it's my pleasure.

413
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:49,422
Don't tell me that you two have forgotten that we're in the car, too?

414
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:19,121
Huh? Another social gathering?

415
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:22,421
That's right. They don't have enough girls again this time.

416
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:25,621
Yumi, I'm sorry. But this time, I'll pass.

417
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:28,021
I've had more than enough of my share last time already.

418
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:31,521
What? There's an all-you-can-eat cake buffet after the meal?

419
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:33,421
Moreover, the host is treating?

420
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:34,721
I'll go, I'll go.

421
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:37,021
As soon as I nab the robber of Shinjuku 3-chome,

422
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,921
I'll go dashing over!

423
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:40,522
Officer Sato.

424
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,222
"Next Episode" -Huh?

425
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:48,222
Mr. Mikami?

426
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:51,121
This schedule is...

427
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:53,722
It looks like the scotch tape was peeled off once and stuck back on again.

428
00:23:54,622 --> 00:23:57,721
There were three keys here just a while ago,

429
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,621
but there's only one now.

430
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:01,821
At this height...

431
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:04,621
it's probably impossible to come in from the window.

432
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:05,721
I see!

433
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:06,722
I got it!

434
00:24:07,922 --> 00:24:13,222
Next Conan, "Conan: A Strange Child".

435
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:31,421
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:31,422 --> 00:24:33,221
"Gum."

437
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,321
Officer Sato, this time for sure, let's just the two of us...

438
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:36,521
Miwako, do you want to go sing karaoke?

439
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:38,522
-Okay. -Yumi, you're really in the way.
