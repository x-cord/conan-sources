1
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,579
Officer Takagi and Officer Sato

2
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,679
came to Tropical Marine Land on a secret date

3
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,480
without telling their colleagues at the station.

4
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,279
However, not only did they end up being watched

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,079
by Inspector Shiratori and the other officers,

6
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,280
we were sent to interrupt their date.

7
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,179
Then, instead of a ring

8
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,579
that he was planning to give as a present,

9
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,980
a paper bag of heroin was found in Officer Takagi's bag.

10
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,379
Here.

11
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,579
That's right.

12
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,979
When I rode the "50,000 Miles Under The Sea" attraction,

13
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,179
I'm sure someone made a mistake back then

14
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,879
and took my bag.

15
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,279
You've got a clue!

16
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,579
Look at the shoulder belt of that bag.

17
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,979
Only the hole on the left side is spread out wide.

18
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,179
A right-handed person would normally carry it on the right shoulder,

19
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,979
but the owner of that bag always carried it on his left shoulder.

20
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,879
Which means

21
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,380
the possibility of him being left-handed is very high.

22
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,879
"Genta Kojima."

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Here it is.

24
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,079
This person is left-handed!

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,979
How do you know?

26
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,980
The characters written using the ballpoint pen

27
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,579
smeared to the right.

28
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,380
This is proof that the person is left-handed.

29
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,979
Please announce his name that's on the survey sheet

30
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,879
and have him come here immediately!

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,180
He's a major witness for an investigation!

32
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,480
"Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 2)"

33
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,180
"300 fireworks show at 7 pm!"

34
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
"Tropical Marine Land, Gate C."

35
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,979
Mr. Noboru Takagi, please come immediately to the front

36
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,880
of the entrance of the attraction "50,000 Miles Under The Sea".

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,279
Takagi?

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,079
I see, Takagi has already gathered all his relatives here.

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,879
Inspector, the two are probably going to

40
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,379
have their reception wedding here today.

41
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,579
It'll be okay.

42
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,979
Without a ring, they cannot proceed with the ceremony.

43
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,379
But if you find anyone with a similar kind of bag,

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,479
question them at all cost

45
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,579
and check inside their bag.

46
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,379
Show it to me.

47
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,079
Hurry.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,079
Attention, all customers.

49
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,880
Mr. Noboru Takagi from Chiba Prefecture...

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,479
please come immediately to the front entrance

51
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,780
of our "50,000 Miles Under the Sea" attraction.

52
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,079
It's him! He's the one!

53
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,580
The man that was doing the golf swing!

54
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,279
Are you Mr. Noboru Takagi?

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,979
The police?

56
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,679
Yes, I am Takagi.

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,079
What do you want from me?

58
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,879
You're left-handed, aren't you?

59
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,179
Yes.

60
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,180
I'd hate to trouble you,

61
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,079
but will you show me your bag?

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,880
My... my bag? But this is all I have.

63
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,579
Oh, no.

64
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,980
It's totally different from Officer Takagi's bag.

65
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,779
Hey, daddy. I'm hungry!

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,279
-Come on! -Okay, okay.

67
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,379
What? He is...

68
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,680
the child that's in the picture.

69
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,479
Geez, you called me out here,

70
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,979
and this is what you had to say?

71
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,679
I... I'm so sorry!

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,980
Thank you for your cooperation!

73
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,379
There's just no way a mule would bring a child.

74
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,579
But it's one down, so just three more to go.

75
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,579
If we check the survey sheets,

76
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,879
we can get their names and addresses.

77
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,479
That won't work.

78
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,679
The survey sheets taken after that man's

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,679
are those of three students on a school trip.

80
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,379
In other words, the three people in between

81
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,679
didn't answer the survey sheets.

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,179
Oh, no.

83
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,879
If only we could at least find those students,

84
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,279
we could ask them what kind of bag

85
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,879
the three suspects were holding.

86
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,479
The male students on a school trip

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,479
were around there some place a while ago.

88
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,380
See, over there!

89
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,279
They're the DC Academy's famous trio!

90
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,479
Treerrios?

91
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,879
Not Treerrios, but trio.

92
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,380
All three of them are famous for being sportsmen.

93
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,079
Hey, there was a soiled handkerchief in the bag, wasn't there?

94
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Oh, yes.

95
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,680
Do you mean this?

96
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,480
The color and smell of this stain...

97
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,379
Just as I thought.

98
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,779
Okay, I'll go ask the three then!

99
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,679
No, you don't have to.

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,980
There's something I just remembered.

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,979
A taboo that a sportsman should never do.

102
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,179
A taboo that a sportsman should never do?

103
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,479
Is that going to specify the owner of this bag?

104
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,479
What's a taboo?

105
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,280
That's something that you're not supposed to do.

106
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,880
See, just watch those three very carefully.

107
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,279
All three of them are famous high school sportsmen.

108
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,179
On the right end is Yosuke Goto,

109
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,879
a high school baseball player who has won his way up to rank 4

110
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,679
as the best left-handed player.

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,879
In the middle is Keita Nakajima, the backstroker

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,479
who broke the inter-high record.

113
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,779
And at the very left is Kazuhiko Maeda,

114
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,280
a soccer player under seventeen.

115
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,980
Don't you notice something?

116
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,279
The owner of the bag is a left-hander

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,379
who always carries his bag over his left shoulder.

118
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,679
Who among the baseball player, soccer player, and swimmer

119
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,879
is the person we're looking for?

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,679
It's the one who plays soccer then,

121
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,579
because he's carrying his bag on his left shoulder.

122
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,979
That's because he happens to be left-handed.

123
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,679
How is that so?

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,479
What about the swimmer?

125
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,379
We've got to ask whether she's right-handed or not

126
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,679
or we'll never know.

127
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,979
I get it. Maybe it's the baseball player?

128
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,779
A left-handed player means he's left-handed, doesn't it?

129
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,679
Then, it's the baseball player.

130
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,480
That's only a coincidence, I think.

131
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,779
But something seems strange.

132
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,979
Look, the baseball player

133
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,979
is carrying the bag on his right shoulder.

134
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,679
True. Why? Why?

135
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,779
Maybe he used to throw with his right arm

136
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,579
before he switched to using his left arm.

137
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,379
That's why he's probably actually right-handed.

138
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,779
No, you're wrong.

139
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,979
That is not the reason why he's not carrying the bag

140
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,679
on his right shoulder.

141
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,079
He's not supposed to carry it over his left shoulder.

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,580
That's one of the taboos a sportsman is not supposed to do.

143
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,279
That is, he has to protect his precious left shoulder.

144
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,779
Now that you mentioned it, I've heard something like that before.

145
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,379
Pitchers try not to burden their shoulders.

146
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,779
So when they carry heavy loads with their shoulder,

147
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,379
they carry it on the shoulder opposite the hand they throw with.

148
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,279
Genta, the guy you saw was right-handed, wasn't he?

149
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,979
Yeah, he was throwing in air like this.

150
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,379
I see.

151
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,879
If that person is a right-handed pitcher

152
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,779
and is still playing baseball somewhere,

153
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,079
it is very likely that he was carrying the bag

154
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,079
on his left shoulder to protect his right shoulder.

155
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,279
As if he were left-handed.

156
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,679
But I wonder if it's safe to base our conclusion on just that.

157
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,079
There are left-handed soccer players and swimmers too.

158
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,779
That's not all.

159
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,879
This handkerchief that was in the bag.

160
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
Try smelling it.

161
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,779
This is...

162
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,780
Yeah. Mr. Mouri was polishing his glove with it this morning.

163
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,879
It's the smell of glove oil.

164
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,879
Then the owner of this bag...

165
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,779
In other words, the mule is...

166
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,679
The man that wears a cap and plays baseball.

167
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,379
I'm pretty sure.

168
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,779
But how do we look for him?

169
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,580
It seems like the number of customers has increased too.

170
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,379
I bought it at a nearby shop, but it's not working well.

171
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,380
It's difficult to see too far with opera glasses.

172
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,579
This is Sogawa.

173
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,079
Takagi and Sato are beginning to really move about.

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,079
They seem to be looking desperately for the bag with the ring inside.

175
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,179
Roger.

176
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,179
Let's make sure that we get to it before they do, no matter what.

177
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,579
All officers, please continue questioning.

178
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,679
And please do not lose track

179
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,580
of both Officer Takagi and Officer Sato. Thank you.

180
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,279
If he's walking out here somewhere,

181
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,379
we still have a chance of finding him.

182
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,379
But if he's inside a pavilion of an attraction or something,

183
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,180
there's no way we can find him.

184
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,179
Don't worry.

185
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,879
Marine Land is only open till 8.00 pm.

186
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,879
It's already 5.30 pm. If any deal is going to be carried out,

187
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,379
there are only two and a half hours left.

188
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,579
I'm sure he'll avoid an attraction in which he has to wait in line.

189
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,979
Moreover, if he's a mule,

190
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,479
chances are he's here alone.

191
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,180
I'm sure he's having problems trying to kill time.

192
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,979
I can't be all that sure,

193
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,179
but if the mule were to appear,

194
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,380
it would most likely be...

195
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,880
"Retro-Game Pavilion."

196
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,579
He's nowhere in sight.

197
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,279
I did say that I can't be all that sure, you know.

198
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,279
I have to go take a leak.

199
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,079
I'm going to the restroom.

200
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,380
Me too!

201
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,279
Maybe it's this way.

202
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,680
It's the john!

203
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,380
Oh. Are you okay?

204
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,679
You're the two kids that were at "50,000 Miles Under the Sea".

205
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,980
Nice to see you.

206
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,279
See you guys then.

207
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,080
Hey, Mitsuhiko...

208
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,580
-He's here! -He sure was, Genta!

209
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,480
Hurry...

210
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,779
Here I am again.

211
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,979
This is the best place to kill time after all.

212
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,379
He's carrying a bag that looked really similar on his left shoulder.

213
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,980
It seems quite certain that he's the mule.

214
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,580
Bull's eye!

215
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,979
What's the matter, Ms. Sato?

216
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,579
-Hurry, get the bag. -Wait.

217
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,079
Let him be until he goes off to make the deal.

218
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,979
We'll nab him just when he makes contact with the dealer.

219
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,679
But my bag...

220
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,579
Did you have something very important inside it, after all?

221
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,679
Yes. It's what I was planning to give you, Ms. Sato.

222
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
A...

223
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,279
Finger... ("Yubi" means "finger" in Japanese)

224
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,279
What? Finger?

225
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,579
A ri... A...

226
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,079
A ring... ("Yubiwa" means "ring" in Japanese)

227
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,179
A mail? ("Ring" sounds similar to "mail" in Japanese)

228
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,579
Do you mean a letter?

229
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,179
Gosh, if you have something you want to say to me,

230
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,279
why don't you tell me directly as a man should?

231
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,980
You're right.

232
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,279
Okay, we're going to approach the man,

233
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,380
so all of you stay close to me, all right?

234
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,780
It's a ring.

235
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:50,324
Inspector Shiratori, we found the man

236
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,624
that seems to have the bag in question.

237
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,924
All right. Please check the contents then.

238
00:13:56,925 --> 00:14:01,424
But Ms. Sato and the others are near that man too.

239
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,324
Does that mean that the ring inside the bag has already been...

240
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:08,224
No, it doesn't seem so.

241
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:11,524
Rather, it seems as if they're keeping watch over the man.

242
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:14,224
Please tell me where you currently are.

243
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,824
Let's get together there.

244
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:17,724
All officers gather at the Retro-Game Pavilion.

245
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:19,924
-Gather there? -He said that?

246
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:20,925
Roger.

247
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,325
Roger.

248
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:29,724
It's almost time.

249
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:31,025
I guess it's time I get going.

250
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,625
Let's go there next.

251
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,125
What is this? Oh, my.

252
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,324
Where did he go?

253
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:14,124
It's okay. He's over there.

254
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,124
Really!

255
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,224
He sat down.

256
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:19,024
Now, we're about to start

257
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:21,424
the greatest event of this tropical night,

258
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:24,624
the vivid bursting fireworks in the night sky.

259
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,725
It's show time!

260
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:35,424
I don't believe that they're going to go through a drug deal

261
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:38,024
in a bustling place like this.

262
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:40,425
Maybe it's a good place because it's so unlikely?

263
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:57,824
That's...

264
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:00,824
the drug dealer, Asakichi Yakura!

265
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,724
Okay, I don't know what this is about

266
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,924
but take it with you right away and give me the cash.

267
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:09,324
Hold it. The deal starts after the fireworks are displayed in the sky.

268
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:12,524
When all people are looking up at the fireworks.

269
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,924
Oh, talk about being careful.

270
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:17,624
It must be something super illegal.

271
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,224
It's better for you to not think about unnecessary things.

272
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:25,124
You're a mule, and that's all that matters.

273
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,124
So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so very much for waiting.

274
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:35,224
The great 300 shots fireworks show is about to begin!

275
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,924
Officer Takagi, take care of the children.

276
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:39,224
Ms. Sato!

277
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:41,024
Inspector, there is a male among the audience

278
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:43,124
that resembles a suspect on the wanted list.

279
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,125
What?

280
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,324
Okay, now is the time.

281
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,425
Put the stuff on my lap.

282
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:52,825
What?

283
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,124
Police!

284
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,725
Freeze, both of you.

285
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,825
No way.

286
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:24,124
Didn't you hear another sound other than the fireworks just now?

287
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,025
Yeah, I heard it. It's a loud bang!

288
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,324
Yakura!

289
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,325
Ms. Sato!

290
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,124
What the hell are you doing? Let's go after him!

291
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,125
All right!

292
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,424
Inspector, the two are going after Yakura.

293
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,324
Moreover, he's armed with a gun.

294
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:54,624
Roger. All officers on site,

295
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,224
keep in mind the safety of all the people here

296
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,625
while supporting Officer Sato and Officer Takagi!

297
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,525
Hey! Freeze!

298
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,325
Freeze, my foot. There's no way, man.

299
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,025
Up ahead is where the pleasure cruiser is.

300
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,425
Ms. Sato?

301
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:42,724
Oh, no. He's probably planning on hijacking the boat using his gun

302
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:44,225
and flee to the other side.

303
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,425
No, you don't!

304
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,525
The ring!

305
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,625
Darn it!

306
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,025
My ring!

307
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:58,924
Well, good work, Officer Takagi.

308
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,924
Inspector Shiratori?

309
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,424
What brings you here?

310
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:05,324
Well, we got a tip about a drug deal

311
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:08,224
that was to be held here and were staking out.

312
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:11,224
By the way, where is your bag

313
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:12,924
that the mule mistakenly took?

314
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,524
Huh? Well...

315
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:18,924
It went down into the sea when I caught the suspect.

316
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:24,225
Well, there wasn't much in it, so it doesn't matter.

317
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,824
Not much, he said.

318
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,824
I'm glad then.

319
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:32,724
Okay, case closed. Case closed.

320
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:34,724
Shall we go have a shot tonight?

321
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:36,724
Sounds good.

322
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:39,224
You can come too, can't you?

323
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:42,325
Yes, after I take the children home.

324
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,824
Ms. Sato!

325
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:48,525
Ms. Sato, we got the suspect!

326
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,625
Ms. Sato.

327
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:54,224
What's the matter?

328
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:56,124
Are you crying?

329
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,725
It's probably because of that incident.

330
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,325
It can't be...

331
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,624
She seemed to have a flashback on the memory

332
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,025
of Officer Matsuda who died on duty on the Ferris Wheel.

333
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,824
You idiot!

334
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:07,824
Why did you choose a place like this for a date?

335
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:09,124
The pits.

336
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,724
What a dork!

337
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,024
I... I'm sorry.

338
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,625
It didn't dawn on me.

339
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:21,725
Hey, will you promise me?

340
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:25,925
That you will always be with me...

341
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,425
and you will never disappear before me.

342
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:35,425
Give me your word!

343
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:45,125
Although Officer Takagi lost his important bag...

344
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:49,925
but he got a hold of something more important.

345
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,724
"Next Episode."

346
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:01,524
Hurry, Officer Takagi!

347
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,824
Hurry to where?

348
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:04,925
We've found a clue!

349
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:07,724
Did you find anything?

350
00:24:07,725 --> 00:24:08,825
Soil?

351
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,124
Beetle?

352
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,424
What's that?

353
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:17,324
This is it!

354
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:20,124
Why is a beetle in a place like this?

355
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,524
Furthermore, at this time of year.

356
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:26,725
Next Conan, "Mysterious Spring Beetle".

357
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:45,724
Next Conan's Hint:

358
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:48,124
"Cell phone strap."

359
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,524
A date without a ring and a car without an air conditioner.

360
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:53,025
-How sad... -Did you just see a penguin?
