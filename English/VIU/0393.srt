1
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:22,183
Abduction and ransom.

2
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:23,683
Money is usually the objective,

3
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:25,883
but something is strange about today's incident.

4
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:27,383
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:29,183
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,784
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,973
2:30 is the time that I get sleepy.

8
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,419
What happened?

9
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,819
-Call the police! -Ambulance! Call an ambulance.

10
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:32,914
There's no need to call an ambulance.

11
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,214
He died on the spot.

12
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:35,914
He was going at tremendous speed.

13
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:38,415
He couldn't possibly have controlled the wheels at the speed he was going.

14
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:48,214
What's with this load of cash?

15
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:49,314
Unreal.

16
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:51,814
Huh? There seems to be a letter inside.

17
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:53,215
Give it to me!

18
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:57,714
"Here is 30,000,000 yen. I haven't contact the police.

19
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:01,214
Please return my father right away. Domoto."

20
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,614
Which means that this money is...

21
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:07,615
Ransom that was prepared to get back a hostage.

22
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:14,515
"A Mock Kidnap... Case."

23
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,014
The name of the man who died is Takeshi Hirano.

24
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,614
He has a record of being arrested for threatening and taking cash.

25
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:32,014
He's on the kidnappers side for sure.

26
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:35,414
I wonder if he was on his way back after taking the ransom money?

27
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,414
If Hirano alone committed this crime,

28
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:39,814
we've got trouble.

29
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:44,014
Nobody knows where the kidnapped person is being confined.

30
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,915
On top of that, we don't have time.

31
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:50,014
"My father has kidney ailment.

32
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:52,414
He needs medication every six hours.

33
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:56,415
I've enclose it, so please administer it to him."

34
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:01,414
It means that the hostage will not get this medication.

35
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,514
Unless we hurry and find the hostage.

36
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:06,414
But where is he being confined?

37
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:10,614
First, we've got to find out who the hostage is.

38
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:13,914
We know his last name is Domoto but Domoto of where?

39
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:16,014
Maybe he was visiting a hospital

40
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,215
to get his medicine.

41
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:27,114
This is Beika Electric Company.

42
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:29,014
We've come to deliver the TV set you ordered.

43
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,414
I haven't ordered it.

44
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:33,214
Maybe it's some mistake?

45
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:36,214
No. It's no mistake.

46
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,715
Please verify the order form.

47
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,715
We did not order any TV set.

48
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:50,014
We're the police.

49
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:51,614
Dear.

50
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,014
The police?

51
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:54,814
Hey, long time no see!

52
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:56,314
Remember I was an upperclassman at the same university?

53
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:57,714
It's me, me.

54
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,314
And I'm his son!

55
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:01,314
How do you do?

56
00:05:01,315 --> 00:05:04,014
How come you're here, too?

57
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:06,215
You'll look less suspicious with a child, right?

58
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:09,914
This is a kidnap case, isn't it?

59
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:11,315
Yes.

60
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,714
Our father...

61
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,214
We matched the "Domotos"

62
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:20,814
that live within Tokyo and visit the hospital for kidney ailment,

63
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:24,014
and came up with your father.

64
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:27,514
Mr. Shozo Domoto, who goes to the Beika Central Hospital.

65
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:28,814
But why?

66
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:30,915
We were told that if we report this to the police, father would be killed.

67
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,014
The situation has changed.

68
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,914
Why does the police have this?

69
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:39,614
We left it where we were told to leave it.

70
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:44,214
That culprit passed away of a traffic accident while on his motorbike.

71
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:46,314
The culprit?

72
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:48,614
Please don't give up.

73
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,314
We are tracing the friends of this man.

74
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:52,714
We're hoping to find the place

75
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:54,714
where your father is being confined from the hints we may get from them.

76
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:58,014
To think that this did not reach father.

77
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:00,414
It says every six hours,

78
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:03,114
but when is the last time your father was injected?

79
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:04,614
At 9:00 this morning.

80
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,615
Which means the next shot...

81
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:09,314
has to be given to him at 3:00 in the afternoon.

82
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,115
It's way past time!

83
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,315
Inspector.

84
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:19,814
It's not that he's going to fall into serious condition right away,

85
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,914
but if there is a time span of more than eight hours...

86
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,614
The limit is eight hours, which means...

87
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,614
The time limit is 5:00 in the afternoon.

88
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:29,415
There's only an hour and a half left.

89
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,814
Please tell us when and in what way your father was kidnapped,

90
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:36,714
as well as how you coped with the situation.

91
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:39,214
The more in detail the better.

92
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,614
There are four of us living here.

93
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,914
Shosaburo Domoto, my father who runs a metal processing company,

94
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:47,214
his only daughter, me,

95
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:49,114
my husband Akinori

96
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:52,714
and our housekeeper, Masayo.

97
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:55,814
Today is the company's establishment day, so it was closed.

98
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,314
That's why everyone was at home from morning.

99
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:01,514
I'm also working at father's company.

100
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:04,214
You have married into your wife's family.

101
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,915
And will eventually become the heir.

102
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:13,214
I injected father at 9:00 in the morning,

103
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:15,615
and went to visit a friend of mine.

104
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:23,415
I had promised to go see her from sometime before.

105
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,814
After that, father went out for a walk.

106
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:29,114
He always does on his days off.

107
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,414
And at about 10:00, I went into my study

108
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,615
because I had some documents I had to get together.

109
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:42,014
At about 11:00, when I was cleaning the bath tub, the phone rang.

110
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:43,914
It was the voice of a young man.

111
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:45,615
Get one of the family members on the phone.

112
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:50,014
This is Domoto speaking.

113
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,915
What? Kidnap?

114
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,714
In other words, Mr. Shosaburo Domoto was kidnapped

115
00:07:55,715 --> 00:08:01,015
while taking a walk between the hours of 09:00 to 11:00.

116
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:08,714
When he takes a walk, does he always walk the same course?

117
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,514
Yes, it's almost always the same.

118
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:12,414
Can you tell me about where it is?

119
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:15,415
There could be a hint leading to the place of confinement.

120
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:18,815
I'll go look.

121
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:25,115
I called and told her to come home right away.

122
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:29,114
I'll do everything I can to get together the ransom of 30,000,000 yen

123
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:32,514
that is being demanded, so don't worry.

124
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:35,814
As long as we give them the money, father will be all right.

125
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,215
Leave it to me.

126
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,615
I'm counting on you, Akinari!

127
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:53,514
Now, everything will be okay.

128
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,715
Thank you, Akinari.

129
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,814
Hello.

130
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,915
Yes, the ransom...

131
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:21,714
"I'll return the hostage as soon as I confirm the cash, so wait at home."

132
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:24,314
I believed what he told me.

133
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:28,214
I even enclosed the medicine just in case, too.

134
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:31,914
5:00. Only one more hour to go before the time limit.

135
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:35,114
Don't cry. I know father's going to come back safely.

136
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:37,914
Yes, we'd like to pray that he's okay,

137
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:39,715
regardless of how we usually feel about him.

138
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:51,414
Uncle Kogoro told me to ask you.

139
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:52,415
What did you mean when you said,

140
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,414
"regardless of how we usually feel about him" a while ago?

141
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:56,514
Well...

142
00:09:56,515 --> 00:10:01,814
Akinari always had it tough with Mr. Domoto.

143
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:03,615
Had it tough?

144
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:06,214
Of all things,

145
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:09,614
I feel no ambition or spirit from you at all.

146
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:13,615
I'm trying the best I can for the company, too.

147
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,814
You're just not cut out to take after me.

148
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:19,915
Just looking at you makes me lose my appetite.

149
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,215
Father!

150
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,414
Mr. Domoto is strict to the point

151
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:28,314
that it makes you wonder why he's so hard on Akinari.

152
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:31,414
But his wife protects him at times like these, right?

153
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:36,814
When they first got married, they really got along well.

154
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:39,215
But recently, even Mrs. Domoto...

155
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:42,614
Aren't you vexed?

156
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:46,614
Making him talk that way about you. Be a man!

157
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:49,715
Mitsuko, why are you acting like this?

158
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:53,514
I wonder if it's her father's influence?

159
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,914
But him being kidnapped is another story.

160
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:01,214
Even Akinari will worry about him and hope that he is safe.

161
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:05,115
That's why he gathered the ransom with all his might.

162
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,614
I guess so.

163
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:12,815
This has nothing to do with the kidnapping.

164
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,014
It's me.

165
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:20,114
According to a friend who goes around with Takeshi Hirano,

166
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:23,714
he says that Hirano seemed to have a lot of money on him since a week ago.

167
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:27,515
Which means that Hirano was hired and paid by someone.

168
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:30,814
Probably.

169
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,714
But I haven't got info on who hired him yet.

170
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:35,814
So, you don't know who it is yet.

171
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,414
Continue asking around his friends and acquaintances.

172
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:40,114
If only we can find who it is,

173
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,214
we may get a hint on where Mr. Domoto is being confined.

174
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:45,014
There's another mastermind behind this.

175
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:47,114
But if so, something is odd.

176
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,414
Something's strange, isn't it, Inspector?

177
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:49,514
What is?

178
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:50,814
The mastermind.

179
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:54,814
The guy who went to get the ransom hasn't come back for a while.

180
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,414
Therefore, wouldn't he normally call to demand

181
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,114
what happened to the money, saying,

182
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:01,514
"What happened to the money? Are going to leave the hostage to die?"

183
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:03,514
I see. Now that you mentioned it.

184
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,014
Exactly.

185
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,314
Why does the mastermind seem quite indifferent to the money

186
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,815
after having demanded it?

187
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:14,714
Father!

188
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:15,715
Mitsuko.

189
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:18,915
Maybe the real purpose of this kidnapping is...

190
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:26,214
I see.

191
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:28,014
If so...

192
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,714
Oh, my. What is it now, kid?

193
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:35,014
Mr. Akinari Domoto was in his study all morning today, right?

194
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,714
Yes, he had work to do.

195
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,314
Did he say something to you back then?

196
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:40,714
Something?

197
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,614
Well...

198
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:45,914
Masayo, I'm going to concentrate on work for a while.

199
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,314
So you don't have to bring me tea or anything.

200
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:50,114
Just as I thought.

201
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:51,215
If so...

202
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:08,815
Machine oil.

203
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:20,814
No doubt about it.

204
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:23,514
I figured out who the real culprit of this kidnapping case is.

205
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:24,515
But I know that the person will play dumb

206
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,314
even if I try to pressure him for a confession.

207
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:28,115
And the time limit will eventually come.

208
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:34,314
That's the real purpose behind all this, not the ransom.

209
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,814
It's 4:30, only 30 minutes more to go.

210
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,615
Where is the place the hostage is confined?

211
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,299
Hey, kid. What're you doing staring at a map?

212
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:51,698
I was just wondering where the motorbike was headed for.

213
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:55,098
Where? The hideout where the hostage is confined.

214
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:58,798
That's why from the place he picked up the ransom in Beika Park,

215
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,798
to the scene of the accident, over here.

216
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,999
If you draw a line beyond it is...

217
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:04,398
Most likely.

218
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,098
But Conan...

219
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:10,798
But you can't tell if it's 10 or 100 kilometres away.

220
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,598
Huh? There's a place with the same name as this house.

221
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,998
Huh?

222
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,699
Domoto Metal Processing?

223
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,298
That's our factory.

224
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:24,098
But since we moved and built a new one in East Beika six months ago,

225
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:25,898
it's closed down now.

226
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,798
Which means it's not in use anymore.

227
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,698
So nobody is there or will come there anymore.

228
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,098
Inspector, it's the ideal place for confining someone.

229
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,298
Very probable.

230
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,398
Conan, give me the map.

231
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,998
Yes, sir!

232
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,398
Then, father is in that factory?

233
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,198
There's a possibility he is.

234
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:46,998
There's only 15 more minutes left.

235
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:50,998
Mrs. Domoto, please don't give up until the end.

236
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,499
Pops, great phrase.

237
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:56,299
Please hold up for another 15 minutes.

238
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,099
Stop. Time, please stop.

239
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,399
Father.

240
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,299
Give it to me, I'll open it.

241
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:28,498
Father!

242
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:29,999
-Mr. Domoto! -Mr. Domoto!

243
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,098
Father!

244
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:39,099
Father.

245
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:52,498
Father!

246
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:53,699
He's still breathing!

247
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,298
This is Takagi.

248
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,498
Please send an ambulance over.

249
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,699
The location is...

250
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,199
Mr. Domoto, get a hold of yourself!

251
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,598
Your wife will head for the hospital.

252
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,498
You go, too.

253
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:21,799
Yes, sir.

254
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:27,099
Please wait, Mr. Domoto.

255
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,298
Why?

256
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,998
He's transformed into the Sleeping Koori!

257
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,399
Mr. Mouri?

258
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,298
I believe that Mr. Domoto will be all right,

259
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:44,099
regardless of whether you hope otherwise, Akinari.

260
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,498
Hope otherwise?

261
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:50,198
Just what do you mean?

262
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,598
The minute I found out

263
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:56,398
that this kidnapping was not after ransom, I realized something.

264
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,698
According to what Conan heard from Masayo, the housekeeper,

265
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:04,398
you and Mitsuko really got along, and got married loving each other.

266
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,399
But after you entered the Domoto family as her wedded husband...

267
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,898
tough days of being criticized by Mr. Domoto for not being ambitious

268
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,598
or not being fit for being an heir continued everyday.

269
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,298
You most naturally hated Mr. Domoto

270
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,899
and thought you'd like to erase him from this world.

271
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,798
Don't tell me...

272
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,898
But you didn't have the courage to do so.

273
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:33,098
Therefore, you thought up this scheme.

274
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,598
Scheme?

275
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,498
Don't be ridiculous. Just what're you talking about?

276
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:37,698
I know nothing of it.

277
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:41,398
No! The culprit is Akinari, Inspector Megure.

278
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:42,399
What?

279
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,498
It can't be.

280
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:47,898
Mr. Domoto was kidnapped while taking a walk.

281
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,998
At that time Akinari was...

282
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,398
I was doing my work in the study!

283
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,698
I wonder if that's true?

284
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,098
When going into the study, you...

285
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,598
Masayo, I'm going to concentrate on work for a while.

286
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,399
So you don't have to bring me tea or anything.

287
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,698
And after saying so to Masayo,

288
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,599
you wore the shoes that you prepared beforehand.

289
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,398
You caught up with Mr. Domoto who was taking a walk

290
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,799
and got him to get in the car.

291
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,898
What on earth do you want to talk to me about

292
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,298
after bringing me to a place like this?

293
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,498
I tell you, what kind of man are you.

294
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:31,699
If you have something you want to say, just get to the point.

295
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,199
Oh, no.

296
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,098
Akinari, take me home quickly.

297
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,899
I don't have my medicine with me.

298
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,299
Akinari, there's a phone call for you.

299
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:06,098
What? Kidnap?

300
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:10,499
And you acted out the role of the victim.

301
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,098
Of course there is evidence, too.

302
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,298
The same kind of machine oil

303
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,098
that is smeared over the floor of this factory,

304
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:21,998
should be found on the frame of the window frame of your study,

305
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:25,098
showing that you went out and came back in from the window.

306
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,698
I'm sure that the tissue paper that you used to wipe it off

307
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,998
can also be found somewhere in the room.

308
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,398
And above all,

309
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,999
your footprints when you went in and out of your study.

310
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:39,998
From the Domoto residence to here, it takes an hour to go and come back.

311
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,798
It was possible for you to commit the crime

312
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:47,298
between 10:00 to 11:00, the time you were confined to your study.

313
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:48,898
It is possible,

314
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:51,298
but he didn't have to do it himself.

315
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:55,198
He could've made the guy Hirano that he hired do it, couldn't he?

316
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,098
That man was probably not told

317
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:01,098
that he was lending a hand to kidnapping.

318
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,598
He lent a hand without knowing?

319
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,898
Akinari asked Hirano to do just two things.

320
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:09,398
Call me at 11:00 in the morning and 2:00 in the afternoon,

321
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:12,998
then pick up a trunk at Beika Park.

322
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:16,798
It's for your benefit not to know what's inside the trunk or who I am.

323
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,798
Because if he tells of his scheme, Hirano would hold his weak point.

324
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,098
And aware that his wife was going out,

325
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,298
he decided to carry out his scheme today.

326
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,199
What? Kidnapped father?

327
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,998
Ransom...

328
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,198
Beika Park...

329
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,899
In other words, he was acting the conversation out alone.

330
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,098
Yes. Only if Hirano didn't get into an accident,

331
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:51,198
The money could be retrieved later,

332
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:54,598
and the scheme would've worked out fine,

333
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,098
with neither the police nor the detective showing up.

334
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:03,499
All he had to do was pretend to be worried about Shosaburo and wait.

335
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,798
Exactly.

336
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,899
But the motive is not correct, Mr. Mouri.

337
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,498
It's true that I hated him.

338
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,898
I did want him to disappear.

339
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:18,199
But that's not all.

340
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,798
I wanted to show my wife

341
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,198
how hard I tried to get the money together.

342
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,798
I thought that if she saw that,

343
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,799
her love for me would return once again.

344
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,798
It's me, Mitsuko!

345
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,298
I'm glad. Father's life has been saved.

346
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,598
When he regains consciousness, I'll tell him

347
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,798
how desperately you went around to gather money for him,

348
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,798
as well as how worried you were.

349
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,198
I'm sure that father

350
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:19,198
will stop deliberately taking his anger out on you from now on.

351
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,998
Deliberately?

352
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,798
In order to make you a fine heir,

353
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,298
father deliberately took on the hated role and acted it out.

354
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,598
Because father actually likes you.

355
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,799
He always says, "He's never seen someone as diligent as you."

356
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,698
I began putting on an act just like father recently.

357
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:39,999
But I didn't like doing it. I'm sorry.

358
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:42,898
Hello?

359
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,998
Hello? Akinari?

360
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,399
Hello?

361
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,299
"Next Episode."

362
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,398
Those who do not fear the rage of the Gods,

363
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,398
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

364
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,799
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

365
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,498
A petty thief who puts on airs?

366
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:17,199
Their hands brimming with...

367
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:20,199
The Big Jewel!

368
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:27,399
Next Conan, "Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Lock In".

369
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,898
Next Conan's Hint:

370
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:47,898
"A stone comma-shaped bead."

371
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:49,498
-Next week... -For the first time on TV will be that great hit movie.

372
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:52,099
-What? -It'll start from 7:00 in the evening.
