1
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:05,959
Today we bring to all of you out there...

2
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:07,359
Maybe it's a bit early, but...

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,259
-A Christmas present! -A Christmas present!

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,659
Something to blow the cold away.

5
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:11,959
The hot passion of summer!

6
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:13,859
Right. And the stage of today's episode is...

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:15,959
Koushien Stadium. It's show time for me!

8
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,759
You're not the only one, Heiji.

9
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:20,859
A challenge from an unknown culprit!

10
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,259
A time suspense that will make your hands sweaty!

11
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:26,059
You just can't miss it, not even an instant!

12
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,959
Detective Conan has been airing for almost nine years.

13
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:33,259
Which means that next year will be the 10th?

14
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,959
That's right. It's thanks to the support of all of you out there.

15
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:37,959
That's right.

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,659
We'll keep trying even harder from now on!

17
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:45,759
So, please watch the TV programs.

18
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,259
And the movies, too.

19
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,459
-Shonen Sunday comic book, too. -Shonen Sunday comic book, too.

20
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:52,459
Thank you and please keep rooting for us...

21
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,859
Koshien ball grounds, the dream and goal of all high school ball players.

22
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,259
The Japan summer high school ball game will start this morning.

23
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,759
This year, 4,146 schools have participated in the nationwide competition,

24
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,359
and 160,000 players have played.

25
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,859
Chosen from among the winners are 49 schools.

26
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:56,259
In the indoor training grounds on the side of the first base,

27
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:04,459
the players are waiting for the game to start.

28
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,659
Let's take a look at the regional champions.

29
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,659
Representing Okinawa, Okinawa Central High.

30
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,459
Representing Kagoshima Prefecture, Sakurajima High.

31
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,359
Representing Miyazaki Prefecture, Tadohara High.

32
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,859
Representing Oita Prefecture, Meihou High.

33
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:28,159
Representing Kumamoto Prefecture, Kumamoto High.

34
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,959
Representing Nagasaki Prefecture...

35
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:37,959
We will commence the Japan High School Baseball Tournament!

36
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,859
The players will make entry.

37
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:46,459
Following Tadohara High School is Oita's Meihou High.

38
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,159
This makes the third time Meihou has gotten this far in the tournament.

39
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,259
Representing Osaka. Here's Ogane High School.

40
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:13,359
They're getting a big cheer from the stands.

41
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,559
Now, we will move on to the player dedication.

42
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:19,359
Representing all players from Toyama Minami Vocational High School,

43
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:21,359
Captain Kawakami.

44
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,959
I pledge!

45
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,259
That we the players have come here with joy and admiration in our hearts

46
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,859
upon this great stage and will compete fair and square.

47
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:37,959
We will give it our best and display the results

48
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,259
of the of the training we went through

49
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:45,059
with the sportsmanship of fair play.

50
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,459
Representing all the players here, Toyama prefecture,

51
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,059
Toyama Minami Vocational High School Baseball Club,

52
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:51,359
Captain Tomoya Kawakami.

53
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:53,959
Koshien Stadium.

54
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,059
It's the place where the chosen high school ball players gather

55
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,659
from throughout the nation to compete using their skills and strength.

56
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,659
It is the pinnacle of one's goal.

57
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:10,359
It is a sanctuary where the goddess smiles on the champions,

58
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:13,959
as well as a fighting arena where the ball game is settled.

59
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,159
Yes.

60
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:24,559
Koshien Stadium sometimes entices the bewitched into unbelievable fate.

61
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,559
Here's a hot passionate suspense in this cold winter season.

62
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,259
Today's episode is a two hour special. Heiji also appears.

63
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,759
A difficult case on a grand stage.

64
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,159
He sees through the one and only truth.

65
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,059
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

66
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:58,259
His name is Detective Conan!

67
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:20,959
"High School Ball Game, Invisible Summer Devil"

68
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:24,259
On the same day of summer vacation,

69
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,759
the ball game finals and Takarazuka show were to take place.

70
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,759
In order to decide which we'd go to

71
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,359
Hattori and Kazuha will have a deduction match.

72
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,959
The case is one that Pops was asked to help out with.

73
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:40,159
The clue on hand are wooden blocks that the president

74
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,459
of the toy manufacturing company had left behind as a dying message.

75
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,459
Thanks to Hattori's subtle hint,

76
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,359
Kazuha solves the message.

77
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,459
However, it turns out that Heiji figures out who the real killer is

78
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,959
and wins the deduction match.

79
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:58,859
We can finally go to the Koshien Stadium.

80
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:00,259
Congratulations, Heiji.

81
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,259
Oh, shoot! I forgot.

82
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,859
Now, I have to practice the boola boola.

83
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,259
Kazuha, wait.

84
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:14,659
Kazuha, I can ask Hattori for you to go to the Takarazuka show.

85
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:17,659
You are the one who solved the mystery of the dying message.

86
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,859
You are actually half the winner, right?

87
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:21,859
Forget it.

88
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,459
What I really wanted to see

89
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,859
wasn't the Takarazuka show or the baseball game.

90
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:34,559
It was Heiji's smile that he shows when he solves a case.

91
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,459
It's the Koshien Stadium!

92
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,059
I'm sure that here, there and everywhere...

93
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,659
Yoko.

94
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,459
Yoko?

95
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:03,059
Konan High School is where the idol Yoko Okino used to go to.

96
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,359
Hey, we're not there yet?

97
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,659
Are you all right, Kudo?

98
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,259
I give up.

99
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:25,959
By the way, why do they call this Koshien Stadium?

100
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,359
Why not Hyogo Stadium or Kansai Stadium?

101
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,559
I think it would've been way better.

102
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,759
The year that Koshien Stadium was completed

103
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,259
was the first year of both ten signs zodiac and the Chinese zodiac.

104
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:37,159
It was the meeting of the monkey and the mouse

105
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,359
which comes around every 60 years.

106
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,259
So they thought it was a lucky year.

107
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,259
You sure know a lot. Don't you, Conan?

108
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,059
He knows nothing about baseball

109
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,859
and yet he's knowledgeable when it comes to things like these.

110
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,259
Well, I'm so sorry.

111
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,559
That's not all there is about Koshien Stadium.

112
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,259
The number of the stumps of the famous ivies growing here total 430,

113
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:04,159
and the dimension of the leaves total 8,000 mats.

114
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,959
Although it's an old stadium,

115
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,559
it has the capacity to hold a total of 53,000 people,

116
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,759
which is virtually equal to that of a large stadium

117
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,159
that the major leagues play at.

118
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,259
How about it? Fantastic, don't you think?

119
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:17,459
You're just as bad as I am.

120
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,359
It's going to start.

121
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,059
Let's do our best...

122
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,659
Top of the 1st inning,

123
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:31,659
position number 1 short, player Inoue is the first batter

124
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:34,059
for Ohgane High School.

125
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,159
Play ball!

126
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,159
Strike!

127
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,559
Strike two!

128
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,659
Strike three, batter out!

129
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:16,959
The starting pitcher, Sakuraba, struck out the first batter.

130
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,959
One out. The stands are cheering.

131
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,659
Sakuraba is a senior at Konan High School.

132
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:24,859
Here comes the windup and the second pitch.

133
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,649
-Strike! -Strike.

134
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,249
Ohgane High School's pitcher, Inao, with another fastball.

135
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,449
Here comes the second pitch.

136
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,049
Another strike.

137
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:25,949
Three strikes for Konan High School's batter.

138
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:46,949
Now...

139
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:52,149
Here comes the third pitch.

140
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:56,849
-Strike, batter out! -Three swings and an out.

141
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:59,349
Inao presses relentlessly with his trademark style.

142
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,449
Konan High School's third batter, Kikuchi is a senior.

143
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,949
The crowd is on their feet.

144
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:12,449
This being the Koushien finals, we'll see three matched consecutively.

145
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,149
And now, Kikuchi faces off against Inao.

146
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:20,349
And here comes the pitch.

147
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,849
-Strike! -Strike.

148
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:31,449
The pitcher and the catcher exchange signs.

149
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,349
And now, the second pitch.

150
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,449
-Strike two! -Strike.

151
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:47,649
Now, it's two strikes. Thanks to a mean curveball.

152
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:51,449
The next batter, Nagashima is on deck.

153
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,849
Strike, batter out!

154
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:02,049
Ohgane High School's Inao holds off Konan High School

155
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,149
with some aggressive pitching.

156
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,149
That's the end of the 1st,

157
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,949
as Ohgane High School and Konan High School switch up.

158
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:11,149
Konan High School's Sakuraba now takes the mound.

159
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:14,849
It is the top of the 2nd inning,

160
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:18,049
and center number 6 of Ohgane High School,

161
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:20,449
player Matsuda is the batter.

162
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,349
Strike!

163
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,049
Foul ball!

164
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:42,149
The finals are amazing.

165
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,349
Strike, batter out!

166
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:56,149
Number seven, third player Morita.

167
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:12,649
Strike, batter out!

168
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,649
Sakuraba gets three strikes against Morita,

169
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,849
bringing us to two outs.

170
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,649
Number eight catcher, Watanabe.

171
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,849
The catcher, Watanabe steps into the batter's box.

172
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:29,949
The pitcher Sakuraba, with the delivery.

173
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:31,549
He pops it up.

174
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:33,649
-It's going right... -Foul ball!

175
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:34,749
Foul.

176
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,949
Strike!

177
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,949
Strike, batter out!

178
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:59,249
End of the bottom of the 2nd inning,

179
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,949
as Sakuraba from Ohgane High School

180
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:03,249
prevents Konan High School from breaking the no-run tie.

181
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:08,449
Bottom of the 2nd. Hitting for Konan High School.

182
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:12,249
Third baseman, Nagashima.

183
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:17,949
And the batter we've been waiting for takes the box.

184
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:19,749
Konan High School's Nagashima.

185
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,249
Listen to this.

186
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:28,249
The roar of the cheer of the people loud enough to erase the announcement.

187
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:30,349
By some strange coincidence, it turns out that the same players

188
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:31,849
get to compete against each other three times in a row

189
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:34,249
at the finals of Koshien.

190
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:40,549
Will the victor be the winner of last year, Konan High School?

191
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,849
Or will it be Ohgane High School that is aiming

192
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:44,549
to win the spring and summer games successively?

193
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:56,049
The pitcher flings his arms up high

194
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,949
and prepares to throw his first pitch.

195
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:59,049
There goes the ball!

196
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:01,649
Strike!

197
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,749
Talk about strike indeed!

198
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:09,249
Strike. Strike.

199
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,449
Hey, Pops.

200
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,349
What have you been looking at all this time?

201
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,949
Dad. The game's over that side.

202
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:21,149
I bet he's watching the cheerleaders in those stand.

203
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:22,949
Pervert.

204
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,149
We came all the way out here.

205
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:27,649
So watch the game, will you?

206
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:30,049
But...

207
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,249
Sitting in right stand like this,

208
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:35,749
it's so far that you can't really watch the game anyway.

209
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:40,149
I thought we were going to have better seats because you invited us.

210
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:42,549
I'm so sorry.

211
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:44,549
I asked an acquaintance of mine who lives here

212
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:47,049
to line up and get the tickets,

213
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,049
but he seems to have overslept.

214
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:52,549
Inspector Ohtaki.

215
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:56,949
Besides, the game between Ohgane and Konan is super popular.

216
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:58,949
So, unless you come really early in the morning,

217
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:01,649
it seems to be impossible to get an infield seat.

218
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:06,249
That's why you should buy advance tickets.

219
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,649
Nagashima faces off against the pitcher, Inao.

220
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:12,349
Here comes the second ball.

221
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:13,749
He pops it up!

222
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:17,549
It clears the field and goes just foul.

223
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:20,149
Here, have some ice candy. Ice candy.

224
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,449
I bought one for each one of you.

225
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,549
Cold!

226
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:25,949
Thank you.

227
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:27,849
You're welcome.

228
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,549
But are you sure it's okay, Inspector Ohtaki?

229
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:31,749
What about you work?

230
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:35,649
No problem. He took time off anyway.

231
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:36,749
Right?

232
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,849
Yes.

233
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,949
I've been watching the game for three days since the semi-finals.

234
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:44,549
You like Koshien, don't you?

235
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,749
Of course he does.

236
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:51,449
Mr. Ohtaki may not look it, but he used to play high school baseball.

237
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:54,449
Right?

238
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,449
Come on, Kazuha. It's no big deal.

239
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:59,949
Oh, really?

240
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:02,249
How embarrassing.

241
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:07,949
Have you played on this Koshien field, too?

242
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,349
No.

243
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,849
Making it to the best eight for the preliminary district match

244
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,849
was as far as I ever went.

245
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,749
But coming here and watching them play brings back memories.

246
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:34,049
The days when we struggled while covered with sweat and dirt

247
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,349
just to after that one ball.

248
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:46,649
And just by giving the game everything you have.

249
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,649
Just what do you think you're doing, Ohtaki?

250
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,149
There!

251
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:58,349
What's the matter? Missing a ball like that, Ohtaki?

252
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,049
I guess I don't have the knack for playing baseball.

253
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,949
That's not true. Don't give up.

254
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:09,149
All you need to do is practice a little more.

255
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:13,149
Right. I'll practice even more and get better.

256
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:17,349
Hey! Freshman Ohtaki.

257
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,449
Yes, sir?

258
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,749
You'll be the number seven catcher for the practice game

259
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:22,649
against Yakushiji High School that's coming up.

260
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,049
Yes, sir!

261
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:27,049
Hey, fantastic. Let's give it our best shot.

262
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:28,149
Yes.

263
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,249
I wonder if I don't have the knack for baseball?

264
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,049
It's not that.

265
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,049
Don't give up and practice more and more.

266
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:58,349
If you give up before doing anything, that's it.

267
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:01,749
I was really hopeless when I started off, too.

268
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:04,649
But I stayed after school everyday and practiced.

269
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:08,149
Then one day, I realized that I had become captain of my team.

270
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:10,049
You weren't a good player?

271
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,349
No. I was really bad.

272
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:14,749
Are you serious?

273
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:18,249
Yes. So don't give up, okay?

274
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:35,749
Hey, what's with that look of yours?

275
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:39,249
All the underclass men don't know what to do since you look so depressed.

276
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:43,949
Ohtaki, you're the one who lead the weak team to where it is now.

277
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:46,249
The underclass men are the ones who are going to Koshien.

278
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:47,949
Encourage them and make them feel that can do it.

279
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:53,449
I have one last thing I'd like to say to all of you.

280
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:55,549
No matter what...

281
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,849
No matter what, don't ever give up!

282
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,349
Yes, sir...

283
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:11,249
So I really think,

284
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,649
that the effort I put in back then was worth it.

285
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,649
I feel that one should never give up.

286
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:20,649
Really? Koshien is really a good place.

287
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:38,649
What a worthless place this is.

288
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,949
Don't you think so, Hiroshi?
