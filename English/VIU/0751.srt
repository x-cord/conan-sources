1
00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:02,827
Wow, great!

2
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:04,927
Poirot's really on it.

3
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,594
See!

4
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,694
The other day, an interviewer came

5
00:00:08,694 --> 00:00:11,094
and told me that it was going to be published

6
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,894
but I didn't think the article was going to be so big!

7
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:17,294
Your picture's on it too, Azusa.

8
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:18,394
See, over here!

9
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:21,994
It says Tai the calico cat owned by a patron of this shop

10
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:24,394
together with the beautiful waitress Azusa.

11
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:27,294
Oh, true! You're carrying Tai!

12
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:30,894
Geez, calling me a beauty is going too far, no?

13
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:34,694
They usually exaggerate when writing articles like this.

14
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:36,694
I guess so.

15
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:39,794
Your picture's not here Amuro?

16
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:41,894
No. I wasn't feeling good that day

17
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:44,094
so I took a day off.

18
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:46,594
Oh, that's too bad.

19
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:48,594
After all, you're handsome.

20
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:50,794
Well, a member of the Black Organization

21
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:52,394
couldn't afford to show his face that easily

22
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:55,494
on a cheap gourmet magazine like this.

23
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:59,094
By the way, I thought there was one other person in your group?

24
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:01,194
Ai went home already!

25
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:05,294
We invited her to come to Poirot to see Tai.

26
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:07,994
She said she suddenly remember she had something to do.

27
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:09,494
Come to think of it...

28
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:11,094
Where's Tai?

29
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:13,294
Did he already come to eat?

30
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:15,694
No. Well, you see...

31
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:21,294
From last week, Tai's become my pet!

32
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:22,394
What?

33
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:24,794
Is it okay to do something like that?

34
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:28,294
Tai's a stray cat but was wearing a collar,

35
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:30,794
so I think he belonged to someone before.

36
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:31,994
But...

37
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:35,694
The other day, he seems to have fought with a cat in the neighborhood

38
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:37,694
and came along all beat up.

39
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:39,794
So, I got worried.

40
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:42,394
Besides, our picture was put in a magazine too.

41
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,494
If Tai's owner is really looking for him,

42
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:48,494
I figured the owner would come to claim him.

43
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:49,894
But, but...

44
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:52,594
It's not fair keeping Tai all for yourself.

45
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:55,194
Besides, the owner would never come to claim him

46
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:57,694
because the picture's so small!

47
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:59,194
If the picture was posted on the net,

48
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:00,994
it'd be a different story, though.

49
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:02,494
So you'd think, right?

50
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:03,994
But, you'd be surprised.

51
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:05,094
Excuse me.

52
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:09,694
Is this the shop Poirot that was in the magazine?

53
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:10,794
Yes.

54
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,094
It was written in the article, right?

55
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:16,894
That at sundown a stray cat comes to eat cat food.

56
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:19,294
-With its picture and all... -Yes.

57
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:22,294
"Shogo Amezawa (36), Free-lancer" -In fact, that's my cat!

58
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:25,394
I've been looking for it from about half a year ago.

59
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:29,394
Hey! Just what do you think you're saying?

60
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:32,494
"Teiji Masuko (54)" -That's unmistakably my pet cat!

61
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,694
"Company President" -Don't lie!

62
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:36,094
What?

63
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:39,894
Wow. The owner actually showed up.

64
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,294
Moreover, two of them.

65
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:44,894
It... it's not just two of them!

66
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:48,294
The fact is, there's one more person in the shop.

67
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:54,194
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

68
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:55,994
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

69
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:57,694
Three owners come to claim their pet?

70
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,494
Kogoro and Bourbon have a deduction tag match.

71
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:00,994
He sees through the one and only truth.

72
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:02,794
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

73
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:05,394
His name is Detective Conan!

74
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:53,852
"Lucky Calico Cat Case (Part 1)"

75
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:57,852
Hey! Do I have to keep repeating myself?

76
00:04:57,852 --> 00:05:01,052
"Mutsumi Shagawa (61)" -This cat is my granddaughter's pet cat!

77
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,652
"Housewife" -Mugi.

78
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:04,252
Where's Mugi?

79
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:07,252
Weren't you going to bring her here?

80
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:08,352
Yes.

81
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:11,052
I went outside to try to bring the cat

82
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:14,452
but I met these children and while talking to them,

83
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:18,452
these people came claiming that they are the owners.

84
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,852
No, I'm the real owner.

85
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:24,252
No, you're not! I'm telling you it's me, aren't I?

86
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:28,252
Do you people mean to snatch my granddaughter's cat away?

87
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:30,852
Wow! Tai is really popular.

88
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,752
But, why are there three owners?

89
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:36,252
He's only an ordinary calico cat, and yet...

90
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,652
The thing is, he's not ordinary.

91
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:39,752
-What? -What?

92
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:43,452
I do think he's smart

93
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:46,852
because when we were trapped in the car of the bad courier guys,

94
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:50,952
Tai seems to have delivered Conan's message here.

95
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:53,852
Back then, Tai really did a good job!

96
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,552
But... Although he delivered it,

97
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:59,452
that message was blown away by the wind, right?

98
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:00,452
Yes.

99
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:01,652
At any rate.

100
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:05,252
Please go back home and bring Tai here!

101
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:06,452
Okay.

102
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,352
While we're waiting,

103
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:12,152
let's hear what the three people have to say, separately.

104
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:15,652
Let's ask the master of solving mysteries to join us too.

105
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:18,952
Master of solving mysteries?

106
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:20,552
Don't tell me...

107
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:23,852
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What? Searching for the owner of a cat?

108
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:26,152
-The horses are all starting off at once. -Go have somebody else do it!

109
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,752
I'm busy now!

110
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,052
Geez.

111
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:31,852
Goro.

112
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,252
Why's he here?

113
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:36,852
This cat is that scary lady's cat, right?

114
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:39,252
Scary lady...

115
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:42,152
Mom's on a business trip in Fukuoka,

116
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,152
so I was asked to take care of him for the night!

117
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:47,952
Go home! Go home!

118
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:51,552
Nobody's paying me for the job, right?

119
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:54,552
Then, I'll ask you to do the job.

120
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:57,052
The payment for the job will be a premium seat ticket

121
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,052
for the Yoko Okino Summer Live.

122
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:04,752
First of all, claiming to be the owner...

123
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:07,252
Mrs. Shagawa, you're a housewife?

124
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:08,252
Yes.

125
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:11,052
He's really a super simpleton.

126
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:14,752
And? When did your cat disappear?

127
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:16,852
About 2 months ago.

128
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:20,652
We asked a friend to watch it for us since we went on a family trip.

129
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:24,752
But, it seems to have gotten away when my friend wasn't watching.

130
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:26,952
This is the picture of my granddaughter,

131
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:29,452
the owner of the cat.

132
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,552
This was taken 5 years ago.

133
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:35,052
I see. It still seems to be a kitten, though.

134
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:38,952
It's true that the pattern on its body looks similar.

135
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:42,052
Right? You think so too, don't you, Mr. Detective?

136
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:43,152
Yes.

137
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:46,052
Then do you like cats too, ma'am?

138
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:48,252
Yes, of course.

139
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:51,552
Okay. Come here, come here.

140
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:57,952
Oh, my. This cat is quite shy, no?

141
00:07:57,952 --> 00:08:00,152
It likes you a lot, doesn't it?

142
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:03,052
It's not my cat though.

143
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:04,652
The cat in question had traces of it

144
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:08,352
having been neutered.

145
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:10,552
We had a tough time back then.

146
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:13,352
It was hospitalized for a night and came back

147
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,852
but we couldn't take the bandage off for a while.

148
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:19,752
It took about a week to get the stitches removed.

149
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:23,952
Mr. Masuko, President of an IT company.

150
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:27,952
You're the 2nd candidate for owner.

151
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:30,152
When did the whereabouts of your cat become unknown?

152
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:34,252
Just about 4 months ago when I moved.

153
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:37,852
My wife of 30 years passed on.

154
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:42,152
I sold my house and moved to a condo.

155
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:46,252
I thought I had it in a cage and carried it onto the truck

156
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:50,452
but when it came time to get off it was gone from its cage.

157
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:52,452
Do you have a picture or something?

158
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:55,352
If it's one that I took with my cell phone.

159
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:58,052
The one in the picture with the cat is my wife.

160
00:08:58,052 --> 00:08:59,852
I'm the one who took the picture.

161
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:04,452
This cat is the exact duplicate of the cat at Poirot.

162
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:08,252
Of course, because it's the same cat.

163
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:10,552
Then, do you like cats too, sir?

164
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:11,552
Yeah.

165
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,052
Would you like to carry him?

166
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,652
Do you have a cold?

167
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:19,652
Maybe so...

168
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:23,552
By the way, was your cat neutered?

169
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:25,652
Yes. But I'm not sure

170
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:29,152
because I used to leave things like that up to my wife.

171
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,852
Only, even after the surgery,

172
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:32,752
there was no bandage around it but for some reason,

173
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:38,152
I remember it had what looked like a parabola antenna on its neck.

174
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:41,352
I'm telling you if you let me see the cat,

175
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:43,952
you'll be able to see for yourself right away

176
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:46,152
that I'm the owner.

177
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,952
Well, let me hear you out either way.

178
00:09:48,952 --> 00:09:51,052
Free-lancer, Mr. Amezawa.

179
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:53,052
When did your cat disappear?

180
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,152
About a half year ago.

181
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:58,852
I like being free, so likewise with my cat.

182
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:02,452
One day, it suddenly didn't come home!

183
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,152
Then, do you have a picture of it?

184
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,252
What makes you think I'd have something like that?

185
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,352
I let it go free.

186
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:10,652
Then, you like cats, don't you?

187
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,452
Yeah. Of course.

188
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:15,852
Come here!

189
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,052
No joke.

190
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,652
Goro isn't that much of a friendly cat, and yet...

191
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:25,952
It seems that animals take well to me.

192
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:29,752
Then, do you remember neutering your cat?

193
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:30,852
I wonder...

194
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:35,152
Somebody gave it to me after it was quite an adult already.

195
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:36,552
By the way,

196
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,552
the article addressed Tai as if it were a male

197
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:40,952
but it's actually a female cat.

198
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:45,152
Well... Then, maybe it's not mine.

199
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:46,352
Just what do you think you're saying?

200
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,052
Tai's a male!

201
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:49,852
He had balls.

202
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,352
Is that right?

203
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,552
Don't scare me! I'm sure it's a male!

204
00:10:57,552 --> 00:11:00,052
"Mouri Detective Agency"

205
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:04,052
So, who among those three was the owner?

206
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:06,452
Maybe it was that young man after all?

207
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:08,852
Goro really liked him too.

208
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:11,552
But, the picture that the man had in his cell phone

209
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:13,752
looked just like Tai.

210
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:17,552
But, he himself, wasn't in the picture.

211
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,652
What about the picture the lady showed us?

212
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:24,652
But that was a picture of the cat when it was a kitten.

213
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:27,052
What do you think, Conan?

214
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:30,352
-I'm not really sure yet. -The final straight course.

215
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:32,652
-That's it! Go! -Dad, turn the volume down.

216
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:34,452
Everybody's thinking you know!

217
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:35,452
Noise?

218
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:37,952
That's right.

219
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,752
I'll let Ai know too.

220
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,852
Three people showed up claiming to be Tai's owner?

221
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:45,852
And? How was it?

222
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:50,152
They're all thinking really hard who the owner really is.

223
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:53,352
I mean, what does Conan think?

224
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:54,752
How does he look?

225
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:02,152
He's grinning wearing a mischievous look.

226
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:03,952
If so, it'll be fine.

227
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:06,452
I guess he's found the owner.

228
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,659
Hey, hey, just what is the meaning of this?

229
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,859
Didn't you gather us here because you found the owner?

230
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:22,559
So, Azusa from Poirot

231
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,259
will be bringing the calico cat here soon.

232
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:29,259
If so, why didn't you say so to start with?

233
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,959
We'll all find out who the owner is

234
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,659
as soon as we see the cat.

235
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:37,059
But, in my case, my granddaughter is the owner.

236
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:39,159
Thank you for waiting!

237
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,259
Tai!

238
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,859
See! It's my cat after all!

239
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:53,359
Okay, I'm taking this cat home with me, then!

240
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:56,759
But, if there are three people,

241
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,559
cats have a tendency to go to the person in the middle.

242
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,959
It could be that Tai jumped on you

243
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,159
because you happened to be in the middle.

244
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,959
-What? -Is that true, Conan?

245
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,559
Yes! I saw it on TV the other day.

246
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,659
I'm sure he's right!

247
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,659
Otherwise my cat would never go to a shady guy like him.

248
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,959
Then, try it again!

249
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,159
I don't care if I'm on the left or the right!

250
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,359
There's a better way do it!

251
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:27,059
An experiment that will nail the owner at once!

252
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:29,559
Azusa, are you ready?

253
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,359
Yes! Tai's eating his food in front of the door of the office.

254
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,759
Will each of you approach the door and open it?

255
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,959
If it's one to one,

256
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,059
I'm sure the cat will be able to distinguish its owner.

257
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,059
First you, Mrs. Shagawa.

258
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,059
Yes.

259
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,759
Come, Mugi. It's me!

260
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,359
Can't you tell?

261
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,759
Mugi!

262
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,459
It... it's no good after all unless it's my granddaughter, the owner.

263
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,859
No. It's the same even if she were here!

264
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:13,159
Because that cat that you're looking for,

265
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,759
unlike that cat is a female cat.

266
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,959
What?

267
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,459
That right, isn't it, Amuro?

268
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,759
Yeah, Mrs. Shagawa, you mentioned, didn't you?

269
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,359
That when the cat was spayed, the cat was hospitalized...

270
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,059
And it took a week before the stitches were removed.

271
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,159
Yes.

272
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,059
That was because the cat was spayed

273
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,659
and not neutered.

274
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:39,159
Spaying is surgery that includes making an abdominal incision

275
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,159
and removing the ovaries.

276
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,159
But neutering involves only a slight incision

277
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,659
to remove the testes.

278
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,659
So hospitalization isn't necessary.

279
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:51,459
Well, just as Mr. Masuko mentioned,

280
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,159
all it takes is putting a collar around the cat's neck

281
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,559
so it doesn't lick the spot.

282
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,059
Besides, ma'am,

283
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:02,159
you mentioned that you kept the cat together with your granddaughter

284
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,659
but wasn't it that she just used to bring the cat over

285
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,359
to your place only sometimes?

286
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,959
Because you're not used to handling the cat!

287
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,759
Other than the owner,

288
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,059
cats don't like being stared at.

289
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:17,659
That's why back then,

290
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:22,259
the cat went over to Uncle Kogoro who isn't interested in it!

291
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:26,559
You were probably asked by your granddaughter to take care of the cat

292
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,759
because she had to leave the house,

293
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,459
but it got away, right?

294
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,459
It's exactly as you say, sonny.

295
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,959
My granddaughter's on a school trip

296
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:39,159
and her parents took this opportunity to travel abroad.

297
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:42,459
I was asked to take care of the cat

298
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,659
but it wouldn't take too well to me.

299
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,659
And the minute I took my eyes off it,

300
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:50,159
it disappeared.

301
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,759
I was at a loss as to what to do

302
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,859
then I saw the picture of that cat in the magazine.

303
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,659
So, you decided that you wanted Poirot's cat

304
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,159
in place of the cat that disappeared?

305
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,559
But, I think a male and female

306
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,559
have different physical characteristics.

307
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,859
But, my granddaughter's coming back from her school trip tonight!

308
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:15,359
I've got to do something by then or I can't face up to her.

309
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,159
When did your cat disappear?

310
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,259
Last night after it finished eating cat food.

311
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,359
I looked all over under furniture

312
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,459
and places where the door were open

313
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,459
but to no avail.

314
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,159
Then, try looking in places where the doors are closed,

315
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,459
like in the bathroom, in the washing machine

316
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,559
or in the closet for example.

317
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,959
Cats tend to slide in the moment doors are opened.

318
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,859
I'll try looking once more!

319
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:48,859
Gosh. What a granny.

320
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:51,859
Next! Try it Mr. Amezawa!

321
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:54,659
Just like Mrs. Shagawa did right now!

322
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:56,859
Okay! Sure!

323
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:58,559
Well, even before doing it,

324
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,559
the result is obvious though.

325
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,359
Right, Conan.

326
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,859
Just like a while ago.

327
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:07,259
The cat's going to jump on him and purr.

328
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,159
Hey, what's the matter?

329
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,359
Come like you did before.

330
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,259
I'm telling you come here!

331
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,859
Don't you know?

332
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:25,559
Catnip's only good for 5 to 10 minutes.

333
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,159
After that, to the cat...

334
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:32,359
you're only a scary man shouting.

335
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,559
As proof of that,

336
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,559
even Goro who was frolicking with you at first

337
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,759
is afraid of you and doesn't even attempt to go near you!

338
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,859
Well, the real owner wouldn't sprinkle catnip over his body

339
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:48,959
when coming to pick the cat up.

340
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,959
Well, this is...

341
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:55,159
Besides, you were about to leave on the spot

342
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,259
when Conan mentioned that the cat was female, no?

343
00:17:58,259 --> 00:17:59,659
If you saw the picture in the magazine

344
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:02,059
and was sure it was your cat,

345
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,359
you would've insisted a lot more.

346
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,859
You knew, didn't you?

347
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,459
That the cat was worthless if it were female.

348
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,159
Worth? It's only a mix, isn't it?

349
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,959
True for female calicos but...

350
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,859
As for males because of chromosomal aberration,

351
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,859
only one out of a thousand are born.

352
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:24,259
Because of this rarity value,

353
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,259
they have served as models for the so-called luck cats.

354
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:29,059
They're worth at least 1 million yen.

355
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,459
I've heard that some were even priced as high as 20 million yen.

356
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,359
Twenty million yen?

357
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,459
No joke.

358
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:38,859
-Wow, Tai! -Just as valuable as the white lion!

359
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:42,859
If that much money, I could eat unlimited eels over rice.

360
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:45,859
You apparently knew what it was worth,

361
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:49,159
so would never have let it go free in a city like this, no?

362
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:55,059
Excuse me!

363
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,859
Lastly, Mr. Masuko, please try doing it.

364
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:02,059
Okay.

365
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,259
But, I haven't seen him for 4 months,

366
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:08,659
and my wife used to feed him most of the time...

367
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:13,959
I may end up with the same result as the other two.

368
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,659
Souseki.

369
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,559
You remembered me, Souseki.

370
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:27,359
But, why?

371
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,059
It seems he was waiting for you in front of the door

372
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,959
even before you opened it.

373
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,059
The sound.

374
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:37,759
They said on TV that cats have super good ears

375
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,959
and can tell the footsteps of their owners!

376
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:44,159
You said that your cat disappeared when you moved

377
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,259
but were you using the Cheetah Movers back then?

378
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:51,359
Yeah... But, how'd you know?

379
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,059
Because some time ago that cat

380
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:58,359
jumped into the container of the same courier.

381
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,659
I see.

382
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,859
He wanted to go back to his owner!

383
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:06,059
He thought that he could get home

384
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,959
if he got on a truck with the same mark on it.

385
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:10,259
I'm happy for you, Tai.

386
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:18,459
Thank you so much for everything.

387
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,359
Bye, Tai!

388
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,759
Take care!

389
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,059
Don't run away anymore!

390
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:33,559
This is my address and e-mail address.

391
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:36,159
You can come over if you want and I'm home!

392
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,359
Really? Thank you.

393
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:44,259
But, I didn't know

394
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:47,359
that cats were attracted to people in the middle.

395
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,659
That's not true.

396
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:54,059
I had to say that in order to carry out the footsteps experiment.

397
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:59,859
I lied by faking an innocent smile as sweet as a cat.

398
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,759
You see... After all we're dealing with a cat.

399
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,359
Is that supposed to be a pun or something?

400
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:34,259
"A week later" -But, I didn't think he'd actually call us.

401
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,959
An e-mail was received at the detective agency saying,

402
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,759
to come today if we want to see the cat, right?

403
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,859
-Yeah. -It's only been just a few days yet since then.

404
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:44,459
I wonder why?

405
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:47,459
Maybe he decided to give it away, after all?

406
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,159
It seemed he was allergic to cats too.

407
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,059
Allergic to cats?

408
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,559
And yet he kept a cat?

409
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,759
Well, there are times when you keep a cat

410
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,059
not knowing that you're allergic to it.

411
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:02,059
Or even become allergic while keeping it.

412
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:05,559
But I wonder if he's going to sell it after all?

413
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:09,459
-What? -After all, it's 20 million yen.

414
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:12,159
It's that room, right, Mr. Masuko's place?

415
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,859
At any rate, please open the door!

416
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,659
Because I heard a strange sound!

417
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,059
Mr. Masuko! This is the Manager!

418
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:23,859
Are you all right?

419
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,159
What's with this cat?

420
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,859
Sir! Is anything wrong?

421
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:34,259
Well, although this cat doesn't seem to be hurt,

422
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,059
it's got blood on its paws.

423
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,259
Which means...

424
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:38,759
Don't tell me that Mr. Masuko...

425
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,259
Don't tell me...

426
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,059
There's blood on the paws.

427
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,159
I'm sure something happened inside!

428
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:53,559
Do you guys have a string or something?

429
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,959
The room beyond?

430
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,759
There's no time for you two to be lovey-dovey!

431
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,159
The tape and scissors are here...

432
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,059
but the wastebasket nearby is empty.

433
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:11,059
Why that think isn't it here?

434
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,459
Next Conan,

435
