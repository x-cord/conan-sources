1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:02,153
Lately...

2
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:04,053
Ran's been acting strange.

3
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,453
She's oddly excited.

4
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:09,953
Curious, the old man and I decided

5
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:12,453
to follow Ran on her outing.

6
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:18,053
Ran met Sonoko and Sera at a cafe,

7
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:21,053
where they began discussing some kind of trip.

8
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,853
Furthermore...

9
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:26,853
I wonder if we'll get to see Okita.

10
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,753
Okita?

11
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:33,653
You mean that guy who's just like Kudo?

12
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:34,853
Yeah.

13
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:37,453
Come to think of it,

14
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:41,153
he said he lives in Kyoto's Kamigyo Ward.

15
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:43,553
Which means...

16
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:44,853
Is Ran...

17
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:49,053
going to Kyoto to see Okita?

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,853
There's no way.

19
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:56,653
It's incidental.

20
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:59,553
She's just incidentally meeting Okita on her trip to Kyoto.

21
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:02,753
Maybe we'll incidentally run into Shinichi, too.

22
00:01:02,753 --> 00:01:03,853
Yeah.

23
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:07,653
Incidental?

24
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:09,853
Seeing me is incidental?

25
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:12,253
While this was happening,

26
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:14,453
we heard a scream from the back of the cafe,

27
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:18,653
where the body of waiter Daiki Saraie was discovered.

28
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:22,053
That locker with the broken padlock...

29
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:25,153
Was that the victim's?

30
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:29,153
Yes, that's Saraie's locker.

31
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:34,753
Which means the culprit may have been after its contents.

32
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:44,353
It's been badly ransacked.

33
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:47,653
Do you have any idea what was stolen?

34
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:51,653
I'm not sure. Only its owner would know for sure.

35
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:57,253
Why is this the only locker with a padlock?

36
00:01:57,253 --> 00:02:01,353
He's been using it since he started working here.

37
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:05,153
I did think he was overly cautious.

38
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:08,053
The culprit really smashed the padlock.

39
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:10,753
How were they able to break it like this?

40
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:19,753
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

41
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,953
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

42
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:23,653
More than the padlocked locker,

43
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:25,753
the girl's trip to Kyoto has captured my interest.

44
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,253
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,153
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:31,353
His name is Detective Conan.

47
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:18,258
"The High School Girl Trio's Secret Cafe (Part 2)"

48
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:25,192
I see pliers, a hammer, screwdrivers, and a spanner.

49
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:28,692
None of those could break a padlock like that.

50
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,692
You're right.

51
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:34,692
The only other thing in here are these screws and nails.

52
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,092
Sorry.

53
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,092
"Isuzu Naomura (27), Waiter"

54
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,392
I remember now!

55
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:56,392
What?

56
00:04:56,392 --> 00:05:00,492
Something Saraie kept carefully locked in his locker.

57
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:02,392
It was his tablet.

58
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:06,092
He often typed on it while smoking.

59
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:08,992
Maybe that's what was stolen.

60
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:11,692
What was he typing?

61
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,992
I asked, but he never told me.

62
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:15,392
It was his blog.

63
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:16,792
"Toshinori Motosu (38), Customer" -His blog.

64
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:22,192
That man wrote a food blog under the handle "the Stuffed Professor".

65
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:25,592
He made lots of posts disparaging rival restaurants.

66
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,092
I've seen that blog.

67
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:31,392
It's pretty popular for its funny writing, right?

68
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:33,292
That's right.

69
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,692
That's why it's so difficult to handle.

70
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:41,592
My restaurant is hard up because of that blog.

71
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,792
I see.

72
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,792
That's why you stopped Sonoko

73
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:50,492
from telling him the address of Poirot and its delicious sandwiches.

74
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:52,692
Yeah.

75
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:58,292
Why do you and the manager

76
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,792
have different family names when you're siblings?

77
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:03,492
Is it because the manager is married?

78
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:06,892
No, I'm getting married next month.

79
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:11,392
My brother's father-in-law was apparently a stubborn man.

80
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:13,392
He said he wouldn't let him marry his only daughter

81
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:16,192
unless he took his name and took over the restaurant.

82
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,792
He had no choice.

83
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,092
Come to think of it,

84
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:23,292
Isuzu, since your family started its own branch of the restaurant,

85
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,492
have they not been victimized by that man's blog?

86
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:29,792
Yes. They're barely keeping the place open.

87
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:32,392
But the restaurant is as deserted as ever.

88
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,292
They're apparently drowning in debt.

89
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:37,392
So you say.

90
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:40,392
Are you sure that business isn't going under because of his blog,

91
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:42,992
so you killed him?

92
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:46,792
Then I would've complained to him like Motosu instead!

93
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:52,392
I was the restaurant's poster girl.

94
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:57,492
I had no idea Saraie was running that kind of blog.

95
00:06:57,492 --> 00:07:01,092
Even though you lived with him for a year.

96
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:04,792
Hey, that's irrelevant right now.

97
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,992
You lived together?

98
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:09,892
You were living with the victim?

99
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:14,092
Well, yeah. It was five years ago.

100
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:17,592
Then it's possible he was threatening to show

101
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:21,892
embarrassing photos of you from when you two dated...

102
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:26,492
to your fiance unless you paid him.

103
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:28,292
What?

104
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:30,892
If he was causing mischief with his blog,

105
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,392
then it's all the more likely.

106
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:35,292
He didn't have any money problems.

107
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,892
He was going to become the new manager

108
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:41,192
after I got married and quit my job.

109
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,592
He mentioned that to me, too.

110
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:45,892
He said since he'd be the next manager,

111
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:49,092
I wouldn't have to worry about money if I became his girlfriend.

112
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:55,592
Which means the culprit is the former chef.

113
00:07:56,892 --> 00:08:01,692
How did I carry this vase back here?

114
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:04,892
I returned my keys when I quit.

115
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:11,592
Which means you had a key once.

116
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,292
You had the opportunity to make a copy.

117
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:18,292
I told you, I dislocated my wrist.

118
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:23,492
You can fake that easily by wrapping yourself in bandages,

119
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:26,892
and make it seem like it was dislocated all along.

120
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,792
Then ask the hospital!

121
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,692
They should have X-rays!

122
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:38,092
I see. So that's how it is.

123
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:43,092
But any of them

124
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:46,392
could've pulled off this trick.

125
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:50,092
Who did it?

126
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:51,592
Hey, Ran.

127
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,792
Don't you think he's acting different?

128
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,492
Who is?

129
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:57,792
Over there. Him.

130
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:01,992
The brat with the glasses.

131
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:05,592
Normally, he interrupts with stuff like "huh?"

132
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:11,592
Or "that's weird" when there's a case.

133
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,292
Yeah, but...

134
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:18,292
Conan seems to be thinking about the case.

135
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,492
I've seen him scowling.

136
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:26,092
What's going on?

137
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:27,892
You can't figure it out?

138
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,192
No.

139
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,692
I don't have a clue.

140
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,292
I figured out the trick.

141
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:37,292
Unfortunately, I don't know who the culprit is yet.

142
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,692
The culprit?

143
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:43,492
I figured that out when we entered the changing room.

144
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,592
And the trick they used, too.

145
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:47,592
What?

146
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:50,892
Then when you say you don't have a clue...

147
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:53,792
It's your trip.

148
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,692
She said it's an unusual trip I'd experience when I'm older.

149
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:00,792
What kind of trip is that?

150
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:03,492
What? You're worried about that?

151
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:07,492
An outsider?

152
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:11,692
You're saying this murder was committed by an outsider, Inspector?

153
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:14,992
I'm saying it's possible.

154
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:17,792
But all three of them

155
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:21,892
had motive to murder Saraie.

156
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:23,292
Yeah.

157
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:27,092
The former chef Toshinori Motosu

158
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:30,092
had his own restaurant harshly criticized on the victim's blog.

159
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:34,392
The waitress Isuzu Naomura

160
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,092
was being harassed by the victim.

161
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:40,792
The manager Tamao Hasunuma

162
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,092
is getting married next month,

163
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:47,292
and it's possible her ex-boyfriend, the victim, was threatening her.

164
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:51,192
But when the nearly 30 kilo vase

165
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,392
that is the murder weapon is filled with water,

166
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:57,492
I doubt any of them could lift it.

167
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,692
And there aren't any tools here

168
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,592
that could be used to break the padlock on the victim's locker.

169
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:05,992
But, Inspector,

170
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:10,792
no one else could have brought the vase back here.

171
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:15,592
This window was open when Saraie's body was discovered.

172
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,192
It's possible he opened it to smoke,

173
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,192
but the manager said

174
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:26,592
she may have forgotten to confirm that it was locked.

175
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:30,292
If it was left open,

176
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:32,792
then someone could have entered through the window at night

177
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,592
and carried the vase here.

178
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,992
They could've seen Saraie smoking

179
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:40,192
with the window open from outside,

180
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:42,592
entered through the service entrance,

181
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:45,992
and clubbed him to death using the vase.

182
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:52,192
An incredibly strong someone who could swing a water-filled vase

183
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:55,992
weighing over 40 kilos and smash the padlock.

184
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:57,992
That's a decoy.

185
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,392
What?

186
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:03,192
I doubt the culprit was particularly strong at all.

187
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:04,892
Right, Conan?

188
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:09,492
Conan?

189
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:13,392
Darn it!

190
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:17,092
I got them, Mouri.

191
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:19,592
A padlock and two spanners.

192
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:22,792
What? I didn't ask you to buy those.

193
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:26,092
What? But Sera said...

194
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:28,192
Let's get started.

195
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,392
I'll show you how to break a padlock

196
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:35,192
with hardly any force at all,

197
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:39,192
and club a man to death using a heavy vase.

198
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,998
First, the padlock.

199
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:52,398
There was a toolbox inside those drawers, right?

200
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:57,198
It's ready.

201
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:01,598
And inside there are two spanners just like these, right?

202
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:05,098
Yeah, they're here.

203
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:06,098
Okay.

204
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:11,098
If you jam both spanners into the U-shaped spanner

205
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:15,498
of the locked padlock

206
00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:18,498
and apply your weight from above...

207
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:25,998
See?

208
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,098
It's broken.

209
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,098
You're right.

210
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,798
That's amazing.

211
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:33,598
Yeah, but...

212
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:36,298
there weren't any marks left on the locker

213
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:40,498
that would indicate the padlock was broken using spanners.

214
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:44,498
Close, Detective, but no cigar.

215
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:50,198
That's because after killing Saraie,

216
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:52,598
the culprit took the key from his body,

217
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,598
unlocked and removed the padlock,

218
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:57,998
broke it using the method I just showed you,

219
00:13:57,998 --> 00:14:01,698
and then reattached it to the locker.

220
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:03,998
They even ransacked the inside of the locker

221
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:05,798
so it looked like the culprit

222
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:10,398
was after the contents of Saraie's locker.

223
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:14,698
What about the contents of the locker?

224
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:18,098
I doubt anything was stolen.

225
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:24,698
But those tools aren't enough to swing that vase.

226
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,198
They didn't need to swing it.

227
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:30,498
Oh, my.

228
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:35,398
Hey, be careful!

229
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:36,598
Sorry.

230
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:40,098
Could you get that spanner from underneath the drawers?

231
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:42,698
What?

232
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,698
Gosh.

233
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:46,598
Why do I have to do this?

234
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:49,798
Darn it.

235
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:52,798
It's pretty far back. I can't reach it.

236
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,398
They forcefully dropped the vase

237
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:00,398
on top of the victim's head like this.

238
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,498
I see.

239
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:07,498
They asked the victim to get something from underneath the drawers

240
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:09,098
so they could kill him

241
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:12,098
by simply lifting the vase instead of swinging it.

242
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:15,098
After propping the victim up like this,

243
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:17,698
they put the flowers they had in their locker

244
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,198
in the vase, filled it with water,

245
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,698
and pushed the vase towards the blood splatter

246
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:26,898
on the floor caused by the impact.

247
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:29,998
This removed the blood splatter,

248
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:32,398
while also creating the illusion

249
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:38,098
that the vase had always contained water.

250
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:39,198
Remember?

251
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,198
You said you could wrap your wrist in bandages later

252
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,798
to make it seem like it was dislocated all along.

253
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:48,798
It's just like that.

254
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,098
-And? -Who's the culprit?

255
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:55,598
The trick you just described...

256
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:58,098
Could've been used by any of them.

257
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:03,398
Well...

258
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,798
I know, right?

259
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:11,398
-Hey, you. -After all that...

260
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:13,998
You don't know who did it?

261
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:15,798
Socks.

262
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:23,098
You were wearing socks earlier,

263
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:25,298
so why aren't you now?

264
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:26,498
What?

265
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:29,998
You were wearing socks when you picked up

266
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:31,898
the pieces of the glass I broke.

267
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:35,298
Why did you take them off?

268
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:37,998
I... I'm a sweaty person.

269
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,898
They were drenched in sweat.

270
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:43,298
They were gross, so I took them off.

271
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:46,698
Really?

272
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:48,898
Yes, really.

273
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:50,698
I see.

274
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:53,698
So it's not because you got blood

275
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:56,598
on your socks when you dropped the vase?

276
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:00,298
That's it.

277
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,198
Your shoes and pants are black,

278
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:04,498
so blood isn't visible on them,

279
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:08,098
but you were forced to remove your socks.

280
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,798
Huh?

281
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:16,198
There's something under the drawers.

282
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:21,598
You're right. Is that a pearl earring?

283
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:24,598
It looks like it's stuck to the floor.

284
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:28,198
I see.

285
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:30,798
You asked Saraie to use the vacuum

286
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,398
to suck up the earring underneath the drawers

287
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:38,798
using the narrow hose attachment.

288
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,798
But if it was stuck there with glue,

289
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:43,498
it would've been difficult to get.

290
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:45,798
So while he was lying on the floor,

291
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,998
you dropped the vase on him.

292
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:52,798
But where did she get all this water?

293
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:03,498
Gosh. What are you doing, brat?

294
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:07,198
But isn't this Naomura's locker?

295
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,698
I see.

296
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,798
She divided the water into plastic bottles

297
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,198
and hid them in her locker.

298
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:16,798
And she could stop the flowers from wilting

299
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,898
by putting them in the filled water bottles.

300
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,598
But why, Isuzu?

301
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,998
Why kill Saraie?

302
00:18:24,998 --> 00:18:30,298
He criticized my family's restaurant on his blog as well.

303
00:18:30,998 --> 00:18:34,998
Though it's gone now since my parents killed themselves

304
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,298
over their debt.

305
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:39,998
What?

306
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,698
So you did do it for revenge.

307
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:52,898
No. At first, I had no intention to kill him.

308
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:57,098
My father fell ill, so my mother was cooking instead.

309
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:59,998
It's true that the quality of our dishes had declined.

310
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:02,898
I decided to get a job here

311
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:07,698
because I heard the owner of the blog was a waiter here.

312
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:12,798
I wanted to give him a piece of my mind.

313
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,098
"I'm the poster girl of a restaurant you ruined!"

314
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:18,898
"Laugh it up!"

315
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:22,598
But do you know what he said when he met me?

316
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:25,298
Hey, you're cute.

317
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,898
Are you from Tokyo?

318
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:28,898
Do you want to go out with me?

319
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:39,498
He didn't know you were the poster girl?

320
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:43,498
No. He wrote on his blog that the quality of the food had dropped.

321
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,098
He claimed to be disappointed

322
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,998
after dining regularly at our restaurant for years.

323
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,198
But he never ate our restaurant's food!

324
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:55,498
He criticized us based only on rumors and our image!

325
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,198
I couldn't forgive him for that,

326
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:05,498
so I dropped a vase on the head of a man

327
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,998
who called himself "the Stuffed Professor"

328
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,398
with a stomach full of murder.

329
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:39,798
What an awful case.

330
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,898
I guess you shouldn't trust blogs like that.

331
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:46,298
That was amazing, Conan.

332
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:49,198
I can't believe you noticed her socks.

333
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,898
It was a coincidence.

334
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:54,898
Didn't you know the moment we entered the crime scene?

335
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:59,498
I saw that she wasn't wearing any socks,

336
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:03,398
and the victim's elbow was dirty.

337
00:22:03,398 --> 00:22:06,698
I thought he might have been doing something while lying on the floor

338
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:09,498
and looked under the drawers

339
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:12,398
and saw the earring stuck to the floor.

340
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:16,298
What are you talking about?

341
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,198
You can't tell if something's stuck to the floor

342
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:20,098
just by looking at it.

343
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:21,298
I could tell.

344
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,798
"Floor" -Normally, if a pearl earring fell on the floor,

345
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:26,998
the post would be touching the floor due to its weight,

346
00:22:26,998 --> 00:22:29,698
but the post of that earring was pointing upwards.

347
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:36,898
Wow!

348
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,698
Conan, you might be a genius!

349
00:22:39,698 --> 00:22:41,898
There's nothing amazing about it.

350
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:43,098
What?

351
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:47,698
I spent all that time thinking about it,

352
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,798
but I still don't understand your trip.

353
00:22:56,198 --> 00:22:58,598
Conan, you're so cute.

354
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:01,598
He really is a little kid.

355
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:03,298
You stupid little kid!

356
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:07,398
I told you...

357
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:09,498
That trip is...

358
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:12,298
Your standard high school...

359
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:14,498
School trip!

360
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,498
Really?

361
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,798
I gave you the handout.

362
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:24,198
I totally forgot!

363
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:28,798
I doubt even Shinichi would miss this trip.

364
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:32,398
You think he'll come?

365
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:34,598
I'm excited.

366
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:36,998
Well, yeah.

367
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,798
I...

368
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,698
I really want to go!

369
00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:45,498
"Next Episode"

370
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:49,998
But we saw him smoking cigarettes. Right, Ran?

371
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:54,398
Yeah. From right around here, when we gave them our gift.

372
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:58,298
It's probably safe to assume there was no foul play.

373
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:00,598
It's become clear to me

374
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:04,298
that this is a murder made to look like an accident.

375
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:13,598
