00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,570
HISHIDA Hall Renovation Commemorative Lecture

2
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,490
Sorry I'm late.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,119
Mom!

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,440
Hello.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,219
Took you long enough.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,669
How long were you going to make us wait?

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,000
I've been holding off from drinking beer.

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,500
I didn't ask you to do that. Drink if you want to.

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,879
I found time in my busy schedule for this.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,929
What was that?!

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,890
What?

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,850
Jeez... Stop!

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,150
You're not here to argue today.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,730
You're having a meeting.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,989
Then this is none of my business. You don't need me here.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,399
Hey, one large beer!

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,120
Yes, sir.

18
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,890
I'll be leaving immediately, so water's fine.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Mom!

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,379
I'm sorry, but I really don't have the time.

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,659
But I'll be there tomorrow.

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,999
Yes! Isn't that great, Conan-kun?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,130
Huh? Uh, yeah.

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,050
Like I said, this is none of my business.

25
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,189
No one asked you to come.

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,559
You don't have to force yourself.

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,210
Dad!

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,690
I think I'll be able to make the panel during the second half.

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,190
I'll make sure to get there on time.

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,940
So you'll be going onstage together.

31
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,319
Yeah, that's right.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,750
It's the best. Right, Dad?

33
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,850
Either way, I'm the star of the show.

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,440
Yes, yes. Congratulations on your lecture.

35
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,320
I should go.

36
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,970
Oh, no!

37
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,720
University Professor Murdered

38
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,040
Huh? Someone was just looking over here.

39
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,150
Thanks. See you later.

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,530
They're gone?

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,030
Did I imagine that?

42
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,939
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness!

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,829
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills!

44
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,499
The old man's invited to give a lecture.

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,689
What will happen when the couple goes onstage?

46
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,279
Always determining the one truth

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,920
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,300
his name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,990
Mori Kogoro's Grand Lecture (Part One)

50
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,700
HISHIDA Hall Renovation Commemorative Lecture

51
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,710
1 Hour Before the Lecture

52
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,379
Boy, I'm nervous.

53
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,260
Hey, you! Another!

54
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,950
Dad, are you okay?

55
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,749
If you get drunk, you won't be able to give your talk.

56
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,859
Don't worry.

57
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,850
It'll be more fun with a little drink in me.

58
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,349
Well, it doesn't seem like he'll need me today.

59
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,909
I hope not.

60
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,279
Ready, and...

61
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,290
Congratulations!

62
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:15,705
You kids sure are considerate.

63
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:19,585
Make sure you study all this great detective's secrets.

64
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:20,934
Okay!

65
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:23,215
At least, we wish we could,

66
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:27,385
but we actually have to leave before it starts.

67
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:28,675
What?

68
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:32,604
Sorry, mister. We already had plans.

69
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,784
We're going to see a soccer game.

70
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:40,185
But as long as it doesn't go into overtime, we'll be able to return during the panel.

71
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,815
Conan-kun and Ai-chan, are you going, too?

72
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:46,204
That's right.

73
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:47,695
Sorry.

74
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,264
Fine. Go on, then.

75
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:53,574
You don't have to force yourselves to return.

76
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:56,415
Don't say that.

77
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,384
Mom will be on the panel, too.

78
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,915
We'll be waiting for you to come back.

79
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,755
Okay!

80
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:08,864
Thank you so much for coming today, Mori-sensei.

81
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:14,224
I'm delighted to have the world-famous detective speak at the grand opening of our theater.

82
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:14,935
Ujimori.

83
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:16,185
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,615
Here you are, Sensei.

85
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,824
No, thank you.

86
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:25,315
I'm just glad to be useful.

87
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:36,624
Thank you for coming today, Mori-sensei.

88
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,714
This is our staff.

89
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,865
If there's anything you need, don't hesitate to ask.

90
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:42,705
Thank you for coming.

91
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:48,265
M-Mei-chan.

92
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:49,595
Huh?

93
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,055
Say hello.

94
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,884
Oh, I'm sorry!

95
00:06:55,885 --> 00:07:00,805
I'm a huge fan of yours, so I'm a nervous wreck.

96
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:03,684
N-Nice to meet you!

97
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:08,085
I see, I see. The pleasure's all mine.

98
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:14,684
Mori-san, I've heard so much about you.

99
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:18,825
Thank you for coming to speak to—

100
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:23,575
Shall we have a battle of the detectives?

101
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:29,574
I think I recognize that guy.

102
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,404
That's actor Inokoshi Kenichiro-san.

103
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:35,224
He's famous for playing police officers and detectives.

104
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:38,844
That's right. They call him the king of mystery shows.

105
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:42,684
For some reason he's always solving mysteries under precipitous circumstances.

106
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:44,475
Hey, he can hear you.

107
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:51,644
I hope you'll appear in one of my shows sometime, Mori-san.

108
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:54,155
We could even start a new series.

109
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:57,075
What? Me, on TV?

110
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,065
I'm joking.

111
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,174
That was a joke?

112
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:05,415
You can't be serious!

113
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:08,045
I refuse to accept this hall!

114
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:12,784
I've looked after this place since your father was here.

115
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,175
What's with the cheap décor?

116
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:18,475
There, and there, and there!

117
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,294
Taking pride in an outdated management philosophy

118
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:31,634
that kept us in the red died off with my father—rather, my predecessor.

119
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:36,365
Reizei-san, our contract with you has already ended.

120
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,144
Please leave.

121
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:39,745
What was that?!

122
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,335
Please, calm down.

123
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:49,835
"Keep doing that, and you won't have a single person open their heart to you."

124
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:53,054
Who the hell are you? Move!

125
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:56,594
You're not familiar with my catchphrase?

126
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:59,845
It's even better when there's a camera around.

127
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:07,025
Isn't this actually your job, Tsukinogi-chan?

128
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:10,145
You're as useless as ever.

129
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:15,775
I quit working security because of you.

130
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:18,484
What does that mean?

131
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:19,935
Who knows?

132
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,764
Sounds like there's bad blood between those two.

133
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:24,915
Yeah.

134
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:29,835
Are you all right?

135
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:33,335
Why don't you rest over there.

136
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:38,274
Would you like something to drink?

137
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,885
I'll help.

138
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:42,575
Thank you.

139
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:48,034
But I'm fine. You should be helping him.

140
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:48,815
What?

141
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,995
What's going on?

142
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:55,024
Dad, you've had too much to drink!

143
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,825
Yikes.

144
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,445
Did something happen?

145
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,074
Conan-kun, help me.

146
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,565
Okay.

147
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:06,704
What? What happened?

148
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:09,174
Is he okay? He's blind drunk.

149
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,864
I'm worried.

150
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:12,215
Me, too.

151
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:17,664
Everyone, I'm sorry for the commotion.

152
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:19,384
We'll be starting shortly.

153
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,725
Please relax in your changing rooms until then.

154
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:24,174
Ujimori, show them the way.

155
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:24,965
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:29,105
20 Minutes Before the Lecture

157
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,134
Huh? Where's Conan-kun?

158
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,824
Do you suppose he's still with Ran-san?

159
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:41,024
If we don't hurry, the game will start.

160
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:44,105
Fine. I'll go get him. You go on ahead.

161
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:49,404
Dad! Wake up, Dad!

162
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:50,175
Huh?

163
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:54,795
What? Did the great Sleeping...

164
00:10:56,695 --> 00:11:00,554
I mean, did I impress you with my detective skills again?

165
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:04,605
Huh? I don't remember anything...

166
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,555
Dad!

167
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,974
I thought so.

168
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:20,945
Why don't you use your voice changer to give the lecture yourself?

169
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:23,615
That's not funny.

170
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:28,035
What was that?

171
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:29,455
Conan-kun.

172
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,495
What happened?

173
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,255
Inokoshi Kenichiro-sama

174
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:41,225
Over there...

175
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:43,845
That's...

176
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:48,075
I-Inokoshi-san asked me to bring him coffee.

177
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:51,545
I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer.

178
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,645
Looks like it's stuck on something.

179
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,275
Judging by this pool of blood...

180
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,265
Yeah, definitely.

181
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:08,915
Let's see.

182
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:11,424
The window to Inokoshi-san's changing room is...

183
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:12,415
That one.

184
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:24,964
I knew it.

185
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:28,845
The body's keeping the door shut instead of the lock.

186
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:30,825
In other words, this is...

187
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:33,775
Yeah.

188
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,604
It's a locked room mystery.

189
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:38,325
What?

190
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,825
What should we do? The game is starting.

191
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,904
Why not let the police handle it?

192
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:56,225
I know, but...

193
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:57,785
Inspector.

194
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,184
There may be some clues still.

195
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:03,085
Please be careful.

196
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:04,694
I know.

197
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,384
Takagi, Chiba.

198
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,235
Yes, sir.

199
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:12,345
Look. Even the great detective is awake.

200
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:14,475
Yeah.

201
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:28,115
The victim is actor Inokoshi Kenichiro-san, forty-eight years old.

202
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:33,514
He was scheduled to appear on the panel after Mori-san's lecture,

203
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:36,625
and was waiting alone in this changing room.

204
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:40,744
We're waiting on the autopsy for the cause of death,

205
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:44,315
but it was likely blood loss due to being stabbed in the heart.

206
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,635
Also, look at this.

207
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:50,085
This was in the left breast pocket of the victim's jacket.

208
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:52,974
A pocket watch, huh?

209
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:56,744
The blade of the weapon matched the damaged section.

210
00:13:56,745 --> 00:14:01,025
It's safe to assume it was damaged when the victim was stabbed in the heart.

211
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:05,835
Which means the time of death was 2:50.

212
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:08,275
The problem is...

213
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:09,365
Yes.

214
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:12,535
This was a locked room.

215
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:16,614
Under the circumstances, the door only opened about five centimeters,

216
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:18,795
making it impossible for anyone to enter or exit.

217
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:22,545
The window we broke was locked from the inside as well.

218
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:26,295
There were no signs that it had been tampered with.

219
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:32,805
So how did the culprit leave the room after killing Inokoshi-san?

220
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:37,245
At the very least, one thing is clear, Inspector.

221
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,315
And what's that?

222
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:43,735
Takagi, how's the security here at HISHIDA Hall?

223
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:47,615
We confirmed with the security staff

224
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:52,244
that aside from the front entrance and reception desk of the hall,

225
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:55,865
all entrances including emergency exits are locked from the inside.

226
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:59,264
According to the reception desk,

227
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,125
around 2:50 when the crime took place,

228
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,614
only three children left the building.

229
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:06,064
Children?

230
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,505
Those were our friends.

231
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:10,755
They left because they had someplace to be.

232
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:14,265
Don't interfere with the investigation.

233
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:18,645
Which means no one else entered or left.

234
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:24,275
This wasn't the work of an outsider, Inspector.

235
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:27,155
I-I see. In other words...

236
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:28,195
Yes.

237
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:32,154
The culprit is among the staff, guests,

238
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:36,535
and 300 audience members inside HISHIDA Hall right now.

239
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,535
Wh-What?

240
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:43,475
Well, that's for sure.

241
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,925
It was enough to leave a mark on the floor,

242
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:59,015
so they must have dragged the chair with the body sitting in it.

243
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:02,865
So how did they get out afterwards?

244
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:13,785
Something was pressed against it.

245
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,765
I see. So that's how it is.

246
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,165
I see.

247
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:23,195
This is how they created the locked room.

248
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:26,915
Who is this person?

249
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:30,115
What's that? What about the locked room?

250
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:34,354
What's going on?

251
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:36,304
Start the event.

252
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:38,164
It's ten minutes past.

253
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,245
Is the Sleeping Kogoro not coming onstage?

254
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:45,435
Delay Mori-kun's lecture an hour?

255
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:46,665
Yes.

256
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:51,014
We were thinking about making that announcement to the audience.

257
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:52,945
What are you talking about?

258
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,614
This is a murder.

259
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,614
The lecture should be canceled immediately.

260
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:04,205
But only the owner Hishida can make the decision to cancel the event.

261
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:05,825
Then...

262
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:09,834
Where is this Hishida-san?

263
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:13,444
Actually, I haven't seen her.

264
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:15,595
I've been looking for her.

265
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:18,595
What?

266
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:25,355
But fortunately, the great detective Mori Kogoro-sensei is here.

267
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:29,304
I trust he'll solve the case before long.

268
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:31,985
Well, actually...

269
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,904
As the president of the company running the event, I'd hate to leave things like this.

270
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:39,615
Please solve this case, Mori-sensei.

271
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:41,955
Let me handle this.

272
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:48,625
The great detective Mori Kogoro will solve this case within an hour.

273
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:51,504
Mori-kun, you can't go promising that.

274
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,265
Excuse me!

275
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,385
Delaying the lecture an hour may be the right call.

276
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:57,525
What?

277
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:03,424
If the event is canceled and the audience leaves,

278
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:06,405
it could be disastrous if the culprit is among them.

279
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:10,165
Y-You're right.

280
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:11,964
Fine.

281
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:17,405
If you're so sure about this, Mori-kun, you must know who did it.

282
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:21,035
Of course. I've even solved the mystery of the locked room.

283
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:23,035
R-Really?!

284
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:26,994
That's amazing. He truly is a great detective.

285
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:29,594
He just spoke with them briefly.

286
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:32,045
Yeah, he sure is.

287
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:36,314
Inspector, could you gather all the concerned parties?

288
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,994
Got it. Takagi.

289
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,215
Yes, sir!

290
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:44,575
The locked room didn't use a very complicated trick,

291
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:47,824
but I still don't know who did it.

292
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:51,605
And I'm worried that no one's seen the owner.

293
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:53,945
Yeah.

294
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,754
Before I explain my reasoning,

295
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:01,865
Chiba, have you checked everyone's alibi?

296
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:03,545
Yes.

297
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:09,565
I was able to confirm everyone's alibi for 2:50, with one exception.

298
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:14,125
They were all gathered in the same place.

299
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:17,564
I see. Who's the one exception?

300
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:20,144
Reizei-san, the former manager of HISHIDA Hall,

301
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:23,765
who was resting in his changing room alone.

302
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,145
Dad, d-do you think...?

303
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:32,415
Yes.

304
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:37,235
You did it, Reizei-san.

305
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:42,914
Your motive was the rage you felt towards Inokoshi-san

306
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,785
after he brought you in line like you were on a TV show.

307
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,415
Actually...

308
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:52,165
And you created this locked room using your cane.

309
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,354
Creating a locked room with a cane?

310
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,045
But how?

311
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,345
I'll show you.

312
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:08,305
This room is constructed exactly the same as Inokoshi-san's room.

313
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,794
Takagi, Chiba.

314
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:10,685
Yes, sir.

315
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:30,665
You alone left the room

316
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:35,365
and removed your cane just before the door closed.

317
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,045
I see.

318
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:43,264
I'm sure it would open more if you pushed harder,

319
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:46,055
but a body is rather heavy.

320
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,305
It's enough to create a quick and dirty locked room.

321
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:53,784
Well, yeah.

322
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,315
But...

323
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:57,185
Excuse me!

324
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:03,125
Earlier I took Reizei-san to his changing room.

325
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:06,725
Oh, thank you.

326
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:09,455
He was exhausted, and he's elderly.

327
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:14,694
Wouldn't it have been difficult for him to do all that?

328
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:15,505
What?

329
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,174
You're right.

330
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:21,234
Sitting that large a victim in the chair,

331
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:23,274
dragging it across the room, leaning it against the door,

332
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:28,345
and supporting it all with one cane would've been rather difficult.

333
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:32,465
You're right. I can't imagine him doing it.

334
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:41,355
Impressive, Detective. I am astonished.

335
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:47,445
What?

336
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:54,415
I knew it.

337
00:21:55,005 --> 00:22:00,034
I knew you'd spot my cane trick eventually.

338
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:04,425
But I killed someone else.

339
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:06,925
What?

340
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:10,175
Wh-What?!

341
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:49,025
You verified my alibi, didn't you?

342
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,525
We've determined the time of the crime.

343
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,585
Stay out of—

344
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:58,535
Wh-What is it, Mori-kun?

345
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,835
I am the great detective...

346
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:09,084
Mori Kogoro!

347
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:15,095
