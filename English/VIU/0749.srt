1
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:07,367
The three members of The Youth Detective Squad

2
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:09,967
spent their time absorbed in a new TV game during summer vacation.

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:11,867
At the convenience store, we coincidentally happened to run into

4
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:15,467
a boy who goes to the same Teitan Elementary as us,

5
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:17,267
and while talking to him we end up going to his relative's house

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,467
to play the TV game.

7
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:24,867
I sensed something suspicious about that home that we went to

8
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:27,267
and just then, Toshinari finds a ruthlessly killed body

9
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:29,467
in the room next door!

10
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,067
In the meantime,

11
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,667
between the two police detectives Sato and Takagi...

12
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,367
I don't have it...

13
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:39,567
You know, that.

14
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:44,267
You don't have it? Don't tell me...

15
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:45,267
Oh boy.

16
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:47,767
Don't tell anybody because it's embarrassing.

17
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,967
Miwako's having a baby?

18
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,967
She's pregnant, right?

19
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,267
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

20
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,967
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

21
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,767
Officer Takagi's going to be a Daddy?

22
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,567
The two are shocked, a shocking trick.

23
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:06,067
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,867
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,167
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:56,598
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Truth)"

27
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:31,998
I'm back.

28
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:38,698
What's up? This sinister atmosphere...

29
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:43,598
The fact is, Officer Chiba...

30
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,398
I, I found it!

31
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:51,598
Bento that was made on August 13th

32
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,398
and the newspaper dated August 13th.

33
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:57,398
Well, I buy newspapers every day.

34
00:03:57,398 --> 00:04:01,298
But, no matter if you're just taking care of him for a week,

35
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:02,298
feeding a child only snacks,

36
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:05,998
bentos from convenience stores and cup noodles.

37
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:08,898
I think you should think more about what you feed him, no?

38
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:11,198
After all, Noriya's still growing.

39
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,398
Motherly instinct is growing in Officer Sato?

40
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:17,698
And, and...

41
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:19,898
I'm the Daddy.

42
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,698
Hey, Officer Takagi?

43
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:26,098
Did you go confirm at the convenience store?

44
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,298
Yes.

45
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:30,898
He was in view on the surveillance camera of the convenience store!

46
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:34,698
Mr. Yasutomi, at around 06:00 pm yesterday,

47
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:37,698
August 13th, shopping!

48
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:42,798
Of course, Toshinari and Noriya were in view shopping too.

49
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:43,798
Really?

50
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:47,098
And about six months ago,

51
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,498
there seems to have been a traffic accident

52
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,698
on the road in front of the florist near the convenience store.

53
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,998
-Traffic accident? -Yes.

54
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:59,698
Something about a woman suddenly running out in front of a car,

55
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,198
and though the driver steered away to avoid her,

56
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:02,298
couldn't make it in time,

57
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:06,898
and ended up crashing into the guardrail on the opposite side.

58
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:09,298
The driver was unconscious.

59
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,698
Thanks to someone nearby calling the police,

60
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:14,698
the driver lived.

61
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:17,498
But, as to the woman who was run over,

62
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:20,498
no one noticed that she was stuck under the car because of her clothes.

63
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:21,898
And due to delayed treatment,

64
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:24,498
she passed away.

65
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,498
According to the driver,

66
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,998
it seemed that the woman came dashing out into the street

67
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:31,098
as if she was being chased.

68
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:35,598
And, what does that accident have to do with this murder case?

69
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:39,898
It seems that the convenience store salesclerk saw

70
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:43,098
Mr. Yasutomi fleeing from the site of the accident.

71
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:46,298
Moreover, the woman who was run over...

72
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,098
Yes.

73
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,398
The one who died in that accident was my older sister, Mika.

74
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:55,498
I'm making it a point to bring flowers every day

75
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:57,898
to the accident site since then.

76
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,798
Is... is that so?

77
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:04,698
But aren't those flowers are bit flashy to be decorated as offerings?

78
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,598
My sister used to like pink.

79
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:10,998
I thought that maybe once in a while, such colors would be nice.

80
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:12,398
I see.

81
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:13,798
Sir.

82
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:18,498
Was your sister troubled about something?

83
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:21,898
For example...

84
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,298
stalkers?

85
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:25,998
Was she?

86
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:27,098
No.

87
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:30,998
I haven't heard of anything like that in particular from her.

88
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:32,598
Just as I thought...

89
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:36,798
The one who killed Mr. Yasutomi is this man,

90
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:38,698
Mr. Toshinari Shiga.

91
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,198
But, he has an alibi that on August 13th,

92
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:47,898
for two hours between 7:00 to 9:00 in the evening

93
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:51,598
he was with Noriya right through.

94
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:55,498
I'm going to air the room out a bit.

95
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,998
Oh no, it's already sundown!

96
00:06:57,998 --> 00:06:59,298
I've got to go home.

97
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:02,898
No joke? I opened the bag of snacks.

98
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:05,298
Genta, you're spilling it.

99
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:06,998
Aren't there plates or something?

100
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:10,298
I think there were some paper plates.

101
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:11,998
What happened to your leg?

102
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,398
It looks like pinch marks.

103
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:19,098
I think I over scratched the mosquito bite.

104
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:27,198
Hey, the Yaiba movie you saw last night was it by chance...

105
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:29,998
Yes, that's right!

106
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:33,198
I watched it and holding back wanting to go pee!

107
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:37,098
If so, that newspaper...

108
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:38,198
Don't tell me.

109
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:40,798
Conan?

110
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,098
Just as I thought...

111
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,598
Only the newspaper for August 12th is gone.

112
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:51,898
No doubt about it!

113
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:54,298
He's the killer.

114
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,898
He distorted the time

115
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:59,698
and completed his alibi trick.

116
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:04,398
He even twisted Noriya's thoughts.

117
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,198
At any rate...

118
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:10,898
If between the hours o f 7:00 to 9:00 last night,

119
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,298
when the crime was committed,

120
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:16,398
Toshinari and Noriya who were in the room next to the crime site,

121
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:18,798
didn't hear any suspicious sounds

122
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,698
because of the TV program they were watching,

123
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:25,698
we'll just have to ask the other people who live in this apartment.

124
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:30,798
But since this apartment is scheduled to be destroyed next year

125
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,098
the only other residents here

126
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:35,198
are the elderly couple who live upstairs.

127
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,098
It seems that they spent the night

128
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:38,598
over at their grandchildren's home last night.

129
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:39,998
Is that right?

130
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:42,498
Ai, I'll leave everyone to you.

131
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:43,998
Okay.

132
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:45,398
Come on, all of you!

133
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:47,398
Let's spend the night at Dr. Agasa's house

134
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:49,398
and have a ball playing TV games!

135
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,898
Okay, let's play Titan Hunter, then!

136
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,998
Let's, let's!

137
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:56,098
Okay, I'll bring the software from my house then!

138
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:58,098
Will you come too, Noriya?

139
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:01,198
I'd like to ask you all kinds of things about the game.

140
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:04,398
Besides, you don't want to sleep in a room

141
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:06,398
next to where a murder was committed, do you?

142
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:07,398
No.

143
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:13,098
Aren't you going?

144
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,098
No!

145
00:09:14,098 --> 00:09:17,398
By the way, why did you move to an apartment like this

146
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:20,198
that's scheduled to be destroyed next year?

147
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:23,098
I wanted a change of pace.

148
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:25,698
Because I used to live with my sister before

149
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,698
but since she died from the accident.

150
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:32,098
But, you moved here just a month ago, right?

151
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:36,498
I'd think that you'd buy pots and pans and the like,

152
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:38,798
but there's nothing in this room!

153
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:41,098
Well, cooking's not my piece of cake,

154
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,398
so I have no kitchen appliances.

155
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:47,698
But since you have no detergent or sponges under the sink,

156
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:51,198
it means that you don't have plates or cups either, right?

157
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:55,098
Right, I was going to go get some soon.

158
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,798
Oh, is that so?

159
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:58,298
I thought it was because you were planning

160
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:04,098
to move out right away after killing Mr. Yasutomi who lived next door.

161
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:19,158
Conan, what do you mean?

162
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:23,358
Toshinari was watching TV during the time the crime was committed

163
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,358
from 7:00 to 9:00 last night, wasn't he?

164
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,058
Together with Noriya.

165
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:31,158
But, Noriya said he was holding back going to the bathroom all

166
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:33,758
during the time the movie was playing.

167
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,258
That means that there were no commercials

168
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:40,058
for 2 hours straight, right?

169
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,058
I see! It's was a rental DVD.

170
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:45,658
Rental DVD?

171
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:48,758
Yes. If the movie is aired on TV,

172
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:51,558
at the same time it would be released as DVDs

173
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:53,758
and rented out or sold already.

174
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:55,158
I see.

175
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:56,858
He placed the DVD that he prepared beforehand

176
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:59,358
and placed it in the player,

177
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,958
then play it at the appropriate time,

178
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,558
it would look as if the movie is playing on TV to a child.

179
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:08,258
But, Toshinari...

180
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:11,258
The night of the crime, on August 13th,

181
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:13,358
didn't you say that aside from the game,

182
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:16,358
you were watching the movie right through with Noriya?

183
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:19,558
Yes. Before and after the movie too.

184
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:23,758
Then, it'd been impossible for you to...

185
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:27,158
Are you sure it was August 13th?

186
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:28,758
Yes.

187
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:31,558
It seems that he had Noriya confirm

188
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,658
the date of the newspaper that day.

189
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:36,558
Right?

190
00:11:36,558 --> 00:11:37,558
Yes.

191
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,558
See!

192
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:42,058
That day was unmistakably August 13th.

193
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:45,658
I see. I guess I made a mistake.

194
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:48,258
They wouldn't be selling newspapers of the future,

195
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:50,958
that is the following day, would they?

196
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,058
Tabloids.

197
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:55,158
If it's the so-called evening newspaper

198
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:57,858
the date of the following day is printed.

199
00:11:57,858 --> 00:12:01,458
If he bought that and made Noriya confirm.

200
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,358
He could've tricked Noriya into thinking that it was the wrong date.

201
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,058
Come to think of it,

202
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,658
only the newspaper dated August 12th was gone.

203
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:10,758
I see.

204
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:14,558
You got rid of the evening paper that was dated August 13th

205
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:16,458
that you bought on the 12th, didn't you?

206
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,658
In other words, you were watching the movie on TV with Noriya

207
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,758
on the night of August 12th.

208
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,958
So, it would've been completely possible for you to commit the crime

209
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,658
on the night of August 13th, no?

210
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:30,658
Please wait!

211
00:12:30,658 --> 00:12:32,458
Didn't Noriya tell you?

212
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,358
That we watched the movie on TV yesterday!

213
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:36,758
I'm pretty sure that children can tell the difference

214
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:39,858
between yesterday and the day before, can't they?

215
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:44,358
If you think I'm lying, please call Noriya back here and ask him!

216
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:47,258
He'll tell you that today is the day after we watched movie.

217
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:49,758
Come to think of it, Noriya was saying...

218
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,358
At sundown on August 13th,

219
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:54,058
after returning from the convenience store,

220
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:56,658
he played the game till the movie started,

221
00:12:56,658 --> 00:13:00,658
then after the movie he played the game again until quite late.

222
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:03,658
He woke up early in the morning played again,

223
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:08,058
then went to the convenience store to buy breakfast

224
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:11,958
and played until around noon but, got sleepy so took a nap

225
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,058
and resumed playing the game again after getting up.

226
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,658
Then, since they got hungry,

227
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,158
they went to the convenience store again

228
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:18,958
where he met us.

229
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,758
Noriya said that he was with me playing the TV right through, didn't he?

230
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:28,658
Yes. But he also said that after he went to buy breakfast with you

231
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:32,658
at the convenience store and finished eating, you went out.

232
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:36,958
He said you told him to use the headset and keep playing the game.

233
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,058
Where did go out to?

234
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:41,858
I just went out to take a puff.

235
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:44,558
Besides that was this morning.

236
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:47,658
Time wise it has nothing to do the crime, does it?

237
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,358
Talking of time,

238
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:53,058
there's no watch in this room, is there?

239
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:54,758
The only one who can tell what time it is,

240
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:58,558
is you, Toshinari because you're wearing a watch.

241
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:00,058
Moreover,

242
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,058
there're thick curtains by the window

243
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:06,158
and if all you're doing is playing the game eating snacks,

244
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,258
you won't get hungry

245
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:11,158
so it'd be easy to lose track of what time it is, right?

246
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,558
I think you should at least by a watch or something!

247
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:16,758
Yes.

248
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:20,458
I see, so in other words...

249
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,358
The day before the crime was committed,

250
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:25,658
on August 12th, you buy the evening paper at the convenience store,

251
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:28,358
and make Noriya think that it's the 13th.

252
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:29,558
Then that night,

253
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,458
let's say till about a little past 10:00 pm,

254
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,958
you make him play the game

255
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,858
and then tell him it's time for the movie.

256
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:37,758
Then, after showing him the DVD till about 12:00 am,

257
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:40,658
if you made him play the game until early the next morning...

258
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:43,158
When you woke him to tell him that it was morning,

259
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:45,758
it would've been a little after noon on August 13th.

260
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:47,958
If you made him play the game till sundown that day

261
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,358
and then told him, "Let's go buy breakfast,"

262
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,858
it would really have been at 06:00 pm

263
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,858
on the 13th that you went to the convenience store.

264
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,258
I... I see! In this season,

265
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:02,258
it's bright no matter if it's 6:00 am or 6:00 pm.

266
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:05,158
Then, after eating breakfast,

267
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:07,958
if you told him that you'd be going out for a while and left,

268
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,958
you would've had more than enough time to murder Mr. Yasutomi.

269
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,258
Besides, it seems that Noriya was wearing a headset

270
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:17,258
and probably couldn't hear anything.

271
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:20,058
Then, afterwards you returned to your room again

272
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:23,058
and made Noriya play the game until early morning.

273
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:24,858
After this if you urge him to take a nap

274
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:29,358
and make him sleep well till the afternoon of August 14th,

275
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:33,558
to Noriya, the two days, the 13th and the 14th

276
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,258
would've seemed to be only one day.

277
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:39,758
How about it? Is there anything not right here?

278
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:42,258
What do you mean, how about it?

279
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:46,058
Besides, why would I want to kill the next door neighbor?

280
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:49,558
Your older sister is really a beauty, isn't she, Toshinari?

281
00:15:49,558 --> 00:15:50,858
Hey, sonny!

282
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:52,358
But, it's strange.

283
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:55,858
All the pictures towards the end is not looking this way.

284
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,558
And there's what looks to be a hole on the top part.

285
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:04,258
You really like your older sister, don't you, Toshinari?

286
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:06,758
You lined all the pictures of your older sister

287
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,458
that you took in secret up and posted them somewhere, right?

288
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,958
That's...

289
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,158
Stalking!

290
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,958
Come to think of it, the forensic officer was saying

291
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,558
that there was also a board with pictures posted on them

292
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:21,358
in Mr. Yasutomi's room too,

293
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:24,058
but that most of them didn't match the discolored part of the board.

294
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:26,358
Which means that the pictures that were posted on that board

295
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:28,058
were actually these pictures,

296
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:29,458
and after the crime was committed,

297
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,958
in order to erase all connection with yourself

298
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,458
you peeled all of it off,

299
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,658
and posted Mr. Yasutomi's pictures over that area!

300
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:38,458
If so, the data of the pictures

301
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,458
may still be in Mr. Yasutomi's laptop

302
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,958
that was on his desk.

303
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,758
Go check it right away!

304
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:46,758
Although it may already have been erased...

305
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:47,858
Okay.

306
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:49,658
I'm sure they're still there.

307
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,958
I didn't even think of it.

308
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,558
Besides, I peeled the pictures off

309
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:03,258
because I didn't want to keep the pictures of my sister

310
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:06,958
posted in the room of that darn stalker any longer.

311
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:11,558
Which means that Mr. Yasutomi was stalking your sister after all?

312
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:16,158
Yes. I just realized it 2 months ago.

313
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:20,958
I went to offer flowers at the site of the accident

314
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,358
as always when he came to talk to me asking,

315
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:26,558
"Were you her fan too?"

316
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,158
It bothered me so I tailed him

317
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:36,158
and saw from through the window.

318
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:39,158
Him posting the pictures of my sister

319
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,758
on the board while mumbling,

320
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:44,758
"It's your fault for running from me".

321
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:47,758
Don't tell me that your sister came running out to the street

322
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:50,058
as if she was being chased because...

323
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:53,958
Yes. My sister came running out into the street

324
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:58,158
and got run over because that guy came after her.

325
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:00,958
Before killing that guy,

326
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,258
I asked and confirmed,

327
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:06,758
why he fled back then

328
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:11,458
and why he didn't tell the paramedics that my sister was under the car!

329
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:18,458
If he did, maybe my sister would've still been alive.

330
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:23,258
The man said that he was just plain scared.

331
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:27,458
And so you moved to the room next to Mr. Yasutomi

332
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,558
and schemed this?

333
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:34,058
Yes. I was told to take care of Noriya for a week from,

334
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:36,058
some time ago so...

335
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:41,458
Well, I didn't think that Noriya would fall so nicely for this trick.

336
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,658
Just what're you talking about?

337
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:46,558
Noriya pinched his own feet trying to keep himself awake,

338
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,958
and played the game for long hours,

339
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,358
that's why everything went well.

340
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:55,358
He did it because his mother told him to stay with you

341
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,258
and cheer you up.

342
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:01,358
Otherwise, this plan would never have worked out.

343
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:05,458
I see.

344
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:10,458
So, I was the one who was being taken care of.

345
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:35,358
And? What's Noriya going to do after this?

346
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:39,058
They're going to let him stay at Dr. Agasa's home

347
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:40,658
until he's mother returns.

348
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,358
His mother for the time being,

349
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,158
called Noriya to tell him that Toshinari

350
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:46,658
would be going on a trip for a while.

351
00:20:46,658 --> 00:20:51,158
And? Isn't it about time you told me?

352
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:54,058
Who on earth were you planning to give those flowers to?

353
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:56,558
Of course you, Officer Sato.

354
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,058
I actually wanted to give you

355
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:03,158
that Fake Dragonhead along with a ring!

356
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:05,558
Give me a ring and flowers?

357
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:07,258
Before giving me something like that

358
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:10,258
give me your red badge, Officer Takagi!

359
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:11,958
Red badge?

360
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,358
It's this one that's being passed out

361
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:15,758
by the 1st Investigation Division of MPD, right?

362
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,958
But, why?

363
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,458
You said that you'd take responsibility, didn't you?

364
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,258
That's why...

365
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:27,258
Remember last time when you let the suspect you handcuffed go

366
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:29,558
and I nabbed him back?

367
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,758
It seems that I dropped my badge

368
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,258
while doing so back then.

369
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:36,258
After that I realized that I had lost it

370
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:38,858
and went back to the site to look

371
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:40,758
for it but couldn't find it.

372
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:44,958
I picked it up and have it in my left slacks pocket.

373
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,558
I'm sorry I forgot to tell you.

374
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:48,558
No joke! Are you serious?

375
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,658
Hey, Officer Sato...

376
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:52,158
This is it! My red badge!

377
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:53,858
I'm glad!

378
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:55,958
Well, although we always wear it,

379
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,558
we don't really have to,

380
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,558
we can always get new ones if we ask the execs for it.

381
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:04,358
Is that right?

382
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,958
I thought that I would be asked to submit a written letter of explanation

383
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,358
and was embarrassed.

384
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:11,558
That's why I was depressed for a while.

385
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:16,758
You mean the thing that you said you didn't have was...

386
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:19,258
Right! This red badge!

387
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:20,758
What?

388
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:22,458
Watch out!

389
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:27,658
Hey! What's that bummed out look for?

390
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:32,558
We were able to arrest the perp on the spot,

391
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,658
so shape up, will you? Shape up!

392
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:37,258
Yes.

393
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,258
I have this feeling from a while ago that we're being...

394
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:44,258
Watched, right?

395
00:22:44,258 --> 00:22:45,558
Miwako.

396
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:48,858
Yumi. Officer Chiba too.

397
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:52,558
Yumi, everybody's looking at us.

398
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,858
Why don't you ask yourself why?

399
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:58,458
Miwako, you don't have it?

400
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,758
Right, I found it though!

401
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,358
You found it?

402
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:06,858
See, see? Officer Takagi picked it up for me!

403
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:08,758
If he told me about it earlier,

404
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:12,258
I didn't have to be so bummed out.

405
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,258
Don't tell me...

406
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:16,558
What is it?

407
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:20,858
09:36 pm, Wataru Takagi taken into custody!

408
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,458
We'll escort him to the interrogation room now!

409
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,458
Copy!

410
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,058
What? What?

411
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,558
Wait!

412
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:34,358
Oh boy. So, Officer Takagi goofed again?

413
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:36,658
I'm sorry, you're mistaken.

414
00:23:36,658 --> 00:23:41,158
There's been a slight misunderstanding.

415
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,758
Officer Sato!

416
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,158
Fantastic!

417
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:54,358
Yes. We're really good friends.

418
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:57,458
Okay!

419
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,858
Oh no! He's drowning!

420
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:06,058
Is there anything important shown here?

421
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:08,958
Next Conan,

422
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:12,958
"The Man Betrayed by the Sea".
