1
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:18,906
Amazing!

2
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:28,306
-What? -Super!

3
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:41,606
Darn it!

4
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:56,606
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

5
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,706
are slashed by the light of deduction.

6
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:00,506
Mischievous Sanada's all out shoot

7
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,506
turns into a most unexpected incident?

8
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,006
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,906
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:08,206
His name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:43,507
"Promise with the J-Leaguer"

12
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,710
Big Osaka can't score.

13
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,110
What? Weren't you guys anti-Big?

14
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,010
No. It's just that we're fans of the Spirits.

15
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,610
But we got to know player Sanada at the soccer class so, you see...

16
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,510
So, we decided to cheer just for player Sanada.

17
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,210
But Big Osaka can't win without Higo after all.

18
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,810
It can't be helped

19
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,410
because Higo is going to the World Cup

20
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,210
and can't participate in this game.

21
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,010
He's a striker who represents Japan that aligns with Hide.

22
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,710
That's why Sanada's playing in place of Higo, right?

23
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,810
Sanada's Higo's sub, see...

24
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,610
But to us...

25
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,210
Hey, I'm not a sub!

26
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,710
I'm a super sub. Remember that!

27
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,910
Is what he said.

28
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,110
But his shoot a while ago was really too bad.

29
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,010
He kicked with his right foot, didn't he?

30
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,810
I think he tried to dodge the defender's shoot block.

31
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,010
I think he did the right thing.

32
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,210
-I wonder about that. -Huh?

33
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,110
At that timing, he didn't have to cut-back with a feint.

34
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,610
If he shot with his left foot aiming at the upper left of the goal,

35
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,510
he would've surely made goal.

36
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,010
Then, why did he go out of his way to...

37
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,610
I don't know why,

38
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,210
but he did the same thing a while ago too.

39
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,610
A while ago? What do you mean?

40
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,710
Remember, a perfect cross went up

41
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,710
before Sanada who was in front of the goal, right?

42
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,910
I thought he was going to volley shoot with his left foot, but...

43
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,010
Come to think of it, he shot with his right leg

44
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,310
and the ball largely went pass the cross bar.

45
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,710
I was also wondering back then

46
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,410
as to why he kicked with his right leg

47
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,510
which isn't his dominant leg.

48
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,610
Maybe he was just trying to show the coach

49
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,610
that he could also kick with his right foot?

50
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,210
Although the result didn't come out as he expected.

51
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,110
One more thing.

52
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,210
This has been bothering me for a while too,

53
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,010
but Sanada seems to be looking towards the stands off and on.

54
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,510
There he goes again.

55
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,210
See, he's looking around there somewhere.

56
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,110
I wonder who he's looking at?

57
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,610
I wonder. I can't tell from here.

58
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,910
But it's for sure that he's concerned about somebody.

59
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,310
I hope he's not being blackmailed by somebody

60
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,210
and deliberately kicking balls away from the goal.

61
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,510
What?

62
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,810
It couldn't be, though.

63
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,510
Why do you think so?

64
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,710
Did you encounter a similar case sometime before?

65
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,010
No, never.

66
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,710
Sorry. I was just getting a bit carried away.

67
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,510
Let's watch the game.

68
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,410
But the way that Sanada is playing is obviously strange.

69
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,910
I'm sure that something's happening.

70
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,910
Ayumi. Genta.

71
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,410
Maybe Conan's deduction is right.

72
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,710
You mean that Sanada is being threatened by someone

73
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,110
and is kicking the ball off goal?

74
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,310
Yes.

75
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,510
I'm sure that Conan has his reasons for thinking so.

76
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,210
Although he's hiding it from us.

77
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,610
If so...

78
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,610
Let's help him ourselves.

79
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,110
Okay.

80
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,710
Conan.

81
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,610
We're going to the restroom.

82
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,210
Okay.

83
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,510
That man.

84
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,310
He really looks suspicious.

85
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,210
Let's go up near and look.

86
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,110
Sanada, give it your best shot!

87
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,410
Go for it! Sanada!

88
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,710
Clear it!

89
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,710
Can't make it!

90
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,410
Sanada, no big deal! No big deal!

91
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,010
That man...

92
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,110
It looks like he's looking at Sanada

93
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,510
and the lady who's cheering Sanada on.

94
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,510
He looks suspicious.

95
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,510
Aren't you Conan?

96
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,210
Kaoru.

97
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,010
Are you here watching soccer with your girlfriend today?

98
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,210
-No... -No!

99
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,510
Is that so? Excuse me.

100
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,810
You're not here on the job, are you, Kaoru?

101
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,710
You're not wearing your press bib.

102
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,010
No, today's my day-off.

103
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,910
I was able to get back to the local news section

104
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,610
thanks to that scoop, you see.

105
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,810
Moreover, because of the events that took place then,

106
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,610
I happened to become personally interested in Takahiro Sanada.

107
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,210
I'm still following him around, you see.

108
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,010
Hey, don't you think there's something strange about Sanada today?

109
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,710
Yes. He's not the usual Sanada.

110
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,810
I took a picture of Sanada the day before yesterday

111
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,010
practicing on his own early in the morning at the field

112
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,510
near Nishishiba Hotel

113
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,110
that team Big always uses when they come to Tokyo.

114
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,710
Was he practicing shooting with his right leg at that time?

115
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,610
No. He was practicing PK.

116
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,510
He was kicking all his shoots with his left leg.

117
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,010
He shot strong kicks

118
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,810
aiming for the upper left corner of the goal.

119
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,010
He kept repeating the same course over and over.

120
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,810
Just as I thought.

121
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,310
And yet, today he shot with his right leg.

122
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,210
Too bad!

123
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,710
How nostalgic this field is.

124
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,810
Have you been there before?

125
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,610
Yeah, Nishishiba Sports Park.

126
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,410
There was a soccer tournament here when I was in Jr. High School.

127
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,210
And a few days before the tournament,

128
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,310
I wanted to check on the grass of the field

129
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,910
and was kicking the soccer ball alone.

130
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,410
I tried shooting a PK at the end, too.

131
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,510
I kicked a strong straight ball

132
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,910
aiming at the upper left corner of the goal

133
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,710
just like Sanada did.

134
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,210
But the ball was too strong.

135
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,210
So a super ranking High School soccer boy

136
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,110
fails the PK without a goalkeeper.

137
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,410
I said, that was when I was in Jr. High!

138
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,010
Huh? In Jr. High?

139
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,310
You said when you were in Jr. High just now, didn't you?

140
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,610
No. I was talking about an acquaintance of mine.

141
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,310
Sanada! Give it your best shot!

142
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,910
What's that? The stuff on his lap.

143
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,110
I wonder what it is? It looks like a black cylinder.

144
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,610
A gun! I think it's the muzzle of a gun.

145
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,010
Is the muzzle of a gun so thick?

146
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,510
That's a silencer!

147
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,610
It's attached to the gun so there's no sound!

148
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,110
It comes out a lot in spy movies.

149
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,510
The truth is

150
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,710
that lady who is cheering Sanada on is his girlfriend,

151
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,910
and he's being threatened saying that

152
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,110
if he doesn't want his girlfriend to be shot,

153
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,110
to kick away from the goal.

154
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,010
That's why he's been shooting with his right leg

155
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,110
that's not dominant instead of his left that is!

156
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,310
What?

157
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,510
What shall we do, Mitsuhiko?

158
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,010
Let's tell the security guards!

159
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,710
Good job, Sanada!

160
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,710
Shoots!

161
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,510
We've got trouble!

162
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,510
They've made goal!

163
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,510
-Don't! -No! Look out!

164
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,410
What... what's with you guys?

165
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,310
-Let go of me! -We won't let you go!

166
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,310
You're blackmailing Sanada, aren't you?

167
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,810
Ayumi! Get the security guard right away!

168
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,910
Both of you.

169
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,610
I don't think it's a gun.

170
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,810
What?

171
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,910
Hey, you guys!

172
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,110
Hey, let me go!

173
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,410
What're you guys doing?

174
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,510
We thought it was the silencer of a gun.

175
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,910
That's a video camera.

176
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,910
For taking peeping photos.

177
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,210
What the heck is this about? I don't know a thing!

178
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,510
That man! He's stalking Yuki!

179
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,610
Those ladies weren't Sanada's girlfriends.

180
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,110
I guess they were just merely his fans.

181
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,010
Thank God that was a video camera.

182
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,710
If it was a real gun,

183
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,110
who knows what would've happened to you guys.

184
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,310
But thanks to them, I got an interesting shot.

185
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,510
Thanks a lot.

186
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,510
I'll treat you to something at the shop

187
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,010
as a token of my appreciation.

188
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,810
It just happens to be half-time now anyway.

189
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,610
-Yeah! -Yeah!

190
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,810
-Gosh. -Talk for yourself.

191
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,410
They did what they did because of what you said, you know.

192
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,510
Well, that's true.

193
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,510
But there's no mistake that something's going on with Sanada.

194
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,410
I'm going to the restroom.

195
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,910
Are you all right? You want me to go with you?

196
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,910
I'm fine.

197
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,510
He was looking at that boy.

198
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,881
Hey, sir?

199
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:59,581
What's wrong with that boy's right leg?

200
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:02,881
He sprained it after he fell off the bicycle.

201
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,481
Are you his father?

202
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,181
No, I'm not.

203
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:10,981
You don't look like a coach of the soccer club either though.

204
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:14,181
Is that boy friends with Sanada?

205
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:15,581
Why?

206
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:19,581
Because Sanada was sending signals to him.

207
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:26,081
Hey, is there a connection between that boy

208
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:29,481
falling off the bicycle and Sanada?

209
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,481
What makes you think so?

210
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:33,881
When Sanada came to Tokyo,

211
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:37,481
there's a field in Nishishiba that he always used to practice alone at.

212
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:40,881
And it was also written on the boy's jacket,

213
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:43,381
the words Nishishiba Soccer Club.

214
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:50,981
I run a convenience store in Nishishiba.

215
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:53,581
When I was taking a walk near a sports park

216
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,281
in the morning the day before yesterday...

217
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:12,681
Are you all right, sonny?

218
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:13,981
My leg...

219
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:15,481
I'm sorry, really sorry!

220
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:16,981
I was practicing PK,

221
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,581
but the ball went over the goal.

222
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:24,581
Did you get hurt?

223
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:28,581
So, we took the boy to a hospital that I knew of nearby.

224
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:32,781
With this leg, I can't participate in the game.

225
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:33,881
You'll be fine.

226
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,981
10 days and you'll be able to run.

227
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:39,081
But I can't kick a shoot.

228
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,481
Yes, you can.

229
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,681
Besides, if you can't kick with you right,

230
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,881
then kick with your left!

231
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:48,181
Then can you shoot with your right foot

232
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:51,581
that's not dominant instead of your left, Sanada?

233
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:54,881
Of course. I'm a J-Leaguer, you know.

234
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:56,981
I'll do fine with my right, too.

235
00:14:56,981 --> 00:15:00,881
Then, make goal with your right leg the next game.

236
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:03,281
Then, I'll do my best too.

237
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,781
That's why Sanada...

238
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:12,481
A few days later, Sanada sent us tickets for today's game.

239
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:14,981
But Koh's parents were busy,

240
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,281
so I took him in their place.

241
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:19,881
Thank you, sir.

242
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:25,081
What a story.

243
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:28,181
Where on earth would there be a J-Leaguer

244
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:30,581
who'd make such a stupid promise,

245
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,281
just because he hurt that boy.

246
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:35,581
Well, that's just like Sanada.

247
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,381
It's one of his good points.

248
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:41,281
I hope Sanada makes goal in the 2nd half!

249
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:44,481
I hope he doesn't make goofy shots like before.

250
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:48,181
I'd like him to score fantastically.

251
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,581
More than that, what bothers me is...

252
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:57,881
Hello, Nishishiba Sports Park maintenance office.

253
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:03,181
Huh? Mouri? You mean that famous Detective Mouri?

254
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:16,781
I heard about it from Mr. Fukazawa.

255
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:19,781
Please forgive Sanada.

256
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,881
No way! A promise is a promise.

257
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,581
But it's not Sanada's fault that you got hurt, you know.

258
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:29,681
What're you talking about? The ball that he kicked...

259
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:34,181
Will you tell me where you fell off the bicycle?

260
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:35,581
What?

261
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:39,281
Yeah. Around here, I guess.

262
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:40,781
Are you sure?

263
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:45,881
Yes, because it was right after I crossed the crosswalk.

264
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,781
Which way did the ball come flying from?

265
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:50,481
Diagonally behind.

266
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:52,881
Sanada kicked a strong straight ball

267
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:57,481
aiming at the upper left corner of the goal from this position.

268
00:16:57,481 --> 00:17:02,081
But the ball largely flew over the goal.

269
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:05,081
If this ball flew over Mr. Fukazawa's head

270
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:08,981
and went out onto the main street...

271
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:12,081
See? The ball that was aimed at the upper left corner of the goal,

272
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:15,681
couldn't have come flying from diagonally behind you

273
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,581
who sped pass the side of the crosswalk.

274
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:21,181
What? But then why?

275
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:23,981
The only thing thinkable is, first of all,

276
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:29,581
the ball that Sanada kicked didn't fly pass over Mr. Fukazawa,

277
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,381
but hit him.

278
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,981
On his face, too.

279
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:35,381
What?

280
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:39,381
Mr. Fukazawa, your glasses doesn't look to be in great shape.

281
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,681
The temples are slightly bent out of shape.

282
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,481
Didn't you get hit by the ball?

283
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,381
No, I didn't!

284
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:53,381
Wait. If the ball hit Mr. Fukazawa as you said,

285
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:56,181
why did that ball come over to where I was?

286
00:17:56,181 --> 00:18:00,781
Right, the ball couldn't have come flying to where you were.

287
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,981
That is, unless Mr. Fukazawa who was hit by the ball on his face

288
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:07,781
got angry and threw it in the direction of the main street.

289
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:10,281
What?

290
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:13,681
No! I saw the ball way before that,

291
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:16,881
and the ball unmistakably flew over my head.

292
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:20,681
The course of the ball that Sanada kicked was wrong to begin with.

293
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,781
Try remembering again.

294
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:24,881
The ball didn't come from diagonally behind

295
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:27,481
but rather from the side!

296
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,481
Mr. Fukazawa.

297
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:37,581
That field... Did you know that there's a surveillance camera here?

298
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:38,881
What?

299
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:43,781
I called the maintenance office a while ago

300
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:45,181
and had them check the footage of the surveillance camera

301
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,081
of the day before yesterday.

302
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,581
Darn it!

303
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,981
Why are you going that far?

304
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:19,981
It's not that I want to disclose what you did

305
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,881
because I know you're not a bad person.

306
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:25,781
However, the truth has to come to light.

307
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:27,981
For the sake of Sanada

308
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:30,081
as well as for Koh.

309
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,781
It's a foul!

310
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:34,581
It's PK!

311
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:41,381
Nobu, I'm counting on you!

312
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,781
Yeah!

313
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:48,681
If I kick towards the goal with my left foot as I practiced,

314
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:51,581
I'm sure I can shoot the ball into goal.

315
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:52,581
But if I do that,

316
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:55,281
I wouldn't be keeping the promise I made with that boy.

317
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:03,281
No way.

318
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:05,281
Just as I thought, it's a goofy shot.

319
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:07,181
Darn it!

320
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:12,681
No big deal, no big deal! I've no time to be feeling down!

321
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:16,181
-Idiot! -That's not for you to say!

322
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,981
Sorry!

323
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,581
Well, it's just like him.

324
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:47,381
Which means that the ball that you threw...

325
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:52,981
I'm sorry for lying, Mr. Sanada, Koh.

326
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:54,381
Please accept my apology.

327
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:56,481
Forget it, sir.

328
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:59,681
I'll try my best in the next game.

329
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:08,581
Hey, Mr. Sanada.

330
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:13,081
I'm sorry!

331
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:15,381
Even if you threw the ball,

332
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:19,781
Koh got hurt because of the ball that I kicked.

333
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:24,681
Moreover, that ball hit you on the face, I'm so sorry.

334
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,381
Mr. Sanada.

335
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,681
But that PK should've made goal.

336
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:47,281
"Next Episode"

337
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:53,581
The corpse of a young unidentified woman?

338
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:56,181
Hey, don't tell me...

339
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,881
No way...

340
00:23:57,881 --> 00:23:59,581
What a bummer.

341
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:02,181
I finally woke up from pain.

342
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,881
This case is still not over!

343
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:07,981
Mr. Mouri, it's not over?

344
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:13,281
Next Conan, "Coincidences Come in Twos"

345
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:31,081
Next Conan's Hint:

346
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:33,481
"A brand new skirt"

347
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,581
Player Making of the Reds, you're on!

348
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:37,681
Go for it, Japan!
