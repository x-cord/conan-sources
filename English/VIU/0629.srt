1
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:08,455
The wind feels good.

2
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:10,155
Really!

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,855
There are many super pretty fish near the isolated island

4
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:16,455
that we're headed for now!

5
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:18,555
I feel really excited.

6
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:20,755
Ai should've come too.

7
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,955
She said she didn't want to get a sun tan.

8
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:26,255
Conan, a seagull!

9
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:30,055
The seagull's over that side.

10
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:31,855
More than that,

11
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:34,555
doesn't it look like it's going to rain?

12
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:42,355
Like the fog clears.

13
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:44,555
Let's see through love and crime as well.

14
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:46,155
A tragedy occurs on an isolated island.

15
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:48,155
A fight that breaks out among the video crew.

16
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,755
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:51,555
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:53,955
His name is Detective Conan.

19
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:40,337
"Promotion Video Filming (Part 1)"

20
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:53,829
Mr. Kurahashi, thank you for having us over again.

21
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,429
Sonoko, thank you for always

22
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:59,029
-patronizing our pension. -Thank you.

23
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,629
Okay, let's hurry and put our things in our room

24
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,629
and go snorkelling!

25
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:06,929
"Osamu Kurohashi (43)" -Oh, a storm is coming this way now.

26
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:09,829
I'm sorry to say this after you've come this far,

27
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,629
but please don't go into the water because it's dangerous.

28
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:15,229
-What? -Are you serious?

29
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,229
How disappointing.

30
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,729
I wanted to see pretty fish.

31
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:26,429
Well, I thought it was going to turn out this way.

32
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,729
"Keiko Kurahashi (38)" -Let me show you

33
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,829
to your rooms, everyone!

34
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,229
No joke.

35
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,629
I was looking forward to it and yet.

36
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,729
Come to think of it, it's typhoon season right now.

37
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:47,129
What's the matter, Conan?

38
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,029
They seem to be filming something over there.

39
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,529
Filming?

40
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:52,529
Hey, Okita,

41
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,229
make sure you shine the light on me.

42
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:55,829
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,629
"Yuya Miyasaka (30)" -Right, right. That's good.

44
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:03,329
Hey, hey! Isn't that Yuya Miyasaka?

45
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:05,729
Who? Is he famous?

46
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,129
He's an actor.

47
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,729
You see, the one who got drunk

48
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:11,329
and was arrested for assault last year.

49
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,029
I remember.

50
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:16,829
And because of that the drama he was starring in was called off.

51
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,129
I also used to like that drama so I remember it too.

52
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,129
Ever since then, his popularity went down the drain

53
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,829
and he disappeared from TV.

54
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,429
But, I wonder what he's filming in a place like this?

55
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,329
It looks sort of interesting.

56
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:31,729
Let's go check it out.

57
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,329
-Okay. -Hey, hey.

58
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:37,029
"Saeko Akimoto (25)"

59
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,529
Oh. Actress Saeko Akimoto is there too.

60
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:44,929
Actress?

61
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:47,929
Where?

62
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,729
Cut!

63
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,529
All right. Okay.

64
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,529
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:02,629
It's okay.

66
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,829
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:08,229
We're staying over at a pension nearby,

68
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,229
and came to see what you were shooting.

69
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,629
"Miki Kitagawa (22)" -Then, I'm sure you're staying

70
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,629
at the same pension we are.

71
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,929
What are you shooting now?

72
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:22,329
We're shooting a promotion video of Yuya Miyasaka.

73
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:25,629
What's the content about?

74
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,529
Well, the two, Saeko and Mr. Miyasaka drift onto an isolated island,

75
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,429
but with his superb survival skills

76
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:34,029
he protects her from danger.

77
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,229
The story goes like so.

78
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:38,629
An uninhabited island.

79
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,329
I'm counting on you, then.

80
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,529
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,129
Hey, Miki.

82
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,629
He's calling me.

83
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,829
See you.

84
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:58,029
Who are those guys?

85
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,329
People who are staying at the same pension as we are.

86
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,229
Huh?

87
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,029
Oh, that great actress is putting on her own make-up.

88
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,829
Um, wasn't that person who was here a while ago

89
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:11,129
the make-up artist?

90
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:16,329
Don't... Saeko is watching.

91
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:21,229
Who cares?

92
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,029
Let's get on with the shooting.

93
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,929
I see, so that's the story.

94
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,129
What do you mean?

95
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:35,329
Yuya Miyasaka and Saeko Akimoto were once rumored about.

96
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,829
However, another woman showed up.

97
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:45,129
I mean, she can hear.

98
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:50,829
Next, scene 14!

99
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,429
It's the scene where I slide down the cliff

100
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,629
to try and save Saeko who is below the cliff.

101
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,429
Hey, Yamamoto!

102
00:06:57,429 --> 00:06:59,729
Are ready over there?

103
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,029
"Eiji Yamamoto (21), Assistant Director" -Yes, sir. We're ready.

104
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,929
Hold it.

105
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,329
"Mitsuo Okita (23), Camera Assistant" -Mr. Miyasaka, what is this?

106
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,129
I didn't hear anything about me doing stunts!

107
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,829
But, you used to be in the exercise club

108
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:15,129
and have good athletic skills, don't you?

109
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,229
If you didn't,

110
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,329
I wouldn't have hired you as an assistant cameraman.

111
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,129
"Shingo Takayama (28), Cameraman" -Well, you can quit if you want to,

112
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,729
but I'm not paying you a cent, get that!

113
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:29,229
Darn, how dare he take unfair advantage of me?

114
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,729
You'd better make your mind up and resign yourself.

115
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:34,129
Once Mr. Miyasaka makes up his mind, he won't take no for an answer.

116
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,629
I know!

117
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:39,529
It's easy for you to say because it doesn't concern you!

118
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:47,729
Hey, is he really going to slide down from there?

119
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,829
No matter how good you are, that's impossible.

120
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:50,929
How frightening.

121
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,229
No matter how athletic.

122
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,529
This is going too far.

123
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,529
Ready,

124
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,729
action!

125
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:21,529
Cut!

126
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,829
Hey, Okita, are you okay?

127
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,529
I mean somehow the way you fell didn't have much impact.

128
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,829
Okita, do it once more!

129
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,929
What's with that look of yours?

130
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,129
I think it's better to cut it out already!

131
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,529
Exactly, right!

132
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,629
What?

133
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,829
Weren't you watching, Mr. Miyasaka?

134
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,029
He was one step before getting seriously hurt, you know!

135
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,029
-Right! -That's right!

136
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:58,129
You guys have no business in this!

137
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:06,829
That hurts!

138
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,729
Who threw the coke can over here?

139
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:11,429
Oh, no.

140
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:14,429
Not you again, Genta.

141
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:20,229
There's a coke stain on it.

142
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,029
Oh, no.

143
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,929
Idiot!

144
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:30,729
Getting precious small props dirty!

145
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,729
Oh, come on, cool it.

146
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:35,229
Are you all right, Mr. Yamamoto?

147
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:39,729
You dupes.

148
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,629
Shoots. It's started to rain.

149
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:47,729
Mr. Miyasaka. It seems that even the heavens have forsaken you.

150
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:50,029
With all that's happening to you, this is more like a joke.

151
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,229
Shut up!

152
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:54,229
Everybody, we're going back to the pension.

153
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:05,729
Come, wipe your body with this.

154
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:09,029
The bath's ready too, so whenever you're ready,

155
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,729
please help yourselves.

156
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:12,629
How about it, everyone?

157
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,429
While dinner's being prepared,

158
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:18,629
would you like to do some recreation to get to know each other.

159
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:21,129
Okay!

160
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,729
That sounds like fun.

161
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:23,729
Yeah!

162
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:25,329
You gotta be joking.

163
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:28,529
I mean we're not on some school excursion you now.

164
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,029
Give me a break.

165
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,629
Most owners of pensions

166
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,729
have a tendency to want their guests to get friendly with each other.

167
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:39,329
We've got to do some check on our equipment too.

168
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,829
If you will excuse us.

169
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,829
I'll go first!

170
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:50,929
The eight of spades.

171
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,429
Well...

172
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,229
Eight of diamonds.

173
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:56,629
I...

174
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,129
Here, six of hearts.

175
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:02,729
Is Mr. Miyasaka always like that?

176
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,529
I heard that he got in trouble

177
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:07,629
in some kind of incident before in the past too.

178
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:12,729
Mr. Miyasaka is trying desperately to regain the popularity he lost

179
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,329
due to that incident.

180
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,129
He's paying out of his own pocket for this promotion video

181
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:18,229
that we're shooting now too.

182
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:20,829
He's staking everything he's got on this piece of work.

183
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:23,229
That's why he's nervous.

184
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:27,029
I'm sorry that we made you feel unpleasant.

185
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:28,629
It's okay.

186
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,529
Who is it?

187
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,029
It's me.

188
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,529
Oh, what?

189
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:45,929
You haven't changed clothes yet?

190
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:49,429
Who cares! What do you want?

191
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:52,629
Won't you drink with me before dinner?

192
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,129
With this weather.

193
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,529
I'm sure there'll be no more shooting today, right?

194
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,029
He punched me again.

195
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,229
Darn!

196
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:15,929
Darn, Miyasaka. How dare he...

197
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,229
Hey, Okita!

198
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:22,429
Yes, sir?

199
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,629
What is it, Mr. Takayama?

200
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:28,529
Miyasaka says to bring the camera to his room and roll it

201
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,429
because he wants to make a "making of" video.

202
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:34,729
I'm rolling the camera? Not you, Mr. Takayama?

203
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:37,629
Yeah. He's asking for you.

204
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:38,729
Maybe he wants to apologize for what

205
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:40,429
he did you to a while ago or something.

206
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,029
Here you go.

207
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:53,129
Pass 2 for me.

208
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,029
Pass 3.

209
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:57,029
I can't make any more passes.

210
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:58,729
Pass 3

211
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,029
for me too.

212
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,829
Gee, Conan, it's not fair for you to stop everything!

213
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:04,929
Unfair?

214
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:07,829
I mean that's how this game seven is played, isn't it?

215
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,229
Bad news!

216
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,129
Mr. Miyasaka is

217
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:15,029
dead!

218
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,678
What do you mean, Mr. Miyasaka is dead?

219
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,778
I was told to go to Miyasaka's room

220
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:29,378
because he wanted to shoot a making of film

221
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:31,078
and wanted me to roll the camera.

222
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,078
Then...

223
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:40,978
What's wrong?

224
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:44,178
Oh, Mr. Takayama, Mr. Miyasaka is...

225
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:47,378
Miyasaka!

226
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,978
No joke?

227
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,978
Okita! Call everyone here right away!

228
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,678
Yes, sir!

229
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:56,578
Really?

230
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:57,978
Yes!

231
00:13:57,978 --> 00:13:59,578
No!

232
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:01,478
Let's hurry over!

233
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,978
You people wait outside.

234
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:16,178
Mr. Takayama, is Mr. Miyasaka really...

235
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:20,178
There's no pulse. It's too late.

236
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:21,578
Mr. Miyasaka?

237
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:22,578
No.

238
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,278
No!

239
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,578
What's the matter?

240
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:29,078
What's going on?

241
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,578
Miyasaka...

242
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:35,678
One stab of the knife through his chest.

243
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,978
-Somehting's wrong. -Conan.

244
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:42,878
Don't go inside.

245
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:45,578
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:48,778
What's this?

247
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:52,978
That's my liquid foundation.

248
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,478
Why is it in a place like this?

249
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,478
Don't touch it!

250
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:59,378
We've got to keep the site intact.

251
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:02,678
Let's leave this room as is, and seal it off.

252
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:05,878
When the police come, I'll use the master key and open the room.

253
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:07,578
The police.

254
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:09,278
A person has died.

255
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:11,778
I've got to call the police, don't I?

256
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,978
That's true, but...

257
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:20,878
Miki, I think you should go to your room and rest.

258
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,978
True.

259
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:24,278
Yes, thank you.

260
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:26,878
Excuse me...

261
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:33,578
I called the police

262
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,278
but was told that unless the storm subsides,

263
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:37,478
they can't send any boats out.

264
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,778
It means that the culprit is among us, doesn't it?

265
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,178
Right?

266
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:50,478
Because it's storming outside and even the police can't come here.

267
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:51,878
It's hard to think that someone from outside

268
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:53,578
committed the crime, isn't it?

269
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,478
I don't want to admit it, but I think so too.

270
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,878
Oh, no.

271
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,178
Uh... what shall we do about dinner?

272
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:05,378
I'm sorry to say

273
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:08,578
that we'll just have to let everyone wait until the police arrive.

274
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,078
I don't mind.

275
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,078
Because I don't want to eat dinner together with a murderer.

276
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:17,578
You sound as if you're not the killer.

277
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:18,578
What's with you?

278
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,178
Are you suspecting me?

279
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,278
Well...

280
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,178
Let's calm down and organize the circumstances together.

281
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:32,478
Miki, are you alright already?

282
00:16:32,478 --> 00:16:34,578
Yes, I am.

283
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:38,078
I'm sorry to have worried you.

284
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,078
So, everyone's here.

285
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,878
Miki, please come here.

286
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:44,978
Thank you.

287
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:48,178
Then first, about time that the murder was committed.

288
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:50,678
It was probably between the time that Mr. Miyasaka left the lobby to

289
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:55,478
when he was found dead by Mr. Okita.

290
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:59,578
All during that time we were in the lobby right through.

291
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:03,278
In other words, me, Ran, Miki, Mr. Kurahashi

292
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,878
and the four kids have an alibi.

293
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:10,278
I see. The ones with no alibi are...

294
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:13,778
actress, Saeko. Cameraman, Mr. Takayama,

295
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:17,178
AD, Mr. Yamamoto, his assistant, Mr. Okita,

296
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:20,278
and my wife.

297
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:23,678
I was getting dinner ready all the while!

298
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:27,578
Yeah, there's no way you could be the culprit.

299
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:30,178
You met Mr. Miyasaka for the first time today.

300
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:32,278
So you have no motive.

301
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:38,178
Which means, that one of the four among us is the culprit?

302
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:41,978
As record of evidence, I'm going to start rolling the camera from here.

303
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,278
So, who wants to start justifying themselves?

304
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:49,178
Uh, may I ask a question?

305
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:50,978
Hey, Conan.

306
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:53,278
All I want to do is ask a question.

307
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:55,878
I'd like to ask you, Mr. Okita, but...

308
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:58,878
Mr. Miyasaka's room is auto lock, isn't it?

309
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,978
How'd you get into the room?

310
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:02,778
Was the door open?

311
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:05,278
In other words, when Okita went to the room,

312
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:07,378
Miyasaka was still alive.

313
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,178
Then after you, you know what, Miyasaka,

314
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:12,078
you pretended to be the first one to find his body.

315
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:14,878
You were pissed at Miyasaka about having to do the stunts,

316
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:16,578
so it's a possibility...

317
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:19,578
Hey, hold it.

318
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,578
When I got there...

319
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,878
a bottle of cosmetic was stuck by the door

320
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:26,678
and there was a space open!

321
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:29,478
It was Saeko's, wasn't it?

322
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:33,078
Doesn't that mean she went to Miyasaka's room?

323
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,578
Hey! You're suspecting me too?

324
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:40,078
Why would I have to do something like that in the first place?

325
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,278
You've got motive!

326
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:46,878
Saeko suspected that Miyasaka and I had an affair

327
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:48,378
and was jealous about it.

328
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,978
Love entanglement?

329
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:56,878
If you wanted to go that far, I'll tell you honestly.

330
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:00,678
It's true that I went to Mr. Miyasaka's room

331
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:03,678
in order to ask him about his relationship with Miki.

332
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,778
But...

333
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:09,678
Sorry, I just don't feel up to it now.

334
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:15,078
He didn't let me into his room and I was shooed away.

335
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:18,678
But, I didn't take foundation with me.

336
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:21,878
And yet, I myself don't know

337
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:24,478
why it was at Miyasaka's room.

338
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:28,678
There's something I'd like to ask you too, Mr. Takayama.

339
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:30,078
What is it?

340
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:33,478
When I found Mr. Miyasaka's dead body,

341
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:35,878
you arrived there really quickly, didn't you?

342
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:40,278
Almost as if you were waiting for me to burst out of the room.

343
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:43,178
It could be that you lied about Mr. Miyasaka calling me,

344
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:45,678
and you're the real culprit, Mr. Takayama.

345
00:19:45,678 --> 00:19:48,678
Weren't you trying to frame me up as the killer?

346
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:49,878
What?

347
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:51,878
I know that

348
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:53,778
Mr. Takayama owed a lot of money to Mr. Miyasaka

349
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,778
from gambling playing mah-jong.

350
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,578
You idiot!

351
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:00,778
I went to check you out

352
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:02,878
because I was worried whether you could shoot the video alright!

353
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:05,278
My debts had nothing to do with it!

354
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:07,078
I wonder about that...

355
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:10,278
How about you, Mr. Yamamoto?

356
00:20:10,278 --> 00:20:12,278
The murder weapon was the knife

357
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:16,578
that was among your small props, wasn't it?

358
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:21,178
I'll bet you were outraged at being punched by Miyasaka and did it?

359
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,378
You were being slaved driven all the way up to now too.

360
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:27,378
So, maybe all that accumulated to hate and...

361
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:30,178
No, I didn't do it!

362
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:34,578
I lost that knife when Mr. Miyasaka punched me!

363
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,578
I went to look for it right away,

364
00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:42,378
but it suddenly began raining so hard.

365
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:46,378
I just couldn't find it.

366
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,878
Really?

367
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,778
What was it?

368
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:53,778
The uncomfortable feeling I felt when I saw Mr. Miyasaka's dead body.

369
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:55,078
Something...

370
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:57,578
Something's not right.

371
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:00,378
Mr. Okita,

372
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:03,478
if I remember correctly, the video camera was rolling

373
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,378
when we went to Mr. Miyasaka's room, wasn't it?

374
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:07,078
Yeah.

375
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:11,178
I kept it rolling from the time we went to Mr. Miyasaka's room.

376
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:15,678
That means that everything from the time

377
00:21:15,678 --> 00:21:18,078
that Mr. Miyasaka's dead body was found is recorded, right?

378
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:23,478
I just thought that if we watched that, you could come up with some clue.

379
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:26,778
I'm sorry! I can't take it.

380
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:29,578
Not the video of Mr. Miyasaka's dead body.

381
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:36,378
Conan, Miki is really shocked over Mr. Miyasaka's death,

382
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,378
you know?

383
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:40,678
Yep. I'm sorry.

384
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:45,578
Who on earth could've killed Mr. Miyasaka?

385
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:50,978
Mr. Takayama owed a lot of money to Mr. Miyasaka.

386
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,678
It's possible to think that after he killed Mr. Miyasaka,

387
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,778
he made Mr. Okita go to Mr. Miyasaka's room

388
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:58,478
and tried to set him up as the culprit.

389
00:21:58,478 --> 00:22:00,078
Mr. Okita was angry

390
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:02,378
because he was forced to do many impossible stunts.

391
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:04,078
Did he kill Mr. Miyasaka

392
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:07,678
and pretend that he was the first one to find the body?

393
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:12,078
Saeko was jealous of the relationship between Mr. Miyasaka and Miki.

394
00:22:12,078 --> 00:22:15,578
Her liquid foundation bottle was found at the scene of the crime.

395
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:19,878
Mr. Yamamoto had a grudge against Mr. Miyasaka for punching him.

396
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:24,378
Saying that he lost the knife could be a lie.

397
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:27,278
At any rate, there's no mistake that the culprit

398
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,178
is someone who is inside this pension.

399
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:58,078
"Next Episode" -How long do we have to stay in this room?

400
00:23:58,078 --> 00:23:59,778
Where can we flee to

401
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:02,278
when we're on an isolated island in the storm?

402
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:04,678
I'm not the culprit.

403
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:09,578
Mr. Takayama seems very concerned about the police.

404
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:13,178
It's the thing that bothered me when I first saw it.

405
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:16,178
The culprit got away!

406
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:19,278
I've finally figured out what was bothering me.

407
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:20,878
Next Conan,
