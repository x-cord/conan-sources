1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:01,735
The body of Yuri Saeki,

2
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:05,535
the woman who went missing with the Tears of Borgia,

3
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:08,835
a jewel scheduled to be used as part of a live TV drama broadcast

4
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:12,335
40 years ago, was discovered.

5
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:16,135
Yuri Saeki's granddaughter, Sumire

6
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:21,035
hired the Mouri Detective Agency to clear Yuri's name.

7
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:22,336
But...

8
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:26,935
Hey, Mizusawa!

9
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:30,335
Didn't you say something about the whatever of Borgia?

10
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:31,636
Mizusawa!

11
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,736
Something's burning.

12
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:41,235
A fire? Could it be...

13
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:43,336
Mizusawa! Hot...

14
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:46,935
Hot...

15
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:49,436
Mizusawa!

16
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:53,335
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

17
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,435
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

18
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:57,235
A skeleton emerges across time and space.

19
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:59,435
The case catches fire, putting the old man in danger!

20
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:00,935
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,735
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:04,736
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:51,477
"The Cursed Tears of Borgia (Part 2)"

24
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:56,276
Dad!

25
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,576
Be quiet. We're in a hospital.

26
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:02,576
I'm glad you're doing okay.

27
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:05,376
Yeah, it's just a scratch.

28
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:08,076
Be careful.

29
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:11,976
Inspector Megure, I'm sorry for all the trouble.

30
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:13,176
It's fine.

31
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:17,076
But I couldn't save Mizusawa.

32
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:21,976
Isn't he the one who found Sumire's grandmother?

33
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:24,876
Yeah. He was my drinking buddy.

34
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,977
He said he had something to discuss with me today.

35
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:32,376
Gosh! If only I'd gotten there sooner!

36
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,876
About that, Mouri...

37
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:41,177
The autopsy revealed that he hardly inhaled any smoke at all.

38
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:45,876
So by the time the fire started, he was already...

39
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,677
That's right.

40
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:53,976
Come in.

41
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:55,776
-Excuse us. -Excuse us.

42
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,276
Ran.

43
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:58,576
What is it?

44
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:02,576
Forensics just called.

45
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:07,876
They examined the victim's phone that Mouri saved from the fire.

46
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:11,576
There wasn't a single image saved on it.

47
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:12,976
What?

48
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:14,976
It wasn't just the images.

49
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,976
Aside from Mouri's,

50
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:19,876
they didn't find a single fingerprint on the phone.

51
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:22,476
Which means...

52
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:26,376
Someone erased all the images on the phone

53
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:28,276
and wiped their prints off of it.

54
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,676
Right, mister?

55
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:34,676
Yeah, and it's probably the same person

56
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:37,576
who murdered Mizusawa and started the fire.

57
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,676
Officer Takagi.

58
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,776
What about the erased data?

59
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:43,676
We're having forensics restore it right now.

60
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:44,776
I see.

61
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:49,176
Mouri, you were supposed to meet the victim at six, right?

62
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:50,177
Yes.

63
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:54,176
Do you remember anything from when the fire started?

64
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,276
Judging by the situation,

65
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:59,276
the fire was started about 30 minutes earlier.

66
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:02,276
It couldn't have been more than an hour.

67
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:06,376
Which means Mizusawa was murdered before that,

68
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:08,976
between 5 and 5:30.

69
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:11,876
What about his associates' alibis?

70
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:16,476
Nonogaki Real Estate, the site of the fire, was closed today.

71
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,576
We haven't been able to confirm the whereabouts

72
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:22,376
of President Nonogaki or any of his employees.

73
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:23,776
I see.

74
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:27,176
Also, the victim's friend

75
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:31,877
and client Kanoya Construction President Hiromichi Umeki...

76
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,376
-I've heard that name before. -Yes, sir.

77
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,576
Umeki was with the victim

78
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:40,876
when they discovered the body at the dam.

79
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:43,076
Oh, right.

80
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,976
And? What about him?

81
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:50,676
He saw the news about the fire on a TV at a bar

82
00:05:50,677 --> 00:05:53,176
and came to talk to the police.

83
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,476
According to him,

84
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:58,076
he'd been drinking with several friends since around five.

85
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:02,376
So only Umeki has an alibi.

86
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:03,876
Hey, mister.

87
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:06,276
Don't you want to see photos of the crime scene?

88
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:07,376
What?

89
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:12,476
You might be able to figure something out if you saw it again.

90
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:13,776
You're right.

91
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:15,576
What do you think, Inspector?

92
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,776
Very well.

93
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,876
Bring them immediately.

94
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,077
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:24,477
"From: Kanoya Tatsuma. Subject: No Subject. I found the kine."

96
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:27,876
Kinescope?

97
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:31,676
Isn't that the powdered roasted soy beans you put on mochi?

98
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:34,476
-Before video became widespread, -Oh, silly me.

99
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,976
-they used to convert important images to film... -I was thinking of kinako.

100
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:38,876
in order to preserve them.

101
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:41,976
Kanoya kept a kine, not kinako,

102
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:44,877
of the final scene of "I Killed Them".

103
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:48,876
That's a valuable record,

104
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:53,076
but it's not like it will solve the case.

105
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:56,776
I already know who killed Mizusawa.

106
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:58,176
What?

107
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:01,577
We're going for the other case.

108
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,676
This brings back memories.

109
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:08,876
"I Killed Them", or "Killed 'Em" for short.

110
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:11,576
"Kanoya Tatsuma (72)" -You remember?

111
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:13,876
Indeed I do.

112
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:17,276
I think I was in sixth grade at the time.

113
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:18,976
My, my.

114
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:22,476
Hey, mister. Was the window open in the final scene?

115
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,576
No, we closed it.

116
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,576
We didn't want to distract from Nagisa

117
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,976
in the important final scene.

118
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:33,977
It'd be ruined if the wind blew the curtains.

119
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:38,476
Come to think of it, that line was incredibly intense.

120
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:41,677
I see. No, but maybe...

121
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:44,876
Your grandson is rather strange.

122
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:46,877
Oh, is he?

123
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:52,776
Yes, Inspector.

124
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:55,977
Yes. Thank you.

125
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,576
We've gathered the others,

126
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,776
but where are we headed?

127
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,576
The dam.

128
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:07,677
There's something I want to check at the filming location.

129
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:16,677
According to Kanoya, it should be around here.

130
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:20,077
Let's see...

131
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:25,576
I don't see anything.

132
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:27,776
-Not right now. -Huh?

133
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:30,576
Beika City is...

134
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,976
I knew it.

135
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,576
Knew what?

136
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:35,276
Hey, Shinichi!

137
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,077
We're leaving already?

138
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:45,260
Mouri's late.

139
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:46,860
Yeah.

140
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:51,160
I have someplace to be after this.

141
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:53,660
Probably a gambling hall.

142
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:54,661
What?

143
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:58,161
I heard you're being threatened by some suspicious people recently.

144
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:02,861
Not here.

145
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:05,861
He's here.

146
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,360
This way, Mouri.

147
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:12,260
Everyone's waiting for you.

148
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,760
What? Waiting?

149
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,860
Inspector. You're here, too.

150
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:19,960
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:23,560
You're the one who asked us to come here to solve the case.

152
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,361
What? I did?

153
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:28,560
What? Already?

154
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:30,360
Dad?

155
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,060
That was quick.

156
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:36,060
Thank you for coming, everyone.

157
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:37,761
Have a seat.

158
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:44,260
Now then, I asked you to come here to discuss the two cases

159
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:49,560
surrounding the jewel known as the Tears of Borgia.

160
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,060
Unbelievable.

161
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:55,060
I doubt I have anything to do with that, so I'm leaving.

162
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,560
No.

163
00:09:56,561 --> 00:10:00,061
Its connection to you will eventually emerge, Umeki.

164
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:05,960
I'm sure some of you have heard that.

165
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:08,660
Western history scholar Senju said

166
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:12,660
the Tears of Borgia didn't actually exist

167
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:14,960
and that the jewel was a fake.

168
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,060
What?

169
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:19,460
However, though the jewel itself was fake,

170
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:25,161
Yuri Saeki who was transporting it was indeed found dead.

171
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:30,560
Unfortunately, 40 years is quite the barrier.

172
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:33,661
People thought it impossible to determine the truth.

173
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:38,960
But a new incident occurred in the present.

174
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:42,560
Its victim was one of the men who discovered Yuri,

175
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:45,360
Sho Mizusawa.

176
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,960
Not only that, but he was killed not by the fire,

177
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,261
but by someone who strangled him to death.

178
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,160
The investigation briefly proceeded under the assumption

179
00:10:57,161 --> 00:11:00,360
that the culprit was someone who had no alibi for when the fire started,

180
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:05,360
but the crime scene suggested the existence of another culprit.

181
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:07,760
Officer Takagi, the photos.

182
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:08,960
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,460
Take a look.

184
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,360
The platter that should be on the shelf is on the table,

185
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:16,460
and the bottles are empty.

186
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:18,161
Why do you suppose that is?

187
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,160
It's because

188
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:25,760
that's a picture of a timed ignition device

189
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:29,061
made from the materials on hand.

190
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:42,360
This device the culprit made to get away with his crime

191
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:45,960
instead limited who the culprit could be.

192
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:49,260
In other words, whoever has an alibi for the time the fire started

193
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:50,960
is the culprit.

194
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,561
Am I right, Umeki?

195
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:57,460
I have no reason to kill Mizusawa.

196
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:58,860
I see.

197
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:01,760
Officer Takagi, the photos from the phone at the crime scene.

198
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:02,761
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:07,860
These two photos were restored from the phone's deleted data.

200
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,861
They show the glovebox of the car Yuri was riding.

201
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:15,860
Look at the time these photos were taken.

202
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:20,160
The first was taken at 9:41,

203
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:24,360
while the second was taken at 9:51.

204
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:27,660
The glovebox that was closed in the first photo

205
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:29,760
is open in the second.

206
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:34,060
Officer Chiba, what time was the body reported?

207
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,460
9:45 am.

208
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:41,361
In other words, Mizusawa photographed the car at 9:41.

209
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,460
Then he switched with you

210
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:47,860
and reported the body at 9:45.

211
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,660
He then returned to the car

212
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:52,561
and photographed it at 9:51.

213
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:55,260
In other words, Umeki,

214
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:58,060
while Mizusawa was away from the car for 10 minutes,

215
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:02,661
you're the only one who could've opened the glovebox.

216
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:07,460
When Mizusawa noticed the open glovebox later,

217
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:11,160
he suspected you took something from the car.

218
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:15,360
He tried to discuss it with me, but you killed him.

219
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,860
This is ridiculous!

220
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:21,261
Are you saying the Tears of Borgia was inside that glovebox?

221
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:26,560
Why would I know about that ancient history?

222
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:28,760
I'm disappointed, Hiromichi.

223
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,760
I told you about the Tears of Borgia

224
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:34,061
countless times when you were a boy.

225
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:38,460
Gosh!

226
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,260
For this...

227
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:42,561
For this fake...

228
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,460
Darn it!

229
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:46,561
No!

230
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:51,761
Even if it's fake, my grandmother risked her life for this.

231
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:54,661
Darn it.

232
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,261
Darn it!

233
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:11,761
So who stabbed my grandmother?

234
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:18,260
Allow me to take over for Mouri.

235
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,060
You?

236
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:24,360
Yes. After all, it happened 40 years ago.

237
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:28,060
And it's more speculation than anything.

238
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,660
I'm better suited for this than Detective Mouri.

239
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:35,860
Kanoya, could you prepare the kine?

240
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:37,561
Very well.

241
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:48,260
Kanoya preserved the final scene

242
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:52,860
of the forty-year-old drama "I Killed Them" on 16 mm film.

243
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:54,860
The maid played by Nagisa

244
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,961
calls over her boyfriend the butler.

245
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:01,960
This is the scene suggested by Yuri

246
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:05,160
in which she begins peeling apples, right?

247
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,261
Yes, but...

248
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,161
"Red Hood has arrived"?

249
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,360
Nagisa.

250
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,460
Masao.

251
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:37,660
Huh? Didn't you say only Nagisa went to the filming location?

252
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:39,360
That's right.

253
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:43,660
But look. The man playing the butler is there with her.

254
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,660
The butler's at the studio set.

255
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,160
What?

256
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:51,461
We're switching cameras at set times.

257
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:58,760
But the maid is in the scene with him.

258
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,860
That's a stand-in.

259
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,960
We had a similar-looking actress

260
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:09,060
wear the same costume and stand in for Nagisa.

261
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:11,260
This shot was done on location.

262
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,760
Then we switched to the studio here.

263
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:16,260
I see.

264
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:18,661
Could you pause it here?

265
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:24,460
The rest of the scenes are unrelated to the case,

266
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,660
so we'll leave them out.

267
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:31,160
I'd like to present my theory to you now.

268
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:34,761
Sumire, I'd especially like you to hear this.

269
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,760
Go ahead.

270
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,560
While the drama was being filmed at the studio,

271
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:44,160
Nagisa waited on location for her scene to start

272
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:48,260
and for Yuri to arrive with the Tears of Borgia.

273
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:52,360
However, she never arrived.

274
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:55,161
Nagisa must've panicked.

275
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,661
Calm down, Nagisa.

276
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:01,861
We have three more minutes.

277
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,661
We need to film the real thing.

278
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:13,760
You're late, Yuri.

279
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,461
She won't make it in time.

280
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:21,560
Yuri! I'm glad you made it.

281
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,861
Quickly, the Tears of Borgia.

282
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:28,260
Yuri had been convinced by Professor Senju

283
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:30,760
not to embarrass the family with a fake.

284
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:33,060
They were both desperate.

285
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:35,260
Yuri had no time to explain,

286
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:38,061
and Nagisa had a 40 degree fever.

287
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:10,260
Yuri tried to get as far away from the location as she could

288
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,860
so Nagisa wouldn't be blamed,

289
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:18,661
and so the fake Tears of Borgia wouldn't appear in the drama.

290
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:32,360
At the studio, the stand-in maid stabbed Red Hood to death.

291
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,561
All that remained was Nagisa's final shot.

292
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:40,560
Nagisa, the real jewel won't make it in time.

293
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:45,060
I'm sorry, but you'll have to wear the fake ring.

294
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,961
I... I understand.

295
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,761
I...

296
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:02,460
I...

297
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:04,661
I killed him!

298
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,461
"The End."

299
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:24,260
That's what I imagine happened behind the camera.

300
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:28,360
It's true that your story explains

301
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:33,060
the fallen car and the fruit knife.

302
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:37,760
And Nagisa's current condition, but...

303
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:41,160
It's too bad that it's only speculation.

304
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,760
It can't be helped.

305
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,860
Hey, didn't you say

306
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:48,560
you had them close the window for the final scene?

307
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:52,360
Yes, it was necessary for the performance.

308
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:55,760
Then if the window was open,

309
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,661
doesn't that prove Yuri came?

310
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:02,160
It wouldn't be conclusive,

311
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:04,660
but it would be circumstantial evidence.

312
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,360
But since the curtains were closed,

313
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:09,460
we don't know if the window was opened.

314
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:14,760
I saw something shining when you showed us this film

315
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,561
on the editor this afternoon.

316
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:24,160
Just before the words "The End" appear onscreen,

317
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:28,060
when Nagisa disappears from the shot...

318
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,460
Right here.

319
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:35,360
Can't you see something shining through the lace curtains?

320
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:37,360
I see. You're right.

321
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,260
How embarrassing.

322
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:43,260
I hadn't noticed in 40 years.

323
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,660
That proves Dr. Agasa's story.

324
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:50,461
Yes. Now, I can report the results to my mother.

325
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:54,260
But I wonder what it was.

326
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:56,360
-Could it be a star? -No.

327
00:20:56,361 --> 00:21:00,360
It was cloudy that day. There wasn't a single star in the sky.

328
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,160
Then was it plane lights?

329
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,160
A plane?

330
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,560
I see. This is...

331
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:11,260
That's right. This light was probably

332
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:17,461
the now demolished Beika City aerial lighthouse.

333
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:46,160
Several days later,

334
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:52,660
we learned Nagisa Asahina kept calling Yuri's name,

335
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:56,060
so we went to Grand Light with Sumire where Nagisa lived.

336
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:58,061
Nagisa.

337
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:06,961
Yuri, you're okay.

338
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:12,360
Yes. I've been fine this whole time, Nagisa.

339
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,760
I'm so glad.

340
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:17,461
I had such a long and terrible dream.

341
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:30,060
Nagisa's heart, which had been tormented

342
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:34,860
by the ring's curse for 40 long years,

343
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:40,061
was released by the kindness of one grandmother and her granddaughter.

344
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:45,161
"Next Episode."

345
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:48,860
-Thank you. -It's only once a day,

346
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,960
so enjoy yourselves.

347
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,260
The dinosaur bones fell apart!

348
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:58,060
I don't believe it! My brachiosaurus!

349
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,961
Like you, I wanted everyone to enjoy them.

350
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:06,361
But it was only for a few seconds, right?

351
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:12,461
