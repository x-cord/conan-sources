1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,199
I found it!

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,699
Remi Sekizawa's photo book, "DoRemi"!

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,799
You have the last copy in stock!

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,999
I'm so lucky!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,499
Your big sister is so popular.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,399
Thank you.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,899
To me, she's still my sloppy and careless big sister.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,399
But she was so cute as a detective's assistant

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,099
in the drama that was aired the other day.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,199
She was a hopeless assistant

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,299
who didn't have any skills of deduction, though.

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,299
Well, that's what the script wanted her to be.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,599
She is a model first and foremost, after all.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,099
So, is it really okay for our friends to come over tonight?

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,599
To Remi Sekizawa's birthday party.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,599
Even though we're not famous or anything.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Yes.

18
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:47,799
It is a small party at the place where one of her classmates works.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,699
And we're also celebrating my birthday at the same time.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,899
I see. Your birthday is two days after Valentine's Day, right?

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,399
That's right, on 16 February.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,799
My sister's birthday is on the day after Valentine's Day,

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,199
so we've celebrated our birthdays together since we were kids.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,899
Besides, there's another reason I want you all to come to the party.

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,499
Is something the matter?

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,499
No, it's not such a big deal.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,199
So, Yumi. About what I said earlier...

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,399
He's a first-year in elementary school, right?

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,900
It's fine! I think it's okay to have just one more kid at the party.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,399
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,199
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,699
At a well-known model's birthday party,

33
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,899
the screams carried by the cake echo throughout!

34
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,499
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,299
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,700
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,900
"A Birthday Party with Divine Punishment (Part 1)"

38
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,099
The cafe isn't that big.

39
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,599
But there are so many models, actors, and entertainers here!

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,599
No wonder everyone looks so stylish.

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,000
Aren't you glad you came along, Conan?

42
00:03:57,463 --> 00:04:00,462
What's up? You don't look happy at all.

43
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:05,362
Conan has a mouth ulcer, so it's difficult for him to speak.

44
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:07,662
Did you bring your medicine?

45
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:10,362
Yeah, I brought it.

46
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:14,462
You should have left the kid at home if he has a mouth ulcer.

47
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,962
But dad has to attend

48
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,862
the neighbourhood association meeting tonight,

49
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,862
so Conan would have been alone at home.

50
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,762
How about you take your medicine before the party gets started?

51
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,262
You're right.

52
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:30,862
Let's see. If I recall correctly, it's one tablet per dose.

53
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:33,562
I put the mouth ulcer tablets

54
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:37,462
in the same pill case as that capsule.

55
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,262
Hey.

56
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:42,863
What's the blue-and-white capsule for?

57
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:46,463
It... it's nothing!

58
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:50,062
Of course, I couldn't tell her.

59
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:52,862
It's the antidote to APTX 4869

60
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,962
that Haibara gave me during the field trip.

61
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:00,362
I can't believe I've kept it on me the entire time without using it.

62
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:04,162
What's this? Is the kid afraid of swallowing tablets?

63
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:07,962
I don't think that's the case.

64
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:09,662
Mum?

65
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:14,462
Just as you predicted, Conan has the capsule with him.

66
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:16,062
I see.

67
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:21,962
But a blue-and-white pill is different from the poison I was given.

68
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:24,562
Judging by his flustered response,

69
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:29,062
it's likely an antidote to revert my body to its original age.

70
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,962
If possible, take it from him.

71
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,963
Okay, mum.

72
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:40,362
That's right. I was given a red-and-white pill.

73
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:43,162
At London's Vauxhall Bridge.

74
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:45,263
They defeated me and...

75
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:51,262
You must be my sister Yumi's classmates.

76
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,762
These are Ran, Sonoko, and Sera.

77
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:56,662
Nice to meet you.

78
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:59,162
I hope you enjoy the party to the fullest.

79
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:00,762
While we're here, I...

80
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,962
I bought your photo book earlier today,

81
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,262
I'd appreciate it if you could sign it at a later time.

82
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:08,562
In that case, I can sign it for you now.

83
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:12,462
Mr. Kushiyama, could you get the permanent marker from my bag?

84
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:13,863
Yes.

85
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:16,662
Here you go.

86
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:17,962
Thanks.

87
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:19,762
Should I write "To Ran"?

88
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:22,162
Yes! Thank you very much!

89
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:23,462
No problem.

90
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:24,662
That's weird.

91
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:27,162
I can't write a thing with this marker.

92
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:30,962
There was an acrid smell when I opened your bag earlier,

93
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:33,162
so maybe the marker was uncapped.

94
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:35,262
-No way. -For goodness' sake.

95
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,662
You always forget to cap your markers, Remi.

96
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:40,762
Here's a spare permanent marker I have ready.

97
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,762
Nice one, Yumi!

98
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:44,562
Sorry to make you wait. Was your name Sonoko?

99
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:46,462
-Hey, Yumi! -It's Ran.

100
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:48,862
Who do we ask for water?

101
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,562
The kid wants to take his medicine.

102
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:52,563
Well...

103
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:54,762
In that case, I can bring it to you.

104
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,862
-Yes, please. -While we're at it,

105
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,562
I can help inform the staff if you have food allergies.

106
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:01,063
We don't really have any.

107
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:03,763
Understood.

108
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:06,262
I'll treasure it always!

109
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:07,562
I'd appreciate it if you do.

110
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:11,262
Come on, Remi, you're not supposed to put the marker in there!

111
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,162
You'll leave stains on it.

112
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,062
But what if I get asked for an autograph again?

113
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:17,962
I'll carry it for you until the time comes!

114
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:20,162
You almost can't tell who's older.

115
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:21,163
You're right.

116
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:23,862
They've been like that since they were kids.

117
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:26,562
Yumi is more reliable even though she's four years younger.

118
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:27,762
I really thought that

119
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:30,762
Yumi would be the one who'd apply to become a model.

120
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:34,162
I'm a classmate of Remi's in middle school and high school.

121
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,862
My name's Tsuguo Hatsune.

122
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:39,662
I work as a pastry chef, and someday I would like to open my own shop.

123
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:43,962
I asked the head chef if I could make the birthday cake,

124
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,262
so please look forward to it.

125
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:47,962
Yes.

126
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:50,262
You've just started out as a pastry chef,

127
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,262
but you're dreaming of getting your own shop?

128
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,762
Well, yes.

129
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:55,962
Good luck, then.

130
00:07:55,963 --> 00:08:01,062
If you wrote "made by Remi Sekizawa's classmate" in the name,

131
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,063
your cakes might just sell well!

132
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:06,762
Thank you for that.

133
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:10,162
Remi! Happy birthday!

134
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:11,962
Mr. Hanasaki!

135
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:15,962
Here you go. A birthday bouquet.

136
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,862
-Thank you, Mr. Hanasaki. -Who is that creepy dude?

137
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,862
That's Mizutoshi Hanasaki.

138
00:08:20,863 --> 00:08:22,362
He's a hair and make-up artist who's married with children

139
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:23,862
but he has asked her out countless times.

140
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:26,862
She has always rejected, though.

141
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:28,962
What a despicable man.

142
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:31,062
What's with the glasses?

143
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:33,062
You'll have to wait and see.

144
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:36,262
Not only that, but he has tried to ask me out before.

145
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,962
You should have just ignored him!

146
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,662
But his skills in hair and make-up are genuine,

147
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:43,762
so we can't just let go of him.

148
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:47,162
I see. So that's why you invited us.

149
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:50,062
So that he wouldn't try to flirt with you.

150
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,762
Yes. It's easier to avoid him if I'm with you guys.

151
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:56,262
It's all right! We'll protect you!

152
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,562
Don't worry!

153
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:00,362
Thanks.

154
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:03,262
Well, anyone would feel safe around a Jeet Kune Do expert,

155
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:07,063
a karate expert, and a daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group.

156
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:14,462
That was delicious.

157
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,262
There's only dessert left.

158
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:18,962
They'll bring out the birthday cake.

159
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:20,763
I can't wait!

160
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:29,562
Happy birthday to you.

161
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:35,662
Happy birthday dear Remi and Yumi.

162
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:40,363
Happy birthday to you.

163
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:45,863
Happy birthday...

164
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,762
Your glasses are glowing!

165
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:51,762
How do I look? I look good, right?

166
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:55,362
While the cake is being sliced and distributed,

167
00:09:55,363 --> 00:09:59,563
please enjoy these precious pictures of sisters Remi and Yumi.

168
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:04,663
Yumi was so tiny!

169
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:08,362
Please, have a bite.

170
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:11,862
-Please enjoy the cake. -Thank you.

171
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:13,063
Excuse me.

172
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,362
Remi!

173
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:20,862
The three-second rule applies here.

174
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,363
Come on.

175
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:30,862
Did somebody fall?

176
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,763
Was it the hair and make-up artist?

177
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:35,062
I'm sorry,

178
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:39,062
but a wine bottle just broke, so please don't come this way!

179
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,162
There's no way of telling even if he said "this way"...

180
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:42,862
Where is it?

181
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:44,662
Anyway, we have to turn on the lights.

182
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:47,963
Gosh, I can't see anything in this darkness.

183
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,262
Mr. Hanasaki has fallen,

184
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:53,262
but his glowing glasses are partially hidden.

185
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,262
Is there someone next to his head?

186
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,763
What on earth is going on?

187
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:11,063
"Divine Punishment"

188
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:17,362
Death by poison?

189
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:19,462
So, the victim, Mizutoshi Hanasaki,

190
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:22,862
ate something that was poisoned and died. Is that right?

191
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:25,462
Yes. According to forensics,

192
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:28,462
it is likely that there was poison in the cake

193
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:32,263
the victim ate before falling over.

194
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:35,562
A vial of cyanide-based poison

195
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:39,762
was found under the table where he was sitting.

196
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:42,962
But how did the culprit do it in the middle of a party?

197
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:47,762
He fell when the projector was showing the pictures.

198
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:50,662
The inside of the cafe was dim at the time.

199
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:54,962
But still, even if there was barely any light...

200
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:58,062
If someone was writing on the victim's forehead

201
00:11:58,063 --> 00:11:59,762
with a permanent marker,

202
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:02,262
someone else must have seen him or her do it!

203
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,362
About that...

204
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:08,262
Just after the victim fell, the projector was suddenly turned off,

205
00:12:08,263 --> 00:12:12,162
and the entire hall became pitch black.

206
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:15,462
But if it was pitch black, how did anyone manage to write

207
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:17,562
these words on the victim's forehead?

208
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:19,662
Actually, the glasses

209
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:23,062
were a type of party item that glowed in the dark.

210
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,362
I see.

211
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:29,262
Anyone could write if they were able to find where his head was.

212
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:31,862
The writing is quite distorted,

213
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:33,762
the culprit must have used their opposite hand

214
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:36,162
so that they wouldn't be identified by the handwriting.

215
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:41,062
But there are close to 40 people here, including guests and staff.

216
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:44,262
It would be difficult to find the culprit amongst them.

217
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,562
There are four suspects.

218
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:48,362
Suspects?

219
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:52,262
I think he's saying that there are four suspects.

220
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:53,862
You're here too?

221
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:58,062
Our classmate is the sister of Remi Sekizawa,

222
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:02,362
so she invited us to the birthday party.

223
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:06,162
So? What do you mean by "there are four suspects"?

224
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:07,862
Can't you tell just by looking at the scene?

225
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:11,562
There's the projector and our table to the left of the victim,

226
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:13,062
so no one can get through.

227
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:15,262
And to the right of the victim...

228
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:19,062
Look. A staff member dropped and broke a wine bottle in the dark,

229
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,962
but there aren't any footprints

230
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,362
even though there's wine on the floor.

231
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:24,363
That's not all.

232
00:13:24,364 --> 00:13:27,762
The door across from the victim leads to the kitchen,

233
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:30,562
but the kitchen staff testified that

234
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:34,362
none of them left it after the projector was turned off

235
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:37,562
but before the lights turned on again.

236
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:40,162
In other words, the murder scene

237
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:43,362
is a closed space where no one could leave

238
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:46,962
after the victim ate the poisoned cake and fell to the floor.

239
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:49,962
If you exclude us, who weren't acquainted with the victim,

240
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,662
there were only four people at the scene.

241
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:57,462
I see. So, who are the four?

242
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,762
I've told them to stand by in a corner

243
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:03,262
so that nothing gets carried out.

244
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,162
These are the suspects who could have slipped the poison

245
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:08,562
-to the victim. -Hold up.

246
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:10,362
Yumi is one of the suspects, too?

247
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:12,262
Remove her from suspicion!

248
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:13,862
I'm including her just in case.

249
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:16,462
She does seem to know the victim, after all.

250
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:18,462
Isn't that right, Conan?

251
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:19,662
You're right.

252
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,262
What is this?

253
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:23,662
Has your mouth ulcer not healed yet?

254
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,462
Wouldn't it be better if you took more medicine?

255
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:27,962
I'm going to be fine.

256
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:31,762
In any case, we'll have all the other guests go home

257
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:36,262
and question you all individually.

258
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:38,262
We'll ask you how you were connected to the victim

259
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:43,362
and what you did before and after he fell down.

260
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:47,062
The deceased, Mr. Hanasaki, was a hair and make-up artist,

261
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:51,162
and he handled my hair and make-up for almost every event.

262
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:53,762
He was good at his job and quite popular,

263
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:55,362
so I appreciated what he did.

264
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:58,762
You were only involved with him for your work, right?

265
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,062
That's right.

266
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:03,262
But he tried to ask me out numerous times.

267
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:05,362
Ask you out?

268
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,162
But if I recall, Mr. Hanasaki was already married, wasn't he?

269
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:09,762
Perhaps he wanted an affair?

270
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:12,462
That was why I said no every time.

271
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,862
I thought he was half-kidding when he said it.

272
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:18,562
-I see. -What were you doing during the incident?

273
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:21,662
Mr. Hanasaki was wearing glow-in-the-dark glasses,

274
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,362
and after I commented on it,

275
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:25,962
he ate the cake that was brought in.

276
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:29,562
After that, he stood up all of a sudden and fell to the floor.

277
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:33,562
I didn't get up from my seat until the lights were on again.

278
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:37,362
You didn't do anything aside from eating the cake, correct?

279
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:40,062
The hall was dim

280
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:42,162
because the projector was turned on to show pictures.

281
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:45,362
And the strawberry on top of my cake dropped onto the table.

282
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:48,062
I saw that, too.

283
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:50,662
Remi said the three-second rule applied,

284
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,162
so she ate the strawberry in one bite.

285
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:55,462
Three... three-second rule?

286
00:15:55,463 --> 00:15:57,162
Don't add unnecessary details!

287
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:58,562
Sorry.

288
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,962
So, Yumi, were you next to your sister the entire time

289
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:02,262
during the incident?

290
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:06,362
Yes. I love cakes, so I finished mine quickly.

291
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,462
Then, I thought about going to the toilet.

292
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:11,662
But I heard Mr. Hanasaki groaning and the sound of him falling.

293
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:15,162
And there was no one rushing to his side?

294
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:17,762
No one. It was pitch black, after all.

295
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:21,262
There was also a commotion over the wine bottle that broke nearby.

296
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:24,462
You weren't really close to the victim, I presume?

297
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:27,762
No. He tried to ask me out a few times as well,

298
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:30,962
-but I also turned him down. -You, too?

299
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:32,862
Yes.

300
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:36,262
I often met Mr. Hanasaki while on the job.

301
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:40,062
After all, he was the hair and make-up artist for the model I represent.

302
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:44,162
Have you encountered any trouble with the victim, then?

303
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,562
She mentioned the problem with him earlier,

304
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:49,762
but he was accomplished and well-known otherwise.

305
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:51,762
Instead of prioritising Miss Sekizawa,

306
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:53,862
he had a lot of demands.

307
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:55,662
What were the demands?

308
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:59,662
He wanted to know her favourite flowers or her favourite foods.

309
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:03,462
This time, he wanted to sit next to her, so we arranged it.

310
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:06,262
So, what did you do during the incident?

311
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:08,362
My phone was ringing,

312
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:11,162
so I stood up from my seat before eating the cake.

313
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:15,662
And to prove it, my cake is still untouched at the table.

314
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:16,762
So I see.

315
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:20,062
And during my call, Mr. Hanasaki fell,

316
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:23,262
the lights went on, and you policemen came here.

317
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,462
I haven't had the chance to return to my seat

318
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:27,063
since I left it to take my call.

319
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:32,262
Yes, I was the one who baked the cake.

320
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:33,562
It was for Remi's birthday.

321
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:35,662
We were classmates in middle and high school.

322
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,562
So I asked the chef if I could bake the cake, and I did.

323
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:42,962
You also cut the cake and gave the slices to guests, is that correct?

324
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:46,562
Yes. I placed a strawberry on top of each slice.

325
00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:48,962
Remi loves strawberries, so I had to.

326
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:51,462
Are you acquainted with the victim?

327
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:54,562
No, today is the day I first met him.

328
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:57,162
I heard from Yumi that Remi was bothered by him

329
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:59,762
asking her out so often.

330
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:02,462
What were you doing at the time of the incident?

331
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:05,762
It suddenly got dark while I was cutting the cake,

332
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:09,362
so I held on to the cake cart until the lights were on again.

333
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:12,162
So that the cart wouldn't fall if anyone were to collide with it.

334
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:13,262
That aside,

335
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,862
wouldn't it be more efficient if you checked our belongings?

336
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:17,362
What do you mean by that?

337
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,862
I'm talking about the marker.

338
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:22,562
The culprit wrote those words on Mr. Hanasaki's forehead,

339
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:26,062
so they must have the marker on them right now.

340
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,762
Of course, I do not have one myself.

341
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:31,463
Then, please allow me to check you.

342
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:38,562
He certainly doesn't have one.

343
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:41,762
Well, then. How about you, Mr. Manager?

344
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:42,962
Yes.

345
00:18:42,963 --> 00:18:46,362
Miss Sekizawa usually has a permanent marker in her bag

346
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:49,862
in case she needs to sign autographs.

347
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,963
That one can't be used anymore, though.

348
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:54,962
You're right.

349
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:57,362
The bag has an acrid smell inside.

350
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:59,062
Did you deliberately uncap the marker

351
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:00,562
so that it wouldn't work anymore after the incident?

352
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:03,262
No, Miss Sekizawa tried to sign that girl's book

353
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,462
before the party started,

354
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:06,962
but the marker didn't work.

355
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:08,462
Was that true?

356
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,463
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:12,062
Did you not get your book signed, then?

358
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:15,362
No. Yumi had a spare permanent marker,

359
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,262
so Remi used that to sign my book.

360
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:21,462
So, Remi, do you have the marker that was used to sign the book?

361
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:24,162
-No! This has to be a mistake! -Well... no...

362
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,862
There's no way Miss Sekizawa would murder anyone!

363
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:29,962
I returned the marker to my little sister.

364
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:34,062
Yes. It is in my bag.

365
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:35,562
But it wasn't me!

366
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:39,262
I haven't killed anyone! Please believe me!

367
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,762
Sera, you have to do something!

368
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,463
Even if you say so...

369
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:47,462
It's from mum!

370
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:48,962
Sorry, but I have to take this call.

371
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:50,363
Goodness.

372
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:52,662
Hello?

373
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:56,662
How is it? Do you think you can get the antidote?

374
00:19:56,663 --> 00:20:00,262
No, someone was poisoned to death at the party,

375
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:02,262
so this really isn't the time.

376
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,463
I'll call you back later!

377
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,863
Poison. Someone was poisoned to death...

378
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:26,663
Aren't you late?

379
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:29,262
Tsutomu.

380
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:31,262
Sorry, Mary.

381
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,762
It has been such a long time

382
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:37,362
that I couldn't recall where our usual meeting place was.

383
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,362
I'd completely forgotten that

384
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,062
it was on the railings of Vauxhall Bridge,

385
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:44,262
right in front of the MI6 headquarters.

386
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:45,462
So?

387
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,862
Did you figure out who murdered Koji Haneda?

388
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:50,262
No.

389
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:54,462
The only thing I found was that the organisation was enormous.

390
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:58,562
They had their eyes on me, so I was desperate to get away from them.

391
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:03,362
So, why didn't you contact me for more than a decade?

392
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:07,662
Didn't I tell you when we happened to see each other in town before?

393
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,262
I suffered a serious injury to the head

394
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:11,362
when I was running away from them.

395
00:21:11,363 --> 00:21:15,662
I had amnesia for a long time and wandered the town.

396
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:19,562
My memories finally returned when I saw you again,

397
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:23,163
and I was able to return to work for MI6 within a year.

398
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,362
Enough about that.

399
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:29,162
Did you come here with our sons?

400
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,962
No.

401
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:32,762
I'm here with our daughter.

402
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:34,262
Daughter?

403
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:37,562
So, you still don't remember that

404
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,562
you held our daughter in your arms.

405
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:42,162
Oh, her.

406
00:21:42,163 --> 00:21:43,863
How old is she now?

407
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:49,062
What's wrong, Mary?

408
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:50,963
Why are you crying?

409
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,462
When I parted ways with Tsutomu,

410
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,562
I was still pregnant with my daughter!

411
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:01,263
Who are you?

412
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:11,262
That's right.

413
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,963
I'm not Tsutomu Akai.

414
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:24,063
I'm the woman who's about to poison you to death with this capsule.

415
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,199
Yumi was the only person who had a working marker.

416
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,999
It's no wonder she would be suspected the most.

417
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,899
But whoever poisoned the victim left his or her seat.

418
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,799
Does anyone have an idea who would have a grudge

419
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,299
against the victim?

420
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,599
-No. -There are too many.

421
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,499
He often complained.

422
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,000
I see.

423
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,899
