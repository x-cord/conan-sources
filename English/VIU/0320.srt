1
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:04,846
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:06,946
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,947 --> 00:00:08,746
The answerphone that bring about mystery after mystery.

4
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:10,746
A feeling of something not being right is wiped out all together!

5
00:00:10,747 --> 00:00:12,446
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,346
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,747
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,178 --> 00:02:00,377
Pops! Pops!

9
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:04,177
Shut up. Let me sleep in peace, will you?

10
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:06,277
Pops!

11
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:08,677
Come on, today's Sunday, isn't it?

12
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:10,277
You've got a guest!

13
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:12,977
Good morning.

14
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:14,777
Huh?

15
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:16,378
Officer Chiba?

16
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,477
What's this?

17
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:22,377
What do you want this early on a Sunday morning?

18
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,577
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:28,677
Well... so like I was saying, Inspector Megure...

20
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:31,678
Conan? Why are you here?

21
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:39,278
"Ninja Technique of Alibi Scheme"

22
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:42,077
The cause is death by suffocation.

23
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:46,377
The estimated time of death is between 7pm to 9pm last night.

24
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:48,577
There are no signs of any struggle here,

25
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:50,677
so the victim must've been killed somewhere else

26
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:55,077
then brought here to North Beika Park and abandoned.

27
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,477
Is something bothering you?

28
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:59,777
Well, I'm not sure why I was summoned here.

29
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,377
What're you talking about?

30
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,977
Isn't he an acquaintance of yours?

31
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:07,777
We found this in the victim's pocket. See!

32
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:11,377
My name card. Why is it here?

33
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,777
Likewise, from the driver's license the victim had on him,

34
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:16,477
the victim is Yuichi Kusaka, 26 years old,

35
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:19,677
a resident of Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture.

36
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:21,677
Well? Mr. Mouri?

37
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:23,977
But...

38
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:26,378
I remember him!

39
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:28,877
What? Conan?

40
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,677
Sticking your nose into the case again.

41
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,777
Well, well, now, Mr. Mouri.

42
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,377
Conan? Tell us.

43
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:38,877
He's the one that came together

44
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,877
with novelist Mr. Ryutaro Tsukigata before.

45
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:42,478
Tsukigata?

46
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:44,978
Tsukigata.

47
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:54,777
Right, he's one of the two disciples that was there back then!

48
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:59,577
He's the famous samurai novelist

49
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:02,377
that is good at writing about Ninja stuff?

50
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:05,477
Yes, 6 months ago, he came to visit me

51
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,277
saying he wanted to challenge writing detective stories too,

52
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:10,977
and suddenly came to interview me.

53
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:15,678
So, at that time you also gave Mr. Kusaka your name card?

54
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,277
He was indeed a salaried worker

55
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,977
who was training to become a professional novelist,

56
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,877
and because he was just about to come to Tokyo,

57
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:26,777
he said he brought him along to experience interviewing.

58
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:28,877
What about the other one?

59
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:31,377
What? What do you mean?

60
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:33,377
Mr. Saruhashi!

61
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:35,877
Oh, Saruhashi.

62
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:38,377
His name is Masaru Saruhashi,

63
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,777
and he was saying that he lived in Beika-cho just like Mr. Tsukigata,

64
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:43,777
so he went through training

65
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:46,278
by always helping to clear up the manuscripts.

66
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:49,377
Okay. First, we'll go see Mr. Tsukigata!

67
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:50,877
Yes, sir!

68
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,177
Let's go, Mr. Mouri!

69
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:54,578
Oh, yes, sir!

70
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,777
What? You mean Mr. Kusaka?

71
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:02,977
So, I think he was on his way here.

72
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:05,277
I see.

73
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:08,077
He was supposed to come here yesterday

74
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:11,377
with the new story he had finished writing.

75
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:15,177
Did Mr. Kusaka have that manuscript?

76
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:18,678
No, he didn't have anything on him.

77
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,377
I got a call from Teito Station last night a little after 8pm,

78
00:05:23,378 --> 00:05:26,077
saying that he would come by at 9pm.

79
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:29,277
Since he didn't come, I was a bit concerned.

80
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:33,477
Oh, you got a call from Teito Station at about 8pm?

81
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:34,877
Yes.

82
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:39,377
Inspector! The estimated time of death is between 7pm and 9pm.

83
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:41,777
If he was at Teito Station until past 8pm,

84
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:45,177
we can narrow down his tracks until the time he was killed.

85
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,377
I got two calls from Mr. Kusaka yesterday.

86
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:51,377
One was at about noon.

87
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,778
It was from his residence in Kofu.

88
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:03,877
He asked me if he could come and have me look over his new novel.

89
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:07,777
But I had to go out so...

90
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:10,677
I'd be back about 9 at night.

91
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:14,378
9pm? All right, I'll be there around that time.

92
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:19,477
And then I got the second call from Teito Station around 8pm.

93
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,978
Since I was out, his message was in my answerphone.

94
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,977
There is one message.

95
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:32,977
This is Kusaka. I've arrived at Teito Station.

96
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:35,077
I'm going to head over to your place from now,

97
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,977
so I think I can get there by 9pm as I promised.

98
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,377
Oh, the train's leaving, so I've got to go!

99
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:45,277
Saturday, 8.10pm.

100
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:47,577
May I listen to it one more time?

101
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:48,978
Sure.

102
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:52,577
There is one message.

103
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,677
This is Kusaka. I've arrived at Teito Station.

104
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:57,777
I'm going to head over to your place from now,

105
00:06:57,778 --> 00:07:00,677
so I think I can get there by 9pm as I promised.

106
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:02,877
Oh, the train's leaving, so I've got to go!

107
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:06,977
Saturday, 8.10pm.

108
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:10,877
At 8.10pm, Mr. Kusaka left from Teito Station

109
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,677
to go to Beika Station.

110
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:14,878
There's no doubt about it.

111
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,677
But, there's something

112
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:19,577
about this phone call that bothers me.

113
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:22,077
He left the Teito Station at 8.10pm.

114
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:23,477
On this train!

115
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:27,577
Which means it takes approximately 30 minutes to Beika Station so...

116
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:30,678
He arrives at Beika Station at 8.40pm!

117
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:36,077
The crime was committed between 8.40pm to 9pm,

118
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:38,377
in the vicinity of Beika Station...

119
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:40,578
I guess this is more or less the picture!

120
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,578
I've figured out who the killer is!

121
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:51,177
The killer is the other disciple of Mr. Tsukigata!

122
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:53,777
You mean Saruhashi?

123
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:56,777
I hope you have your reasons for saying that.

124
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:58,177
Of course.

125
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:02,777
He said that he lives right on the other side of Beika Station,

126
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:04,577
so he knows his way around here.

127
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:08,477
And more than anything else, he has a motive!

128
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,877
I just remembered, 6 months ago,

129
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:13,878
they had a brawl, didn't they?

130
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:18,177
Are you telling me to quit being Sensei's disciple?

131
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:23,077
Mr. Saruhashi, you studied under Sensei for many years now.

132
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:25,677
-Haven't you studied all you have to already? -What?

133
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,877
Come, come now.

134
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,877
Mr. Kusaka, stop it already.

135
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:33,577
I want to study under you too, Sensei.

136
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:37,677
But since you can't watch two disciples...

137
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:40,477
That's not true, Mr. Kusaka!

138
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,477
You have a stable life of an employee of a company.

139
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:46,377
No matter where you live, there's no difference

140
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:47,977
in the fact that you're my disciple.

141
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:50,177
Whether we live near you or not,

142
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:52,677
it makes a difference in the amount of things we get to learn.

143
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:56,077
Mr. Saruhashi, please change places with me!

144
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,777
That's for Sensei to decide!

145
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:01,477
Worried of his position as a disciple

146
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:03,577
is indeed a motive for killing, but...

147
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:07,078
It's too childish of a motive, it's absurd.

148
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:12,577
This is Takagi.

149
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:14,077
Yes.

150
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:16,578
I see, goodbye.

151
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:19,977
It's from the forensic officer.

152
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:23,877
Mr. Kusaka's fingerprints were not found on the lighter in question.

153
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:26,677
What's this about a lighter?

154
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:30,778
It was found on the ground by the corpse, the lighter.

155
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:36,077
Excuse me.

156
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:39,977
This is the lighter I gave Mr. Saruhashi some time ago!

157
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:41,677
What?

158
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:46,177
Now we not only have a motive, but also have material evidence...

159
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:49,278
No. Saruhashi couldn't have...

160
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:54,877
Mr. Saruhashi, does this lighter look familiar to you?

161
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:57,177
It's my lighter.

162
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,377
Though I lost it some time ago.

163
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:02,877
Lost it? When? Where?

164
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:05,577
I don't know.

165
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:08,277
Please try to remember!

166
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:10,077
I really don't know.

167
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,178
It was quite some time ago, though.

168
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:19,377
The key to a coin locker?

169
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:20,577
Right.

170
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,177
It's a precious lighter that Sensei gave me as a gift.

171
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:27,177
I'm sure that Kusaka stole it from me because he was jealous.

172
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,777
Mr. Saruhashi!

173
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,477
Officer Takagi.

174
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:34,877
Mr. Saruhashi. Where were you last night?

175
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:36,277
Oh, yes...

176
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:39,577
I was at a coffee shop in front of the station about 8pm.

177
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:43,577
I came back here once

178
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,177
and from about 8.30pm, I went to a pub in front of the station.

179
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,677
Are you sure it was from 8.30pm?

180
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:51,677
Wasn't it a little later, like 9pm?

181
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:53,377
Huh?

182
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:56,177
Mr. Kusaka's estimated time of death

183
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:59,777
is thought to be between 8.40pm to 9pm.

184
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:00,778
What?

185
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:08,577
Mr. Kusaka called Tsukigata Sensei at 8.10pm from Teito Station.

186
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:15,278
So he arrived here at Beika Station after 8.40pm.

187
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,177
I went into the pub at 8.30pm!

188
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,677
I'm sure!

189
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:23,477
Please check on it.

190
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:26,278
I'm not lying.

191
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,977
Thank you so much.

192
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,078
Inspector!

193
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:40,378
As to the coffee shop,

194
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,877
it seems he was there from sundown and left about 8.30pm!

195
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:45,177
I got his alibi on this side too.

196
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:48,877
He came at 8.30pm and was drinking until midnight.

197
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:52,778
Which means that Saruhashi has an alibi!

198
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,377
What's going on?

199
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:57,777
The story about the lighter is just a cop out.

200
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,777
If Mr. Kusaka stole it, his fingerprints should be on it!

201
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:03,977
I'm aware of that.

202
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:06,777
He's got a motive and there is material evidence.

203
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:09,278
But he has an alibi.

204
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:13,877
Please wait.

205
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:15,877
It's possible for him to commit the crime!

206
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:18,777
He left the coffee shop at 8pm.

207
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:21,077
He came to this pub at 8.30pm.

208
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:24,677
There're 30 minutes of unaccounted time!

209
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:28,477
-And? -And he lied about returning to his apartment.

210
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:32,377
He killed Mr. Kusaka during the 30 minutes!

211
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,877
The scene of the crime is not Beika-cho,

212
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:37,677
but between Teito Station and Beika Station.

213
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:39,877
If he uses the 30 minutes that is unaccounted for to the fullest,

214
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:41,577
he can make it to a station in between.

215
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:42,977
After committing the murder there,

216
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:47,477
he can still make it back to Beika Station at 8.30pm.

217
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:51,177
The actual time the murder was committed was not 8.40pm,

218
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:54,077
but rather, around 8.15pm...

219
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:55,977
That's not possible, Officer Takagi.

220
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:56,978
What?

221
00:12:56,979 --> 00:13:00,977
Mr. Kusaka left Teito Station at 8.10pm.

222
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,977
5 minutes later, at 8.15pm,

223
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:05,577
Mr. Kusaka is still way before

224
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,377
reaching the middle point of both stations.

225
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,477
During the 30 minutes time,

226
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:12,777
it'd be impossible to commit murder,

227
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:15,577
much less even make contact with him.

228
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:16,878
Impossible.

229
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:21,577
That is, unless you use some kind of Ninja technique

230
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:24,077
that is described in Ryutaro Tsukigata's novel or something...

231
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,378
Ninja technique of creating an alibi.

232
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:34,478
What kind of Ninja trick did he use?

233
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,878
What kind of trick...

234
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,679
did Mr. Saruhashi use anyway?

235
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:59,178
It's Tsukigata Sensei's new book.

236
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:02,378
Mysterious Centipede Ninja.

237
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,378
The enemy is your friend and your friend is your enemy.

238
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,679
Counter turn after counter turn.

239
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,278
Counter turn?

240
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,579
Counter?

241
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,378
I'm not lying.

242
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,178
I got two phone calls from Mr. Kusaka yesterday.

243
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,679
This is Kusaka. I arrived in Teito Station just now.

244
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,478
Saturday, 8.10pm.

245
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:33,178
I see, I get it!

246
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,879
"Beika Station, West Entrance, 2 Days Later" -If so...

247
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,978
The coin locker

248
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,978
can be used for a period of 3 consecutive days in a row.

249
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,078
0101.

250
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,379
Please be there!

251
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:51,978
It's there!

252
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:55,378
So, he's the killer, after all!

253
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:01,179
There're no hints, no matter how much I read this.

254
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,978
What brings you all here?

255
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,978
What're you talking about?

256
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:12,878
You're the one that told us to come here, Mr. Mouri!

257
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,779
Me?

258
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,279
I made no such phone call...

259
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,178
I did call you indeed.

260
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:29,078
Of course, I did so to talk to you

261
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,978
about the homicide case of Mr. Yuichi Kusaka.

262
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:35,778
Did you figure out the Ninja technique?

263
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,978
Yes, one alibi trick was used in this murder case.

264
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:44,178
It's a very simple trick,

265
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,578
but it was very difficult to figure it out.

266
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:51,978
Why? Because the one who used the trick was not the killer!

267
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:55,678
Not the killer? Then, who was it?

268
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,078
When I heard the message on the answerphone,

269
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,178
something bothered me.

270
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:03,078
That was because despite knowing that

271
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,278
Tsukigata Sensei was still not home a little after 8pm,

272
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,978
Mr. Kusaka called twice.

273
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:13,378
Why did he go out of his way to make such a phone call

274
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,878
when it really was no big deal?

275
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:20,678
Saturday, 8.10pm.

276
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,278
Yes, he did it only to make everybody believe

277
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,078
he was at Teito Station at 8.10pm.

278
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,678
To make everyone believe?

279
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,178
Which mean, he was actually not there?

280
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,478
Mr. Mouri, I found it!

281
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,979
Officer Takagi.

282
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,178
I found it! The ticket you asked for.

283
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,378
Ticket?

284
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:41,078
The ticket that was retrieved at Beika Station that day

285
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,578
with Mr. Kusaka's fingerprints on it.

286
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:46,978
Officer Takagi, what time was it issued?

287
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:49,378
Oh, yes!

288
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,278
It was sold at Teito Station... at 7.30pm?

289
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,078
What, 7.30pm?

290
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,678
It's not after 8.10pm?

291
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,178
Just as I thought.

292
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,978
He bought the ticket at 7.30pm.

293
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:02,978
If he boarded the train right away,

294
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:07,678
he would've reached Beika Station a little after 8pm.

295
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,378
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

296
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:10,778
Officer Chiba?

297
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,678
I asked Officer Chiba to do me a favor too.

298
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,178
I had him go and get the contents in the coin locker,

299
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:18,079
which pick up date was overdue.

300
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:24,178
That's Mr. Kusaka's bag.

301
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,778
This is the victim's belongings?

302
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,478
Is it?

303
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,278
Yes.

304
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,678
Please put the contents of the bag on the table.

305
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,379
Oh, yes!

306
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:41,878
Thank you.

307
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:48,179
Inspector! Please rewind that tape recorder a little.

308
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,378
-Teito. Teito. -Mommy, hurry!

309
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:58,378
It's dangerous to run, Kenichi!

310
00:17:58,379 --> 00:17:59,478
This is?

311
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:03,278
It's the same as the message that was in the answerphone!

312
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,778
Yes,

313
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:09,878
Mr. Kusaka who reached Beika Station, used that to make it

314
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:13,978
seem as if he had reached Beika Station at 8.10pm

315
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,478
in order to create his alibi!

316
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,778
The Ninja technique of creating an alibi.

317
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:21,678
Once the secret is revealed, it is a very simple trick.

318
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,178
The only thing is the one who used this Ninja trick

319
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,478
was not the killer but the victim himself.

320
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,678
What did Mr. Kusaka do something like that for?

321
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,779
In order to kill Mr. Saruhashi!

322
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:44,478
After the answerphone trick, Mr. Kusaka rushed over

323
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,578
to Mr. Saruhashi's apartment.

324
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:48,878
I guess he told Mr. Saruhashi beforehand,

325
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,978
that he had something important to talk about or something.

326
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,878
If Mr. Kusaka were to work out the way he planned,

327
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:57,478
he was probably going to make an anonymous call to the police

328
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,979
right after killing Mr. Saruhashi.

329
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,878
And the time of the crime would be precisely determined

330
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:07,478
by the police who get there right after the call.

331
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:12,278
According to his alibi scheme, from between 8.10pm to 8.40pm,

332
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,778
Mr. Kusaka would be riding the train to Beika Station,

333
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,778
so he would be erased from the list of suspects.

334
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:23,578
All he had to do next was visit Tsukigata's house at 9pm as scheduled.

335
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,778
However, it didn't work out as he planned!

336
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:29,278
He was counterattacked by Mr. Saruhashi

337
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,179
who he meant to kill.

338
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,079
Dang it!

339
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:47,678
Mr. Saruhashi who counterattacked,

340
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,478
carried Mr. Kusaka's corpse to the park and disposed of it there.

341
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:53,178
Then, just as you already found out from investigations,

342
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,879
he went to the pub at about 8.30pm.

343
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,778
I'm not lying.

344
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:05,678
Exactly. You weren't lying.

345
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,978
You realized that the police made a mistake

346
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:11,178
and all you did was decide to use this to your advantage.

347
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,378
So, you're the one who killed Mr. Kusaka after all.

348
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,778
I know nothing of that sort!

349
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:17,278
He didn't come to my apartment!

350
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,878
No, I'm sure he did.

351
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,978
If he had intention to kill,

352
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:24,878
he wouldn't take the tape recorder that he used to create his alibi,

353
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:26,978
nor his manuscript along with him.

354
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:32,678
So, I figured that he would leave it at the coin locker of Beika Station.

355
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,478
If something is left in that locker for more than 3 days,

356
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,278
the maintenance company opens it with a spare key.

357
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,078
Since today was the 3rd day,

358
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:45,578
I asked Officer Chiba to go get the thing that was in the locker.

359
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,678
Mr. Kusaka's bag, that's over there.

360
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,378
But how did you figure out the number of the locker?

361
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,878
That's the point.

362
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,678
When we went over to Mr. Saruhashi's home,

363
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,878
Conan found the key to the locker in Mr. Saruhashi's room.

364
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:06,378
0101. It's a number easy enough for a child to remember.

365
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:09,078
You say that Mr. Kusaka didn't come,

366
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,978
but how can a person who didn't come

367
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:14,078
drop the key in your room?

368
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,978
My house...

369
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,978
He did come to my house. But...

370
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:21,278
It's okay already, Mr. Saruhashi.

371
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,179
Sensei...

372
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:30,978
I was afraid of him all this time.

373
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,878
Afraid that he would take you away from me.

374
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,278
I'm happy how you feel about me.

375
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:39,478
But whether you succeed as a professional

376
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:43,178
is how much effort you exert!

377
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:50,279
I guess both Mr. Kusaka and you forgot what was most important.

378
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,678
I thought this time for sure that our hands were tied.

379
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,478
But, you never let us down, do you, Mr. Mouri?

380
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:38,678
You mean Inspector Shiratori's new unmarked police car?

381
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,078
Oh, come on.

382
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:43,978
Ninja technique of playing dumb?

383
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:45,878
You got me there.

384
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:48,179
I can never beat you, Inspector.

385
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:55,779
The Ninja technique you're really good at is, "all talk", Pops.

386
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,578
Then, somebody's just gotta stay at the hospital in his place,

387
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,178
right, Conan?

388
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,979
Okay.

389
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:13,379
Oh, no.

390
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:26,378
Next Conan,

391
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:30,679
