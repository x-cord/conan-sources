1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,234
"Suzuki"

2
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:03,375
400 wins and no losses?

3
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:07,267
At the World Karate Tournament?

4
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:11,767
That record sure is something to look forward to, isn't it?

5
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:13,067
No, not really.

6
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:16,567
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to participate in the game the other day,

7
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:18,467
so, I lost by default.

8
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:22,467
He skipped the game because of me, you see.

9
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,667
-Well... -If it weren't for that,

10
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,767
the invincible myth would've continued!

11
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:32,767
But there is no need for outstanding physical power in the Suzuki Family.

12
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,567
You!

13
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,667
Are you prepared to take on the responsibilities

14
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:42,067
of the Suzuki Financial Group?

15
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,367
Hey, Tomoko.

16
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,567
It's too soon to talk of that.

17
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:48,967
They're still in high school, you know.

18
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,167
No.

19
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,367
Now that it's been set that our oldest daughter Ayako,

20
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,367
has decided to marry the son of the Tomizawa's,

21
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:56,767
the only choice of a successor for us

22
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:01,967
is for Sonoko's husband-to-be to take after the name of our family!

23
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:03,067
If it were how it should be,

24
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,467
we would have to carefully consider his lineage and his academic history.

25
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:10,867
I had in mind that he had to be someone suitable for the Suzuki family,

26
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:13,067
and yet you're going with a hobo who,

27
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,567
despite being a mere high school student is studying abroad

28
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,667
to heighten his martial art powers?

29
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,867
Just what do you think you're doing, Sonoko?

30
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:23,367
It's all up to me, isn't it?

31
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:26,467
I have no intention of taking after this family anyway!

32
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,667
You listen!

33
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,167
Calm down.

34
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:33,967
Makoto, it's almost time for your return departure flight.

35
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,367
I'll have the driver take you to the airport.

36
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:39,767
Let's talk about this again at a later date.

37
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,767
Yes.

38
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:45,267
And let me know when it's time for your next tournament.

39
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:48,267
I may not look like it, but I love martial arts, you see.

40
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:49,467
Sure.

41
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,067
"Ran"

42
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,067
It's from Ran.

43
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,867
Hey! I'm not finished yet.

44
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,767
Hello?

45
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:05,267
Huh? Thief Kid?

46
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,467
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Early this morning...

47
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,467
Right!

48
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:12,667
Kid's after Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki's jewel again

49
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,367
and he sent out a letter of warning about it.

50
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,667
It's being aired on the TV news just now.

51
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:19,967
No! Are you serious? No joke?

52
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:23,867
I'll call Uncle Jirokichi right now then!

53
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,767
Wait...

54
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,967
Geez. I wanted to tell her not to act excited

55
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:32,467
like she usually does because Mr. Kyogoku is here today.

56
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,367
Way to the contrary.

57
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:38,367
Hello, Uncle?

58
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,767
I heard about it, you know!

59
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:42,667
Thief Kid is coming again, isn't he?

60
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,967
Thief Kid?

61
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,967
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

62
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,567
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

63
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,467
A battle between two men that Sonoko adores?

64
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,467
Jirokichi prepares a formidable ultimate weapon.

65
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,967
He sees through the one and only truth.

66
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,767
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

67
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:00,167
His name is Detective Conan!

68
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:45,449
"Thief Kid vs. Makoto Kyogoku (Part 1)".

69
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:50,249
Lost... lost all 100 confrontation simulations?

70
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,249
You mean he broke through

71
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,149
all of the newest security systems

72
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,949
that were completed just the other day?

73
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,649
Yes, sir.

74
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:02,849
Of course, it's only through the simulation on the computer though.

75
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,649
That is, the results attained by

76
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,049
inputting the mode of operation of Thief Kid up to now

77
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,949
and running a simulation of it.

78
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:10,649
He... he did so outstandingly.

79
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:14,849
What now?

80
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:17,249
The scheduled date's tomorrow, you know.

81
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:22,049
If things are left as is, it's all for his taking.

82
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:28,449
The Alexandrite that I travelled the world over to get a hold of.

83
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:33,049
The vivid green king of jewels, the Green Emperor.

84
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:37,949
But the ability of Kid being able to disguise himself as anybody

85
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:42,349
as well as his intellectual brilliance to cope with any situation,

86
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:45,249
on top of his super-human physical capacity,

87
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,649
if we were to add all that up as data...

88
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,449
No matter what kind of security system was to be used,

89
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,049
I think the end result would be the same.

90
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:52,149
If you'd like,

91
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:57,349
we could re-simulate everything by lowering Kid's ability by 20%.

92
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:58,949
He's only human too.

93
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:01,149
There could be days when he's not at his best.

94
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:02,849
You fool!

95
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,249
He's a great thief known for being keen and nimble!

96
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,149
Moreover, his abilities become more polished with each appearance.

97
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:12,049
Decreasing the rate by 20% won't help!

98
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:15,449
Well after all, it's a hundred to none.

99
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,249
I wonder about exhibiting the jewel knowing that he'll get a hold of it.

100
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:20,249
And although, I'm not all for it,

101
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,949
maybe I should just postpone exhibiting it this time.

102
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,149
Advisor Suzuki!

103
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,849
Right now at the entrance,

104
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:30,449
a weird man asking to see you.

105
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:31,649
What?

106
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,749
No use continuing any longer.

107
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,349
Will you please give Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki word

108
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,149
that I wish to see him?

109
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:38,349
What's going on?

110
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,749
Advisor!

111
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,149
I, here am called Makoto Kyogoku.

112
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:50,749
I'm a greenhorn that is now courting Sonoko.

113
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:53,349
You're Sonoko's boyfriend.

114
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,649
And, just what do you want with me?

115
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,149
I've heard that you're in possession of a jewel

116
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:01,049
that a thief, what's his name is seeking.

117
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,249
If so, I would like to offer you my services.

118
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,349
Won't you please assign me, Makoto Kyogoku

119
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:08,549
to guard this for you at the foot of the table, if you will?

120
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:10,649
I refuse!

121
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,749
I... I implore you...

122
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:17,249
You're such a novice.

123
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:20,649
I'll bet you just can't take the fact

124
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,849
Sonoko is head over heels over him, right?

125
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,449
But don't you worry!

126
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,149
It's just similar to a case of measles.

127
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,449
Measles?

128
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,949
I'll make sure that she forgets all about him

129
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:37,849
the moment I nab that guy.

130
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,049
Advisor!

131
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,349
Come on, go on home!

132
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,849
"Sonoko"

133
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,449
Sonoko? What a good timing.

134
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:50,349
Is Makoto there by chance?

135
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,949
Advisor, please hear me out one more time!

136
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,349
I'm at Haneda Airport now

137
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:58,549
and was taking care of Makoto's boarding procedure,

138
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,049
but he disappeared.

139
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:05,449
The driver says that he was asking for your address, you see.

140
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,449
So, I thought that he just may have gone over there.

141
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,349
What kind of guy is he?

142
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:14,749
I hear that he practices karate.

143
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:16,749
He's no ordinary karate practitioner, you know!

144
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:19,249
He has won 400 World Karate Championships with no losses,

145
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:22,549
an invincible prince of attacks!

146
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:28,349
Four... four-hundred championships, no losses?

147
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,949
Don't put any guards into the exhibition room of the jewel?

148
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,749
Why on earth?

149
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:41,149
Thief Kid's coming to steal, you know?

150
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,549
Advisor Suzuki called me a while ago

151
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:48,049
and said that they would get in the way of the newest security systems.

152
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:49,949
Don't tell me it's that old man again.

153
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,849
What's he up to anyway?

154
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:57,149
And this is the footage that was sent after the phone call.

155
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:59,349
Footage?

156
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:06,949
One man is being surrounded by men armed with guns?

157
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:10,049
Of course they're just airsoft pellets,

158
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,449
but still, with this number of men at this range...

159
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,849
Moreover, the man in the middle

160
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:19,549
is wearing a gas mask that interferes with his visibility.

161
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:22,749
You'd think that it'd be impossible for him to avoid the pellets, huh?

162
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,549
Please fire at me all at once with the intent of defeating me.

163
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:57,049
His name is Makoto Kyogoku.

164
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,049
According to the Advisor,

165
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:03,549
he's the world's most formidable security system.

166
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,949
The... the world's most formidable?

167
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:09,549
You know her too, don't you?

168
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:13,249
The Advisor's niece, Sonoko.

169
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,549
He seems to be her boyfriend.

170
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,149
Boyfriend?

171
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,249
Very interesting.

172
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,149
Oh, my.

173
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,949
Don't tell me that you're planning to spend the night here in this museum.

174
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:45,149
Yes. Because I want to learn the size of this room by heart.

175
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:49,849
Well, I have my sleeping bag with me.

176
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:53,149
As well as a bit of food too.

177
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:55,349
Hey, there.

178
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,049
Won't you like to make a bet with me?

179
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,149
Make a bet?

180
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,849
"Mouri Detective Agency"

181
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:07,049
Mr. Kyogoku and Thief Kid is going to confront each other?

182
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:10,649
-Really? -Right!

183
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,449
It seems Makoto went and personally negotiated things out Uncle Jirokichi!

184
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,149
I guess he got all fired up when he heard me talking about Sir Kid!

185
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:23,249
Don't you think it's just fantastic

186
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:26,949
that two good-looking men are going to confront each other

187
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,449
in a passionate battle over me?

188
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,649
Over you?

189
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:35,849
I don't think Kid gives a hoot about Sonoko, though.

190
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:39,649
And? Who do you wish would win?

191
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,549
Kid or Mr. Kyogoku?

192
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:46,649
Of course I'd like Makoto to win,

193
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,749
but neither do I want Sir Kid to lose.

194
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:53,749
Huh? What's with you? Make up your mind!

195
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:59,449
But Makoto... Well, you see, Kid is...

196
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:02,149
Hey, Sonoko? The phone's...

197
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,249
Hello, Ran? Ran?

198
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,349
"Out of range"

199
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,649
No joke! It's out of service range.

200
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:14,549
A transmitter function limiting device.

201
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:26,449
Good evening, my lady.

202
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:29,049
Thief... Thief Kid?

203
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:35,349
What brings you here?

204
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:41,749
Well, I just kind of got tired and stopped by to rest my wings.

205
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:45,549
While I'm at it...

206
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:48,849
May I ask you to make a bet with me?

207
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:53,749
Make a bet?

208
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:01,275
Thief Kid came last night?

209
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,875
To your room?

210
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,175
That's right!

211
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:09,575
He was standing by the window just like Peter Pan, you see!

212
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,375
He left right away

213
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,075
because one of our security guards found him, though.

214
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:15,375
Didn't you hear about it?

215
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,275
Of course not!

216
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:20,375
And? What did Kid come for?

217
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,175
Well, you see...

218
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:27,675
he asked me if I'd like to make a bet with him.

219
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:30,375
"As a reward for getting hold of the jewel I'm after,

220
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:34,375
I want your lips", he says.

221
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,675
That's a lie.

222
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,175
And, so what did he really say?

223
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,175
He actually said...

224
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,975
If he successfully gets hold of the Alexandrite Green Emperor

225
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:52,675
that Uncle Jirokich is going to publicly exhibit,

226
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:57,975
he'd like to exchange it for a certain treasure that he specifies

227
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:01,275
out of all the treasures that the Suzuki Financial Group owns.

228
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,075
He wanted me to relay this to Uncle.

229
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,775
What is that certain treasure that he specified?

230
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:10,375
Beats me. He told me he'd tell me after he does his job.

231
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,775
And what was your answer?

232
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:15,675
Of course I told him off

233
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:18,575
saying that I would never go for anything

234
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:20,975
that a villain like him proposed!

235
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:23,375
Really?

236
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,475
Well, I did say it in a softer tone of voice, though.

237
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:29,675
Strange.

238
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:31,875
The only jewel that Thief Kid is after

239
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:36,175
should be the gigantic stone called the Big Jewel.

240
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:39,475
If the Suzuki Financial Group owns such a jewel,

241
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:44,575
I'm sure that the Advisor would've used it by now as bait to capture Kid.

242
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:49,375
Besides, why on earth would he tell Sonoko of something so important?

243
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:54,375
And? Where's Kyogoku who's supposed to protect that jewel?

244
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,575
As for Makoto...

245
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:58,775
He's with the jewel even now!

246
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,675
Even now?

247
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:04,575
Isn't that jewel already being publicly exhibited from today?

248
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:09,275
Yes, at the Grand Suzuki Museum where we're going to from now!

249
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,675
Don't tell me

250
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:13,875
that he's standing beside the exhibition case wearing a dreadful look?

251
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,775
Well, you'll see once we get there!

252
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:35,675
Huh, why does he look so bored with the jewel hanging from his neck?

253
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:37,275
Weird, isn't it?

254
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:38,775
Never mind.

255
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:42,475
-See? -True.

256
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:44,175
What's the difference?

257
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:46,775
Good job, Sonoko!

258
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:50,075
To choose such an invincible one as your boyfriend,

259
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,175
you're my niece all right!

260
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,175
Uncle Jirokichi!

261
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:56,075
But, the time that Kid's scheduled to appear

262
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,575
is at 10 p.m. after all the guests have left.

263
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:01,075
So it's too early for him to...

264
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:04,175
He sincerely wished to do so!

265
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:07,375
After making it look as if it had been stolen at the scheduled time,

266
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,675
he wanted to avoid having to find out that

267
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:13,375
the jewel was actually exchanged for a fake.

268
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,675
He may be a master of Karate,

269
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,875
but he's still in high school, isn't he?

270
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,975
I wonder if it's appropriate to make him guard the jewel alone.

271
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:23,675
Haven't you seen it?

272
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,275
The awesome footage that I sent to MPD of him

273
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:34,675
knocking over the 11 men as quick as lightning?

274
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:40,475
But if Kid uses his forte which is to cause a black-out again...

275
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:43,375
No need for worry.

276
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:48,375
He is an invincible prince of attacks who sees with his mind's eye.

277
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:52,375
If in the dark, Kid's the one who'll be in a fix!

278
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:55,775
Besides,

279
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,375
I've got a secret plan too.

280
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,675
Secret plan?

281
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,275
Kid's forte is to become an imposter

282
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,975
and act as if he's someone very close to us.

283
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:08,775
That is, he disguises himself well to get close to the jewel.

284
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:12,175
Yes, just like when he disguised himself as my husband some time ago.

285
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,375
I just happened to fall for his fake phone call back then.

286
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,575
Both you Advisor, and Inspector Nakamori

287
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,375
have similar experiences, don't you?

288
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,475
Yeah, that's why we're doing all this.

289
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:26,875
We even pinch faces at times.

290
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,675
I guess it's all right for you men to do so, but...

291
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,075
Ouch.

292
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:35,075
It's not easy to do something so rude like this to women.

293
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,675
So, this is what I prepared.

294
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:44,375
A specially ordered outfit from a designer in Paris that I just received.

295
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:48,075
This one of a kind outfit that cannot be found elsewhere in the world.

296
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:50,175
This is the outfit!

297
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,175
But, that outfit,

298
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:58,975
if Kid puts you to sleep and removes it from you...

299
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:01,575
That applies only to you men.

300
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,275
As far as I know,

301
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:08,775
Kid has never taken anything off a woman and disguised himself as her.

302
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:11,275
In other words, as long as I have this outfit on,

303
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,675
it's apparent that I'm the real me!

304
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,975
I see.

305
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:19,375
So, Masumi isn't included, is she?

306
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:24,675
Of course, I've got clothes for Sonoko and her friend too.

307
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:25,875
Me too?

308
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,175
I just stopped over here on my way back from school, and yet.

309
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:32,175
Please change later, will you?

310
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:35,675
That is, only after we pinch each other's faces.

311
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,075
Yes.

312
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,375
And...

313
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:43,175
I'm sure that the Advisor wouldn't want this Kid Killer boy

314
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,575
to leave either anyway.

315
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,775
Oh, that's right!

316
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,875
When I looked into the mailbox this morning,

317
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,475
I got this letter from Sir Kid.

318
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:58,275
What?

319
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:00,075
"Makoto Kyogoku"

320
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,775
It was addressed to Makoto, though.

321
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:11,375
What on earth does he want?

322
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:15,375
Blank?

323
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:21,275
Don't tell me he's going to forget about everything this time?

324
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:25,575
Could he have been too afraid to confront the master of Karate?

325
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:27,575
I don't think it's blank.

326
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:31,475
Maybe it's invisible ink revealed by applying heat?

327
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:34,875
It smells like fruit too.

328
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,775
Invisible ink?

329
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:40,875
Let's use my lighter to apply heat to it.

330
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,475
Some words are...

331
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:53,875
"Okay, let's have it out fair and square. Thief Kid".

332
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,975
Huh? Is that all?

333
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:58,275
Yes. There's nothing written behind either.

334
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,775
That's probably

335
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,575
a symbolic message from him daring you to smoke him out

336
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:06,275
and catch him if you can.

337
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:09,475
A very wretched way of challenging someone, I guess.

338
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,375
Come, Sonoko, Ran!

339
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,475
Let's go get changed.

340
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,475
Okay.

341
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,475
Before that...

342
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:33,475
After you grow up.

343
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:36,575
Hang in there, Makoto!

344
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:37,975
Sure thing.

345
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:40,875
I...

346
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,675
believe in you.

347
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:47,275
Yes! I will protect it over my dead body

348
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:49,375
with these fists of mine!

349
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,575
Come along now, Sonoko.

350
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,975
I also have faith in you

351
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:16,475
and believe that you will keep your word.

352
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:17,775
Yes, I will.

353
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:21,475
Of course.

354
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:44,575
"Next Episode" -Kid! Kid! Kid!

355
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:48,975
What's this?

356
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:51,675
Kid, Kid, Kid!

357
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:55,175
Okay, I'm ready when you are!

358
00:23:55,175 --> 00:23:59,275
I'll make you pay for all you've done so far!

359
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:01,175
May I please have a look at the letters?

360
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:03,675
I won't take them out of the bag!

361
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,775
Hey!

362
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:07,675
Next Conan,

363
00:24:07,675 --> 00:24:11,875
"Thief Kid vs. Makoto Kyogoku (Part 2)".

364
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,775
Next Conan's Hint:

365
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:31,875
"Candle".

366
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,675
Sonoko, who's side are you on anyway?

367
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,675
The ultimate choice...
