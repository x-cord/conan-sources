1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,220
If that person is the culprit,

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,120
Mr. Hirasaka didn't commit suicide.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,720
In order to prove that,

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,420
I've got to solve the mystery of the two locked rooms!

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,320
Tears are the start of all dramas.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,120
So, he was the real culprit!

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
Everything is finally clarified!

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,820
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,620
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:17,391
On the night that a seance was held at the residence

13
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:19,791
of occult cartoonist, Mr. Reiki Hirasaka,

14
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,791
a series of locked room murders are committed.

15
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,991
The incident was connected with the murder

16
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:28,291
of the editor in charge of Mr. Hirasaka's work,

17
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,491
Mr. Sawanami that occurred six months ago.

18
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:34,791
The word "Kira" was found left behind at the scene.

19
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,791
What on earth does this mean?

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,791
"Kira"

21
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:45,991
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (Locked Room Opened)"

22
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:52,691
Mr. policeman!

23
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:56,391
Did you see my Gomera badge in the room?

24
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:59,591
Gomera badge? I got no such report.

25
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,091
May I go look for it?

26
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:02,691
What?

27
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:09,791
The two keys were found inside the drawer.

28
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:14,191
It's possible to throw the keys into the drawer via that window vent.

29
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,291
However...

30
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,791
Is it possible for them to also put a notebook atop those

31
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,791
and lock the drawer?

32
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,791
And...

33
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,691
Kira's posters that were torn apart

34
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:26,591
and scattered all over the place.

35
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:31,191
Why was something like that done?

36
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:33,891
Hey, hurry up out of there.

37
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:37,791
Just a little while more. One second!

38
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:42,291
Mr. Policeman, there's something on top of that flower.

39
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,591
Let me see it!

40
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:51,191
This is a torn piece from Kira's poster!

41
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,191
Why is it on that flower?

42
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:58,091
I see!

43
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,691
Maybe...

44
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,791
Forensics lady!

45
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,391
My? Sonny, you're the one staying over at Mr. Mouri's.

46
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:08,491
Did you see my Masked Yaiba card on the floor?

47
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:11,791
I seemed to have dropped it when I came in here last night.

48
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,391
No, nothing was on the floor.

49
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,691
I'll go take a quick look!

50
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,191
Sonny!

51
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:22,791
There's no footing to climb up to that window in the room.

52
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,891
Besides, in order to close that window,

53
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,091
that switch would have to be pushed all the while.

54
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:36,291
However, the door was locked from the inside with a padlock.

55
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:40,291
You can't lock the door from the outside.

56
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:46,991
Maybe...

57
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,491
I get it. That's the story.

58
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,991
I'll look for the card for you so...

59
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:06,391
Yes. I'm sorry.

60
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,491
But, why did the culprit have to go out of the way

61
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:15,591
to create a locked room?

62
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,691
As for Mr. Hirasaka,

63
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,791
it was probably to make it look like he committed to suicide.

64
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,391
Maybe there's a secret way out

65
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,791
of the meditation room or something?

66
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:30,991
If it's as I suspect,

67
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:35,391
this locked room is much too sad.

68
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:39,491
I've solved the mystery of the locked room.

69
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,691
but there's no proof.

70
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,891
Why not check if there's an

71
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,791
escape route out of the meditation room?

72
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,991
There's no such thing. Not in that room!

73
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:54,491
No use doing something like that!

74
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:59,591
Because Kira used magical powers to escape from that room.

75
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,891
Isn't this room hot?

76
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:04,691
Then, why don't you loosen your necktie?

77
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:06,491
Like always.

78
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,091
But, it's not good to look too untidy

79
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:11,391
despite the police being here, right?

80
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,991
Maho, do you feel bad or something?

81
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,491
No. I'm fine.

82
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:21,291
Wait a second. That person just...

83
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,691
I see.

84
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:26,991
Maybe the culprit left definite evidence behind?

85
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:28,991
Pops, over this way!

86
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:32,591
-Hurry up. -Hey, what on earth did you find?

87
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,291
Look, it's just over there.

88
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,791
What?

89
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,591
Wait.

90
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,291
Leave the rest to me, Pops.

91
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,791
Everyone!

92
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:54,891
From now, I will tell you the truth of this case.

93
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,491
Last night, the body of Ms. Shoko Utakura

94
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:00,191
was found in this meditation room,

95
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:03,591
and Mr. Hirasaka was also found dead in his room.

96
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,891
Near Mr. Hirasaka's dead body,

97
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,191
the rope that was used to kill Shoko

98
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,991
was found together with her cell phone.

99
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,891
Judging from this circumstance,

100
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,691
it would look as if Mr. Hirasaka, after killing Shoko

101
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:18,091
committed suicide.

102
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:20,091
You mean it's not suicide?

103
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,991
No, it's most likely that the culprit

104
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:25,091
first went to Mr. Hirasaka's room

105
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,891
and killed him after giving him poisoned wine.

106
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,491
Then the culprit got hold of key

107
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,091
for the padlock and the room.

108
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,291
Then the culprit locked the room from the outside,

109
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,091
then killed Shoko in the meditation room.

110
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,991
The posters were pulled out from all the panels

111
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,691
after which the culprit went back to Mr. Hirasaka's room.

112
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:47,191
The culprit put the two keys, the murder weapon rope

113
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:50,091
and Shoko's cell phone in the room

114
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,091
to frame Mr. Hirasaka up as the killer.

115
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:55,391
Do you have proof?

116
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,991
On the flower that was decorated outside Mr. Hirasaka's room,

117
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,191
a ripped piece of the poster was found.

118
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,391
What? Is that true?

119
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:06,091
It's this one.

120
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,191
-Here! -This was...

121
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,591
on the flowers that was in the vase?

122
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,991
In other words, the culprit ripped the poster in the corridor

123
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:17,691
and put the pieces into the room

124
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:20,791
through the ventilation window.

125
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,591
Why did the culprit do something like that?

126
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,491
The more I don't understand.

127
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:29,091
I shall replay the locked room trick now.

128
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,891
-What? -Officer Takagi, Officer Chiba!

129
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,691
Yes, sir!

130
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:36,591
What are you people doing there?

131
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:38,891
We're preparing to replay the locked room trick

132
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:41,191
under Mr. Mouri's instructions!

133
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,991
Chiba, what is it that you're carrying?

134
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,791
Oh, this is

135
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:50,891
a gigantic poster of the Masked Yaiba movie.

136
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,891
I borrowed it from a special effects mania!

137
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,791
Why would you need something like that?

138
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,591
That poster is the same size

139
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:02,091
as the largest panel of Kira's panel that was over here.

140
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,991
The culprit used this to carry out the locked room trick.

141
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:06,891
What?

142
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,691
Let's start, then.

143
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:14,791
First, you roll that poster into the shape of a cylinder.

144
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:19,191
Then a thin long cylinder of 2m will be made.

145
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:23,591
Push the cylinder inside the room from the ventilation window

146
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:26,891
and push the tip of it into the cylinder into the drawer.

147
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:30,791
Then all that's left to do is to put the key into that cylinder.

148
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,891
After that, use the tip of the cylinder

149
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:38,191
to place the memo pad on top of the keys,

150
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:41,991
close the drawer then turn the knob.

151
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:44,891
You can lock it.

152
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:50,091
Then the culprit tore up all the posters

153
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,391
and put them inside the room.

154
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:55,791
Lastly, he sends everybody text mail using Shoko's cell phone.

155
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,991
After throwing the cell phone and rope into the room,

156
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:59,891
he left.

157
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,891
But, in order to carry out this trick,

158
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:04,591
wouldn't using just one poster do?

159
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:07,791
Why did he have to take all the posters that were here out

160
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,391
and rip them?

161
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,591
Besides, how did he create the locked room

162
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:13,891
in this meditation room?

163
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:16,491
She used magic!

164
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,491
Kira became a witch, you know!

165
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:23,991
No, the culprit didn't use magic.

166
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,691
Rather, he used a Ninja technique.

167
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,291
Ninja technique?

168
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,391
Are you saying that the culprit is a Ninja?

169
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:34,691
I'm not talking about super ninja tricks like

170
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,991
"Dust hiding" and "Ninja split".

171
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:39,491
You see it a lot on TV, don't you?

172
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,691
The technique where ninjas jump over high fences

173
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:44,591
using their own swords.

174
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:48,791
The culprit used that trick to escape from here.

175
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,191
He used ten somewhat posters

176
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,991
that were here in place of a sword!

177
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:56,391
By using the posters?

178
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:58,591
I'm completely lost.

179
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:03,091
Okay, I'll show you how it was done, everybody!

180
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:05,391
Not again.

181
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,891
You two are my men, you know.

182
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:11,191
Thanks to the cooperation of Officer Chiba's friend,

183
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:13,491
we were able to get hold of the same size

184
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:16,191
and number of posters that were here.

185
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:19,491
First, the culprit rolled all the posters

186
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,991
he removed from the panels into cylinders.

187
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:25,691
Posters of the same size are stacked together and rolled up.

188
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:31,391
Then, four cylinders of different lengths will be made.

189
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,791
You bunch the four up

190
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:37,291
and a make-shift step-ladder is made.

191
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,791
But, can you really climb up to that window

192
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,391
using paper that you just rolled up like this?

193
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:48,091
Paper, when you roll it up into cylinders like this

194
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,191
will manifest surprising strength

195
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:53,491
when it comes to vertical loads.

196
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:55,391
Officer Takagi, please.

197
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:56,591
Yes, sir!

198
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,391
But, how will the window be closed after this?

199
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:44,491
-Officer Chiba! -Yes, sir!

200
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,491
By using the trick that was used during the seance.

201
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,891
When the fishing line is pulled,

202
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,091
the easel ends up pushing the switch right through.

203
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,591
Then all he had left to do was go back to Mr. Hirasaka's room

204
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,191
get rid of the poster

205
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:44,691
and during the chaos of the dead body being found,

206
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,491
return the remote controller into the room.

207
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:48,891
I see.

208
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:52,191
And, who's the culprit?

209
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:55,691
The culprit not only killed Shoko and Mr. Hirasaka,

210
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:59,791
but also killed Mr. Sawanami who died half a month ago.

211
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,991
Characters pointing to the killer was left behind at the scene.

212
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:05,191
"Kira" was written, right?

213
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:07,991
Kira resurrected after all.

214
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,891
No!

215
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,991
The name of the culprit that Mr. Sawanami

216
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:15,491
was trying to point out was...

217
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,287
The name of the culprit that Mr. Sawanami

218
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:32,687
was trying to point out was...

219
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:34,387
"Mifune"!

220
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:41,287
Right, the killer is you, Mr. Mifune!

221
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:46,787
No, it can't be.

222
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,987
Then, what is the meaning of the character "Kira"

223
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:51,287
that was left back at the scene?

224
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,087
Mr. Sawanami

225
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:56,187
tried to write the name "Mifune" in katakana.

226
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,887
But after writing "Mifu", he died.

227
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:00,687
Shoko, the first one to find the corpse,

228
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:04,487
saw this and on impulse added on a vertical line

229
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,287
and changed the word to "Kira".

230
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:07,987
What?

231
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:12,387
Ridiculous. Why would she have to do something like that?

232
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:16,187
Wasn't that to protect you?

233
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:19,287
Everything you're saying is nothing but deductions!

234
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:21,087
Do you have definite proof to support what you're saying?

235
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,087
I'm sure that you still have the proof on you, don't you?

236
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:28,087
-What? -That's why you have your necktie

237
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:29,487
that you usually wear loose,

238
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,787
wrapped tightly and neatly around your neck

239
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,987
despite it being hot.

240
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,587
The proof is hidden under that necktie!

241
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:39,487
-Officer Chiba! -Yes, sir!

242
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:48,287
When you poisoned Mr. Hirasaka to death,

243
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:51,187
the wine splattered all over from the glass that was knocked over,

244
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:53,887
and smeared your shirt.

245
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,587
Since you didn't want to get into trouble

246
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,087
after the interrogation and your belonging are checked,

247
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:01,087
that you wore it and hid it with your necktie.

248
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,687
If we analyze that smear,

249
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:08,687
it should match the substance that killed Mr. Hirasaka.

250
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,687
Yeah, that's right!

251
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:14,687
I killed all three of them!

252
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:18,887
Mr. Mifune. Why in the world...

253
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:21,387
It's because they killed Kira!

254
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:22,787
The Kira that I love!

255
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:26,887
What? So, you were going out with Kira after all, Mr. Mifune.

256
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,187
Yeah, that's right!

257
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:32,187
That's why despite it being necessary to hide the trick that I used

258
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:35,787
having to tear up Kira's posters with my own hands

259
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,487
was really painful!

260
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:42,087
But, I did so believing that it was to save Kira!

261
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,587
To save Kira?

262
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,487
Just as I thought.

263
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:49,287
I thought that it wasn't possible

264
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,187
that Kira who was especially careful about driving safely,

265
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:53,287
would get into an accident in a place like that.

266
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:56,987
But the police would not take me seriously.

267
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:59,687
I suspected that something must've happened

268
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:02,787
at the party that was held here.

269
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:05,487
Right before the accident!

270
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:07,687
In order to find out the truth,

271
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,987
I set up wiretaps everywhere in this mansion!

272
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:13,087
I listened to everything!

273
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:16,387
Hirasaka who was going through a slump back

274
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,387
then drowned himself in alcohol.

275
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:21,587
That night, Hirasaka got drunk and violent again.

276
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:25,587
Kira, who tried to calm him down was knocked down by him

277
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,987
and...

278
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:30,287
In order to hide this fact,

279
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:32,887
Hirasaka and the others faked the accident!

280
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:34,687
So, you took revenge.

281
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,787
Yeah, I picked Sawanami to be the first

282
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:40,287
because he was the least on his guard.

283
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:41,687
But...

284
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:48,487
I know everything, you know.

285
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,487
Everything that you did, Mr. Mifune.

286
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,587
But, don't worry.

287
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:55,987
I won't tell anybody.

288
00:17:56,787 --> 00:18:02,387
Sawanami was saying that another woman as at the party.

289
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:06,287
He didn't say her name, but I knew it was Shoko.

290
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:09,287
He was trying to protect the woman he loved.

291
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,887
I was actually planning to kill you first!

292
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:15,187
Since I knew of the seance from listening to the wiretaps,

293
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,887
I was going to take advantage of it!

294
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,187
But, I changed my mind.

295
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:21,187
I couldn't forgive the fact that the woman

296
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:24,387
who was involved in Kira's death dared to blackmailed me!

297
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:26,787
That's why I decided to kill that woman!

298
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,487
You're wrong!

299
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,287
You're wrong!

300
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:36,187
I'm the one that was with Kira that day!

301
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:37,687
Maho.

302
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:38,987
It's a lie.

303
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:42,787
If so, why didn't Sawanami mention your name?

304
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:47,087
Mr. Sawanami probably didn't know my name.

305
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:49,187
He didn't seem to be interested in a plain

306
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:51,587
and reserved person like me.

307
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:53,887
-No. -It's that true?

308
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,487
Yes.

309
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:58,987
That's why I thought that she was the culprit.

310
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:02,487
Why didn't you report it to the police right away?

311
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:07,687
I didn't want to believe that Kira was dead!

312
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:11,287
She was what kept me living.

313
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,587
I was bullied in Junior and Senior high school,

314
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,187
and as an adult I used to be confined to myself.

315
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:21,187
I owe my being able to function fairly normally to Kira.

316
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,187
I encountered Kira coincidentally at a cosplay shop

317
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:27,387
that I conjured up courage to go to for the first time.

318
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:30,787
I guess you all think why cosplay.

319
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:33,187
But, being able to be an inhabitant of dreamland

320
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:34,887
for even a fleeting moment

321
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:38,187
helped me forget the painful world of reality I lived in.

322
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:41,787
Kira was the one who taught me that.

323
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,987
I wished that everything was just a dream.

324
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:50,187
If I reported the incident to the police and things came into light,

325
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:53,587
I would have to accept everything as fact.

326
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,587
I was afraid to do so!

327
00:19:56,587 --> 00:20:01,787
I'm sorry!

328
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,287
Shoko.

329
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,387
If only you didn't blackmail Mr. Mifune.

330
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:11,287
That's wrong too.

331
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:14,187
Shoko liked Mr. Mifune.

332
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:15,387
What?

333
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:18,287
Wasn't Shoko going steady with Sawanami?

334
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:21,787
No, Shoko told me,

335
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,987
"Mr. Mifune probably likes Kira"

336
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:29,387
so she said she'd keep her feelings deep down in her heart.

337
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:30,687
I think that Shoko

338
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,887
"Mifu" -really wanted to help Mr. Mifune.

339
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,287
No.

340
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:39,287
No.

341
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,487
Which means that I killed somebody

342
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:48,387
who really wanted to protect me with my own hands?

343
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:51,587
There was no sign of her fighting back on her body

344
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:53,487
because when you attacked her,

345
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:57,387
she probably felt deep grief and gave up on everything.

346
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,287
That's a lie!

347
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:02,687
A lie!

348
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,287
It's a lie! A lie!

349
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:08,887
-Hey! Cut it out! -It's a lie!

350
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:13,387
It's a lie! A lie!

351
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:19,387
But, why did he have to create a locked room here?

352
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:21,987
This is just my imagination.

353
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:25,187
Mr. Mifune, by creating a locked room

354
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:28,487
probably wanted the police to destroy this room.

355
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,587
Destroyed by the police?

356
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,387
If the locked room trick is not solved,

357
00:21:32,387 --> 00:21:34,687
in order to look for a secret passage or something,

358
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:37,987
the least they'll do is tear off the floors, right?

359
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:41,887
And, he wanted the police to find

360
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:45,987
Kira's body that Mr. Hirasaka and the others hid under the floor.

361
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:47,887
He wanted the police, the very ones, who concluded

362
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:51,187
Kira's death to be accidental to find her corpse.

363
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:56,487
The following day, the police found Kira's body

364
00:21:56,487 --> 00:22:00,387
under the floor of the meditation room.

365
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:04,387
Now, all the locked rooms have been opened.

366
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,487
"Mouri Detective Agency"

367
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:28,987
Yatsukawa, I heard you won the Director's Award

368
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,487
because of your reporting the incident!

369
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:34,287
But, many of my acquaintances died

370
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,087
or got arrested,

371
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:38,087
so my feelings are a bit complex.

372
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:39,687
Cheer up!

373
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:42,687
Yes! Please help me out on the next case too!

374
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,487
-What? -My next report'll be about a haunted hospital

375
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:48,487
where a series of ghostly phenomenon occur!

376
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:49,587
What?

377
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:52,387
Come on! Let's head off right away!

378
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,787
What? Hey! Don't pull me!

379
00:23:54,787 --> 00:23:58,387
I'm fed up with occult already.

380
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:00,387
You can say that again.

381
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:04,587
Is it true that you were chosen as lay judge?

382
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:07,287
Why did something like that happen?

383
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:09,787
Attorney at Law Queen Kisaki, who has never lost a case

384
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:11,687
and Madonna prosecutor Kujo

385
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:12,687
are going to be confronting each other,

386
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:15,387
and Ms. Kobayashi is going to be a lay judge.

387
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,787
Isn't this picture upside down?

388
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:22,787
It seems that the defendant had a motive for killing the victim.

389
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:25,787
What a terrible thing to come out.

390
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:27,087
Next Conan,

391
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:31,487
"Courtroom Confrontation IV Lay Judge Sumiko Kobayashi (Part 1)"

392
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:49,487
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,487
"Picture"

394
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:53,187
Next episode, we will have the woman that's hard to deal with!

395
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:54,487
Oh, mother.

396
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:56,487
What's this chill I feel?
