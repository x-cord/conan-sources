1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:02,504
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:04,304
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,704
Let's meet once in 10 years.

4
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,604
The first promise, a smeared postcard.

5
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:09,204
This is Dr. Agasa's love story.

6
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:10,804
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:12,405
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,630
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:24,290
"Ginkgo-Colored First Love (Part 1)"

10
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:28,581
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

11
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,981
What kind of letter is it?

12
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:35,382
A letter in a postcard size envelope.

13
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:42,981
I guess we've got no choice

14
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:44,281
but look for it all together.

15
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:47,081
What was the letter about, Dr. Agasa?

16
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,981
It was an invitation to the wedding

17
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:52,581
of an acquaintance doctor's son's wedding.

18
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:55,581
If I remember correctly the R.S.V.P. postcard was enclosed

19
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:57,981
and the deadline for answering it was today.

20
00:02:57,982 --> 00:03:01,381
You should have kept it carefully.

21
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,281
Absolutely.

22
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,382
Will you stop barking up the wrong tree?

23
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:08,381
You're all to blame for the letter getting lost too,

24
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:10,481
since you came over to play games last night

25
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,982
and messed the place up.

26
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:16,282
That's true.

27
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:20,182
By the way, you look sleepy as usual.

28
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:22,981
Bug you?

29
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:26,381
I guess you can't help being sleepy

30
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:28,981
since you get up early and go to school with Ayumi

31
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:30,882
to look in on the rabbits at school.

32
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,181
How come you know?

33
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:36,081
Were you watching us?

34
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,382
I saw ginkgo leaves on the hair of you both.

35
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:48,381
That rabbit hut is by the gingko tree lined street

36
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:49,781
behind the school yard, isn't it?

37
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:50,981
That's about the only place,

38
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,381
you can find gingko trees around here.

39
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:55,281
Moreover, the girls were making a fuss

40
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,581
over the rabbit looking sick yesterday.

41
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:59,581
Cool.

42
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:04,481
Then, would you please hurry and look for the letter, Mr. Detective?

43
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,181
Let's see.

44
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:09,081
Dr. Agasa has a habit of putting letters

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,181
and postcards that he finishes reading on the TV set,

46
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:13,181
so behind the set is a likely place for it to be.

47
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:14,582
But you've probably already looked there.

48
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:18,081
There are a lot of things down here.

49
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,881
See. This much.

50
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:21,581
No joke?

51
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,982
That's the first place you should've looked.

52
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:28,781
Talk about a lot of things down here.

53
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:29,881
Let's see.

54
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:32,481
New Year's cards, midsummer greeting cards, and...

55
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:35,481
Goodness. A driver's license renewal notice too.

56
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:39,882
Oh My. They're all stuff that I thought I lost.

57
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:43,181
Oh. What cute handwriting.

58
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,481
"To Mr. Agasa" -This postcard must've been written

59
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:45,482
by a child.

60
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:46,482
"Mr. Hiroshi Agasa."

61
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,381
Oh, this is the one.

62
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,982
Yeah! Here it is, Dr. Agasa!

63
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:53,382
Dr. Agasa?

64
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:01,381
What? Have you found something good?

65
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:02,881
What?

66
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,581
Say, that's the postcard written by a child that we saw a while ago.

67
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:07,481
-Well... -Could it be a love letter?

68
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:12,081
No, it's a card I received from my friend long ago.

69
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:15,181
It was 40 years ago.

70
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,981
40 years ago?

71
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,381
Which means that this is something back

72
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,181
from when you were in the 6th grade?

73
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:22,182
Yeah.

74
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:26,082
It was the first day of school after summer vacation.

75
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:29,981
I took a different road from the usual

76
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,981
because I was late for school.

77
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,681
Then, I saw a girl,

78
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:38,081
who was an under classman standing stalled and looking pale.

79
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:40,581
She was a cute girl with big round eyes

80
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:44,481
that could be seen from the cap that she wore quite deeply.

81
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:46,681
It seems that she was scared of the barking dog

82
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:48,982
and was stalled because of it.

83
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,981
Well, a person named Mr. Noi owned a big dog,

84
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:54,881
and it was also well-known in the neighborhood

85
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,881
so I guess it couldn't be helped.

86
00:05:56,882 --> 00:06:00,281
She looked so scared, despite hiding behind me

87
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:03,881
when passing by the dog, that I asked her why.

88
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:05,381
She told me that she had been bitten by a dog

89
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:07,181
that she had when she was little,

90
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:10,482
and that she had become to hate animals since then.

91
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:16,081
I felt sorry for her plight,

92
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:17,981
so I took her to the place of an acquaintance

93
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:21,181
named Mr. Chono who kept a hamster.

94
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,681
She was scared at first,

95
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:27,081
but she seemed to get used to as the days went by.

96
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:31,181
After two months, she turned into an animal lover.

97
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,781
She could even laugh when passing in front of Mr. Noi's dog.

98
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:40,482
So, you and that girl went to school together every day, right?

99
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,181
Yeah, I guess so.

100
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:46,481
Only during fall of that year, though...

101
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:48,181
Only during fall?

102
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:51,981
Right. On a rainy morning at the end of November,

103
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:54,681
I was waiting like always in front of the Mr. Noi residence

104
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,681
for her to come but,

105
00:06:57,682 --> 00:07:00,881
no matter how long I waited she didn't show up.

106
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:02,581
Worried that she may have caught cold or something

107
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,681
I went to her house after school

108
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,481
too check things out but,

109
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:10,882
the lady next door told me she had moved that morning.

110
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:13,881
She moved?

111
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:15,581
Without telling you?

112
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:18,181
She could've at least said goodbye.

113
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:19,381
No.

114
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:21,281
She probably...

115
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:24,581
She probably couldn't even if she wanted to.

116
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:28,681
Goodbye, is a sad word

117
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,881
that pricks the heart like a needle.

118
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,781
It can't be.

119
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:37,781
But, it's too sad leaving without saying a word.

120
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:40,981
No, she did thank me.

121
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:45,482
I found that postcard in the mailbox of my house that day.

122
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:51,581
But, there isn't any stamp on the postcard.

123
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:55,381
She probably put it in the mailbox of your house herself,

124
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:56,481
just before she moved.

125
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,881
And? What's written on it?

126
00:07:58,882 --> 00:07:59,981
Oh...

127
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:02,081
Thank you for the three months.

128
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,081
It was a lot of fun being with you.

129
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,481
I don't like goodbye, so I want to say,

130
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:07,681
let's meet again.

131
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:09,281
10 years later, on this day,

132
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:12,981
before the sun sets at that memorable place.

133
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:15,581
If I can't see you then, 10 years after that will do.

134
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:18,081
I'll wait for you even if I grow to be a grandmother.

135
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,681
Come see me if you have the time.

136
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:23,781
To Hiroshi Agasa who I like, like, like very much.

137
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:27,581
November 24th, 4th grade, class A,

138
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,381
Kinoshita...

139
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:31,182
The words are smeared that I can't read it.

140
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,281
It probably got wet in the rain

141
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:36,481
when she was putting it in the mailbox.

142
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,581
And, did you get to see her? Ms. Kinoshita.

143
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:43,881
No, I don't know where that memorable place is you see...

144
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,381
Hey, hey...

145
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:49,781
But... Isn't November 24th today?

146
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:52,981
And it's exactly 40 years ago...

147
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:55,381
Maybe that girl...

148
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:57,881
She is waiting for you there today too!

149
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:01,682
But, if Dr. Agasa can't remember the place.

150
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:05,281
So... I'm sorry...

151
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:06,881
Really...

152
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:11,381
You've always been dense when it came to things like this from before.

153
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:16,381
Hey, maybe it's the place where that scary dog was?

154
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:19,681
I see. The place where you first met each other.

155
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:22,681
I thought so too, so I went there 10 years later

156
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:24,581
and waited for her there for a long time,

157
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:26,181
but no one came.

158
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:28,881
Then, what about the house of the person who had the hamster?

159
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:31,381
I went to his house 20 years later,

160
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:34,181
one day before and spent the night there.

161
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:37,581
Too bad, she didn't show up though.

162
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:40,981
I'm sure she was waiting elsewhere.

163
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:43,881
You never got a letter from her after that?

164
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:46,481
No. She had the address of my parent's home,

165
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:49,681
but my parents moved to the country too so.

166
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:52,981
Then, why don't you write her?

167
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,881
I don't know her address or her name,

168
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:56,781
so I can't even if I wanted to.

169
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:58,581
What? You don't know her name?

170
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:02,681
I think you can easily get it at the grade school you went to?

171
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,681
Of course, I thought of asking her.

172
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:06,781
But I figured I could see her 10 years later anyway,

173
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,781
so I didn't.

174
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:09,782
That's right!

175
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:12,381
You went to Teitan Elementary school too, didn't you, Dr. Agasa?

176
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:14,381
Then, maybe we can give them a call?

177
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:17,581
Oh, but there's no school today,

178
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:20,081
so only the custodian is there.

179
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:21,781
Besides, if by chance you're able to find out

180
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:23,781
what her name and address are,

181
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:26,981
and if you fortunately are able to get in touch with her

182
00:10:26,982 --> 00:10:29,981
and see her, maybe all you'll be doing is hurting her feelings?

183
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:34,481
Dr. Agasa didn't know what place she thought was important,

184
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:38,081
and the fact that he made her wait meaninglessly

185
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,782
for 40 years is going to be revealed.

186
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,581
I don't think you need to take it that far.

187
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:49,381
That is, only if she's waiting there today.

188
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,081
Then, Dr. Agasa's going to have to remember the place

189
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:54,681
and go see her after all.

190
00:10:54,682 --> 00:11:00,381
But, it's already been 40 years, so remembering is...

191
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:03,381
But we've got clues.

192
00:11:03,382 --> 00:11:05,081
Clues?

193
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,082
"To Mr. Agasa" -See,

194
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,281
"The Hint Is: Animal" -below the name of the addressee,

195
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:09,481
you can see a row of numbers, right?

196
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:13,582
"The Hint Is: Animal" -This could be a code that indicates the place.

197
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:17,381
-Really. -But, what does it mean?

198
00:11:17,382 --> 00:11:22,581
4163, 33, 6, 0.

199
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,581
It says here that the hint is an animal.

200
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:28,081
Hey, Dr. Agasa, what does this mean?

201
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:29,381
Well...

202
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:32,281
If you knew, you would've met her already, right?

203
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:33,781
I'm ashamed.

204
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,681
But, maybe you can solve it, Conan.

205
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:37,381
Nope, I don't have the slightest idea.

206
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:38,881
I see.

207
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:43,281
Hey, if she's only waiting till sundown,

208
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:46,581
you only have about four hours left.

209
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,281
Then, I guess we have no choice but to go to Sleeping Kogoro

210
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:52,181
and have him decipher the code.

211
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:57,881
Pops is at the joint live concert of Yoko Okino and Misa Nakayama,

212
00:11:57,882 --> 00:11:58,981
so he's not in now.

213
00:11:58,982 --> 00:11:59,982
What?

214
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:01,581
Misa?

215
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:02,981
Did you remember something?

216
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:05,781
The first name of the person called Kinoshita.

217
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:09,081
I sort of think her name was something like that.

218
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:11,681
Hey, if Sleeping Kogoro's not around,

219
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:15,181
maybe we should ask Sonoko?

220
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:20,081
Right. She was bragging that she solved a case the other day too.

221
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:22,681
Sonoko's not around either.

222
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:25,681
She's out with Ran since this morning standing in line

223
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:28,082
to buy a brand-name handbag that's going on sale just today.

224
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,081
Besides, if I can't solve it,

225
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:33,781
those two wouldn't be able to solve it either.

226
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:35,481
Oh, it's the one that's on sale

227
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:39,881
in commemoration of Fusae Campbell's visit to Japan.

228
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:41,381
Fusae?

229
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:44,682
It could've been that sort of name too.

230
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,981
No, wait... Misae...

231
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,382
No, or was it Fusako?

232
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:55,181
I wonder what's so good about that leaf-patterned handbag.

233
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,781
It' s expensive, isn't it?

234
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:59,181
The "Fusae Brand" handbag are not leaf-patterned, those are ginkgos.

235
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:01,281
They're the trademark of the "Fusae brand".

236
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:04,481
And, not all the items are that expensive.

237
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:09,082
That brand has a number of reasonably priced items too.

238
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:12,081
A number?

239
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,881
Will you show it to me, Conan?

240
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,681
What's up, Ayumi?

241
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:17,981
Hey, maybe this code

242
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:21,582
has something to do with the number of animals at our school.

243
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:28,181
Well, there are six rabbits, chickens, society finches and pigeons.

244
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,881
All the birds added together make a total of 33 birds, right?

245
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:32,182
Then, what about the zero?

246
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:34,881
That's the number of turtles

247
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,582
that died during summer vacation.

248
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,781
No way.

249
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,281
When I was in elementary school,

250
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:43,581
the turtle was still alive and kicking,

251
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:48,581
and the only animal other than that were the chickens.

252
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:52,981
Besides, the first numbers 4163 are unexplained, right?

253
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,881
Oh, that's right.

254
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:59,281
But, turtles live long, don't they to be alive for 40 years?

255
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:02,081
No, that's actually the 3rd turtle,

256
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,481
and it's rumored that each time a turtle dies,

257
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:06,281
a new one is brought over from the zoo.

258
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,681
That's true.

259
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,781
A graduate of Teitan Elementary school,

260
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,381
and the first head of the Tohto Zoo,

261
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:15,781
Mr. Yoichirou Kobata,

262
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:17,981
in hopes of wanting the children to live

263
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,681
a long life gave the turtle to the school as a gift.

264
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:24,082
They say that turtles live a million years too.

265
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,881
Dr. Agasa, what did you just say?

266
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:30,481
Turtles live a million years?

267
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:34,781
No. The name of the first head of Tohto Zoo.

268
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:36,881
He said, Kobata...

269
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:38,481
Mr. Yoichirou?

270
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,081
"Four" -Yo... (In Japanese 4)

271
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:41,082
"One, Six" -Ichirou... (1 and 6)

272
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,781
"Three" -San... (means Mr.)

273
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,381
-That's it! -That's it!

274
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,681
Hey, hey...

275
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:46,782
Oh, boy.

276
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,032
"Tohto Zoo."

277
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:10,531
Hey, look good and hard.

278
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:14,531
Yes. She's sure to be here somewhere.

279
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:16,731
Dr. Agasa's first love.

280
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,931
We'll get her for sure.

281
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,331
-Yeah! -Yeah!

282
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:24,531
Hey. I never said she was my love.

283
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:25,932
It's so obvious.

284
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:37,431
Well, even if I were to believe what they said

285
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:40,131
about 4163 being Mr. Yoichirou.

286
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:43,532
The connection with 33, 6, and 0 that comes after that is not solved...

287
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,931
Pandas are cute after all.

288
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:48,131
Yeah.

289
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:50,431
I'd like to have one.

290
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:51,931
Hey, you guys...

291
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:55,431
Hey, I wonder what that number is?

292
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:59,132
See, the number that is written on the name plate of the animals.

293
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:06,131
The numbers are probably designated to categorize the animals.

294
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,532
But the numbers are picked too much at random.

295
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:12,231
The numbers are designated in the order

296
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,531
in which the animals came into the zoo.

297
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:18,431
Therefore, the panda was the 58th animal that was put in here.

298
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:21,831
Then, which animal is the 33rd?

299
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,831
If I remember correctly, I think it was a donkey?

300
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:24,931
Donkey?

301
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:26,131
I get it.

302
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:27,831
"Mr. Yoichirou" -The 33rd animal that...

303
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:30,031
"33rd animal" -Yoichirou put in the zoo...

304
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,232
"Donkey" -Was a donkey!

305
00:16:33,432 --> 00:16:34,932
That's it!

306
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:39,031
Hey! The zero hasn't been figured out yet.

307
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,231
Hurry up, hurry up!

308
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,831
-Yes! -Yes!

309
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,032
They've been switched on.

310
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,231
Number 33, number 33, number 33.

311
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:53,731
Donkey, donkey, donkey.

312
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:56,631
Woman, woman, woman.

313
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,832
"33, Donkey."

314
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:02,931
Number 33!

315
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:04,031
Donkey!

316
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:05,032
Woman!

317
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,831
-Found her! -Found her!

318
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:09,231
Hey, you guys...

319
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,931
There she is. There she is.

320
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:12,932
No joke?

321
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:20,031
She's wearing a hat so it's probably her, right?

322
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:22,031
Let's try asking her then.

323
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,432
Hey.

324
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,532
-Excuse me. -Excuse me.

325
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,532
Aren't you?

326
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,532
Oh, Mr. Hiroshi Agasa?

327
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:42,831
It's been a long time.

328
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:46,231
Yes, 40 years, is it?

329
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,131
You sure lost a lot of hair.

330
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:50,831
No.

331
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:53,631
Then, don't tell me that

332
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:55,531
this grandmother is...

333
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,531
the one with the big round eyes...

334
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,631
Of 40 years ago...

335
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:02,431
Your first love?

336
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:07,431
I guess this is a typical case of time beautifying all things.

337
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:10,731
But don't you think she looks a bit too old?

338
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:13,931
When Dr. Agasa was in the 6th grade,

339
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,331
she was in the 4th grade, right?

340
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:20,032
If so, she should be around 49 or 50 years old.

341
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:24,031
Maybe she went through a lot of hard times.

342
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:25,131
I guess so.

343
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:27,031
Well then, see you then.

344
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:29,532
Yeah. Take care.

345
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:32,631
Hey... Are you done already?

346
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,531
She's your first love, isn't she?

347
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:37,531
No... She's Mrs. Noi.

348
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,532
I told you about her, didn't I?

349
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,231
She's the owner of the big dog

350
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:43,331
that used to bark a lot on our way back from school.

351
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,131
The grand-dog of that dog seems to have died last month,

352
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:49,831
and she got lonely so she came to the zoo.

353
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:50,931
What?

354
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,631
Wrong person.

355
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,931
I thought she was a bit too old.

356
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,231
But, how strange.

357
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:02,731
If the place you are to meet her is the code 4163,

358
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:04,931
it's about the head of the zoo,

359
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:07,431
Mr. Yoichirou Kobata, and,

360
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:11,131
if three, three designates the 33rd animal that came here,

361
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:13,031
and if six is a donkey,

362
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:16,131
she supposed to be waiting here.

363
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,531
I told you, right?

364
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,131
That the last zero hasn't been solved yet.

365
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:25,331
And? Can't you remember anything else that would could be a hint?

366
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:29,231
Nothing other than that her eyes were big

367
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,631
and that her last name was Kinoshita.

368
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:36,432
And also that she liked to take care of the chickens at school.

369
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,931
She had freckles on her cheeks,

370
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:42,231
and for some reason always wore her cap deeply over her head.

371
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:44,132
That's about it.

372
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:46,531
Always?

373
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:49,531
Yeah. On the way to school and back.

374
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:52,931
Of course I think she took it off during class, though.

375
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:54,931
I wonder if there was a reason for her wearing the cap?

376
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,631
She wasn't bald.

377
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:59,731
She was probably a very shy girl.

378
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,331
Then we have no choice but to figure out

379
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:04,332
the code and find the place after all.

380
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:09,531
Let's say that 4163 is this zoo.

381
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:13,431
The problem is the number three, three, six and zero.

382
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:15,231
"Mimimure" -Mimimure...

383
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:16,632
"Mimiroku" -Mimiroku...

384
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,831
Hey, maybe it's about an owl?

385
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:24,731
If it's an owl, the numbers would be three, three, two, nine.

386
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:26,431
"Sasarokuwa" -Sasarokuwa...

387
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,231
"Sasarokure" -Sasarokure...

388
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:29,532
"Sasamu" -Sasamu...

389
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,131
Flying squirrel (Musasabi)!

390
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:35,131
How silly. Then it would be the same as before.

391
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:37,331
The meaning of zero is not solved, is it?

392
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:40,731
No. Not really.

393
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,531
It says on the postcard,

394
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:47,031
let's meet before the sun sets, right?

395
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:49,231
Flying squirrels are nocturnal animals

396
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:50,831
that move about only at night.

397
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,931
In other words, before the sun sets it is asleep in its nest,

398
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,831
and the number of flying squirrels

399
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,832
that meet the eyes of the zoo comers is...

400
00:20:58,932 --> 00:20:59,932
Zero!

401
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:02,031
Is zero flying squirrels.

402
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:07,031
But, are there animals at the zoo that you only get to see at night?

403
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,131
Stupid.

404
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:12,331
Cages are set up indoors in most zoos

405
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,832
so that nocturnal animals can also be viewed.

406
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:17,331
Okay, let's go then.

407
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:18,531
-Yeah! -Yeah!

408
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:20,731
"Nocturnal Animals Building."

409
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:22,231
Really...

410
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,132
It's full of nocturnal animals.

411
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:28,531
But, it's full of bats and snakes that it's kind of eerie.

412
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:29,532
Yes.

413
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:32,732
Let's see. Flying squirrels, flying squirrels.

414
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,431
There they are!

415
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,832
The flying squirrels!

416
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,632
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

417
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:49,431
She seems to be waiting for someone.

418
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:53,631
She's not wearing a hat, but I'm sure it's her.

419
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:56,531
See. You're meeting her after 40 years,

420
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,031
so go do your thing.

421
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,032
Yeah.

422
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:59,031
"Next Episode" -Then, don't tell me that...

423
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:00,331
It can't be that...

424
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:01,431
Blonde?

425
00:24:01,432 --> 00:24:03,231
As for memories about her,

426
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:07,732
I will keep it untouched and beautiful as it used to be within my heart.

427
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:14,932
I see, so that's it.

428
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:18,231
I got it, Dr. Agasa.

429
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:20,732
The memorable place that she's waiting for you.

430
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:27,132
Next Conan, "Ginkgo-Colored First Love (Part 2)"

431
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:45,231
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:45,232 --> 00:24:47,431
"Blonde."

433
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:48,631
Ai's first love is?

434
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:49,632
Dr. Agasa.

435
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:50,632
Just joking.
