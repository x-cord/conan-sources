1
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:02,652
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

2
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:05,152
You must be true to yourself.

3
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:07,052
Screams echo throughout the haunted house!

4
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:09,252
What was supposed to be an act turns into reality.

5
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:10,852
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:12,852
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:15,352
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:59,013
"Screaming Operation Room (Part 1)"

9
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:03,013
"Beika University Summer Festival"

10
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:07,013
The light music club concert will start from 15:00!

11
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:08,813
How about some famed mountain hut style

12
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:11,713
fried noodles of the Wandervogel club?

13
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:16,913
Entry number 5, English major Ms. Alisa Arisugawa!

14
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:20,113
Don't break the set!

15
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:22,613
What're we going to do about evening performance?

16
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:25,513
How about some cold drinks?

17
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,513
We're loading two more Adamski type UFOs!

18
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:30,613
Okay!

19
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:32,713
The costume play photo studio is open!

20
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:34,413
Please come!

21
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,113
Let me introduce to you!

22
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:40,713
An OB of Beika University as well as a famed detective.

23
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:42,413
Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

24
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,113
Hello!

25
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:46,613
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

26
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,413
How does it feel, visiting your alma mater after a long while?

27
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:51,213
Do you feel nostalgic?

28
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,613
Yes, sort of.

29
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:55,913
The school building is as rundown as was always, though.

30
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,313
But...

31
00:02:57,313 --> 00:03:00,113
There are so many beauties here.

32
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:07,913
Geez, since he said he was going to give a lecture at his alma mater,

33
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:09,613
I came to look in on things,

34
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:12,413
and sure enough, all he was after was the girl students here!

35
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:14,313
Well, I guess it's not all that bad

36
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:18,013
to spread your wings freely at times in places like these, no?

37
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:21,113
The only thing that's spread long is the space under his nose.

38
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:25,213
And? Did you get to spread you wings in London, Ran?

39
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:28,713
You wrote me that you coincidentally ran into Shinichi, right?

40
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:31,413
Yeah, sort of.

41
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:36,113
Don't tell me you two did things you weren't supposed to do?

42
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:37,713
Just what do you mean by that?

43
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:39,913
Talking about London...

44
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:43,213
Shut up! I wish you'd stay out of it!

45
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:46,613
This is a story of adults that have nothing to do with brats!

46
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:49,213
Yes, it has everything to do with me.

47
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:53,413
Well, I guess when it comes to that Holmes freak,

48
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:57,013
he ended up talking your ears off about Holmes, right?

49
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,613
Well...

50
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,313
The thing is...

51
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:03,813
What?

52
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:06,713
Shinichi confessed that he loves you?

53
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,213
Keep your voice down, Sonoko!

54
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:15,413
Oh, so the time's finally come around for him to settle down.

55
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:19,813
But, if under those circumstances, rather than confess...

56
00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:22,813
Can't you tell?

57
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:25,313
You're a detective, aren't you?

58
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:28,713
If so, why don't you at least deduce what's going on inside of me!

59
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:30,513
You dumb-dumb!

60
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:34,413
Hey, hold it, Ran!

61
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,413
Wait, I said!

62
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:38,713
Hey!

63
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,013
No. Let me go!

64
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,413
You're a nuisance!

65
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:44,813
What?

66
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:48,113
You're a nuisance of a difficult case to solve!

67
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,613
You've got so much unnecessary emotions mixed up inside of you,

68
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:52,213
that I wouldn't be able to make you out

69
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:54,513
even if I were Holmes himself!

70
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:57,113
I could never accurately make out

71
00:04:57,113 --> 00:05:00,613
the feelings of a girl I care for!

72
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,113
It seems as if you pressured him into confessing how he felt.

73
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:19,613
I guess so.

74
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:23,113
And? You answered truthfully too, didn't you, Ran?

75
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,413
Answered... what?

76
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:29,513
No joke. I don't believe it.

77
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:32,213
I loved you all this time too.

78
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:33,813
Like this?

79
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:36,513
Of course I wouldn't say something like that.

80
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:41,013
I mean, should I have said something too?

81
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,813
Why, of course!

82
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:44,513
If you're not clear about it,

83
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:48,313
he may think that he was brushed off or something.

84
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:50,113
Idiot.

85
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:53,013
It was obvious at that point.

86
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:56,013
If you're going to tell him, tell him right now on the phone!

87
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,813
-I'll watch you while you do! -What?

88
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:01,913
Hey, are you calling now?

89
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:06,213
Then, I would like to tell you the story of the 108 bags

90
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:07,813
that are indispensible for detectives!

91
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:10,813
The first is a wisdom bag!

92
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,113
Geez.

93
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:15,513
At this rate, who knows when he'll finish talking.

94
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:18,013
I mean after hearing that a detective was coming,

95
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:20,513
I wanted him to take a look and then.

96
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:25,513
Oh, I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

97
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:27,313
Did you want to see my father about something?

98
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:29,513
Could it be that you want him to investigate a case?

99
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:32,313
No. That's not it but...

100
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:36,113
If you're his daughter, do you go to investigate cases at times?

101
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:41,513
-Yes, at times. -Well, very frequently!

102
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:44,713
Then, you've seen it, haven't you?

103
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:46,113
What?

104
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,813
"Screaming Hospital"

105
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:50,513
Go inside that haunted house

106
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:53,113
to check out how well the zombie is made?

107
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,813
Yeah. I think that someone who has been

108
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:59,313
to the actual scene of a crime many times

109
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,713
would be able to evaluate the looks of things more realistically!

110
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,313
Oh, well...

111
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:04,313
But...

112
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:07,413
The fact is, we belong to the department of literature and fine arts

113
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:10,213
and are majoring in the art of imagery!

114
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:13,813
We're shooting a horror movie as our graduation production

115
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,813
but we were told by a nagging broad who thinks

116
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,313
she's some big shot director that the scene

117
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:20,613
where a person dies, doesn't look real enough.

118
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:22,313
So, we told her to show us

119
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:24,213
a sample of what she's talking about.

120
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:29,113
Are you talking about me?

121
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:36,413
Who are these children?

122
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:38,613
When's the Sleeping Kogoro coming?

123
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:43,513
So, we've brought his daughter and her friend over!

124
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:47,213
Because she seems to have seen corpses at murder sites.

125
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:50,613
Okay, then, Go tell your father how you felt looking at it

126
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,513
and bring him here later, will you?

127
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:58,313
Anna! It's about time we shift!

128
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:00,313
Hey, what's with you, Mutsumi?

129
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,213
You don't even have your make-up on yet!

130
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,613
Because even if I were to do it myself,

131
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:06,813
you're going to fix it, aren't you, Anna?

132
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:08,913
That's why I thought it'd be better

133
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,613
if you did it for me to begin with.

134
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:13,513
Geez, talk about a hopeless case!

135
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:16,913
Okay, we'll let them in in 30 minutes, then!

136
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,613
You want to show them the part you're playing the zombie,

137
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:21,113
while you're at it anyway, don't you?

138
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:23,013
Okay!

139
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:27,013
Take a good look at the way I look dead, then!

140
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,113
So, she says...

141
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,113
Oh, no, I'm not going inside!

142
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:40,713
Don't worry about it! They're all only props after all!

143
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:45,313
But you were shocked a while ago too, weren't you, Sonoko?

144
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:48,613
That was just because I was taken by surprise.

145
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,613
That's what a haunted house is all about, isn't it?

146
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:53,213
Ran! Being the way you are,

147
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:56,813
you won't be able to tell Shinichi that you like him forever!

148
00:08:58,313 --> 00:08:59,813
That's why you see!

149
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,713
Do it to conjure up some guts in you!

150
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:03,613
If you clear this, no doubt you'll step up

151
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:06,813
to becoming a woman stronger than you are now!

152
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:10,313
You think so?

153
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:18,813
That's totally out of this world.

154
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:20,913
You can say that again.

155
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:22,613
See.

156
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,413
It's looks like fun.

157
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,113
It doesn't look like fun at all!

158
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:30,213
If you're that scared, I can escort you inside.

159
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:33,213
After all, he knows where what gadgets are set.

160
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:36,013
Okay, please do!

161
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,113
Then, she'll go inside too!

162
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:40,013
Hey, Sonoko!

163
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,713
Don't worry!

164
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:43,713
It's only the beginning that's really scary!

165
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,513
Gosh...

166
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,613
"Entrance"

167
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:17,913
Hey, this is just the beginning.

168
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:20,313
Don't get lost, sonny!

169
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:22,513
How the heck can I get lost?

170
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:25,213
I'm being carried right through.

171
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:30,513
Well, it's pretty well made for a school festival haunted house.

172
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,813
It's of bad taste, though.

173
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:38,013
I'd like to have shown this to Hashiguchi too.

174
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,313
Yeah. After all, Hashiguchi's the one

175
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:44,613
who planned this graduation project haunted house

176
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,613
and the movie too!

177
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:49,913
Did that person quit school?

178
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:52,313
No.

179
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:55,913
He committed suicide by drinking poison.

180
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:57,813
It was only a month ago.

181
00:10:57,813 --> 00:10:59,113
What?

182
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:00,713
It seems that he was told by the doctor

183
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:02,713
that he had an incurable disease

184
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,913
and that he had only six months more to live.

185
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:07,513
He took it heavily and took his own life.

186
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,413
It was written in his suicide note.

187
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,713
Moreover, the ones who found his body are

188
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:18,013
we two, and Mutsumi and Anna who were just here a while ago.

189
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:22,413
I was haunted by nightmares for a while.

190
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,513
It was after his death,

191
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:25,613
that Anna started to get all worked up saying

192
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,713
she was going to offer it to Hashiguchi

193
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:30,813
and started really getting carried away with making the movie.

194
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:33,213
Isn't that right, Tsujiei?

195
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:34,913
Tsujiei?

196
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:36,813
Hey.

197
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:38,713
Where'd he disappear to?

198
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:42,113
He was here till a while ago, wasn't he?

199
00:11:42,113 --> 00:11:45,813
I'll go look for him around here, so you guys go outside!

200
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:48,513
The exit is right up ahead!

201
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:50,813
What?

202
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:55,013
Straight up ahead.

203
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:58,213
It's so dark that you can hardly see anything.

204
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:03,513
There seems to be a surgery room.

205
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,713
Excuse me.

206
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:12,813
Wow.

207
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:15,113
It looks like a real surgery is being performed.

208
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:17,713
The patient is Anna that we saw a while ago.

209
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:21,113
The doctors performing the surgery are all mannequins.

210
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:25,513
There's the exit.

211
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,313
I guess we can't go outside

212
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:30,313
unless we pass by the pillow of the bed.

213
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:31,913
Yes.

214
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:05,513
There's nothing to be so surprised about, is there?

215
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:08,113
Ladies.

216
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:13,013
That's right.

217
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:17,213
These are just props.

218
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:19,813
See!

219
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:22,313
You guys are too exaggeratedly terrified!

220
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,013
But, Anna's strange.

221
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:31,413
Yeah. Every time after she ejects blood,

222
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:35,613
she gets up, opens her eyes wide and laughs.

223
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:40,513
Hey, Anna. Let's not get lazy!

224
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:44,313
Weren't you going to show us your awesome death sight?

225
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:48,013
Hey. Come on, say something! Anna!

226
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:53,113
Hey. She doesn't seem to be breathing?

227
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,413
Hey, Anna?

228
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,213
Get a hold of yourself, Anna?

229
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:58,513
Anna?

230
00:13:58,513 --> 00:14:00,613
What? Is something wrong?

231
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:03,413
The inside of her mouth smells like almonds.

232
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:06,113
Hey, Anna? Answer me, Anna?

233
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:07,313
Get out of the way!

234
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,013
I'll take Anna to the hospital.

235
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:12,413
Don't touch her!

236
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:15,113
There is smell of almond from inside her mouth!

237
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:18,413
She could've drank potassium cyanide poison!

238
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:19,913
Poison?

239
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:21,813
The smell of almond?

240
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:24,313
-Really? -Amateurs shouldn't smell it!

241
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,313
The almond smell is caused by the poison

242
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:28,213
that was drunk combining with stomach acids and stuff,

243
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,613
resulting in the smell of cyanide gas!

244
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,613
If you mistakenly sniff it in, you'll die!

245
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:35,713
I mean, I saw it on a police drama.

246
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:39,713
The almond smell is not the familiar one of the almond

247
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,513
that is usually sweet and aromatic,

248
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:45,113
but rather, the sweet sour smell of the almond fruit

249
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:46,813
and flower before harvest.

250
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:48,513
Oh.

251
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,713
But, from what it looks like now, Anna's...

252
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,613
committed suicide.

253
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,571
"Screaming Hospital"

254
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:00,371
Suicide?

255
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:04,471
Did she drink the poison in front of you all?

256
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,671
Yes, probably...

257
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:09,871
What is her name?

258
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:11,771
Beika University, Senior of

259
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:15,071
the Literature Department of Performing Fine Arts, Ms. Anna Tadami.

260
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:17,371
Is that correct?

261
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:18,971
Yeah.

262
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:22,371
Oh, well... because of her monster make-up,

263
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:25,171
the picture of her student ID that we found in her belongings

264
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:27,471
seemed so very different.

265
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:28,471
And?

266
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:30,071
What is your testimony

267
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:32,371
that Ms. Anna Tadami committed suicide based on?

268
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:34,671
She suddenly started to suffer!

269
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:37,571
We followed the guide board here...

270
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:41,471
And passed through the pillow of the bed like this.

271
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,771
Her body suddenly went into convulsion.

272
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:54,471
She was struggling kicking her legs up and down.

273
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,171
So much that the bed started shaking

274
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,671
making rattling sounds too!

275
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:04,071
Then, right after that blood gushed out of her stomach...

276
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,271
Blood?

277
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:08,471
Hey, wasn't the cause of her death toxication?

278
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:09,871
Oh, yes.

279
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,271
But since the coroner hasn't arrived yet,

280
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,471
we can't say for sure.

281
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:17,171
There is an almond smell coming from her mouth

282
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:19,071
and there is something that looks like a capsule

283
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:20,771
stuck between her teeth too.

284
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,671
She probably took poison.

285
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:24,771
The blood oozing out is done by a gadget.

286
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:26,271
A gadget?

287
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:29,471
There is a switch inside the bed.

288
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,471
And when you push it...

289
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:36,971
-Hey. -Oh, it splattered on you?

290
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:39,071
It usually flies over there!

291
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:42,171
But it's water based, so it'll wash off right away.

292
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,371
Then, was the bed shaking also done with a gadget?

293
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,071
Yes. It's a gadget alright but...

294
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:51,071
the top right leg of this bed

295
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:53,671
and the lower left leg that is diagonal to it,

296
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:56,571
is slightly short,

297
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,371
so when the person playing the patient

298
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:00,371
shakes the bed with his body,

299
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:04,471
the bed will sways.

300
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:07,471
If so, did she kick her legs up and down

301
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:09,271
-using some device too? -No.

302
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:14,171
That could've only been done by the person on the bed!

303
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:15,971
Oh, wait.

304
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:17,671
See, like so!

305
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:20,671
There's nothing here except for the gadget to eject blood!

306
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:24,371
Please do not touch things at the site without permission!

307
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:25,571
Right, right!

308
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,571
Those legs with red pedicure on them!

309
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:31,671
When kicked her legs up and down, they came into view, right?

310
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,971
Yes, the covers that were on her flipped up

311
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,371
and her right foot came into view.

312
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:41,171
I see. It seems to be true that

313
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:43,671
she drank the poison when Ran and Sonoko passed by her bed.

314
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:47,871
There was nobody around her at that time, was there?

315
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,171
Especially near her face.

316
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:54,071
Yes, it was dark, but I think only we were there.

317
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:55,971
If anyone made her drink poison,

318
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,571
I think we would've been able to see it.

319
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:00,671
By the way, when she started to suffer,

320
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,871
where were you both?

321
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:04,771
Us?

322
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:07,871
I was approaching the two girls secretly

323
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,871
wearing this on my chest.

324
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,971
I was with those children right through

325
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:14,671
as they're escort through this haunted house but...

326
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:16,471
I deliberately pulled away from them a while

327
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,471
to wear this simple item

328
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:20,771
to scare the girls in the operation room

329
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:23,271
as I talked over with Hacchiya.

330
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,171
Well, but after we separated,

331
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,271
I was doing different things from Tsujie.

332
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:29,871
Then, what about you?

333
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:33,071
I was in the X-Ray room next door.

334
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:38,171
I was waiting for people to come right through.

335
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:40,371
I see.

336
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:42,971
But, I heard a scream and despite it, no one came,

337
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,271
so I got anxious and...

338
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:46,371
Anxious?

339
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:47,771
Because...

340
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:49,771
In order to get out of here,

341
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:51,571
you have to first go through the operation room

342
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:53,571
and later pass through the X-ray room.

343
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:56,771
I came here to check things out, wondering what happened.

344
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:58,671
And saw that Anna... Anna...

345
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,971
Hey, Mutsumi, look at yourself!

346
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:04,171
Your make-up is all smeared with tears!

347
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:06,671
But, Anna died, you know!

348
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:08,671
I can't see how you can be so calm!

349
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,971
Of course we're not calm.

350
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:14,371
I feel the same way I felt when Hashiguchi committed suicide.

351
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:15,771
Suicide?

352
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,771
If you're officers, you already know, don't you?

353
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,671
The case about the Beika University Senior

354
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:20,671
who committed suicide

355
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:23,771
drinking poison in his apartment, a month ago.

356
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:25,771
Yeah. If I remember correctly,

357
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:28,171
it's the case where a classmate of his who coincidentally

358
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:30,671
dropped by found his body.

359
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:35,071
The classmates were me, Tsujiei, Mutsumi and

360
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:37,571
Anna, over here.

361
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:40,871
Hashiguchi was really into producing

362
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:43,271
the graduation project movie and yet...

363
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:46,471
He didn't come to class for a whole week.

364
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,271
We got worried and decided to

365
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,771
drop into his place after school one day.

366
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:57,571
But, there was no answer when we pushed the door bell.

367
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,971
So, we thought he was either asleep or out somewhere.

368
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:02,771
Therefore, we were talking about coming back some other time.

369
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,471
Anna suddenly...

370
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,571
I sense something is wrong!

371
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:10,071
Let's go ask the manager to open the door to the room!

372
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:12,371
And, so we got inside.

373
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:16,471
And found Mr. Hashiguchi who had poisoned himself to death?

374
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:18,871
Yes. In the suicide note that was written

375
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:20,171
in his handwriting that was left in the room,

376
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:22,171
the following was written.

377
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,871
I haven't been feeling well recently,

378
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,771
and was examined by a doctor.

379
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,971
I was told that I had osteogenic sarcoma that was pretty far gone,

380
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:30,271
and have only about six months to live.

381
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,571
I'll leave the rest to you

382
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:37,771
and cross over to the world beyond a step ahead of you both.

383
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:41,071
We heard from the officer later that

384
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:42,571
he died that day around the time

385
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:46,671
when we all took the seminar together.

386
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:50,471
It was from about that time that Anna changed, right?

387
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,571
Yeah. She suddenly said that she's going to make a tribute to Hashiguchi,

388
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:55,271
and started really working on the graduation project movie production

389
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,671
and putting her all into this haunted house too.

390
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,171
But, isn't it normal to want to carry things out

391
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,171
for the sake of a friend that had died?

392
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:05,171
But, she wasn't all that normal!

393
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:07,971
There was a time when she overdosed on sleeping pills

394
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:09,871
and was taken to the hospital too.

395
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:10,971
Her reason for this was that

396
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:13,171
she wanted to experience the in between of life and death

397
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,171
to use it as a realistic reference

398
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:16,171
for how she should play the role of being dead.

399
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:17,471
Am I correct?

400
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,571
Yeah. I thought that she was being quite reticent one day,

401
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,771
and found out that she had nails in her mouth one whole day.

402
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:25,571
Nails?

403
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:28,071
Maybe Anna

404
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:31,471
put the poison that was in the capsule into her mouth.

405
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:33,871
I see! Like she did the nails!

406
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:36,771
Then, she bit it accidentally.

407
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:38,971
And before she could experience what it's like to be

408
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:40,371
in between life and death,

409
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:42,771
she really ended up dead.

410
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:46,771
So, should we deem that she did commit suicide after all?

411
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:49,771
I wonder if it's really so?

412
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:53,871
Conan?

413
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:58,371
Because look at the cheek of that lady.

414
00:21:58,371 --> 00:21:59,371
It's not make-up

415
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:02,071
but looks like she's really been scratched

416
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,771
and it looks like she's bleeding a bit too!

417
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:08,571
I think that somebody tried to cover her mouth

418
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:12,771
so she tried to pull away and ended up scratching herself.

419
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:15,371
What?

420
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:18,871
Inspector! Skin and blood were found in between her nails.

421
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,171
What?

422
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:24,471
This is a homicide made to look like suicide!

423
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:27,271
Who on earth poisoned Anna in the dark

424
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:29,671
and killed her?

425
00:23:53,971 --> 00:23:57,071
Mutsumi, you're the culprit!

426
00:23:57,071 --> 00:24:01,171
Then, Mr. Kiichi Hachiya, you're the culprit!

427
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:04,371
Mr. Tsujiei, you've been playing with you feet from a while ago!

428
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:07,371
I'll bet you're doing that because you feel guilty?

429
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:11,571
There's a red line.

430
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,871
Anna was already poisoned to death

431
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,771
by one of her friends.

432
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,271
Next Conan,

433
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:23,271
"Screaming Operating Room (Part 2)"
