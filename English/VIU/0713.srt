1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:04,741
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:08,206
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:11,406
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:13,906
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,406
They take a family picture

6
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:19,906
with the owner of the mansion not present.

7
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:22,806
But in the picture, they see the eerie image of the owner

8
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:24,206
who was not there.

9
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:27,606
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:30,006
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:31,706
A new turn for the growing mystery.

12
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:33,806
The bottomless Dracula case.

13
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,306
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:37,406
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:39,806
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:25,929
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Two)"

17
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,099
Hey, what's this?

18
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,599
It looks like a psychic picture?

19
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,499
Why is Hakuya who wasn't here back then

20
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,499
right here in the center of the picture?

21
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:35,899
Beats me.

22
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:38,099
I have no idea why either.

23
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,699
Don't tell me that you schemed a trick or something

24
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,199
when you developed it?

25
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,899
Idiot! How do you think I can use tricks like this

26
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,299
with an analogue film in such a short time?

27
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:48,799
Then, are you saying that

28
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,299
Hakuya turned into a vampire just like rumor has it?

29
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,699
Don't be ridiculous!

30
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:57,599
Vampires only exist in horror movies and novels!

31
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,499
The fact that he vanished from the coffin

32
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,299
as well as that psychic picture

33
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,999
are all something that Hakuya made up!

34
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,299
I don't think so.

35
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,999
Because he's in the picture in the position

36
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,899
that Kazuha and Ran had said he was.

37
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,599
I think it's for sure that

38
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,099
they saw the owner in that position back then.

39
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,499
What?

40
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:18,599
At any rate, I think it's best to find the owner

41
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,999
as soon as possible

42
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,299
and have him explain what's going on.

43
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,699
Yeah.

44
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,999
True.

45
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,099
Oh, will you please lend that picture to me?

46
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,299
We'll go check with Ran and Kazuha who are in the kitchen

47
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,699
whether that's really what they saw.

48
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:40,899
But they're both not here.

49
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:43,699
The other chefs are gone too.

50
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:48,299
I think they're eating their meals in another room at this time.

51
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,099
We maids actually eat with them too but...

52
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,799
We missed eating since we were looking for the owner.

53
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,499
If I remember correctly, you said

54
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:02,399
you were brought here with the fiance of the owner, right?

55
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,699
Oh, yes.

56
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,099
How'd your mother pass away?

57
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,899
I heard it was from an unfortunate accident.

58
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,699
Back then I was sickly and hospitalized

59
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,999
in the owner's hospital so I don't know the details.

60
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:18,499
You mean the owner ran a hospital?

61
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:23,499
Yes. He was the head of the Torakura General Hospital.

62
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:26,199
He was a very kind man

63
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,899
and paid for all my hospital and surgery fees.

64
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,199
Which means you're working as a maid here for the owner?

65
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,299
Right!

66
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:37,799
I'm taking care of the owner

67
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,599
who my mother was supposed to get married to.

68
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,099
Well, actually, six months ago,

69
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,299
I was contacted by the owner saying that

70
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,499
they got an opening for a maid so why don't I come.

71
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:50,099
All I did was accept his offer, you see.

72
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,499
Oh.

73
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,299
That's why I'm still not used to this mansion.

74
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,599
The owner told me to come this morning too

75
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,699
but I didn't know which room to go to.

76
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,899
So, I ended up standing him up.

77
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,399
Then, I guess the owner will scold you when he's found.

78
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,299
I'll be fine!

79
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:10,499
I never got scolded after coming here.

80
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:12,499
The others are complaining that he's really strict about

81
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:15,099
the way the place is cleaned and stuff, though.

82
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,999
I don't think so.

83
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,699
Look at this floor.

84
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,899
There's something powdery sprinkled all over.

85
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:28,599
Those kids probably did it.

86
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,899
I told them that I had no dough to make wrappers for pot sticks,

87
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,499
then they told me that they'd make it themselves

88
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,399
and were asking me where the flour was.

89
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,099
I'll bet they were rushing and spilled it.

90
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,299
The dough for the wrappers are covered with Saran wrap

91
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,899
and left there, see?

92
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,699
Pot sticks equal garlic, so...

93
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,499
But, I wonder what this thick space is?

94
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:48,499
Huh?

95
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:53,099
See? Flour is gone for about a width of 50cm.

96
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,499
Like something was dragged along.

97
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,399
Now that you mentioned it.

98
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,199
I told them that the bag of garlic

99
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,699
that I bought some time ago may be in the storeroom.

100
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:06,899
If they dragged that bag inside here,

101
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,699
then those girls should be here.

102
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,199
I found it, Ran!! It's garlic!

103
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,599
Wow, that plenty!

104
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:18,199
No good...

105
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,599
It's got roots and shoots sprouting out of it.

106
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,099
No problem!

107
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,199
It won't taste as good,

108
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,899
but if we remove them, it'll be edible!

109
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,999
More than that, I wonder if just garlic will do the job?

110
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,099
We've got this too, so I assure you.

111
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,299
A cross?

112
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,099
Right! It's formidable

113
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,199
because I made it using a silver knife and spoon!

114
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,299
Don't they say these things don't work

115
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,799
unless you're a firm believer of Christianity?

116
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:46,299
Don't worry! You celebrate Christmas too, don't you, Ran?

117
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:49,699
You're celebrating Christ's birthday every year,

118
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,299
so of course it'll work!

119
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,499
Yep.

120
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,499
I guess so.

121
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,999
What? Blood type AB?

122
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,699
Are you saying that the blood on the coffin

123
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,899
was really blood type AB?

124
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,399
Yeah.

125
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,799
Thanks to Mr. Mouri's help,

126
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:08,899
we got the Gunma Prefectural Police Department to check it.

127
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,799
We were told it was with no doubt blood type AB.

128
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,299
But, when we asked the people here in this mansion

129
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,599
the blood type of the owner...

130
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,899
He's blood type A.

131
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,099
When the owner was still young, and was badly wounded.

132
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:29,199
I remember that they used the blood of all of who were blood type A.

133
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,599
Then, who's blood is that supposed to be, anyway?

134
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,299
I think that the only person with type AB blood

135
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:35,099
that is involved with this mansion

136
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,199
was the maid Ms. Shimizu who died six months ago.

137
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,899
What?

138
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,699
Why's the blood of a person who died six months ago

139
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,999
on that coffin?

140
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:50,499
Don't tell me that Hakuya had been saving her blood

141
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,399
and sipping in the coffin.

142
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,799
More than that, I think that

143
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,899
you should check that blood a bit more carefully.

144
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,399
Like for DNA.

145
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,399
And? How much more time will it take for the tunnel

146
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,599
to be repaired?

147
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,799
Oh, they say they'd like to have it back to normal by morning.

148
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,699
If anything happens to my daughter during that time,

149
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,699
you're going to get it!

150
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,399
Don't worry about that, rest assured!

151
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,999
Those two are into making pot sticks.

152
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:19,599
Uh, was the owner found?

153
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,799
No.

154
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:24,199
We've looked all over for him till there's nowhere else to look.

155
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,099
Did Asanobu say anything about it?

156
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,699
He says he tried calling Hakuya many times,

157
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,199
but all he gets is the answer phone.

158
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,799
And? Where is he now?

159
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,499
I guess he's taking a puff in the smoking room.

160
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:42,499
Maybe Hakuya left his cell phone somewhere.

161
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:48,699
What?

162
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:50,499
I got mail.

163
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,299
It's from Hakuya.

164
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,799
It says I'm going to give you my answer from now,

165
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,899
so gather in the dining room.

166
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,599
Which means that he sent this mail to all of us at the same time?

167
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,399
Mailed at once?

168
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:14,399
The owner hasn't shown up yet, after all.

169
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,299
It looks like it's going to rain.

170
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,099
Uh, aren't you worried?

171
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:24,099
Kamiyo hasn't been found yet, has she?

172
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:26,099
Honey's capricious,

173
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,099
and goes off just like that whenever she feels like it.

174
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,599
You've got to have a strong grip on her.

175
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,899
You're lucky to have gotten hold of someone so rich, you know.

176
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,799
Well, if she gets sick of me,

177
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,399
I'll just get back together with you my ex.

178
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,799
How long's Asanobu planning to smoke?

179
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,599
Don't tell me that

180
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,599
maybe he didn't receive Hakuya's mail

181
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,399
because he changed his cell phone.

182
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,199
What?

183
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,099
I just saw a strange shadow on the window.

184
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:56,499
A strange shadow?

185
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,899
Don't tell me that Hakuya really...

186
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,999
Turned into a vampire...

187
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,499
That's not possible.

188
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,899
I'm sure he just used a rope or something.

189
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,999
To hang himself upside down. I'm telling you!

190
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:19,499
No joke?

191
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,499
He disappeared above.

192
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:24,199
It can't be. That's not humanly possible!

193
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,499
Hey, look at that.

194
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,299
Hey, Hattori.

195
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,899
What's that?

196
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,399
Is... isn't it a bird?

197
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,099
But isn't it too large to be a bird?

198
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,899
Kudo? You're bleeding!

199
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,299
Don't tell me it bit you?

200
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,799
Just what're you talking about?

201
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,999
I just got a bit wet in the rain.

202
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,999
It's not rain.

203
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:58,299
Blood's dripping from the roof!

204
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,899
Above here! Is there are room?

205
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,099
Yes.

206
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:04,199
The smoking room's in the attic.

207
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:06,699
What about the smoking room?

208
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,799
Blood's probably dripping from there!

209
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,799
No way...

210
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,299
If I remember correctly, Asanobu's there.

211
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,299
No good.

212
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:27,199
His carotid artery's been cut and his already dead.

213
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:30,799
He's holding the knife.

214
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,099
Which means...

215
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:37,399
Somebody tried to attack him so he killed himself.

216
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,799
Or...

217
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,299
That somebody wanted to make it look that way.

218
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,999
It's one or the other.

219
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:54,723
Dear?

220
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:58,823
God, I'd better hurry and find honey fast too, or else...

221
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:04,123
True, maybe Kamiyo's already been taken away

222
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,323
by Hakuya who's turned into a vampire

223
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:10,291
as legend has it and is being impaled.

224
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,270
Hey.

225
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,870
Excuse me.

226
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,770
Won't you please tell us about it?

227
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,670
About that legend!

228
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,070
It was around the Edo Era.

229
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,070
When the, feudal lord, ancestor of the Torakura family

230
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,270
used to rule this area.

231
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,770
Rumor started going around that blessed with no children,

232
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,170
he would have to give his inheritance over to his younger brother.

233
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,870
Then suddenly, he invited

234
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,470
a beautiful woman as his mistress to the castle.

235
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,170
After a while, she happily ended up

236
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,370
giving birth to an heir, however...

237
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,870
One stormy night, an incident occurred.

238
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,170
An incident?

239
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,870
That woman seems to have fallen off the cliff,

240
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,670
and was found dead with a branch

241
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,070
pierced through her chest.

242
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,470
The lord who was suspicious,

243
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,070
tortured the people who were close to the mistress

244
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,070
with torture devices he asked to be sent from the Western world.

245
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,170
Then, the truth came to light.

246
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,370
The mistress seems to have been told by her brother-in-law

247
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,370
that the young inheritor had gone to the forest and not returned,

248
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,070
in order to lure her into the forest.

249
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,870
The lord who was angered is said to have impaled

250
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,070
his younger brother as well as all those who helped him

251
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,370
in the same way as his mistress was found.

252
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,070
And lined them up in the forest.

253
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:37,370
Since then, this lord became better known as "Lord Impaler".

254
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,170
Oh. But it's not like he was a vampire or anything, right?

255
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,970
Don't you know?

256
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,470
About Vlad III of Wallachia, who Dracula was modeled

257
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,970
after that impaled traitors and rebels one after the other

258
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,070
was called "Lord Impaler."

259
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,070
Oh, really?

260
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,270
Yeah. The father of Vlad III was Lord Dragon.

261
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,370
Therefore, he was called Dracul.

262
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,370
It seems that he called himself Dracula

263
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,470
because he was that Lord's son.

264
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,770
While we're at it,

265
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,170
would you like to take a look at the European room?

266
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,270
European room?

267
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,570
I see.

268
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,770
So, the torture devices that the Lord had bought

269
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,670
and sent over from Europe are stored here, eh?

270
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,370
A guillotine's here too.

271
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,670
I see! It was this room!

272
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,670
Huh?

273
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,570
See, the owner called me this morning.

274
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,970
But I didn't know where this European room was.

275
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,370
You could've just asked somebody, right?

276
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,670
But, he told me to come to the European room

277
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,270
without telling anyone.

278
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,870
He cautioned me not to tell the butler in particular.

279
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,970
I guess when you were searching for the owner,

280
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,870
you looked in this room too?

281
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,970
Oh.

282
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,370
I passed, because it gives me the creeps.

283
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,670
Lord Impaler, this torture room and that flying monster.

284
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,870
I could never tell Ran and Kazuha about it.

285
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,870
Done! The pot sticks are ready.

286
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,170
We've made a lot!

287
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,270
All we need to do now is cook them.

288
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,470
We've got to let Conan and Heiji taste them too.

289
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,770
Right!

290
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,270
Oh, well...

291
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:30,370
I just came to tell you to be careful when you use the stove.

292
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,170
-Oh. Yes, sir. -Okay!

293
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,770
Okay, I'll leave it to you girls, then.

294
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,370
Don't you have to tell them?

295
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,670
That there's been a murder.

296
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,670
Ignorance is bliss for the two girls.

297
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,870
True.

298
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,170
Listen, everybody!

299
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,070
All of you four make sure that

300
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,370
you don't leave this dining room until I return!

301
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,670
But, I've got to look for honey.

302
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,170
The butler and I will go look for her.

303
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,070
Call me if something comes up, okay, Hikaru?

304
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,570
Yep.

305
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,370
I hope you told all the other maids and chefs

306
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,470
to stay in their rooms?

307
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,470
Yes. But, you dealing with a vampire.

308
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,170
Is it really okay just us, doing this on our own?

309
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,470
Idiot. There're no such things as vampires in this world!

310
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,670
We're going to search for evidence to prove so from now!

311
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,070
First of all, let's check this coffin.

312
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,370
I'll bet it's rigged in some way.

313
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,270
Besides, this room.

314
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,870
It somehow seems different from when we first came, no?

315
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,070
But, the carpet, desk and the sofa are all in place.

316
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,270
Right.

317
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,070
Talking of coffins during the incident that happened six months ago,

318
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,570
it seems the master asked the chef to wake him up.

319
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,070
It's only right to ask a maid or butler

320
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,970
to do something like that, isn't it?

321
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,970
In my case, I think it's because I wasn't trusted.

322
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,670
Because each time I tried to stop the owner from his weird actions,

323
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,570
he used to give me an unpleasant, suspicious look.

324
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,870
Hey! Look at this!

325
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,570
There are two slits in the carpet.

326
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,370
Which means if I pull here

327
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,970
and remove just this width

328
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,570
and join the remaining parts together...

329
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,770
The carpet will get small!

330
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,270
What?

331
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,670
In other words!

332
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,070
The position that the coffin was in when we first saw it

333
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,370
was more towards the center of the room.

334
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,670
Huh?

335
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,370
A handle on the tile.

336
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,670
I see. So, this is how it was rigged.

337
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,570
And, next.

338
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,070
For that psychic picture.

339
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,170
I more or less have an idea.

340
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,170
Just as I thought.

341
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,070
Hey. Did you always take pictures facing your back to the wall?

342
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,270
Yes. The chairs were also placed in that position.

343
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,670
Only this time it seems that the two girls pushed the shutter.

344
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:10,570
But the fact is that the owner had asked the maid Hikaru to do it.

345
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,770
-Huh? -Why?

346
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,770
I wonder.

347
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,870
Ms. Shimizu, who passed away six months ago,

348
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,470
used to do it before.

349
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,070
I thought he just figured that

350
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,470
it was her duty to take after that role.

351
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,870
Well, that maid seems to have been favored by the owner.

352
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,870
Huh?

353
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,770
Hikaru told us!

354
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,770
That the owner was very kind to her

355
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,670
and that she never was scolded.

356
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,970
What a thing to say!

357
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,470
All he used to do recently was talk ill of her.

358
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,570
But, she was invited to come to this mansion by him, wasn't she?

359
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,970
No way!

360
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,770
The owner told me that she used her status

361
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,370
as the daughter of his former fiance

362
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,970
and begged in tears for him to hire her.

363
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,070
Well, since she's a quite cheerful girl,

364
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,070
the maids and chefs seem to take well to her.

365
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,070
Maybe she came to this mansion pursuing something, after all.

366
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,470
Pursuing something?

367
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,270
Have you heard about her mother Yoko from her?

368
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,570
Yeah, that she died of an unfortunate accident.

369
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,270
She died on a stormy night.

370
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,070
Yoko suddenly said that

371
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,170
she was going to go to the owner's hospital by car.

372
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,770
I stopped her saying that it was dangerous but...

373
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,370
just as I had worried, she fell over the cliff car and all

374
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,370
while driving along the mountain road.

375
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,570
The police said that it was a driving accident but...

376
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,970
But, why did she go out on a day like that?

377
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,970
Just before she left, I got a call from the owner

378
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,670
to relay to Yoko that her daughter's surgery went well.

379
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,370
That's why the maid, Ms. Shimizu was saying that

380
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,270
she probably wanted to see her as soon as she possibly could.

381
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,670
Yoko back then looked pale, and didn't look to me that way at all.

382
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,570
Why did Ms. Shimizu say something like that?

383
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,170
Because I told her to relay the message

384
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,870
that I got from the owner to Yoko.

385
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,270
Was the car Yoko's?

386
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,170
No. It was Asanobu's, who died a while ago.

387
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:27,070
Everyone was here at this mansion back then.

388
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,970
Everyone? Which means the others were here too?

389
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,770
Yes.

390
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,770
Everyone who is here today, were all here.

391
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,070
So if that accident

392
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,770
were to have been schemed by someone as rumor has it...

393
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,370
Does Hikaru know of this?

394
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,470
I wonder.

395
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,570
The owner told me not to say anything.

396
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,870
Because he would tell her himself.

397
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,670
Huh?

398
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,670
Hikaru was summoned by the owner this morning

399
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,470
but said she didn't get to see him.

400
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,670
If that was a lie and in fact she did get to see him...

401
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,270
Where's Hikaru?

402
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,670
She's gone!

403
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,770
She said she was going to serve tea.

404
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,570
And went to the kitchen.

405
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,770
To the kitchen?

406
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,070
By the way, aren't the police here yet?

407
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,770
You did call them, right?

408
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:23,670
Yes, but they said the tunnel would take until morning to fix.

409
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,070
Did you find my honey yet?

410
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,770
Not yet.

411
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,870
I'm getting a bit hungry too.

412
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,870
Maybe I'll go take a bite of the pot sticks

413
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,970
that those two girls made.

414
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,170
How do you know that Ran and Kazuha

415
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,570
are making the pot sticks?

416
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,070
They came here a while ago.

417
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,970
To borrow the key to the freezer from Hikaru.

418
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,570
They said they made too many

419
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,670
so that they wanted to freeze some.

420
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,270
Come to think of it, after they came to borrow the key,

421
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,070
Hikaru also went to the kitchen.

422
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,570
Right, there's still one place left.

423
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,070
That we haven't searched.

424
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,570
The freezer.

425
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,270
Don't tell me that inside the freezer.

426
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,270
No good. This isn't the right key either.

427
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,670
I wish they'd put labels showing which key is for what.

428
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,070
Well, we'll get to it in time.

429
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,370
True.

430
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,870
We'll overcome with garlic power!

431
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,570
I just got word from the gate guard.

432
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,970
That someone was found dead in the forest in front of the mansion.

433
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,670
What?

434
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,170
You're not police detectives, are you?

435
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,370
But, if you're detectives, are you training under Detective Mouri?

436
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,470
Huh? Why should I train under that goofy?

437
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,370
Next Conan,

438
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,270
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Three)"

439
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,270
Next Conan's Hint:

440
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,270
"Stake"

441
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,970
This case looks pretty bad.

442
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,770
Yeah, it sucks...

443
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,970
blood!
