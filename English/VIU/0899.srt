1
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:08,463
Mifuyu, good morning.

2
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:12,163
"Ayano Saeki (25)"

3
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:15,263
"Morita" -Tabata, what are you doing?

4
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,364
Please stop, Tabata!

5
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:22,863
Mifuyu! What's wrong, Mifuyu?

6
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,764
Are you okay? Mifuyu!

7
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:27,964
Mifuyu.

8
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:39,064
Mifuyu!

9
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:50,363
Mifuyu!

10
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:52,763
Mifuyu, hang in there!

11
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:55,463
Tabata.

12
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:58,363
Tabata? Did Tabata stab you?

13
00:00:58,364 --> 00:01:01,063
Run...

14
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:03,764
Tabata is still...

15
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:08,963
Mifuyu! Hang in there, Mifuyu!

16
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:10,564
Mifuyu!

17
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:21,163
Run...

18
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,264
Tabata is still...

19
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,963
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

20
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,863
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

21
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:41,863
A murder occurs in a woman's apartment!

22
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,763
What on earth happened in there?

23
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:45,563
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,663
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:50,064
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:35,923
"The Real Perp's Scream"

27
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:38,822
It stopped raining.

28
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:39,922
Yeah.

29
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:43,122
Anyway, I wanted to get lunch at Cafe Poirot.

30
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,923
I can't believe they were closed.

31
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:48,723
Kid, is there anything you want to...

32
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,722
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:56,322
Miss, why are you in such a hurry?

34
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:57,822
You look pale, too.

35
00:03:57,823 --> 00:03:59,523
Are you not feeling well?

36
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:04,123
Is that blood on your right shoulder?

37
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:06,822
Actually,

38
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:10,022
Mifuyu, my friend, was stabbed by her boyfriend!

39
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:11,123
What?

40
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,122
This is her apartment.

41
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,122
Wait!

42
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:22,123
The perp might still be inside.

43
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:28,723
Hey. Is anyone there?

44
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:33,423
Stay here.

45
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:48,122
Miss, come in.

46
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:49,323
Okay.

47
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:52,922
Why?

48
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:57,222
Is this really where your friend was stabbed in the chest and died?

49
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,822
It's true! It really...

50
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:01,322
Pops.

51
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,422
Do you think this knife is the weapon?

52
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:05,522
There's blood on it.

53
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,622
And over here...

54
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:11,622
there are footprints leading in from and out to the balcony.

55
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:16,223
But a body can't just disappear on its own.

56
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,323
What's going on?

57
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,522
Are you certain the deceased

58
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:29,322
is the resident of this apartment, Mifuyu Morita?

59
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:30,422
Yes.

60
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:32,922
How do you know Ms. Mifuyu?

61
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:36,522
We worked together at the bakery by the station.

62
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:39,722
Today, Mifuyu invited me to hang out.

63
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,822
When I came at the time we agreed upon...

64
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:45,522
She heard the window break and someone scream,

65
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:47,922
"Please stop, Tabata!"

66
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:50,822
So Ayano, who had been told where the spare key was hidden,

67
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:53,622
unlocked and entered the apartment,

68
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:56,122
where she saw Mifuyu with a knife in her chest,

69
00:05:56,123 --> 00:06:01,423
who said, "Watch out! Run!" and died.

70
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:06,122
I heard a noise from the balcony.

71
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:09,823
I was scared, so I ran.

72
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:15,622
So the perp was still hiding on the balcony then.

73
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:18,222
Who is Tabata?

74
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:21,022
The man Mifuyu was dating.

75
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:24,322
Is this him?

76
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:25,822
Yes, that's him.

77
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:28,222
That's Mifuyu and Tabata.

78
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:31,423
They met about three months ago.

79
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:37,022
Someday I'd like to open a bakery cafe in Paris.

80
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:40,922
"Atsushi Tabata (35)" -Really? What a wonderful dream.

81
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:42,022
Yeah.

82
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:45,222
"Mifuyu Morita (25)" -I'm working hard to save money so I can do that.

83
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:48,322
I can provide a little help.

84
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:50,523
Are you sure, Tabata?

85
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:55,322
We're dating, aren't we?

86
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,623
Tabata...

87
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:00,122
But shortly after that,

88
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:02,422
he said he was having trouble with a client

89
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,123
and needed money urgently.

90
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:09,522
Sounds like a typical romance scam.

91
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:12,622
Did Mifuyu give him money?

92
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:15,422
Yes, about 10 million yen.

93
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,523
-10 million yen? -10 million yen?

94
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:22,322
But Tabata, not realizing I was Mifuyu's friend,

95
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:25,522
tried to approach me with the same story.

96
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:28,622
When I told Mifuyu about it, she said she would sue him.

97
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:32,122
So Tabata came to silence her.

98
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:34,022
Also, Ayano,

99
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:39,222
the blood on the knife and floor were type B.

100
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:42,422
Do you know Mifuyu's blood type?

101
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:44,723
Yes. It's type B.

102
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:48,122
One more thing,

103
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:52,522
we found this piece of paper in the trash can here.

104
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:55,422
Do these numbers mean anything to you?

105
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:58,222
I don't know.

106
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:00,123
293?

107
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:11,123
It wouldn't be impossible to enter and exit from this height.

108
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:15,723
What's this?

109
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,722
Hey! Quit wandering around!

110
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:31,622
Sorry.

111
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:33,422
-Huh? -Is something wrong?

112
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,622
Her suitcase is missing.

113
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:39,622
She always kept a large suitcase in there.

114
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:40,822
That's it!

115
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:43,822
Tabata used that suitcase.

116
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,222
This is what happened, Inspector.

117
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:49,122
Tabata entered the room from the balcony by breaking the window

118
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:52,222
and murdered Mifuyu by stabbing her with a knife.

119
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,522
However, before he could move the body,

120
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:56,722
Ayano arrived.

121
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:58,422
So he hid on the balcony

122
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:00,722
and while Ayano was gone,

123
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:04,422
he put the body in the suitcase and took it away.

124
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:05,822
I see.

125
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,822
Canvas the area to see

126
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:11,822
if anyone saw a suspicious man carrying a suitcase.

127
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,922
Let's go to Tabata's house.

128
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:14,923
Yes, sir.

129
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,822
Hello, Inspector.

130
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,022
Hello.

131
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:30,922
This is Atsushi Tabata's house?

132
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,022
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:33,023
Inspector!

134
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,023
There are footprints here.

135
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:41,722
They seem to be the same as the ones in Mifuyu's apartment.

136
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:45,422
And these tracks are from the wheels on the suitcase.

137
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:48,422
Tabata must've put the body in the suitcase

138
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:50,122
and brought it here.

139
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,122
"Tabata"

140
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:55,123
Tabata, are you home?

141
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:00,722
It's unlocked.

142
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:03,523
Hey, there's blood on those shoes.

143
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:07,122
These are the shoes.

144
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:11,222
The blood must've gotten on them when he murdered Mifuyu.

145
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:12,423
Yeah.

146
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,523
Tabata?

147
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:18,723
He's not here?

148
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:22,723
Tabata!

149
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,223
What's the meaning of this?

150
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:39,053
This smell...

151
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:42,353
I believe he was poisoned.

152
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:47,552
It may have been in the coffee left on the table.

153
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:49,553
That piece of paper.

154
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:52,352
This is...

155
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:53,852
What is it?

156
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,052
I will go to see Mifuyu.

157
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:58,453
Atsushi Tabata.

158
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:01,552
It looks like a suicide note.

159
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:04,452
Find something we can use to identify Tabata's handwriting.

160
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:05,553
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:13,852
"Mifuyu"

162
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:16,952
It seems to be his handwriting.

163
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:19,952
Which means it's a suicide.

164
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:25,752
So he regretted murdering Mifuyu and killed himself.

165
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,852
By the way, where is Mifuyu's body?

166
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:31,052
It doesn't seem to be in this room.

167
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:32,152
Yeah.

168
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:34,752
Let's search the other rooms.

169
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:35,853
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

170
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:46,953
I found it!

171
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:53,353
-I'm opening it. -Okay.

172
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:03,152
It's empty.

173
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:05,353
Could this be a different suitcase?

174
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:07,553
What's this?

175
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:11,852
Based on its length, this is a woman's hair.

176
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:12,952
Inspector!

177
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:18,952
Tabata must've dumped Mifuyu's body on the way here.

178
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:19,953
All right.

179
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:23,652
We'll head back to identify the hair and search for the body.

180
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:24,653
Yes, sir!

181
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:28,152
Mouri, well done. We'll handle the rest.

182
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,652
Got it. Thank you.

183
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:34,552
Once the police find Mifuyu's body,

184
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,252
this case is closed.

185
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:37,653
Let's go, kid.

186
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:42,252
What's wrong? Is there something bothering you?

187
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:47,352
Why did Tabata bring the suitcase all the way home with him?

188
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,452
Huh? Why?

189
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,252
He should've disposed of it with the body.

190
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,652
Yeah. Now that you mention it, you're right.

191
00:12:54,653 --> 00:13:01,052
And Tabata used his coffee set for guests to drink coffee.

192
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:05,052
There was a mug he probably used on a regular basis on the counter.

193
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:07,752
What? It's like how some people groom themselves

194
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,752
before committing suicide.

195
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:13,952
Or he had a guest.

196
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,153
Hey!

197
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:19,552
There you go again.

198
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:21,652
It doesn't look used.

199
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,352
Maybe his guest washed it and put it back.

200
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:25,553
What?

201
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,253
I knew it.

202
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:34,852
Knew what?

203
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:38,252
See? There's lipstick on it.

204
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,253
What?

205
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:41,952
They did wash the cup

206
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,552
to hide the fact that they came here.

207
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,252
To hide it?

208
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:47,652
You mean it wasn't suicide

209
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:50,452
because they murdered Tabata instead?

210
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:52,652
There's no way, right?

211
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:56,552
There's a suicide note written in Tabata's handwriting.

212
00:13:56,553 --> 00:14:00,052
One that says, "I will go to see Mifuyu".

213
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:04,452
Does that really mean he meant to commit suicide?

214
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,952
What else could it mean?

215
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,852
Maybe Tabata really did just mean

216
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:13,152
that he would go to see Mifuyu.

217
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,852
And maybe it was used to look like a suicide note.

218
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:19,452
Then that means this wasn't a suicide.

219
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:22,452
Tabata was murdered!

220
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:24,252
And made to look like he killed Mifuyu

221
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:27,352
and then killed himself.

222
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:29,752
Then maybe they killed Mifuyu, too.

223
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:30,952
Hey, Pops.

224
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,052
When we arrived at Mifuyu's apartment,

225
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:36,352
it had just stopped raining,

226
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:38,752
but the perp's footprints were dry.

227
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,852
What? Is that right?

228
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:45,452
Which means it had been some time since the footprints got on the floor.

229
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:49,452
It doesn't make sense that the perp broke the window

230
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:53,052
and attacked Mifuyu when Ayano arrived.

231
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:56,852
But Ayano heard the window break

232
00:14:56,853 --> 00:15:00,252
and Mifuyu scream, "Please stop, Tabata."

233
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:01,452
That's it!

234
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:03,752
Ayano is lying.

235
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:05,452
The person who killed Mifuyu is...

236
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:07,852
But if Ayano did it,

237
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:12,452
then she wouldn't have taken us to that apartment.

238
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,652
That's it!

239
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,552
The perp made footprints on the floor beforehand,

240
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:20,052
waited for Ayano to arrive to break the window,

241
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,952
and made Mifuyu say Tabata attacked her,

242
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,852
before stabbing her and hiding on the balcony.

243
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:30,652
No, I don't think there was anyone on the balcony.

244
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:31,752
Huh?

245
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:37,052
But Ayano heard the perp make noise on the balcony.

246
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:41,452
They made a noise so Ayano would think

247
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:43,852
the perp was on the balcony

248
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:46,252
and frighten her into leaving,

249
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:48,252
using a certain tool.

250
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:50,052
A certain tool?

251
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,752
A toaster.

252
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:55,252
There was a pop-up toaster in the kitchen.

253
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:56,952
They put bread in the toaster,

254
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:59,352
placed a tray on top of it,

255
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:01,652
and set the timer,

256
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:03,752
so when Ayano entered,

257
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:06,352
the toast would pop up,

258
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:09,352
and the tray would fall and make a sound.

259
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:13,752
There were crumbs on top of the air conditioner.

260
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:17,452
Then who killed Mifuyu?

261
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:19,752
There's only one person

262
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:21,252
who could've prepared all of that beforehand.

263
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:23,252
Hey.

264
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:25,952
You don't mean...

265
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:27,352
What's this?

266
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,152
There's something written under today's date.

267
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,352
Paris 293?

268
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:34,152
293? Wasn't that...

269
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:37,052
Do these numbers mean anything to you?

270
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:41,852
Someday I'd like to open a bakery cafe in Paris.

271
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,353
Paris 293...

272
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,353
Darn it! She got us!

273
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,952
Now my new life begins.

274
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:24,853
I don't think so.

275
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:28,152
I thought you'd be here.

276
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:32,752
The 293 on the note thrown away in your apartment

277
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:35,553
was the flight number of your Paris-bound flight.

278
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:40,452
I knew you were alive,

279
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:43,252
Mifuyu Morita.

280
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:44,452
Who are you talking about?

281
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:47,752
-You've mistaken me for someone... -Hey, Pops.

282
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:49,152
I found Mifuyu.

283
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,052
"France Fair" -She's at the France Fair cafe

284
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,153
in the departure lobby.

285
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:55,553
Yeah, got it.

286
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,752
Anyway, it's time for my flight. I'm leaving.

287
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:02,153
I don't have time for you.

288
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:07,552
It hurts...

289
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,653
Isn't that pain from the wound you inflicted on yourself?

290
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,552
So you could put blood on the floor, the knife

291
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:16,852
and the shoes you used to make the footprints.

292
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:18,852
I thought it was strange.

293
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:22,853
There wasn't enough blood for someone stabbed in the chest.

294
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:29,952
While Ayano was gone, you went to Tabata's house.

295
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:31,452
You left the bloodstained shoes

296
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:34,652
and suitcase with the hair inside it.

297
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:38,852
Then you murdered Tabata made it look like a suicide.

298
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:41,152
Didn't you?

299
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,452
What are you talking about?

300
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,652
Who are you?

301
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,252
Conan Edogawa.

302
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:47,353
I'm a detective.

303
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:52,352
In any case, I have nothing to do with this.

304
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:55,352
Hold it right there, Mifuyu Morita.

305
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:56,952
We're the police.

306
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:59,153
Mifuyu, you're alive.

307
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,152
After investigating the late Tabata's home,

308
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:06,452
we discovered his bank book was missing.

309
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,152
We checked with his bank,

310
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:11,252
who told us 10 million yen had been withdrawn.

311
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:14,552
Morita, you stole that money, didn't you?

312
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,052
No.

313
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:18,752
That 10 million yen is mine.

314
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:21,452
I was just taking my money back.

315
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,452
Then why killed Tabata?

316
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,552
It's his fault.

317
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:30,252
He tried to steal my money.

318
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,752
So I...

319
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,252
I'll head to Paris first

320
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,552
and find a location for my cafe.

321
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:37,553
Yeah.

322
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:39,552
I'll be there soon.

323
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,652
You say that now,

324
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:45,152
but you actually plan to get with another woman, don't you?

325
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:47,153
Of course not.

326
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,752
Then please,

327
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:53,852
promise me you'll come see me.

328
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:56,552
Then I won't doubt you anymore.

329
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:58,152
Fine.

330
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:00,653
If that'll put your mind at ease.

331
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:05,952
I was mortified, so I thought I'd trick him

332
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:09,252
and steal all his money.

333
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:13,052
He got that money tricking other women, anyway.

334
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:17,752
Oh, well. I almost had my rich Paris life.

335
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:20,752
Mifuyu, did you use me?

336
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,852
I thought we were friends.

337
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:24,052
What?

338
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:26,952
How long are you going to keep pretending to be the good girl?

339
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:28,252
Did I use you?

340
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,252
Yeah, I did.

341
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:33,552
After all, it's your fault I killed him.

342
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:34,653
What?

343
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:39,352
I'm not stupid.

344
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:43,752
I suspected he was trying to deceive me.

345
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:48,552
But if he'd just stolen my money and disappeared,

346
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:51,352
I would've remained a victim.

347
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:53,952
If only you hadn't snitched!

348
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,652
Because you snitched on him,

349
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:59,052
-I had to get my revenge! -Hey!

350
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:01,852
Because of you, I killed him!

351
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,752
-Because of you, he died! -Stop!

352
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:07,452
"You're being tricked, Mifuyu". Yeah, right!

353
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:11,552
You just wanted to brag that he didn't trick you!

354
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:12,953
That's enough!

355
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:17,752
You decided to kill Tabata,

356
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:22,852
and then actually did it.

357
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,753
Don't blame anyone else!

358
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,552
It's pretty late.

359
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:54,752
Yeah.

360
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:57,752
Women are terrifying.

361
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,353
A woman that beautiful can change so suddenly.

362
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:05,152
Come to think of it, didn't we leave to get lunch?

363
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:07,652
Let's get some soba in the area.

364
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,052
Mr. Mouri!

365
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:11,053
Excuse me,

366
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:13,852
but you're The Great Detective, Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

367
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:16,552
Yes.

368
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:17,553
-Lucky us! -Lucky us!

369
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:20,152
We're huge fans!

370
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:22,653
Will you tell us about your cases?

371
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,452
In that case, why don't we get dinner somewhere?

372
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,352
-I'm so happy! -Are you sure?

373
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:31,252
It's fine!

374
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:34,953
We were just talking about getting some French cuisine!

375
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:41,353
Hey, what am I supposed to do?

376
00:23:43,353 --> 00:23:48,752
"Next Episode"

377
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:54,053
So, have you figured out who tried to kill me?

378
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:58,552
Of course I know.

379
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:01,652
There's no mystery Kogoro Mouri cannot solve.

380
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:05,653
All truths will be revealed!

381
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:13,353
