1
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:37,048
Giant Gomera's "Treacher"!

2
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:38,848
Sure was good, wasn't it?

3
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,848
Yep! Gomera was super awesome!

4
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:44,048
Just a while more and the Kokkaigijidon (Diet) building

5
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:46,048
would've been squashed slim!

6
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:49,148
It's called Kokkaigijido, not "don".

7
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:50,548
I mean,

8
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:53,148
they were saying the one they played the other day was going to be final.

9
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,248
Gomera really keeps going, doesn't it?

10
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:58,948
I hear that they'll be playing the "Revolution" in six months.

11
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:01,748
Well, I'd like to see it, if you ask me, though.

12
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:07,648
Okay, then. We'll eat lunch at a family restaurant and...

13
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:09,048
Where are the children?

14
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:12,148
They were here till just a while ago.

15
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:16,248
Hey! What're you guys doing?

16
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:18,348
Conan, come and look!

17
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,648
Fantastic!

18
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:28,348
Wow! There are a load of boxes of plastic models and figurines.

19
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:31,648
There's a figure of Sprite Emera of Gomera too!

20
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,948
It's the car of some freak for sure!

21
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:36,548
-You're right. -Amazing.

22
00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:40,048
There are scratch marks around the keyhole.

23
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:41,248
Don't tell me that...

24
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:44,148
A car thief?

25
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:45,548
Conan?

26
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:49,248
What's with the smell of paint thinner?

27
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:52,448
Where is it?

28
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:53,648
This smell...

29
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:54,848
Where's it coming from?

30
00:01:57,448 --> 00:01:59,748
"Die" -This is...

31
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:20,448
If all cases were men,

32
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,148
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

33
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:23,948
That police detective officer's love suddenly accelerates

34
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:25,848
during a joint investigation of car thefts.

35
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,448
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,348
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,648
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:01,427
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 1)".

39
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,311
Huh? What's going on?

40
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:09,011
I wonder what happened.

41
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,985
"Die" -What the...

42
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,085
This is...

43
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,685
My God!

44
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:17,585
Who are these brats?

45
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:20,685
What right do you have riding other people's cars?

46
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,785
I... I'm sorry!

47
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:24,585
Car thief!

48
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:28,785
The word "Die" is written with red spray on the ceiling!

49
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,885
Hey, hey, this is the police detective's car.

50
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:33,285
Police detective?

51
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:34,585
Huh?

52
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,585
Conan?

53
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:37,985
Officer Chiba?

54
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,585
You mean this freak's car is yours, Chiba?

55
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:42,085
Freak?

56
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:44,785
Because we saw loads of boxes of figurine

57
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,085
lined up through the rear window.

58
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:50,985
So, you came back to the car saying that you forgot something,

59
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:53,585
just so you could take all this out of the bag and line them up?

60
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,085
Sorry. I went out of my way to buy them,

61
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:57,985
so I wanted to show them off.

62
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:03,685
But "Die" on the ceiling is not comfortable.

63
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:07,385
Don't tell me it's someone who hates the police.

64
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:10,585
Maybe the culprit hates Officer Chiba?

65
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:13,785
Because it doesn't look like an officer's car anyway.

66
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,285
At any rate,

67
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:17,685
I guess I'll contact Yumi of the Department of Transportation.

68
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:23,585
What? There've been three incidents today already?

69
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,785
A car thief using the same method?

70
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:29,085
Yes, you're the fourth victim, Officer Chiba.

71
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:32,385
Entitled, the Oil-Based Red Swoosh Spray!

72
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:35,485
Oil based red swoosh?

73
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:38,585
Because it's swooshed with oil-based spray paint?

74
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:41,285
I tell you, you become target because you're an officer

75
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:44,985
and yet you go on a shopping spree for things like these with your friend.

76
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:46,485
I just came to keep him company shopping

77
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:48,885
because it's my day off today.

78
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:52,385
But, you like things like these too, don't you?

79
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,185
I won't deny it, but...

80
00:05:57,285 --> 00:06:00,885
See, even our newcomer is laughing at you.

81
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:03,285
I... I'm sorry!

82
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:07,585
Really, you haven't changed, Officer Chiba.

83
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:12,085
Hey, doesn't that officer look familiar?

84
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,285
Really?

85
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:17,685
But Yumi called her new-comer,

86
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:21,285
so I think she newly came to the Metropolitan Police Department.

87
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:23,585
Masked Baiya.

88
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:24,885
Baiya?

89
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,385
This is the title of the SFX drama that Officer Chiba filmed

90
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:30,985
when he was in grade school, right?

91
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:34,085
It was playing at the end of the video, no?

92
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,985
Thank you, Masked Baiya!

93
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,485
Right!

94
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:40,985
Twin tale!

95
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,685
She's Officer Chiba's first love, right?

96
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:51,185
But Chiba said he was brushed off, no?

97
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:52,385
Right.

98
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:55,685
Something about she finally got together with someone she loved

99
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:58,285
and didn't even come to the class reunion.

100
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,585
I wonder if she got married or something.

101
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,685
No, judging from the looks of it,

102
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:05,485
it seems that she's saying that

103
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:08,585
she was able to become a police officer just like him.

104
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,585
And, the reason why she didn't come to the class reunion was because

105
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:14,885
she thought that Officer Chiba had forgotten about her.

106
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:19,085
You mean, Officer Chiba mistakenly thought that he was brushed off?

107
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:22,685
Yeah. Moreover, it seems that he doesn't even realized

108
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:25,185
that the person in front of him

109
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:28,685
is his first love, Naeko Miike either.

110
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:32,685
My God, I wonder why all the police officers around us,

111
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,385
that is, Officer Takagi and Inspector Shiratori too

112
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:36,885
all mature so slowly and are dense as well.

113
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:40,085
They're always in need of help and are super idiots.

114
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,985
Well, maybe they're busy investigating

115
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:46,385
and can't be bothered with things like that.

116
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,485
You think so?

117
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,785
How should I know? Don't ask me.

118
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:53,185
I guess we shouldn't say much anymore.

119
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:55,585
Either she tells the truth,

120
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:59,885
or we just wait till Officer Chiba remembers her.

121
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:02,985
Then, you're sure that nothing was stolen?

122
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:05,185
No, nothing in particular.

123
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,485
-Right? -Yes.

124
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:11,485
Which means that the possibility of some freak being targeted

125
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:12,785
cannot be ignored yet.

126
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:13,885
What?

127
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,885
Only the cars of freaks are being attacked?

128
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:20,885
Please show him the picture of the first car that was victimized.

129
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:21,885
Yes!

130
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,985
This is the car.

131
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:26,785
An Ita car.

132
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:28,085
It's really well-drawn.

133
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:32,285
Yeah. It's Emo-chan of Maho JK 48!

134
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:35,785
Huh? What of this car is Italian?

135
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:37,985
It's a Japanese car, no matter how you look at it, isn't it?

136
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,385
No, not that Italian (Ita) car.

137
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:42,785
It's an "Itai" (ouch) car, that's why it's called Ita car!

138
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:45,485
Since the Moe character is printed on the car,

139
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:48,385
the general public who sees this think it hurts,

140
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:50,585
therefore, it's called Ita car, right?

141
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:51,885
Yeah.

142
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,985
Are the other cars that were attacked all Ita cars?

143
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:57,385
Well, not really.

144
00:08:57,385 --> 00:09:01,285
The car beyond in the picture hasn't been attacked.

145
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:02,785
And...

146
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:06,485
what about the first and second cars that were attacked?

147
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:07,585
Yes!

148
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:10,385
The car of a salaried man on his way back from golf

149
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:14,085
and a flashy remodeled hot rod owned by a hot rodder.

150
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,885
I wonder of it's the work of a person

151
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:17,785
attacking cars at random, just for fun?

152
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:22,085
But, judging from the word "Die" written on the ceiling,

153
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:26,285
it looks as if the victims may have something in common.

154
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:29,885
This is the picture of the three victims.

155
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,685
Do they look familiar?

156
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:32,985
I wonder...

157
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:35,285
If so, why don't you go help with

158
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:37,985
the investigation of the car burglars too, Officer Chiba?

159
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:39,585
Who? Me?

160
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:44,185
You may remember something important while investigating.

161
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,685
Besides, we'll help you too!

162
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,285
Right.

163
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:50,985
I mean, Officer Chiba, you're off duty and have a load of time.

164
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:52,485
It's not that I don't have anything to do, you know.

165
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:55,385
Hey, are similar car burglaries

166
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:57,385
all happening in this area?

167
00:09:57,385 --> 00:09:58,585
Yes.

168
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:02,085
I think all of them happened in the parking area within Beika-cho.

169
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,385
Then, we'll go with Yumi

170
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:08,085
to check out the parking areas on the west side and ask questions,

171
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,985
so Officer Chiba, you go with that woman officer

172
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,285
and check out the parking areas to the east.

173
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:14,485
I mean, well...

174
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:16,385
Okay, okay, then off we go and get out of here!

175
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,385
This way, this way.

176
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,985
So, what shall I do?

177
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,385
Well, Officer Chiba won't be able to use his car for a while anyway

178
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:26,785
since the forensics are checking it now.

179
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:29,985
Just go on and walk home.

180
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:30,985
Okay.

181
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:40,885
Hey, why are we tailing those two?

182
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:44,485
Weren't we going to check out the parking areas in the west side?

183
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:48,185
Be quiet. They'll notice if you talk so loud!

184
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:49,785
You may be from the police,

185
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:51,285
but you're really a bit off, aren't you?

186
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:53,485
You see...

187
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,585
They're going inside the building!

188
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,885
It's the basement parking of the department store.

189
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:59,785
What shall we do? Should we go after them?

190
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:00,985
How stupid.

191
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:02,985
If they go in through the same entrance,

192
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,085
it's inevitable that they could run into each other inside.

193
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,185
We've no choice,

194
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:08,985
let's go into the parking lot from inside the department store.

195
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:14,885
Doc, watch the cars that go in and out of here, okay?

196
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:15,885
Hey.

197
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:20,285
Really, this is just too much.

198
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:24,085
Nobody's here.

199
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:26,285
I wonder if they already left.

200
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,785
No, there's nothing yet from Doc,

201
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:32,885
so I think they should be somewhere in this parking lot yet.

202
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,585
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

203
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:36,785
"Noriko Shigei (36), Housewife" -This is not a playground, you know?

204
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:39,185
If you're going to play hide-and-seek, do so in the park!

205
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:42,885
A car could suddenly move and you could get run over, you know!

206
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,085
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:46,385
What elementary do you go to?

208
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:48,085
And, your names?

209
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:50,085
-Well... -Come, come now.

210
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,385
"Akitoshi Fukuchi (41), Office worker" -It's just hide-and-seek.

211
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:55,985
I've got a daughter their age too.

212
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:58,585
They're going through a playful age.

213
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,285
Children go through dangerous experiences

214
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,485
because the parents are the way you are!

215
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:03,585
Hey.

216
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:08,085
"Takero Nawa (22), Free-lancer" -What're you guys doing near my car?

217
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:10,685
Don't you go touching it with your dirty hands!

218
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:11,685
Get lost!

219
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:16,985
Here it is, your cell phone.

220
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,885
I'll take it to you now.

221
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,085
What a hot rod.

222
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:23,985
Let's go out from here.

223
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:26,685
I think it's wiser to wait here with Dr. Agasa

224
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:28,885
until the two come out of here.

225
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,385
But, they sure are late.

226
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:37,985
It's been 30 minutes already since you've come back here and yet.

227
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:43,385
Maybe Officer Chiba remembered who the woman officer was?

228
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:44,685
I see.

229
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:47,485
They're getting carried away being lovey-dovey, maybe?

230
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:51,485
I'd have like to see Officer Chiba blushing in surprise!

231
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,185
What was that sound just now?

232
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,185
It sounds like a crash.

233
00:12:58,185 --> 00:12:59,585
Could it be the parking lot?

234
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:09,585
Smoke?

235
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:12,685
Are you all right?

236
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:14,185
Officer Chiba!

237
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:15,685
What happened?

238
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:17,185
I wonder.

239
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:18,985
I heard a loud sound so I ran over here

240
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:20,785
and found him lying on the ground.

241
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:23,685
It seems he was hit from behind.

242
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,385
"Die"

243
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:33,085
Is this a car thief?

244
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:40,893
Hey, Conan.

245
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:42,793
What happened to what anyway?

246
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:44,693
I don't know the details yet.

247
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:45,893
Huh?

248
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,893
This man is the kind man

249
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:51,193
that stood up for us a while ago, right?

250
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,793
He's coming to!

251
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,593
Are you all right?

252
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:59,393
Can you tell us what happened?

253
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:00,493
Yes.

254
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,493
I came to this department store

255
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,293
to buy my daughter a doll that she asked for,

256
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:06,893
but it was sold out.

257
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:08,693
But I was hit from behind

258
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:14,593
just as I was about to leave to go elsewhere to look for it.

259
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:17,393
I got off the car to complain,

260
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:22,293
but I felt faint and lost consciousness.

261
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:27,593
I think that I hit my head somewhere when I was hit from behind.

262
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:30,393
Hey, what the hell's going on?

263
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:34,193
My friend's saying that he can't get inside the parking lot!

264
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:36,893
This parking lot's closed off for now.

265
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:39,593
Huh? Why'd you do something like that?

266
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:41,993
It's just a mere accident no matter how you look at it!

267
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:44,093
The one who's to blame is one of the two drivers

268
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:46,993
who was driving the car that crashed, right?

269
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:51,493
But nobody was in the driver's seat that crashed from behind.

270
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,393
Hey, what's going on?

271
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,093
I came back to get my wallet,

272
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:58,093
and why's my car emitting smoke?

273
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:59,793
So, it's your car?

274
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:03,093
Yes! It's a new car that I just bought last year!

275
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,993
Who on earth did something like this?

276
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,893
Wait.

277
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:10,993
Hey! Even the airbag is out?

278
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,693
No, no! Don't touch the car yet!

279
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:19,293
I see, that's the story.

280
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,793
So, Officer Chiba and the new-comer

281
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:25,493
were investigating the car theft in this parking lot.

282
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:28,293
But, they heard a loud sound and ran over to check on it.

283
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,993
Then, they found Mr. Fukuchi over there lying on the ground

284
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:32,493
after being hit from behind.

285
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:34,393
However, nobody was in the car

286
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,793
that crashed from behind already at that time.

287
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:41,193
But, the word "Die" that the car thief always left behind

288
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:45,193
was written on the windshield with red spray paint.

289
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:49,893
But is it true that somebody you don't know drove your car?

290
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:51,993
It's true that there are scratch marks by the keyhole

291
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,293
showing that the door had been forced opened.

292
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:58,593
The car key is still stuck in the key cylinder.

293
00:15:58,593 --> 00:15:59,893
That's probably

294
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,093
the spare key that I had hidden

295
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,093
between the sun visor above the driver's seat.

296
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,893
It's because you hide it in a place like that.

297
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:08,993
That and the underside of the bumper

298
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:11,993
are the first places car thieves check.

299
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:13,793
You're quite knowledgeable, aren't you?

300
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,993
Well, no...

301
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:18,393
I saw it in a movie!

302
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:23,293
And? You didn't see the driver of the car who hit you?

303
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,993
No, because I lost consciousness

304
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:28,093
as soon as I got out of the car.

305
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,593
It would've been good if the surveillance camera here

306
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:32,193
caught the culprit on the monitor, but...

307
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:34,893
It seems to have been going through maintenance just then.

308
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,693
No need to worry.

309
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,793
Right after we rushed over here,

310
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:41,493
we notified the police and told them not to let anyone

311
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:44,693
into this parking lot from inside the department store.

312
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:47,093
Moreover, Agasa and Ai are on guard checking

313
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:50,693
to see if anyone goes out from here to the corridor too.

314
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,393
I think the car thief...

315
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:57,593
is still inside this parking lot!

316
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,293
Right, Ai?

317
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:03,193
Right. No one has come out from the parking lot.

318
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:05,993
Of course no one has gone in either!

319
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,293
I see!

320
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:11,393
In other words, if we the police who are investigating this parking lot,

321
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:14,193
can't come up with anyone...

322
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:18,093
the culprit is among the three of you here!

323
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:19,793
The three of us?

324
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:23,493
I'm a victim who was hit from behind by the culprit, you know.

325
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:27,493
I'm a victim whose car was messed up by the culprit too, you know!

326
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:30,193
Beside, don't you think it's strange?

327
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:32,593
Don't car thieves do they job inconspicuously

328
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,193
so that nobody notices?

329
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:36,193
Why would they go doing something conspicuous

330
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,093
like crashing into other people's cars?

331
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:39,793
Beats me.

332
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,293
Maybe he found the key in the car,

333
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:45,193
so he was going to steal the car and split,

334
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:50,193
but he crashed into Mr. Fukuchi's car that came rushing out in reverse?

335
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:51,893
But, I don't think that's possible,

336
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:55,193
because of the word "Die" is written on the windshield.

337
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:56,393
If it were mere theft,

338
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:58,293
the wallet that was in the car would've been taken too.

339
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,893
Besides, I don't think you can get out of here

340
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,593
without parking lot ticket.

341
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:04,193
How should I know?

342
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:06,693
Ask the culprit, will you?

343
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:07,793
More than that,

344
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:11,093
haven't you witnessed any suspicious people?

345
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:12,693
No, not in particular.

346
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,793
Come to think of it, what were you doing

347
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,393
for nearly 30 minutes?

348
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:18,393
You were along, just the two of you, right?

349
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:20,593
Were you talking to each other?

350
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:22,393
Talking about what?

351
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,793
I was just investigating this parking with her!

352
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:28,493
Because she suggested that we should check

353
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:31,293
the cars that have been attacked.

354
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:32,793
You keep referring to her as "her".

355
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:35,893
Didn't you get her name yet?

356
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:37,893
Come to think of it,

357
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,593
I haven't yet.

358
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:42,993
Right! My name is...

359
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:45,093
About this car theft...

360
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:47,193
Is the place where the word "Die" is written,

361
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,393
always at random?

362
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:51,093
No.

363
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:54,593
Until now, it was always on the ceiling.

364
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,593
This was the first time it was written on the windshield.

365
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,493
Then, maybe somebody copied the culprit.

366
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:01,993
No, it's not a copy-cat crime.

367
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:04,893
The spray can that was used in the burglaries up to now

368
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,193
was found on the floor of the car.

369
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:10,493
The car with the word "Die" on it

370
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:12,293
hasn't been made public yet, so...

371
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:15,793
Hey, Conan!

372
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:19,293
We were doing pretty good, and yet...

373
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,093
Don't get in our way!

374
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,093
Pick up vibes, will you?

375
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:28,493
But still, why was Mr. Shigei's car attacked?

376
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:31,893
There was no freakish things in the car though.

377
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:33,693
Freakish?

378
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:37,093
I mean toys, dolls and the like.

379
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,293
Why would I have to buy things like that?

380
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:41,593
As for dolls...

381
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:43,893
there were a lot in the car over there!

382
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:45,793
Huh?

383
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,193
You can say that again!

384
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:49,493
It's full of stuffed dolls!

385
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:52,493
But, they're scattered all around.

386
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:55,893
I was hit, so it got scattered.

387
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:59,893
My daughter usually lines them out nicely on display.

388
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:04,193
But, I can't figure it out.

389
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,793
If this were to have been done by the same culprit...

390
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:09,293
why did he attack this car?

391
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:13,593
And change the place where he sprayed the paint...

392
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:15,293
Moreover, to move and hit it from behind,

393
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:16,693
to the extent of wanting to damage it,

394
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:20,093
was it because he was outraged by this car?

395
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:26,593
The backseat discolored by the sun.

396
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:30,093
Don't tell me that this is why the car was attacked.

397
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:34,393
I'd like to make a declaration.

398
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:38,093
As a result of careful investigation...

399
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:41,993
there was no one other than you three, after all!

400
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:46,193
This means that the culprit is among you, right?

401
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:47,293
No.

402
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:49,493
Why am I, who was hit from behind

403
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:51,493
also included as one of the suspects?

404
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:53,193
Why not?

405
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:55,493
There's a possibility that you deliberately hit the car,

406
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:59,093
and passed out, making it look as if you were the victim.

407
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:01,893
Give me a break!

408
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,593
My wife and daughter are waiting for me to come home.

409
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:05,893
Same here,

410
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:08,993
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

411
00:21:08,993 --> 00:21:10,593
I got to hurry home too,

412
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,293
or my parents will get on my back.

413
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,893
Don't tell me, you give a hoot about your parents?

414
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:18,593
Yeah. They happen to be school teachers, you know.

415
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:20,493
And, they didn't say anything

416
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:23,493
about that flashy wing on your car?

417
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:26,293
It doesn't look like your car passed the safety check, does it?

418
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:29,493
No, they haven't seen it.

419
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:30,993
Come to think of it,

420
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:34,993
there was a wing on the third car that was attacked, right?

421
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,293
Yes.

422
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:39,693
But, your car wasn't attacked, was it?

423
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:41,293
I wonder why.

424
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:42,493
How should I know?

425
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:48,193
The wing on your car is much flashier

426
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:51,793
and the position of the wing is higher too.

427
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:54,593
If you check the car that was attacked in more detail,

428
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:56,393
maybe you'll find something more.

429
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:57,493
If so,

430
00:21:57,493 --> 00:22:00,293
would you like to look at the pictures taken from a different angle too?

431
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:03,093
I brought it along in my mini patrol car that's parked outside.

432
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:04,993
I'll go get it then!

433
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,493
Thank you!

434
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:10,293
Hey, Officer Chiba, don't you have to go with her?

435
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:11,293
Why?

436
00:22:11,293 --> 00:22:12,993
If there are a lot of pictures,

437
00:22:12,993 --> 00:22:14,793
it'll be tough bringing them all here, right?

438
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:18,293
It's the duty of men to help women!

439
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:21,493
-Come on. -Go on, hurry!

440
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:04,493
"Next Episode" -You mean they're each other's first love

441
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,093
and are still in love with each other?

442
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:08,193
Are you serious?

443
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:09,293
Yep!

444
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:12,193
See you.

445
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:13,693
I've got to stop them.

446
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:16,193
Don't you remember?

447
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,493
No, I don't remember.

448
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,193
I thought so.

449
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:25,193
No doubt about it. That person is...

450
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:26,693
the culprit!

451
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:28,693
Next Conan,

452
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:31,793
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 2)".

453
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,893
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:52,993
"Rear window".

455
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,193
Let's get the two!

456
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,893
-Together! -Aye!

457
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,493
I think you're wasting your time.
