1
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,369
Time capsules come out one after another.

2
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,969
Gathering secrets that are scattered here and there.

3
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,669
Dig out the unexpected killer!

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,069
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,869
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,870
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,559
Doc, the members of the Youth Detective Squad and I,

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,759
came along on a weekend tour to Kibitsuji, Kurashiki in Okayama Prefecture

9
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,960
to study ancient history.

10
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,259
Out of the five people we met there, one person was killed.

11
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,160
A member of the group ends up being investigated as a major witness.

12
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,460
However, I had my doubts.

13
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,459
I see. So that's the story.

14
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,159
If so, the contents of the dying message would change.

15
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,059
The killer is among the four of them!

16
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,459
But in order to specify who it is,

17
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,360
the remaining two codes will have to be solved.

18
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,560
"Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 2)"

19
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,359
I don't have conclusive proof.

20
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,359
But if the motive of the murder has to do with the time capsule,

21
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,460
Then...

22
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,659
Let's continue deciphering the remaining code.

23
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,359
I agree! Let's finish what we started.

24
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,159
Although there's no treasure, I feel like we can't back off anymore.

25
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,959
Me, too! But what're we going to do?

26
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,459
The code was burned, wasn't it?

27
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Right.

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Thinking something like this could happen...

29
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,859
I, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, took notes!

30
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,659
All right, Mitsuhiko!

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,959
Good work, Mitsuhiko.

32
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,560
Okay! The Youth Detective Squad will launch the operation!

33
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,159
This is an umbrella.

34
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,860
And this is the sun, right?

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,159
You tried your best to copy it, didn't you?

36
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,959
I think this is!

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,559
Yes. That's it.

38
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,359
Doc sure is late.

39
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,059
I wonder what's taking him so long.

40
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,660
Isn't that his car?

41
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,459
We don't have all day, Doc!

42
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,959
I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,259
And, where would you like me to take you?

44
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,059
To the neighboring Soja City.

45
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,959
The so-called Kibitsuji.

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,060
Roger!

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,159
Kibiji?

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,159
More accurately, called the Koumorizuka Tomb.

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,460
It's a famous tomb located in Kibitsuji.

50
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,259
Oh, I see!

51
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,159
This is it!

52
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,859
That's right, Genta.

53
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,059
It's an umbrella. "Koumori gasa (Umbrella)"

54
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,759
I see!

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,559
I almost forgot.

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,059
It's information regarding the case.

57
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,759
It seems that Mr. Saruwatari in place of Mr. Onitsura

58
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,659
is being questioned as a major witness.

59
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,259
Of course he's denying the charges.

60
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,259
Something about they found out that there was a change in cast

61
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,059
in the play that was performed 15 years ago.

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,259
A change?

63
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,359
It seems that Mr. Onitsura was not good at remembering his lines,

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,259
so he changed roles with Mr. Saruwatari.

65
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,759
So the possibility of the dying message "ONI" being Mr. Saruwatari came up.

66
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,359
He doesn't have an alibi and besides,

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,260
above all he was the one who was arguing with the victim.

68
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,059
It seems he soon may be arrested.

69
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,259
I kind of had a feeling

70
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,559
because dogs and monkeys don't get along. Just as I thought.

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,859
But in the story "Peach Boy", they work together to defeat the ogre.

72
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,959
That just goes to show that it's no more than a fairy tale after all.

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,059
It sure is a bit disappointing.

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,759
Anyway, let's hurry.

75
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,360
We've got to confirm all the capsules.

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,059
How beautiful.

77
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,359
There's something nostalgic about this.

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,759
In ancient times, this area was called the Land of Kibitsu,

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,060
and was said to be just as powerful as the Yamato Imperial Court!

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,359
Super!

81
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,359
This is the large key-hole shaped tomb, isn't it?

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm sure we can go inside.

83
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,359
How scary.

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,659
This Komorizuka Tomb

85
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,759
is said have been built at the end of the 6th Century,

86
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,359
and in Kibitsuji a lot more other tombs have also been found.

87
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,959
It's really starting to get like we're treasure hunting.

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,659
But it's so fast that we've got lots of work to do.

89
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,959
We're capable of finding what we're looking for,

90
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,659
that's why we're called the Youth Detective Squad.

91
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,159
Besides, I'm sure that it's been dug over again anyway.

92
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,560
So it won't be hard to find.

93
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,559
There it is! I found it!

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,859
-Again? -Yes. Again.

95
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,459
It's dug over again by someone.

96
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,159
This is all that's inside.

97
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,959
What is this?

98
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,560
Is it a code again?

99
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,459
They've got us, Mitsuhiko.

100
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,159
That code's a dummy.

101
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,559
What? A dummy?

102
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,259
You mean it's fake?

103
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,559
Yes. Take a good look at the code.

104
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,759
A half folded umbrella under the sun.

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,359
There's no need to use it.

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,859
In other words, it's meaningless.

107
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,659
The real code is this new one here.

108
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,359
This is a shrine gate. And what's this?

109
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,459
A pot for cooking rice?

110
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,459
On top of it is a peach?

111
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,859
A shrine gate, rice cooker and peach.

112
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,459
Sounds familiar.

113
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,259
It's Kibitsu Shrine!

114
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,659
Kibitsu Shrine?

115
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,060
Yes!

116
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,760
It's the place where the hero...

117
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,059
Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto, who as legend has it, is enshrined!

118
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,260
You've really studied well beforehand. How amazing.

119
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,859
I see! The peach stands for Peach Boy

120
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,759
and the shrine gate stands for shrine.

121
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,859
Then, what about this pot?

122
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,859
That's...

123
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,859
I guess we'll find out if we go there.

124
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,059
I'll wait for all of you here.

125
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,959
-No fair. -No fair.

126
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,660
Hurry, Youth Detective Squad!

127
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,259
I'm tired.

128
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,359
I'm hungry.

129
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,659
Okay, let's go!

130
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Wait, Conan!

131
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,959
Wait!

132
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,859
Let's take it slow.

133
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,360
I'm starved!

134
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,659
A rice cooker.

135
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,460
I see.

136
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,359
With the sound of the rice cooker

137
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,660
we can tell if our fortune is lucky or not.

138
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,459
Sounds interesting.

139
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,959
Okay! It's got to be somewhere around here.

140
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,259
Let's search.

141
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,059
I'm sure it's probably going to be dug over again.

142
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,660
That'll be our approach.

143
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,459
Here it is!

144
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,859
I guess it's not a dummy this time.

145
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,859
All that's inside is junk.

146
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,959
That's not nice.

147
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,659
It's their treasure of 15 years ago.

148
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,759
Shunya, please rest in peace.

149
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,159
Shunya.

150
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,259
He's the one who passed away in a traffic accident 15 years ago, right?

151
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,259
I see! The writings that we found in the capsules up to now

152
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,159
were all about Shunya!

153
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,859
Yes.

154
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,559
Most probably.

155
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Which means that the remaining time capsule...

156
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,359
Are we going back to Kurashiki again?

157
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,759
A flower petal?

158
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,859
This is the pistil.

159
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,559
And this is the stem.

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,159
But it's scattered.

161
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,959
Maybe they're supposed to overlay one on top the other?

162
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,459
Could this be a water lily?

163
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,459
Right! Water lily in Kurashiki.

164
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,959
It's over there!

165
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,659
Where?

166
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,759
Over here!

167
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,460
Ohara art gallery?

168
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,159
Water lily.

169
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,959
How cute.

170
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,559
So the capsule is over here.

171
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,559
No. Water lilies were planted here only recently.

172
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,859
It says, the year 2000 in commemoration

173
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,559
of the 70th year since its establishment.

174
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,159
In other words, the water lily in the code

175
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,459
is referring to the drawing of a famous artist called Monet.

176
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,059
And most probably somewhere near the main building

177
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,560
where that drawing is exhibited.

178
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,759
This place is too big.

179
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,459
It was so easy until now, but...

180
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,559
Walk another 25 steps.

181
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
What's up?

182
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,059
Another 26 steps that is written on this code.

183
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,559
Could it be about this statue?

184
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,259
I see! It means that in the place after taking 25 more steps...

185
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,059
What?

186
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,459
I found it.

187
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,659
Fantastic, Ayumi.

188
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,359
It's amazing that you figured it out.

189
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,459
But how strange.

190
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,259
There doesn't seem to be any writing inside.

191
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,459
Just as I thought.

192
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,259
What's this?

193
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,659
Something is stuck to the bottom.

194
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,060
The envelope looks to be different from the ones up to now.

195
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,760
This is?

196
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,457
Well, everyone.

197
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,457
You are all acquaintances of that Sleeping Kogoro,

198
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,157
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

199
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:26,957
Mouri...

200
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,857
Kogoro.

201
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,157
That famous...

202
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:33,357
We just got word from Mr. Mouri a while ago,

203
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,657
telling us to get the details from Mr. Agasa.

204
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:36,958
Agasa.

205
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,258
Me?

206
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:44,557
I hear that you are just as good as Mr. Mouri in making deductions.

207
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:47,757
Who is this Mr. Kogoro?

208
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,658
Just what do you want with us at this point?

209
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:53,758
I'm counting on you, Doc.

210
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,557
Well...

211
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:04,057
Then, let me start my deduction.

212
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:09,857
About Mr. Saruwatari, who is thought will be arrested soon.

213
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:12,257
The fact is, he's innocent.

214
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:14,657
The real culprit is someone else.

215
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:16,057
That's what I kept trying to tell you!

216
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:19,657
What? Do you mean that it is Mr. Onitsura after all then?

217
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:22,357
You got to be kidding! I didn't do it!

218
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:25,757
Well, let me explain things in order.

219
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:29,057
15 years ago, you all put things that were precious to you

220
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:32,157
inside a time capsule and exchanged it with each other.

221
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:34,957
And each of you buried someone else's capsule.

222
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,757
Let me reconfirm something here.

223
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:42,257
Mr. Momoi hid Seiko's capsule in the Hinomi Watchtower.

224
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:47,057
Seiko hid Mr. Onitsura's capsule in the garden of the Ohashi residence.

225
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:52,657
Mr. Onitsura hid Mr. Saruwatari's capsule here in Ivy Square.

226
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:57,357
Mr. Saruwatari hid Yayoi's capsule or rather a dummy in Komorizuka,

227
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:00,557
and the actual capsule in Kibitsu Shrine.

228
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:05,057
And finally, Mr. Momoi's capsule in the Ohara Art Gallery.

229
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:09,057
This one was buried by Yayoi, am I right?

230
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:12,857
The members of the Youth Detective Squad dug the capsules out.

231
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,657
The problem is though, before the members of the squad got there,

232
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:18,357
every capsule was already dug over.

233
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,257
So like I said, the killer just wanted

234
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,557
to make it look like somebody broke into school.

235
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:26,257
There's one thing we just can't seem to understand.

236
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:28,857
Why was only Mr. Momoi's capsule missing something in writing

237
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:33,458
that was included in everybody else's capsule?

238
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,857
It just didn't appeal to me to bury something like that.

239
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,257
That's all there is to it.

240
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:43,257
No. I'll bet it was actually inside.

241
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:47,057
You removed it and got rid of it.

242
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,057
But Seiko happened to see you.

243
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,958
Isn't that it, Mr. Momoi?

244
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:52,958
What?

245
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,557
You?

246
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:55,558
Naoto?

247
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,657
You got to be kidding!

248
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:58,357
What proof do you have?

249
00:13:58,358 --> 00:13:59,957
Let me explain.

250
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,757
First, the dying message.

251
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,457
The point is the position of the victim's finger.

252
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,157
Position of her finger?

253
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:10,357
Seiko, the victim, was left handed.

254
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:14,657
Therefore, she would've written her dying message with her right hand.

255
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:18,157
But if so, the position of her finger is odd.

256
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,457
Her finger should've near the last "I" of the message,

257
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,557
but it was by the first letter, "O".

258
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,257
True.

259
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:30,557
By the way, left handed people usually right their letters in reverse.

260
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:33,057
Don't you think the same goes for this?

261
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:35,457
That is, viewed from the position of the finger,

262
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,457
it was not written from left to right,

263
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,557
but rather, from right to left backwards.

264
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:45,157
And if the part that is erased is connected with a line...

265
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:46,257
I see!

266
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:50,057
It wasn't "ONI" but rather, she tried to write "Momo"!

267
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,657
Exactly!

268
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:56,957
In other words, "ONI" neither meant Mr. Onitsura nor Mr. Saruwatari,

269
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,457
but was pointing out that Mr. Momoi is the killer.

270
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,757
That's ridiculous!

271
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:03,257
That's all nothing but imagination!

272
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:05,157
I even have an alibi!

273
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:06,957
Yayoi.

274
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,557
You were walking together with Mr. Momoi

275
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:11,557
through the Fine Sights district, is that right?

276
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:15,057
You said you only separated for five minutes to go to the restroom.

277
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:16,357
Yes.

278
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:20,157
It's not obvious, but it's really nothing once you know about it.

279
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:23,857
Can you continue, Youth Detective Squad?

280
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:24,858
Yes!

281
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:27,557
The Ivy Square and Fine Sights District

282
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:30,157
are actually located back to back.

283
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:32,057
If you walk on the outside in front, they seem to be some distance apart,

284
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:36,257
but if you walk within the grounds or the buildings, they are very near!

285
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:39,657
A round trip takes 1 minute 50 seconds!

286
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:44,657
He probably made Seiko wait here beforehand.

287
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:47,057
Then he came to her and killed her.

288
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:49,157
Then, ran back.

289
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,257
Naoto?

290
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,057
No! That's a lie!

291
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:57,457
And after he killed Seiko,

292
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,857
he dug over the capsules in this area.

293
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,257
It should've taken him about an hour.

294
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:04,857
So the time of the crime would've been about 14:00.

295
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:12,558
Wasn't he out of your sight for about an hour?

296
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:15,957
True. He said he wanted to go check something

297
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,557
so he was going to the bookstores and to the library.

298
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:20,057
You're only making assumptions.

299
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:23,157
You have no evidence to support what you're saying at all!

300
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:26,958
There is proof in your wallet.

301
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:30,657
My wallet?

302
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:34,657
You, the killer, in order to make it look

303
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:38,057
as if Mr. Onitsura, the alleged killer, broke into school,

304
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:40,857
removed the contents inside the victim's wallet.

305
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,357
However, since you couldn't just dispose of it,

306
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:45,557
you put it inside your wallet.

307
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:47,757
You still have it with you, don't you?

308
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,357
Tell me, will you?

309
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:51,457
Just what proof do you have to say

310
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,857
that the money from Seiko's wallet is in my wallet?

311
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:57,457
Officer Tsuyama, did you bring the you-know-what here?

312
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,857
Oh, yes.

313
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:00,857
The thing that Mr. Mouri told me about on the phone.

314
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:02,457
This, right?

315
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,357
Officer Tsuyama, please check the wallet.

316
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:09,957
Do you see one bill in there that has something odd stuck to it?

317
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,057
Odd?

318
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:13,557
This is...

319
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:16,057
So what about it?

320
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:19,357
If a bill is dirty, does that make me the killer?

321
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:20,857
Mr. Momoi.

322
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:24,157
How are you going to explain this?

323
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:30,157
Normally it would only look as if the stamp of the ticket smeared off.

324
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:35,657
Only in your wallet there was the other half of the stamp mark

325
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:40,457
that was found on this pamphlet of the art gallery.

326
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,857
Seiko probably put the ticket on top of the pamphlet

327
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,557
then put them inside her wallet.

328
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:48,557
Not knowing that, Mr. Momoi,

329
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:53,157
you left the pamphlet back at the site and took only the bill with you.

330
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:54,857
Thanks to the admission stamp,

331
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,658
you took the bill that coincidentally became a pair.

332
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:07,258
It's because Seiko and that thing 15 years ago.

333
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,457
Because she started investigating what happened 15 years ago.

334
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:18,757
15 years ago, everything started back then.

335
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:20,357
Momoi, as a boy back then,

336
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:23,357
was bullied by other kids.

337
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:25,957
That day, when Momoi was being forced to shoplift by bullies,

338
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,357
he was seen by Shunya.

339
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,758
Momoi.

340
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,957
I thought he was going to squeak on me.

341
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,057
That he'd tell the teacher and my parents.

342
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:39,458
That's what I thought.

343
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:45,357
Back then, Momoi never spoke of anyone about that incident.

344
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,557
But because of his feeling of guilt,

345
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:50,658
he impulsively wrote the truth and put it inside the time capsule.

346
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,657
I was graduating anyway,

347
00:18:53,658 --> 00:18:56,357
and I get to sever ties with those guys, too.

348
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,857
I thought that we'd never be digging the capsules out again.

349
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,258
Back then...

350
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:05,057
Three days ago, I got a call from Seiko,

351
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:06,857
saying that since she's going to hold an interview,

352
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,857
she'd like to dig out the capsules while she's at it.

353
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:12,857
And you snuck into school just for that one piece of paper.

354
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:14,757
You didn't have to kill her!

355
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:16,757
All you had to do was throw that paper away somewhere.

356
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,558
Then it would've been done and over with.

357
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,358
Where do you think I am now?

358
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:26,857
You know the capsule that I buried?

359
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:30,657
When I came to look for it, it was already dug up.

360
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:32,757
You're the only one who could've done it, right?

361
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:36,657
You're the only one who knew that I was going to dig out the time capsule.

362
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,458
Why did you do this?

363
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,257
Don't tell me

364
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:42,857
that I could've written some kind of scoop article about it?

365
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:45,457
She always used to bluff from before!

366
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,658
She just put a leading question to you.

367
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,857
I was scared.

368
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,857
I felt like she knew everything.

369
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,757
Miss.

370
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:58,457
I found this inside the last capsule.

371
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,457
We'll hear you out at the station then, Mr. Momoi.

372
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,558
Wait!

373
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:04,957
Please.

374
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,457
All together. For the last time, I'd like to go all together.

375
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,558
There's a place I really want to go.

376
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:16,857
You're the one who put this code inside the capsule and buried it, right?

377
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:21,557
I was asked by Shunya, a while before he died,

378
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:24,757
that he wanted to go with everybody to bury the capsule.

379
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:28,757
But after the accident, I was too scared to look inside and didn't look.

380
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:31,757
That code is an anagram, right?

381
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:36,257
Yes, it's opened in hiragana then you line it up backwards in order.

382
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:38,357
Monomokidanon...

383
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:40,857
Momodanonani...

384
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:42,857
Peach Tree Adventure Squad!

385
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,157
That used to be the name of our group!

386
00:20:45,158 --> 00:20:47,057
We used to frequently gather here.

387
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:50,958
When we had to wait for each other or when we were practicing "Peach Boy".

388
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:54,758
This is Shunya's...

389
00:20:55,758 --> 00:21:00,057
Momoi looked so cool in his "Peach Boy" character.

390
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,857
Next time, I'm going to be Peach Boy and rescue Momoi.

391
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:07,157
I'm going to make him stop listening to those guys!

392
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:10,657
But it's got to be kept a secret from teacher or his parents.

393
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:13,558
No matter what. No matter what.

394
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,058
No way.

395
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:22,357
Maybe Shunya ran onto the road because he wanted to help you.

396
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:24,158
Stop bullying my friend!

397
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:30,757
If only I remembered it back then.

398
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:34,057
I kind of knew, although I was a child

399
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:36,657
that it was no ordinary traffic accident.

400
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:41,157
But I couldn't say or do anything. I'm just as guilty.

401
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:43,857
As for me, I didn't feel a thing.

402
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:45,658
So I'm even guiltier.

403
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:52,757
I probably looked like an ogre.

404
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:57,958
The ogre in your heart can only be defeated by you yourself alone.

405
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:02,658
Yes. Because you're Peach Boy.

406
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,657
Lover's...

407
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,557
Just come along.

408
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:35,857
All right!

409
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:39,757
Now, you're my Peach Boy, Conan!

410
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:41,757
Bummers.

411
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:44,357
-Then, what about us? -Then, what about us?

412
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:45,957
Genta is the pig!

413
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,958
Mitsuhiko is the water sprite!

414
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:52,357
Those are "Son Goku's" characters.

415
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:56,258
You guys! Then, am I a hot dog?

416
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:03,257
"Next Episode."

417
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:05,557
Kimono Demon?

418
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:09,558
In other words, this is a locked room closed off by the snow.

419
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:16,358
I wonder what Ran and the others are doing?

420
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,758
The folklore of the Kimono Demon.

421
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:28,558
Next Conan, "The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 1)"

422
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:46,657
Next Conan Hint's:

423
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:48,557
"Outdoor bath."

424
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,157
-A secluded Japanese hot spring inn. -Curse of the kimono?

425
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,858
I don't understand the meaning after all.
