1
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:08,406
Yoshida-san?

2
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:17,816
What is it?

3
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:25,085
It's really hurt. Did it get hit by a car?

4
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:27,876
No, it doesn't seem like it.

5
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:32,076
There aren't any signs that it was hit by a car.

6
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:35,916
Someone probably hit or kicked it.

7
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,345
Why would someone do something so cruel?

8
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:39,676
It's unforgivable.

9
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,635
This might serve as a clue to finding the culprit.

10
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:45,345
These bloodstains and fibers...

11
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:48,165
The cat must've scratched something the culprit was wearing.

12
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:52,096
Yellow and pink... That's distinctive clothing.

13
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:54,616
We need to find the culprit

14
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,485
but we also need to get this cat to a hospital.

15
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:00,735
Yoshida-san, let's go.

16
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:01,586
Okay.

17
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,936
She's oddly kind to animals.

18
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:10,246
He's in a weakened state, but he'll be fine.

19
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:13,756
It'll take some time, but he'll get better.

20
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:19,676
Now then, how will we find the culprit?

21
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:23,566
Is it a case?

22
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:28,256
Bocchan Restaurant

23
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,665
Bocchan Restaurant?

24
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,766
You kids again?

25
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:35,515
Are we cursed in some way?

26
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:37,996
Right back at you...

27
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:51,505
That man's shirt is yellow and pink!

28
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:53,156
Which means he's...

29
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,046
The animal abuser.

30
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:59,556
Does this have something to do with that cat?

31
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,945
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

32
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:08,665
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

33
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,565
An odd restaurant with characters plucked from a novel!

34
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,775
The Detective Boys take on a serial murder case!

35
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:14,315
Always determining the one truth

36
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:16,145
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

37
00:02:16,146 --> 00:02:18,396
his name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:05,112
Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant (Part One)

39
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:10,631
The victim was Bocchan Restaurant employee Koga Ushio-san, thirty-six years old.

40
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:15,631
The weapon hasn't been found, but is most likely a kitchen knife-like blade.

41
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:18,710
The body was abandoned in Sanshiro Lake.

42
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:24,001
Judging by the body's condition, he was killed last night around midnight.

43
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,221
You lot again?

44
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:32,140
Try not to get in our way by walking around the crime scene.

45
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,600
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:35,420
Continue, Takagi-kun.

47
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:36,500
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:41,201
This morning, Bocchan Restaurant manager Akazawa Zenichi-san,

49
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:44,670
whose home is located here at the restaurant, discovered the body.

50
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,791
Who could have killed Uranari?

51
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:52,340
It's possible that cat happened to be here at the crime scene last night.

52
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:53,710
What?

53
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,721
Since their crime had been witnessed, they intended to silence him.

54
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,730
That's why they hurt the kitty?

55
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:01,971
How awful.

56
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:04,610
But it was a cat that witnessed their crime.

57
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:07,231
It's plausible given a criminal's mentality.

58
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:12,040
Then we should find the culprit for that cat's sake, too.

59
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,861
Yeah.

60
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,170
You're right.

61
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:14,861
Yeah.

62
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:20,710
Regarding the criminal profile, since the murder occurred within the restaurant late at night,

63
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:23,620
it's hard to imagine that it was committed by an outsider.

64
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:28,121
So it's likely that the murder was committed by someone who works at Bocchan Restaurant.

65
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:31,130
The culprit is probably someone who works at the restaurant.

66
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,271
Inspector Megure.

67
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,841
All the employees have arrived for work.

68
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:36,830
Everyone's here, huh?

69
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:37,631
What?

70
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:54,821
That's our uniform.

71
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,151
What is that?

72
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:01,280
Boys, Uranari's been killed.

73
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,141
Indeed.

74
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:03,161
Indeed.

75
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,890
What evildoer could do such a thing?

76
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:09,411
The sun may forgive them, but I will not!

77
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10,900
How marvelous.

78
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:15,171
Bocchan's sense of justice is this old Kiyo's pride and joy.

79
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:17,351
Bocchan? Kiyo?

80
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,971
Now you've done it, you dastardly Red Shirt!

81
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,261
All to get at Madonna!

82
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:26,161
Please, Yama Arashi-san.

83
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,021
You make it seem like I'm the reason for this.

84
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,770
I'd never do anything as senseless as kill someone.

85
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,521
Right?

86
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,530
Indeed.

87
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,280
You suspect the president? What a fool.

88
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:41,071
Nodaiko, stay out of this!

89
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:42,780
Now, now.

90
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:45,451
Let's not cast suspicion upon each other.

91
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:48,201
You're always afraid to rock the boat, Tanuki.

92
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:54,041
Bocchan Restaurant recreates the world inside a novel, doesn't it?

93
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,450
I'm impressed you noticed, son!

94
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,960
That's our selling point.

95
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:00,850
What? A novel?

96
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:03,471
You haven't heard of "Bocchan"?

97
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:06,230
Well, they are first graders.

98
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,420
Yeah.

99
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:09,471
Mitsuhiko, could you explain?

100
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:17,481
"Bocchan" is a famous novel written during the Meiji Era by Natsume Soseki.

101
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:22,491
The protagonist Bocchan leaves his old maidservant Kiyo-san in Tokyo

102
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:26,301
to begin teaching at a school in Shikoku.

103
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,010
Grasshoppers? These are locusts!

104
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:31,121
Grasshoppers and locusts are the same thing!

105
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:37,001
But his students pull pranks on him, like putting grasshoppers in his bed.

106
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:40,501
The principal Tanuki is irresponsible.

107
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:45,260
Meanwhile, he learns that his colleague Uranari-kun's fiancée, Madonna-san,

108
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:48,380
has been taken from him by head teacher Red Shirt.

109
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,770
The righteous Bocchan is unable to forgive them,

110
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,160
so he and his colleague Yama Arashi-san beat up Red Shirt

111
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:57,771
and his obsequious sidekick Nodaiko.

112
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,651
It's a very satisfying story!

113
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,320
Sounds interesting.

114
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,531
And...

115
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,770
You're lucky, miss.

116
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:11,220
You get to wear those pretty clothes while bringing customers their food.

117
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:13,661
That's not my only job.

118
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:16,081
You do other stuff, too?

119
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:25,840
Bocchan Dancers?

120
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:27,891
They all dance together...

121
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,600
We should get started on looking for the culprit.

122
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:37,311
Yeah.

123
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:40,411
The culprit is probably one of them.

124
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:46,340
Since we're temporarily closed, they could let us leave.

125
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:50,321
The police insist we stay so they can question us.

126
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:53,831
But they'll be providing food, so we won't have to buy our own.

127
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,831
Don't you have any ambition?

128
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:01,101
I do appreciate not having to buy my own lunch.

129
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,320
Those three...

130
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:08,671
Their colleague was just murdered.

131
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,221
It's understandable.

132
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:15,561
After all, the victim Uranari-san was—

133
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,271
Did he have problems?

134
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,531
You think I did it?

135
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,151
We received testimony.

136
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:34,911
You and the victim Uranari-san, or Koga Ushio, were romantic rivals.

137
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:38,370
You fought over Toyama Chiaki-san, who plays Madonna.

138
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,041
That's—

139
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,151
No!

140
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:44,540
And you live on restaurant grounds.

141
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:49,931
It's possible you invited over your romantic rival last night, and...

142
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,690
Impossible.

143
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,560
He was responsible for all of our reception staff.

144
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,851
What kind of manager would murder the backbone of his business?

145
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,510
One thing may have led to another.

146
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:06,460
You invited Uranari-san over and asked him to leave Madonna-san alone.

147
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:08,861
But he wouldn't listen, so without thinking, you stabbed him.

148
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:12,621
Why would I have been holding a knife then?

149
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,260
To threaten him.

150
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:17,621
After all, Red Shirt is a dastardly fellow who will do anything to get his way.

151
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:20,871
Please don't confuse the novel with reality.

152
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:24,431
If you think I did it, I'd like to see some evidence.

153
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,421
Is that true?

154
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,570
Did they both harbor romantic feelings for me?

155
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:35,801
You didn't know?

156
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:39,060
I thought they were simply pretending

157
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:41,931
in front of our customers as part of our business strategy.

158
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:52,951
It must be shocking to learn that two men were fighting over her.

159
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:58,020
Not only that, but if a murder was committed because of it...

160
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:59,621
That would be hard.

161
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:03,480
Come to think of it, what was she about to say earlier?

162
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,690
Something about Uranari-san.

163
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:06,611
Inspector.

164
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:12,130
The victim Uranari had a terrible reputation?

165
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:15,011
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

166
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,970
Uranari is a kind-hearted and good man.

167
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,391
In the novel.

168
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:24,901
But apparently they're all totally different from the characters they play.

169
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,651
What do you mean?

170
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,651
For example, the dastardly Red Shirt

171
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:32,821
is a good-natured man who cares for his employees.

172
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:37,371
Bocchan is actually a twisted man with no sense of justice.

173
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,661
Yama Arashi is a delicate crybaby.

174
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:43,440
And Madonna seems plain,

175
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:46,661
but she wrestled as a student.

176
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,810
Uranari was incredibly strict,

177
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:54,681
and he often yelled at his subordinates as the head receptionist.

178
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,851
Your acting is weak! All of you!

179
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:00,100
You're getting paid, aren't you?

180
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,290
Perform your roles thoroughly!

181
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,731
Idiots! Fools! Morons!

182
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:05,531
Got it?

183
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:11,711
Naturally, everyone working in customer service strongly disliked him.

184
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,050
So that's what it was.

185
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,241
The thing she almost said.

186
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:19,421
So they're nothing like their characters from the novel.

187
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:24,680
Inspector, that means the culprit is one of the good guys from the novel!

188
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,720
Either Bocchan or Yama Arashi!

189
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:29,691
Stop thinking about the novel already.

190
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:33,350
But they did have old scores to settle.

191
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,471
We'll have to question the reception staff, too.

192
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:41,471
All right. Summon them.

193
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:47,151
Not just Red Shirt, but Bocchan and Yama Arashi had motives for murder, too.

194
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,415
The question is their alibis.

195
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:08,704
We're lucky you happened to come stay at my place last night.

196
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,054
We're able to confirm each other's alibis.

197
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:14,055
It's about your employee...

198
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:17,334
Now you think my reception staff did it?

199
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:20,435
They have motive as well.

200
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,435
Just like you.

201
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:27,315
You were able to confirm theirs, too? Which means...

202
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:32,445
We haven't been able to verify last night's alibis for...

203
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,825
Shima-san, who plays Bocchan.

204
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:37,325
Hotta-san, who plays Yama Arashi.

205
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:39,655
Yoshikawa-san, who plays Nodaiko.

206
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:43,335
You three are the only ones.

207
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,035
Having an alibi is the bigger miracle.

208
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,465
It was midnight.

209
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:52,345
And we're suspects because of that? Unbelievable.

210
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:57,845
Indeed. We'll have to question you later.

211
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,355
You mean we can't leave yet?

212
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,685
We appreciate your cooperation.

213
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:13,474
We received testimony that those three without alibis hated Uranari.

214
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,334
Question everyone.

215
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:18,104
Whether it's those three or Red Shirt,

216
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:20,714
it's possible that someone mentioned a desire to kill Uranari.

217
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:22,244
If we can find that...

218
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:24,375
Allow me to help.

219
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,755
We should split up and help, too.

220
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:33,594
You think I hated Uranari-kun?

221
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:35,784
He was hard on you, wasn't he?

222
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:38,514
My wife left me.

223
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:41,515
She left me with massive amounts of debt.

224
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:45,684
I have no choice but to work as hard as I can in order to pay it off.

225
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,344
What I'm asking about is—

226
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,195
But that damn Uranari.

227
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:52,445
He hurled abuse at me for my weak acting!

228
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,075
Who the hell does he think I'm playing?

229
00:14:58,055 --> 00:15:02,285
No adult man wants to play this role!

230
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:06,294
He really is nothing like his role.

231
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:09,044
My mom croaked last year.

232
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:11,514
She was complaining until the end.

233
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:15,055
She said I was trash who could never hold down a job for very long.

234
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:20,894
So I'm clinging to this job to get back at my dead mom.

235
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:22,394
But that damn Uranari!

236
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:24,805
He tells us to act, but there are limits to what a man can do!

237
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:30,165
Besides, I don't care about justice.

238
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:37,524
My mother still sends me encouraging letters.

239
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:40,825
She says if I wish hard enough for something, my dreams will come true.

240
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,544
So I asked Uranari countless times

241
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,955
to let me play Madonna instead of Yama Arashi.

242
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:55,445
But he never listened!

243
00:15:56,295 --> 00:16:00,374
Those three certainly hated Uranari-kun,

244
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,444
but I doubt they had the guts to kill him.

245
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:04,055
The guts?

246
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:07,164
Anyway, this sure is good.

247
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:10,565
Locust tsukudani is our specialty.

248
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,114
So it's a fish called locust.

249
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:15,684
It's not fish. They're grasshoppers.

250
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:16,825
Grasshoppers?!

251
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:20,195
Even if you don't like your role, you just have to do it.

252
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:23,705
Everyone was scouted for their specific role.

253
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:26,165
You were scouted, too?

254
00:16:26,755 --> 00:16:28,755
Based solely on my appearance.

255
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:35,285
After all, I'm nothing like Kiyo-san either.

256
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:45,344
I'm just happy to have a job here.

257
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:48,355
Well, everyone would want to play Madonna-san.

258
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:52,275
That's not what I meant. I had a younger sister.

259
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:55,334
She loved the novel "Bocchan."

260
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:59,275
When she learned about this restaurant, she said she wanted to work here.

261
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:04,785
But six months ago, she died from an illness called subarachnoid hemorrhaging.

262
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:12,585
I thought I could work here in her place, so I asked them to hire me.

263
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,165
So you carried out your sister's wish.

264
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:20,035
But maybe it was a mistake.

265
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:26,145
If me working here caused a murder, then...

266
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:37,555
I guess there's no need to keep up the act in front of a child.

267
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:43,065
Naturally, I knew that everyone hated Uranari-kun.

268
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:50,055
But you need people like that to manage a business.

269
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:55,665
Because he understood that, he played the unlikable role.

270
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:59,695
So he was an ideal business partner.

271
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:03,675
But it's true that you were romantic rivals, right?

272
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:08,354
Opening Bocchan Restaurant has been my dream since I was young.

273
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:11,405
I worked really hard to gather enough capital.

274
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:14,345
I never experienced love or marriage.

275
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:18,615
I can't believe I developed a romantic rivalry at my age.

276
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,205
We didn't find anything conclusive.

277
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:42,465
Is the culprit one of those three or Red Shirt?

278
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,285
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

279
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,795
However, the next day...

280
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:05,485
"I offer my own death as an apology to the man I killed."

281
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:08,495
Inspector, this was found on the altar in Red Shirt's home!

282
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:14,375
That's probably the weapon used in Uranari's murder.

283
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,924
After killing his romantic rival Uranari,

284
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,804
he realized he couldn't escape his guilt, so he took his own life.

285
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:27,464
I knew from the start that the culprit was Red Shirt.

286
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:32,115
Who started saying it was Bocchan and Yama Arashi during the investigation?

287
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:35,395
So it was Red Shirt.

288
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,495
It must be hard for her.

289
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:39,955
It's my fault...

290
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:46,915
You mean she thinks it's because she was trying to fulfill her sister's wish.

291
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:48,565
You don't seem satisfied.

292
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:52,024
If he really did it,

293
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,665
then why leave the murder weapon on the altar?

294
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:56,844
Maybe he disposed of it initially,

295
00:19:56,845 --> 00:20:00,925
but once he decided to kill himself, he left it there by way of apology.

296
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:04,675
And why didn't he write his note on a piece of paper?

297
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:06,925
Because their handwriting would give it away.

298
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:10,204
You mean Red Shirt's death wasn't a suicide?

299
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:10,845
What?!

300
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,265
I'm saying it's possible that it was faked.

301
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,775
They knocked him out and hanged him by the neck.

302
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,214
Then they fabricated a suicide note

303
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:22,614
and placed the murder weapon on the altar

304
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:26,375
to frame Red Shirt for the murder of Uranari-san.

305
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,114
It's possible.

306
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:30,785
If that's true, then they must have left some evidence.

307
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:37,435
It's damp?

308
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:40,795
There are drops of water on the leaves of the branch beneath it, too.

309
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:44,384
His hair and clothes are wet, too.

310
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:45,544
Why?

311
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,465
He just got out of the bath.

312
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:51,215
You're getting in the way of the adults! Get out of here!

313
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:56,225
If Conan-kun is right, then the culprit is one of those three.

314
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:58,254
It could be Yama Arashi.

315
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:01,654
He's big, so he could've carried Red Shirt.

316
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:04,605
We still don't know that the suicide was faked.

317
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:10,434
If he could speak to us, we could ask him who the culprit is.

318
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,115
I wonder if he's all right.

319
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:17,274
I'm glad he'll live, but...

320
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:21,274
He was beaten all over, and two of his legs were broken.

321
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:22,644
Then it couldn't have been possible.

322
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:23,875
What's impossible?

323
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:28,465
What's gotten into you?

324
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:31,404
You found that cat here, right?

325
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:33,215
He was meowing under there.

326
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,234
Bocchan Restaurant is pretty far from here.

327
00:21:36,235 --> 00:21:40,474
A cat with two broken legs couldn't have traveled that distance.

328
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,275
You mean...?

329
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:43,375
Yeah.

330
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:47,774
That cat was attacked not at Bocchan Restaurant, but near here.

331
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:50,025
So, what?

332
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,085
Edogawa-kun!

333
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:58,035
It's a bloodstain. What's that?

334
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:00,265
That cat's fur is stuck to it.

335
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:04,545
The crime actually took place here two nights ago!

336
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:14,024
It's clear now.

337
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:17,435
Red Shirt didn't kill Uranari-san.

338
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:23,065
And Red Shirt's suicide was also a disguised murder!

339
00:23:48,935 --> 00:23:51,304
What's with the weird phrasing?

340
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,945
You think we did it?

341
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:56,304
Judging by the strength of the force applied to his neck,

342
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:58,575
we believe it was applied by a third party.

343
00:24:01,465 --> 00:24:04,325
A powerful force was applied to his neck? That means...

344
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:06,335
Are you serious?

345
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:11,375
There's no way we'd kill the boss!

346
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:17,125
