1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:02,041
We came to visit the villa of Dr. Agasa's friend

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:04,041
to spend time here.

3
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:05,941
Then we found

4
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:08,841
a wounded man called Yuji Isehara.

5
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,741
Isehara was a hacker as well as a henchman

6
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:17,041
for a robber aka Zorro who professed to be chivalrous.

7
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:21,041
I saved Isehara in the nick of time before he was going to

8
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,241
be murdered for being a traitor.

9
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:25,641
But they persistently pursued us, and we...

10
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:36,541
Conan!

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,941
What? Conan?

12
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:40,241
Conan!

13
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,341
Die!

14
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:21,341
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

15
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:23,741
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

16
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,241
Serial robber and arsonist, Zorro.

17
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:28,441
While overcoming a close call, we'll beat him to a pulp!

18
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,941
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,841
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,441
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:17,943
"Conan Disappears Over a Cliff (Part 2)"

22
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:33,843
Guys!

23
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:38,643
Ran! Conan's...

24
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:40,043
Conan's...

25
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:43,843
It's not true. It can't be true.

26
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:46,943
But we saw it, didn't we?

27
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:50,543
We witnessed with our own eyes

28
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:53,143
that Conan fell off from there.

29
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:58,943
Yes, we did.

30
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:00,943
I saw it with my own eyes

31
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:03,643
that Conan fell off the cliff.

32
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,943
No.

33
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:07,243
No!

34
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:08,943
Conan...

35
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:11,643
Why? Why?

36
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:14,143
What's going on, Inspector?

37
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:16,843
It's Zorro. He's responsible for this.

38
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:18,243
What?

39
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:21,043
From what the children said,

40
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,643
we found out that the man who fell with Conan over the cliff

41
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:26,143
was Yuji Isehara.

42
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:29,143
But after the two fell over the cliff,

43
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,243
Zorro seems to have disappeared along with his henchmen.

44
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:36,143
They probably had a brawl or something among themselves,

45
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,443
and Conan got mixed up in it.

46
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:43,343
But yet, why would the kid be together with Isehara?

47
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,843
I have no idea.

48
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,443
Anyway, the first thing we'll do in the morning

49
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:49,343
is to ask Kanagawa Police Department

50
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,943
to do a search over the sea.

51
00:04:50,943 --> 00:04:52,443
Right now!

52
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:55,443
Please start right now, Inspector!

53
00:04:55,443 --> 00:04:57,143
I... I understand.

54
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:59,443
-Hey! -Yes, sir...

55
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:00,943
Darn it!

56
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:02,443
This can't be.

57
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:04,943
This can't be happening!

58
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:08,043
Dad...

59
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:25,743
"Kanagawa Prefectural Police, Misakihama Station"

60
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,643
Don't worry. Don't worry.

61
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:32,943
I'm sure that Conan will be fine.

62
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:35,043
Let us all wait for him.

63
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,243
Okay? -Okay.

64
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:39,543
-Yeah. -Yes.

65
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:40,743
Okay?

66
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:47,143
How is it, Inspector?

67
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:50,543
Three hours have already passed since they've started the search,

68
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:54,043
but they've found nothing yet.

69
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:55,443
I see.

70
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:01,243
According to the local police,

71
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:03,843
the water below the cliff is pretty deep

72
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,743
and the flow is rapid.

73
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:06,843
And anyone who falls in

74
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:11,343
would be washed to the sea in no time at all.

75
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:13,943
They say that corpses are rarely found too.

76
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:15,443
What...

77
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:18,243
At any rate, we'll ask them to keep up the search.

78
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:21,543
If anything comes up, they'll contact us immediately.

79
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:23,143
I understand.

80
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,043
Although Conan's safety is important,

81
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,943
but depending on Isehara's condition when we find him,

82
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:29,543
Zorros's case may hit a snag.

83
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:33,043
But I won't let that happen

84
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:34,743
no matter what it takes.

85
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:37,943
Inspector.

86
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:51,143
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

87
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:53,543
I saw him fall over the cliff.

88
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:00,843
But I didn't see his corpse.

89
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:12,743
I'm sure this was the place.

90
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:47,743
Is this a cave?

91
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:52,943
Sea breeze?

92
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:56,843
Which means that up ahead, it's...

93
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:08,143
If I remember correctly...

94
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:16,943
Which means this is right below that cliff.

95
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:55,043
Wait. I said, wait.

96
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:57,643
"Yuji Isehara (28), Hacker" -Shut up. Don't follow me.

97
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,943
I don't have time to be playing detective with a kid.

98
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:02,243
Sheesh.

99
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,943
We fell off that cliff and made it out safely without getting hurt,

100
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:06,843
and you're not even thanking me?

101
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:09,643
Spare... Spare me.

102
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:10,943
Please.

103
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,843
You're causing us so much trouble.

104
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:16,243
Traitor.

105
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:17,443
Die!

106
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:33,243
If this is right above that cave...

107
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,343
It's sink or swim.

108
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,943
I've got no other choice.

109
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:40,043
Judging from the height of the cliff,

110
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,343
if I match the timing with the waves that hit the rocks...

111
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,043
Now!

112
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:00,343
Hurry! Go beyond.

113
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,743
Darn, I know!

114
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:14,043
You have no intention of turning yourself in, do you?

115
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,343
Of course not.

116
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:19,043
I heard there was a guy in the past who told on Zorro's hideout,

117
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,543
but Zorro pursued him all the way abroad,

118
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:24,043
and got rid of him.

119
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:26,543
Even if I turn myself in,

120
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,843
I'd eventually...

121
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:37,543
But you can't keep running around like this forever.

122
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,843
That's what I'm trying to think out right now!

123
00:10:39,843 --> 00:10:44,943
If so, wouldn't it be faster to get Zorro

124
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:46,343
before he gets you?

125
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:48,243
What a stupid thing to say.

126
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:51,243
Well, you'd need somebody to help you though.

127
00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:59,643
"ZR-Stunt Co."

128
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:05,243
A sale for precious metals and jewelries

129
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,743
by the purveyors for the nouveau riche.

130
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:09,443
"Go Mizorogi (35)" -Once a month,

131
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:11,343
"Armed Robber Zorro" -this event is held at the same place.

132
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:14,343
How much is it worth?

133
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,043
Unlike going from house to house,

134
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,043
we'll make a fortune by just busting into one place.

135
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:21,543
We're guaranteed to make at least a total of one billion yen.

136
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:23,243
What about the security?

137
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:24,843
The norm.

138
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:28,243
We can undo it with Isehara's software as usual.

139
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,243
No problem at all.

140
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:34,243
Speaking of Isehara, what an idiot he was.

141
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:35,943
He chickened out

142
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:38,443
and fell upside down into hell.

143
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:41,543
That means we'll get to split his share among us, too.

144
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:42,743
Right, Zorro?

145
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:48,843
What do you want to do about it?

146
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:51,543
We can sign a new contract if you want.

147
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,243
We'll carry out as scheduled tonight.

148
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:58,343
Get ready now.

149
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,719
Ai is missing, too?

150
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,119
What do you mean?

151
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,519
I don't know.

152
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,619
By the time I noticed, she was already gone.

153
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,819
Don't tell me that Ai...

154
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,219
Got caught by them, too?

155
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:37,119
Sheesh. What exactly is going on?

156
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:40,319
Why is everybody doing as they please one after the other?

157
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,419
There's something more important right now, Dad!

158
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:45,019
I know!

159
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:46,219
Inspector.

160
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:47,519
Start the search immediately!

161
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,619
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

162
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:15,819
I came alone just like you told me to.

163
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,819
I thought that it was done for when we hit the water,

164
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:28,119
but I'm glad that I got through to you.

165
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:30,519
More importantly, don't you have something to say?

166
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,019
Yeah.

167
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,919
Sorry. I had to make them think that we died.

168
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,319
Otherwise, his family would've been in danger.

169
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:46,119
Spare... Spare me.

170
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:49,419
Please spare me.

171
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:52,219
For your wife and child?

172
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:54,619
What a soap opera.

173
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,619
You talked, didn't you?

174
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,519
I... I didn't say anything!

175
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,519
I'll let you choose, then.

176
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,719
Either you let me get rid of your wife and child

177
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:12,519
or die here alone.

178
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,619
Whichever you like.

179
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,719
Come on.

180
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:30,719
Well, I don't mind,

181
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:33,619
but you've got to explain this to them yourself later.

182
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,619
I know.

183
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,119
Did you bring what I asked you to bring?

184
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:41,619
Yes, yes.

185
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,019
All right!

186
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:54,019
Hey, handle it nicely.

187
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,419
It took me two months to make it, you know.

188
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,919
Wow. You're able to make a program like this.

189
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,219
Elementary school kids nowadays sure are amazing.

190
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:08,219
Well, I used to be the same before.

191
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,319
"Program access form"

192
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,719
I thought so.

193
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:20,519
They've already started undoing the security system of their target

194
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,119
using my software.

195
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:26,619
So he wanted the password to confirm that after all.

196
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:28,819
Then the other one is for...

197
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,219
More importantly,

198
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:34,719
we've got to stop Zorro from committing his next crime.

199
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:37,919
Where is Zorro planning to attack?

200
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,519
The Beika City Central Event Hall.

201
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,319
Okay. Let's call the police.

202
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,519
Okay.

203
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:53,719
"ZR-Stunt Co"

204
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,419
"Communication Controls, Memory Controls, Security Controls"

205
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,819
"7th Crown Jewel Exhibition and Sale Party"

206
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,419
Finished setting the left side.

207
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,419
Finished setting the right side.

208
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,319
All set.

209
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,119
Three, two, one.

210
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,119
Go!

211
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,019
Let's go.

212
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,819
What?

213
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,619
I've been waiting for you, Zorro.

214
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,819
Too bad, tonight's party is canceled

215
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,519
because we knew that you'd be coming, Zorro.

216
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,919
-This can't be. -We heard voices just a while ago.

217
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,919
Shut up!

218
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,219
Voices? Do you perhaps mean this?

219
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,119
So, that's what it was.

220
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:13,119
I remember now! He's the kid we saw back then.

221
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,919
He's still alive.

222
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,019
Which means that that guy is alive, too.

223
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,419
Hey, little boy.

224
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,919
Just what are you talking about?

225
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,419
We're just plain stuntmen.

226
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:25,119
We were asked to perform at tonight's party.

227
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,219
It's useless playing dumb!

228
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,719
You can come in now.

229
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,519
Just as I thought.

230
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,719
But I'm sure we saw him fall down back then.

231
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,019
What on earth is going on?

232
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,319
Who cares!

233
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,519
Then just die here once more!

234
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,519
Go Mizorogi aka Zorro.

235
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:55,319
I'm arresting you on charges of armed robbery, arson and murder!

236
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,019
You two are equally guilty!

237
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,719
Surrender yourselves!

238
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,219
Okay. Let's go, Isehara.

239
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,019
Yes, sir.

240
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,919
Just as I thought.

241
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,719
I'll go and confirm it.

242
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,619
Yes, this is Megure.

243
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,619
Dr. Agasa.

244
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:46,119
You were fantastic this time.

245
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,319
What? There's still something more?

246
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:57,319
You really worked it out well, didn't you, Mr. Isehara?

247
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,519
What?

248
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,519
The fact is, she's not your wife

249
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,819
and the child isn't yours either.

250
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,219
You processed a picture you found on the internet,

251
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,219
and made it look like a picture of your family.

252
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,519
You used it as a tool to trick Zorro

253
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,719
into thinking you had a weak point so that he would trust you.

254
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,819
You were after the cash

255
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:18,919
that he stole and saved up to begin with.

256
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,019
Then you found his secret bank account

257
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,019
and the account number for it,

258
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,919
and fled from him back then.

259
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,419
That was when...

260
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,319
Just as I thought.

261
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,119
They've already started undoing the security system of their target

262
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,819
using my software.

263
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,019
Where is Zorro planning to attack?

264
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:46,619
Oh... The Beika City Central Event Hall.

265
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,619
Okay. Let's call the police.

266
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:49,719
Okay.

267
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,919
Conan and Ai figured it out.

268
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,319
It was indeed the password to remotely control an overseas account

269
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,419
and transfer all at once the entire account

270
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,119
to your own account.

271
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,619
This was because you assumed

272
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:14,519
that you'd be going free way sooner than Zorro.

273
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,319
Am I wrong?

274
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,719
Well, it's amazing how you figured all that out, Dr. Agasa.

275
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,519
We contacted Interpol

276
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,919
and froze that account.

277
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,919
So you won't be able to withdraw a cent from it, Isehara.

278
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,619
It's finally over.

279
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:14,619
No, not quite yet.

280
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,619
Don't fight.

281
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,819
Conan...

282
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:23,819
Well...

283
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,619
I'm sorry I made all of you worry.

284
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:28,219
I'm sorry!

285
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:30,119
-Don't run! -You're sorry?

286
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:32,219
You're really...

287
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,219
"Next Episode" -In that case,

288
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:47,619
I have some place I want to go.

289
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,419
We are the Origami Squadron...

290
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:52,819
the Nobuna Gaizers...

291
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:57,819
A local hero show.

292
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:01,719
I guess the heroes have some sort of lineage with Nobunaga Oda.

293
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:05,019
Are the people of Nobuna Gaizer here?

294
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:08,719
Next Conan,

295
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:11,519
"Nobunaga 450 (Yongomaru) Case"
