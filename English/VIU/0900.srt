1
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:22,351
I've gathered everyone together, just like you asked.

2
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:24,751
This is the perfect place, too.

3
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:26,851
I manage this property now.

4
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:30,151
It used to be some kind of research facility.

5
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:35,151
No matter how loudly we shout here, no one will hear us.

6
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:41,051
"Toichiro Azuma (44)" -So, have you figured out who tried to kill me?

7
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:45,952
Which one of these three is it?

8
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:54,251
Of course I know who tried to kill you, Mr. Azuma.

9
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:57,551
There's no mystery Kogoro Mouri cannot solve.

10
00:00:57,552 --> 00:01:01,952
All truths will be revealed!

11
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:07,251
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

12
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:09,351
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

13
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:11,651
Thanks to our viewers, we've reached 900 episodes!

14
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:14,151
The old man's a little different today.

15
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:15,751
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:17,851
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:20,352
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:05,779
"Solving Mysteries in a Locked Room"

19
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:13,078
Mr. Azuma came to my office yesterday evening

20
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,379
and said someone was trying to kill him.

21
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,378
A threatening phone call?

22
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,478
Yeah. They said they'd kill me.

23
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,178
I'm sure they were just trying to intimidate me, though.

24
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:32,478
But, sir, there's a chance they were serious.

25
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,878
As you can see, Kasai's worried about it,

26
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,378
so I thought I'd ask you to determine who called me.

27
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,979
"Haruhiko Kasai (32)" -I believe it's one of these three.

28
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:48,979
We think they may resent the president.

29
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:55,079
I see. You have a list of suspects.

30
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,478
Could you fill this out, please?

31
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,778
Now that The Great Detective Mouri has taken our case,

32
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:06,078
it's as good as solved.

33
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,879
I hope you're right.

34
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,278
The next day, or in other words, today,

35
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,779
I decided to begin my investigation.

36
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,778
Mr. Azuma has been pressuring me

37
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,878
"Benkichi Yamanami (52), Office Worker" -to sell this property.

38
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,478
My wife who was against it died in an accident the other day,

39
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,778
so I've decided to let it go.

40
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,078
But I realized something.

41
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,278
Mr. Azuma may have killed my wife.

42
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,078
What? So you stabbed him?

43
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:46,379
I told you, that wasn't me.

44
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,678
"Fukunishi Auto Repair, Inspections"

45
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,378
I didn't do it,

46
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:53,378
but I understand how they feel.

47
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:59,479
"Mitsuru Kitao (26)" -That Azuma jerk stole the land my dad left for me.

48
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,378
Him, too.

49
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,578
What's going on here?

50
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:08,578
Is it possible your father sold the property to Mr. Azuma?

51
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,779
Then where did the money from the sale go?

52
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,678
I see.

53
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,378
But, Ms. Tomurai,

54
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:21,278
it's true that you resent Mr. Azuma, isn't it?

55
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,478
Yes.

56
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,578
"Kana Tomurai (30), Waitress" -My father killed himself

57
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,278
after Azuma tricked him out of the property

58
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,178
that had been in our family for generations.

59
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:33,879
Murderers always get their comeuppance eventually.

60
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,278
It's true that all three of you are suspicious

61
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,278
but there's no damning evidence.

62
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,778
That's when the threat was turned into reality.

63
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,078
"Toto General Hospital"

64
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,978
I'm sorry!

65
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,678
It's because I left your side.

66
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,478
It's not your fault.

67
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:56,978
But...

68
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,178
It happened when I sent Kasai shopping.

69
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:03,279
It's like they were waiting for me to be alone.

70
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,079
It was someone wearing a ski mask.

71
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,078
What did the police say?

72
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,278
I haven't told the police.

73
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,378
What?

74
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,978
I don't want to get the police involved.

75
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:25,178
I conduct a lot of shady business.

76
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:28,578
But this is attempted murder!

77
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:31,578
Are you saying you can't solve the case without the police,

78
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,079
you incompetent detective?

79
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,878
Hurry up and figure out which of the three of them did it!

80
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:40,879
If I pay them enough, I'm sure they'll stop.

81
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,578
I went to the place where Mr. Azuma was attacked.

82
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,579
"Repairs in progress"

83
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,278
The security camera in the parking lot was undergoing repairs,

84
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,778
so I couldn't review the moment of the crime.

85
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:57,378
Darn it! I know it was one of you!

86
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,378
Confess already!

87
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,778
Now...

88
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,478
Later I went to your office

89
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,578
and spoke with a clerk named Ms. Suematsu.

90
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,078
"Sueko Suematsu (21)" -But Mr. Mouri didn't ask me

91
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,479
about those three.

92
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,178
They don't have any problems.

93
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:19,378
They're very close

94
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,079
and always whispering secrets to each other.

95
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,078
That made me realize their motive.

96
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,978
Mr. Kasai, it seems you've committed

97
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,878
a lot of crimes as Mr. Azuma's right hand man.

98
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,578
You can't conduct business without getting your hands dirty.

99
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,978
But the situation changed.

100
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,878
Your beloved sister

101
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,879
was unofficially offered a job at a first-class bank.

102
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,078
I thought we were just making small talk.

103
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,678
If your crimes came to light,

104
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:58,178
your sister would lose the offer.

105
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:02,378
Fearing that, you tried to kill Mr. Azuma, who knew your secret.

106
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,578
-I... -It was you?

107
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,778
No way!

108
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,478
You did this?

109
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,278
Darn it! Because of you...

110
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,278
No! It wasn't me!

111
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,978
You were captured on the security camera's footage.

112
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:17,979
But you just said

113
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,078
you couldn't review it because it was undergoing repairs.

114
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,478
The parking lot camera was.

115
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,878
Later I went to a nearby convenience store

116
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,979
to check their camera.

117
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,778
This is Mr. Kasai.

118
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,679
He's buying the things Mr. Azuma asked him to get.

119
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,378
What's this?

120
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:44,079
A ski mask...

121
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,778
Then what about these guys?

122
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:59,779
The three of them had nothing to do with this case...

123
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,878
This is it! The so-called...

124
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,278
Sleeping Kogoro.

125
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,178
Mr. Azuma was attacked by Mr. Kasai,

126
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,179
but there was someone who ordered him to do it.

127
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,379
What do you mean?

128
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:25,478
If Mr. Kasai had always planned to killed Mr. Azuma,

129
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:29,478
he would've killed him in secret instead of threatening him.

130
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:32,478
He had plenty of chances.

131
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:36,778
In other words, Mr. Kasai isn't the one who made the threat.

132
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:41,078
But since Mr. Kasai attempted to kill Mr. Azuma, it's natural to assume

133
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,878
he didn't choose to do it,

134
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,078
but was ordered to do it by someone else.

135
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,178
When you consider Mr. Kasai recommended

136
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,478
hiring me to investigate the case,

137
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,778
he must have received the order after that.

138
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:57,279
Perhaps Mr. Kasai was threatened late last night,

139
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,878
"I'll expose all the crimes you've committed."

140
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,878
"Your beloved sister will go down with you."

141
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,079
"If you want to protect your sister, kill Mr. Azuma."

142
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,379
Isn't that right, Benkichi Yamanami?

143
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,778
When I went to question you,

144
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,278
you had an expensive ballpoint pen.

145
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,978
It belonged to Mr. Kasai.

146
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,178
When you threatened him last night,

147
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,979
you likely picked it up after Mr. Kasai dropped it.

148
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,278
Surely you don't suspect me because we happen to have the same pen.

149
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,478
This is why I didn't want to do it!

150
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,878
Shut up!

151
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,178
In order to keep your hands clean,

152
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:47,879
you manipulated Mr. Kasai and made the threatening call.

153
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:54,078
By making the threat, you directed suspicion towards yourselves,

154
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,379
so Mr. Kasai could kill Mr. Azuma during that resulting opportunity.

155
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:02,778
You saw through my deception, Kogoro Mouri.

156
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,479
All I have now is my last resort!

157
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:17,778
It was all a lie, Mr. Mouri.

158
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,578
I see.

159
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,478
"Prank Show Successful! Nichiuri TV"

160
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:24,378
Our prank show was a huge success!

161
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:28,278
Our goal this time was for you to find the culprit behind a fake crime.

162
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,278
And see the astonished face you made

163
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,578
when he threatened to blow himself up.

164
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,178
We're all paid actors.

165
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,378
They were all acting according to script.

166
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,478
A prank show?

167
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:46,478
That explains everything.

168
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:49,078
You're not surprised, Mr. Mouri?

169
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,178
I thought something was up

170
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,279
when Mr. Azuma refused to notify the police.

171
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,878
Mr. Yamanami and Mr. Kitao's strange behaviors also make sense

172
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,279
when you realize they were playing to hidden cameras.

173
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,878
Impressive, Mr. Mouri!

174
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,378
We're a small theater troupe.

175
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:19,478
This job was given to us by Nichiuri TV's Ms. Tomurai.

176
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:22,178
She's the one who wrote the script.

177
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,578
Normally we do comedies,

178
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,678
so this serious performance was exciting for us.

179
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,778
But since you suspected we were up to something,

180
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,378
you can't call this a huge success.

181
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,078
No, it was.

182
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,978
I hope you're right.

183
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:42,878
-Now let's get out of here. -It's over.

184
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,678
We're getting grilled meat tonight, right?

185
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,578
Who is she?

186
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,778
Huh? The door won't open, Ms. Tomurai.

187
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,178
Huh? I can't get the bomb off.

188
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,978
Excuse us, staff?

189
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,278
Could someone get this off him?

190
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,678
There's no point in calling them.

191
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,779
We're the only ones here.

192
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,879
This is when the real show begins!

193
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:23,171
The story about filming a prank show was a lie.

194
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:26,071
We were never filming or recording in the first place.

195
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:30,372
And naturally, I'm not an employee of Nichiuri TV either.

196
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,371
It's locked.

197
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:39,872
I can't have you escaping and calling the police.

198
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,471
Darn it. There's no service.

199
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,071
Of course not.

200
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:47,671
This building blocks phone signals.

201
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:53,371
I've been searching for the perfect place for two months,

202
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:56,171
so I could execute this detective.

203
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,671
Execute?

204
00:13:57,672 --> 00:14:00,471
What's wrong with her?

205
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,871
Darn. I won't let her kill him.

206
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:05,472
Crap! My shoes are out for maintenance!

207
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:10,171
You just sit there quietly and watch,

208
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:13,072
if you don't want your friend to blow up.

209
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:18,171
I installed the same detonator

210
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:22,571
on the dynamite wrapped around you.

211
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:26,071
You mean this isn't a prop?

212
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:28,972
Darn! What should I do?

213
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:46,571
Please do something, Mr. Mouri!

214
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:47,971
Save us!

215
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,971
Mr. Mouri...

216
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,272
Move. You'll get caught in the crossfire.

217
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:01,871
You said you'll execute me,

218
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:04,071
but what have I ever done to you?

219
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:05,872
Who are you?

220
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:09,571
Why don't you guess?

221
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:12,271
Aren't you the world's greatest detective?

222
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:15,471
You have a strong grudge against me.

223
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:18,271
You have a gun and explosives.

224
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:20,071
You could've surprised me

225
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:23,271
or thrown a bomb into my office,

226
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:26,071
but instead you went through the trouble of writing a script

227
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,871
and having me solve a mystery.

228
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:32,671
It was so I'd become the Sleeping Kogoro.

229
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:35,571
In other words, you don't hate the Ordinary Kogoro.

230
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:39,072
You hate the Sleeping Kogoro.

231
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:44,172
And you spent two months preparing.

232
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:46,472
Two months?

233
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:51,271
Murderers always get their comeuppance eventually.

234
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:55,371
Are you Takashi Utsubo's...

235
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,971
Impressive, Sleeping Kogoro.

236
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:00,671
Of course I swore revenge.

237
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:03,371
If not for your meddling detective work,

238
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:06,071
Utsubo wouldn't have gone to jail.

239
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:08,271
He wouldn't have died!

240
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:11,172
I see. You're Utsubo's...

241
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:17,071
Utsubo was a good man.

242
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:19,071
He was handsome and intelligent.

243
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:23,072
But he used his intelligence the wrong way.

244
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:27,971
Six months ago, Utsubo disguised a murder

245
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:31,571
as a suicide using a clever trick.

246
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,971
I solved the case as the Sleeping Kogoro,

247
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,971
and Utsubo was imprisoned for murder.

248
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:41,372
"Takashi Utsubo (33), Criminal"

249
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:46,671
Two months ago,

250
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,871
Utsubo suddenly fell ill.

251
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:51,871
He died in prison.

252
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:55,371
You took Utsubo from me forever!

253
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:57,971
Isn't your anger completely unjustified?

254
00:16:57,972 --> 00:16:59,271
Shut up!

255
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:02,771
I did suspect something,

256
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:07,172
but I didn't realize there was another plot behind it.

257
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:12,371
I had to execute you while you were the Sleeping Kogoro.

258
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:14,371
I feel a little sorry for you,

259
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:16,171
but killing a detective

260
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:20,471
while he's proudly laying out his reasoning

261
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,971
is the ultimate irony.

262
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:26,171
Watch this, all of you.

263
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:28,171
I trapped you in here

264
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,671
so you could tell the world

265
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:34,371
about the great Kogoro Mouri's final moments.

266
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,971
Goodbye, Sleeping Kogoro.

267
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,572
Say hello to Utsubo for me.

268
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:42,572
Stop!

269
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:46,671
Don't shoot him!

270
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:49,671
Please! Don't shoot!

271
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:53,671
Move! If you get in the way, I'll shoot you too!

272
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,572
You'll shoot a child?

273
00:17:57,072 --> 00:18:00,672
You wouldn't shoot a child, would you?

274
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:04,672
You're right.

275
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,671
Kid, if you don't move,

276
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,872
I'll blow up that man over there.

277
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,472
But...

278
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:19,071
I know! Make her laugh.

279
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:20,072
What?

280
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:21,871
Once she laughs,

281
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:25,472
I'm sure she'll feel stupid about trying to get revenge.

282
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,971
In that case, there's that thing for our next performance.

283
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:33,672
That's hilarious. All right.

284
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,971
You're wasting time.

285
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:44,372
I don't have time for your stupid acts.

286
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:47,272
It didn't work.

287
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:53,471
Now, move.

288
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:57,471
No matter how much you stall, I won't give up.

289
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:59,371
No one's coming to save you.

290
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,871
A cockroach!

291
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,871
Mouse! Snake!

292
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:06,271
Centipede! Hornet!

293
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,971
I don't know what to do if Pops dies.

294
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:11,571
I won't be able to go to school.

295
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:14,472
I won't be able to eat anymore.

296
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:19,971
Please don't kill him.

297
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:23,472
His family will be so sad, too.

298
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:27,671
Don't you have family, too?

299
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:29,771
Regain your humanity!

300
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:32,171
You'll regret shooting him!

301
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,371
It's not too late!

302
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:38,271
Throw away your gun and detonator, okay?

303
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:41,972
Please don't kill him.

304
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:48,672
Please don't kill him.

305
00:19:52,372 --> 00:19:54,171
Please...

306
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:55,872
Get up.

307
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:02,571
There's nothing I hate more than sob stories.

308
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:03,972
It's crude.

309
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:11,772
That should be enough.

310
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:14,771
She's going to shoot!

311
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:19,071
She's going to kill Pops!

312
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:23,372
Pops! Pops Kogoro!

313
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:33,472
No, you don't!

314
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,772
You'll never get your way!

315
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:46,072
You brat!

316
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:49,671
Move! Let go!

317
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:51,572
Darn it!

318
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,371
Gosh.

319
00:20:57,372 --> 00:21:01,171
What's everyone screaming about?

320
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,472
What's going on here?

321
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:08,271
I'm out of time.

322
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:09,671
Kid.

323
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:14,771
Your protests, jokes, and tears.

324
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:19,471
You were buying time to fill that bottle with water.

325
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:20,571
Well, yeah.

326
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,371
Hey.

327
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:24,971
What's this talk about buying time?

328
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:27,271
Well...

329
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:30,271
And what are they doing?

330
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:36,072

Hey, we could turn this into a play.

332
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:11,771
I'm saved.

333
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:14,371
I'll be the dynamite man.

334

You never learn.

335
00:23:18,472 --> 00:23:20,671
I want to play the detective.

00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:36,572
A prank show? Was there a film shoot?

341
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:40,972
It's a long story.

Huh? You're starting to sound like Eri.

345
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,871
Really?

I don't like it!

347
