1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,710
Whoa, the numbers are lined up.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,860
It’s 1:11.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,400
So, what does that mean?

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,160
It's my lucky day!

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,840
Is-is that so?

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,630
Today’s dinner might be eel rice.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,920
Hey, you guys, we’ll leave you behind!

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,960
It’s the policeman.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,420
They look like in a hurry to the scene.

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,300
Something might happened.

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,090
Calm down. Please calm down.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,039
You can take it slow.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,630
So please tell us...

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,100
I was pushed down by unknown young woman!

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,770
From the top of this stone stair!

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,140
Uhm, is there any witnesses?

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,060
Not good.

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,870
The only clue is that young woman.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,190
That person…

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,570
Hey, big bro over there!

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,480
Did you perhaps notice anyone suspicious?

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,420
Huh?

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,100
Did you see the culprit?

24
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,420
Uhm, no…

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,020
I didn’t see anything.

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,360
Well, then…

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,070
So it's not the case.

28
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,640
He seemed to want to say something.

29
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,170
He might be really saw something.

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,780
But why did he said that he didn’t saw anything?

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,960
Perhaps he doesn’t want to be involved with the police.

32
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,110
Huh?

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,890
Perhaps...

34
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,880
He might be doing something bad himself.

35
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,530
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

36
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,490
unraveling mysteries that comes before sleep.

37
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,300
The witness who refuses to talk.

38
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,000
What is the truth behind this incident?

39
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,750
He sees through the one and only truth.

40
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,579
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

41
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,910
His name is Detective Conan.

42
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,780
An unspeakable alibi.

43
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,770
If he’s trying to do something...

44
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,200
We won’t let him, right?

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,220
He’s wearing black shirt and has a medium height.

46
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,770
A bald man.

47
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,980
Well, I don’t see him.

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,810
Hey!

49
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,580
I got him! Over there!

50
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,150
Ah… That person?

51
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,380
He is Mr. Kanieda.

52
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,110
He lives at Shikabone City.

53
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,690
Shikabone is very far away.

54
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,800
Yeah.

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,650
It’s an hour ride from Beika City even with a car.

56
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,450
Is he a regular customer?

57
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,780
I think today is his first.

58
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,000
Then, why do you know his name?

59
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,650
Someone called him from the phone.

60
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,409
Um, there should be a customer named Kanieda

61
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,560
from Shikabone City over there.

62
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,540
Please wait.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,509
Among the customers,

64
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,870
Is there any Kanieda from Shikabone City?

65
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,540
Yes. It’s me!

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,540
Kanieda from Shikabone City.

67
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,330
I’m Kanieda from Shikabone City.

68
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,540
Hello… Thank you for yesterday.

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,720
What?

70
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,989
I see.

71
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,900
Then, let’s reschedule the meeting.

72
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,660
Okay. Well then…

73
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,780
He had a meeting at 1 pm but his friend couldn’t make it.

74
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,460
Isn't that the phone call about?

75
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,150
After that, he left in a hurry.

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,339
Aside from answering the phone,

77
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,890
did he do something unusual?

78
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,709
Something unusual?

79
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,400
I don’t think so.

80
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,610
Ah, if you guys are searching for him.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,610
Can you give this lighter to him?

82
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,370
He left it here.

83
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,450
Okay!

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,480
That is it.

85
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,720
I have no idea what he was doing.

86
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,610
What do you mean?

87
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,510
Well…

88
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,930
At the beginning, his destination is the shopping district.

89
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,590
Delicious!!

90
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,710
Ah, so delicious!

91
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,519
This is my first time eating something like this.

92
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,440
Aaah, so delicious!

93
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,560
Then, his destination is 100-Yen Shop.

94
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,810
Hmm. This is quite good.

95
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,250
Hey, how much is it?

96
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,180
Eh, wait, of course it’s 100 yen!

97
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,400
What a stupid question!

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,530
After that, he walked around for a while in that area.

99
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,330
Whoa… What a cute baby…

100
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,780
And he looks like a smart baby.

101
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,940
Ah… there, there.

102
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,520
Meanwhile he was being concerned about something,

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,080
He wandered around Beika City for an hour.

104
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,160
Hello? Ah, yes.

105
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,150
Yes, I see.

106
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes.

107
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,310
He rode the train and left for somewhere.

108
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,210
He doesn’t make sense at all, right?

109
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,860
In the first place, if he does something bad,

110
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,530
Normally, he will avoid people and be careful.

111
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,330
But that person did the opposite...

112
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,940
He behaved as if he was drawing people’s attention.

113
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,780
In addition, although we followed him all day

114
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,020
there was nothing related to the incident.

115
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,690
If he did something bad, I think we missed it.

116
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,880
Nope. He’s definitely strange.

117
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,980
That Kanieda…

118
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,720
He brought a cell phone, didn’t he?

119
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,900
But, why was he being called from the coffee shop?

120
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh!

121
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
He even took the inner line.

122
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,790
That is the opposite direction if he wants to return to Shikabone City.

123
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,309
That train is…

124
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:02,420
Beika
Midoridai
Kokubo

125
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,219
If he stops at the next station, Midoridai,
Beika
Midoridai
Kokubo

126
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:05,228
Kokubo
Beika
If he stops at the next station, Midoridai,

127
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:05,238
Midoridai Station
If he stops at the next station, Midoridai,
Kokubo

128
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:05,320
If he stops at the next station, Midoridai,
Midoridai Station

129
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:06,990
Midoridai Station

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,160
He tried to do something in Midoridai.

131
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,740
But, where is he now?

132
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,810
We can try asking the police.

133
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,660
That is…

134
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,950
It’s him!

135
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,610
But he’s with Officer Takagi.

136
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,340
Did he get him? Something is definitely—!

137
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,760
His destination is probably…

138
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,190
Midoridai  Police Station.

139
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,179
Huh? That person is Mr. Usui?

140
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,539
Eiichi Usui (35)
Huh? That person is Mr. Usui?

141
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:40,700
Eiichi Usui (35)

142
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,839
Yes, he is.
Eiichi Usui (35)

143
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:41,910
Eiichi Usui (35)

144
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,530
He is Mr. Eiichi Usui who lives in Midoridai.

145
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,270
I’ve even checked his driver’s license.

146
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,850
Then, why did he used a fake name of Kanieda from Shikabone City?

147
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,340
Besides…

148
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,379
Hey, Officer Takagi.

149
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,910
In the first place, why is that person with the police?

150
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,290
He is an important witness for an assault case.

151
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,690
Just a while ago, in the back of Midoridai Park,

152
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,700
A man was beaten with a log and collapses.

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,980
He was found by a woman living nearby.

154
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,040
The victim is Mr. Takeru Hachiya who lives in Midoridai.

155
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,240
Shit!

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,250
Takeru Hachiya (45)

157
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:22,429
 I don’t know who, they suddenly hit me from behind.
Takeru Hachiya (45)

158
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:22,820
 I don’t know who, they suddenly hit me from behind.

159
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,619
Hey! You police should quickly catch the culprit

160
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,280
and bring them in front of me!

161
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,990
Well, the reputation of that neighborhood is not so good.

162
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,630
There is a man who was having a heated argument Mr. Hachiya, right?

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,380
A few days ago in front of the station,

164
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:41,799
Kakimoto Sueko (28)
A few days ago in front of the station,

165
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,350
Kakimoto Sueko (28)

166
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,850
I’ve seen that man several times wandering around.

167
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,940
I don’t think he’s a resident of Midoridai.

168
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,080
Inspector!

169
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,930
We found something like this over there!

170
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,840
Huh?

171
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,150
 E, U?

172
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,110
Eiichi, Usui.

173
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,120
He is the most important witness in this case.

174
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,350
I admit that I have a grudge against Hachiya.

175
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,260
But, I’ve lost the pen somewhere and I haven’t been to the park.

176
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,310
Then, Mr. Hachiya was attacked is today afternoon at around 1 PM.

177
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,250
Where and what did you do at that time?

178
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,060
Tha-that is…

179
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,080
Why can’t you say it?

180
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,790
I don’t remember.

181
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,000
What?

182
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,470
Yeah, I have a temporary memory loss at that time.

183
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,160
Maybe, he will be taken as the culprit.

184
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,890
That man is too suspicious.

185
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,250
Hold on.

186
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,840
That Hachiya was attacked today afternoon at around 1 PM?

187
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,020
Yes, according to Mr. Hachiya’s testimony.

188
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,860
Then, that person is innocent.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,020
Huh?

190
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,500
He has an alibi.

191
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,050
Around that time, he was in Beika City.

192
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,180
That’s right.

193
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,920
Yeah!

194
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
Huh?

195
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,350
At that time, that person forgot something in Beika City.

196
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,560
His fingerprints should be there.

197
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,620
What? Conan and the kids are...

198
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,160
the witness?

199
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,970
What is that?

200
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,390
There is a testimony that you were in Beika City during the incident.

201
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,410
That’s not true!

202
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,220
I’ve never been in Beika City before!

203
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,670
Huh?

204
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,260
He denied it!?

205
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,450
Yeah.

206
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,640
He said it was definitely wrong person.

207
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,610
But…

208
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,840
Excuse me, Officer Takagi.

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,950
I see, thank you.

210
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,710
About the previous lighter,

211
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,040
there is no trace of Mr. Usui’s fingerprint on it.

212
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,420
Huh?

213
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,180
In other word, the person that you saw in Beika City...

214
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,310
He is not Mr. Usui Eiichi.

215
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,300
It’s different person.

216
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,930
It must be him!

217
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,380
I think so!

218
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,090
If that so, that Usui person,

219
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,140
he has an alibi but why can’t he say it?

220
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,940
There must be a lot of circumstances.

221
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,260
Could it be…

222
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,790
Found it!

223
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,440
As I thought, that person is real,

224
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,480
that Kanieda from Shikabone City.

225
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,420
He seems to be living alone.

226
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,610
Akira Kanieda.

227
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,980
We might found something if we ask this person.

228
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,910
About the mystery of Eiichi Usui.

229
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,060
Whoa! Today is also lined up!

230
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,750
I must be really lucky.

231
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,920
Hey! Let’s go quickly!

232
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,480
Yeah!

233
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,730
Ah, wait for me!

234
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,210
Huh?

235
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,360
Is Mr. Kanieda admitted to the hospital?

236
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,630
Yes. He was hit by a car.

237
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,240
Yesterday afternoon at the other side of the station.

238
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,760
Traffic accident.

239
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,790
If you have business with Akira, shall we meet him together?

240
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,060
Is that okay?

241
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,340
I’m going to visit him in the hospital after this.

242
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,730
Shikabone General Hospital.

243
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,409
According to the nurse,

244
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,640
his wound is light but he hasn't regained his consciousness.

245
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,210
Akira, I'm coming.

246
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,759
Huh, this person is—?

247
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,190
Akira Kanieda (36)

248
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,939
He is Akira Kanieda.
Akira Kanieda (36)

249
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,100
Akira Kanieda (36)

250
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,280
He is so similar.

251
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,270
With that Usui.

252
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,000
He looks exactly the same.

253
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,329
But why did he went to the south of station?

254
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,240
That is the demon gate.

255
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,320
Demon gate?

256
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,680
Yeah.

257
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,190
Since Akira’s father passed away, he lives with his mother.

258
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:47,779
One year ago, his mother went to visit a dentist, Doctor Saruwatari,

259
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,030
Saruwatari Kanzo (40)

260
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:50,119
in the south of station to get her dentures.
Saruwatari Kanzo (40)

261
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,230
in the south of station to get her dentures.

262
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,350
But soon, unlucky thing happened.

263
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,040
Mother, I’m home.

264
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,360
You’ll catch a cold if you sleep in that place.

265
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,170
Hey, Mother…

266
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,260
Mother?

267
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,200
Mother!

268
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,660
Hang in there, Mother!

269
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,350
The dentures were clogged in her throat when she was napping.

270
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,600
Thus, she passed away.

271
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,890
It’s not an incident!

272
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,840
That’s not an incident!

273
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,800
This was the denture's mistake!

274
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,010
That shitty doctor, Saruwatari, has made my mother—!

275
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,490
That’s only a resentment, Akira.

276
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,170
That shitty doctor… My mother…

277
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,720
Because of that dentist…

278
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,430
The south of the station is demon gate, right?

279
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,190
Then, what was he doing there?

280
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,930
Akira Kanieda’s accident was yesterday afternoon.

281
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,160
 Could it be around 1 PM?

282
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,460
Yeah, a little past 1 PM.

283
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,930
I thought so.

284
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,780
It’s around the time that Usui started wandering around Beika City.

285
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,270
It’s around the time we saw that lined up number.

286
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,320
Then, what is the meaning?

287
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,970
If my deduction is correct…

288
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,640
When Akira Kanieda was being brought by ambulance,

289
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,980
 did he had any belongings?

290
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,240
Belongings?

291
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,120
What is this?

292
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,470
Gloves and rope?

293
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,460
Did  he plan to do something?

294
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,510
Don’t tell me...

295
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,510
Yeah… probably.

296
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,440
Saruwatari Dental Clinic - Shikabone City
Consultation Time 9:30-12:00
14:00-17:00
Morning registration is until noon
Afternoon consultation starts from 14:00

297
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,650
Doctor Saruwatari lives alone.

298
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,090
And it seems he always eats lunch at his own house which is next to the clinic.

299
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,470
Then, it's just like what you observed.

300
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,740
Yeah, maybe he aimed for that time.

301
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,409
Midoridai Apartment

302
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,429
I got the landlord's testimony.
Midoridai Apartment

303
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:54,460
I got the landlord's testimony.

304
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,879
Mr. Usui used to have long hair,

305
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,400
but he suddenly shaved his head the day before yesterday.

306
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,910
I don't really know what's happening.

307
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,300
Those kids want to meet you no matter what.

308
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,100
Umm, have we met somewhere?

309
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,280
We did, yesterday.

310
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,380
In Beika City.

311
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,590
That is—!

312
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,379
This is not the case of wrong person.

313
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,260
We definitely met him.

314
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,730
No, I’ve never been in Beika City.

315
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,460
You were asked by Mr. Akira Kanieda, right?

316
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,040
For his murder plan of the dentist,

317
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,990
 he wanted you to serve as a replacement.

318
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,480
I see. That kind of murder plan.

319
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,610
Right.

320
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,100
Whatever happened, Mr. Kanieda couldn’t forgive Doctor Saruwatari,

321
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,230
and wanted to take revenge for his mother.

322
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,150
But, he could be easily being suspected due to his motive.

323
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,780
At that time, he met Mr. Usui by chance and came up with this idea.

324
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,690
He took advantage of their physical similarity,

325
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,700
and falsified his alibi for the crime.

326
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,460
So you are a collaborator of that murder plan?

327
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,990
It’s bullshit!

328
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,740
You look unemployed so you were offered some money, right?

329
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,710
I have an interesting offer for you.

330
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,380
Something that only you can do.

331
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,310
This is the down payment, take it.

332
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,090
If it succeeds, I will double it!

333
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,550
It’s not a bad offer, right?

334
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,650
It’s bullshit!

335
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,980
And yesterday was the the execution day.

336
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,530
Mr. Kanieda made Mr. Usui, who had hairstyle similar to him,

337
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,230
headed to Beika City that is far away from Shikabone City.

338
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,680
You entered the coffee shop that had been prepared in advance

339
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,470
and made a phone call at the right time.

340
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,950
Excuse me,

341
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,130
there should be a customer named Kanieda from Shikabone City over there.

342
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,910
Yes, that’s me!

343
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,760
 Kanieda from Shikabone City!

344
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,860
Now he can make an alibi with multiple witnesses.

345
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,579
In addition, by attaching his own fingerprint on the lighter,

346
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,590
this will also served as a proof.

347
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,480
Whit this, Mr. Kanieda has secured a fake alibi

348
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,390
and then headed to kill Doctor Saruwatari.

349
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,380
His morning schedule will be over at noon.

350
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,220
Even if it’s delayed a bit, it should be over at 1 PM.

351
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,860
After that, the doctor will take his lunch at his residence.

352
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,430
Mr. Kanieda will sneak in there.

353
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,680
He planned to kill the doctor with the rope.

354
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,120
That was the plan, isn't it?

355
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,400
When the afternoon consultation starts at 2 pm and the doctor doesn't show up.

356
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,220
Naturally someone will check and discover the body.

357
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,960
It will be clear that he was killed during lunch break, from 1 PM to 2 PM.

358
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,140
He just had to make an alibi for that one hour.

359
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,260
On the other hand,

360
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,210
Mr. Usui had witnessed a grandma’s push-down incident in Beika City.

361
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,120
But you can’t give any testimony, right?

362
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,500
If you become a witness, the police will ask for your identity.

363
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,719
Even if you introduced yourself as
Akira Kanieda from Shikabone City,

364
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,750
the name in your driver license is different.

365
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,600
That’s why you said that you saw nothing and ran away.

366
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,070
You keep creating alibi for Mr. Kanieda, right?

367
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,730
You deliberately showing off yourself so people in the city will notice you.

368
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,990
Since you kept hiding your alibi.

369
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,690
It means that your alibi will raise suspicion.

370
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,200
You think it will be better to be
a suspect of injuring Mr. Hachiya,

371
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,960
if compared to be a murder's accomplice, thus you insist to hide your alibi.

372
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,650
But your act is useless.

373
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,030
In the middle of heading to Doctor Saruwatari’s place,

374
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,550
Mr. Kanieda was involved in a traffic accident.

375
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,200
In the end, he couldn’t kill the doctor.

376
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,860
Huh?

377
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,910
Huh?

378
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,960
What?

379
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,440
So if I just confessed that I was creating a fake alibi at Beika City,

380
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,350
it won't be a problem for me?

381
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,290
What the hell these past three days?

382
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,010
I’m beaten.

383
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,550
You fool!

384
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,550
It's just a coincidence that you didn’t have to be a collaborator in the murder!

385
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,200
You’re right.

386
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,100
It’s my phone…

387
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,700
Incoming Call

388
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,099
It’s okay to answer it.
Incoming Call

389
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,210
Incoming Call

390
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:37,720
Uh, yes.
Incoming Call

391
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,320
Uh, yes.

392
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,090
Yes, hello?

393
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,860
Yes.

394
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,200
 Ah, that’s good!

395
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,080
 Okay, well then.

396
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,070
It’s Mr. Kanieda.

397
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,789
He thought that being hit by a car is a heaven's punishment,

398
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,500
he doesn’t want to think about revenge anymore.

399
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,630
I’m truly sorry for the trouble I caused!

400
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,760
For now, let’s get your testimony.

401
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,130
Takagi, Chiba.

402
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,630
Make an arrangement for Mr. Kanieda.

403
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,810
Yes!

404
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,530
But the investigation of the assault case is still ongoing.

405
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,800
That’s right! Who is the culprit?

406
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,790
Mr. Usui didn’t even go there but his ballpoint dropped in the scene.

407
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,910
It means that the real culprit set it up.

408
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,310
The one who has that chance is…

409
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,780
Could it be?

410
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,160
The first witness?

411
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,310
That woman!

412
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,449
A few days ago,

413
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,010
I had the idea when I saw Usui had a heated argument with Hachiya.

414
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,000
I intend to make him the culprit and I want to smack that old man Hachiya.

415
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,629
That ballpoint as well,

416
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,620
he dropped it that time and I picked it then I used it yesterday.

417
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,870
Even if Usui has an alibi,

418
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,760
I thought the police would make up for it.

419
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,730
“He must have used a clever trick.”

420
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,160
You’ll say something like that.

421
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,960
My head is dizzy.

422
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,100
You’ll have to work seriously from now on!

423
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,910
Yeah. Forgive me for causing you guys trouble.

424
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,530
Ah, by the way.

425
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,130
You saw them, right?

426
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,690
The culprit who pushed that grandma from stone stair.

427
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,940
That’s right.

428
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,720
Did you see them?

429
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,580
No, I really didn’t see anything.

430
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,130
Because…

431
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay, like this…

432
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,860
I was pushed down, someone help me!

433
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,350
So, that was nonsense?

434
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,540
That’s right.

435
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,430
But, why does she acts like that…

436
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,720
Ah! Is that person the rumored noisy grandma?

437
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,230
I’ve heard about that too.

438
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,480
She loves creating big fuss while nothing happens,

439
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,620
such an annoying grandma!

440
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,520
It sounds true.

441
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,630
We should tell the police about that too.

442
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,840
Because they’re still searching for the culprit.

443
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,670
But, more importantly...

444
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,280
We solved three cases in one day!

445
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,040
Youth Detective Squad is the best!

446
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,550
This is also thanks to my "perfect lined up number”.

447
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,950
Don’t get full of yourself!

448
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,510
RX-7 FD3S!

449
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,900
Huh? Zero wanted to ride it too?

450
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,220
 After all, it shares the same nickname, Zero.

451
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,470
I-it’s not like that.

452
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,520
If it isn’t the gate to failure,

453
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,960
then it’s the brake.

454
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,990
Don't bite your tongue.

455
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,830
Slam it! Zero!

456
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,820
