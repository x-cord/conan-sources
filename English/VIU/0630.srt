1
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:05,995
We came to enjoy staying at a pension on a southern island,

2
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:08,595
and ran into actor Mr. Yuya Miyasaka

3
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:12,595
who was shooting a promotion video with his staff.

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:16,495
Ever since he got caught for an assault case a year ago,

5
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:18,295
Mr. Miyasaka's popularity had been on a downfall.

6
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:22,295
The promotion video was being made to regain his popularity.

7
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:25,795
However, since he forced his staff to do unreasonable stunts,

8
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,395
and at times got violent with them,

9
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,995
discontent was growing among the staff.

10
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,295
Mr. Miyasaka's ex-girlfriend

11
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:35,295
as well as the co-starring actress, Ms. Saeko Akimoto

12
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:37,695
seems to have ill feelings

13
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:42,295
against the relationship between him and make-up artist, Miki Kitagawa.

14
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:45,795
And a crime was committed along with the coming of the storm.

15
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:48,395
Mr. Miyasaka was killed

16
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:52,395
in his room in the pension by someone.

17
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:54,295
A murder is committed in a pension closed off

18
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,595
because of violent wind and rain.

19
00:00:56,595 --> 00:01:00,295
The culprit is unmistakably in here!

20
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,395
Like the fog clears.

21
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:06,595
Let's see through love and crime as well.

22
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:08,495
The uncomfortable something that Conan feels at the scene of the crime.

23
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:10,695
The truth that was recorded on the video camera.

24
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,195
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:14,195
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:16,395
His name is Detective Conan.

27
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,370
"Promotion Video Filming (Part 2)"

28
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,470
"Mitsuo Okita (23), Camera Assistant"

29
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,570
"Shingo Takayama (28), Cameraman" -Hey.

30
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,570
Just how long do we have to stay in this room?

31
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,170
"Osamu Kurohashi (43), Pension Owner" -Until the police arrive.

32
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,870
"Keiko Kurahashi (38), Osamu's Wife" -If we all stay in the same room,

33
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,670
the culprit won't be able to get away.

34
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,470
"Saeko Akimoto (25), Actress" -Get away?

35
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,670
Where on earth can you get away to

36
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,370
on an isolated island in the storm?

37
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,570
"Yamamoto Eiji (21), Assistant Director" -I'm not the culprit,

38
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,970
so I don't have to run.

39
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,570
"Kitagawa Miki (22), Make-up Artist"

40
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,270
I'm going back to my room.

41
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,870
If you want to suspect me as being the culprit, suit yourself.

42
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,570
Rather than that, is the police really going to come?

43
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,070
Mr. Takayama,

44
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,870
you really seem concerned about the police, don't you?

45
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,570
Don't tell me that you're...

46
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,970
The culprit?

47
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,470
What's the big deal?

48
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,570
I just asked because the police is late getting here!

49
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,570
Done with the recording of testimonies!

50
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,870
I'm leaving too!

51
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,070
It's even more suspicious because he's acting so upset.

52
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,970
May I go back to my room too?

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,770
Me too, then.

54
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,370
If all the four without alibis have left this room,

55
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,070
there's no reason why we should be here anymore, is there?

56
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,770
Excuse me.

57
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,970
Everybody's gone.

58
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,670
I'm sort of hungry.

59
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,970
Of course you're hungry, it's already this late.

60
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,370
I'll bring some dishes I can get ready right away and bring them here.

61
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,670
Awesome!

62
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,470
I wonder if that man named Mr. Takayama is the culprit after all?

63
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,970
Well, I wonder about that.

64
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,070
He did look as if he was afraid of the police though.

65
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,070
That uncomfortable feeling that something wasn't right

66
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,170
when I saw Mr. Miyasaka's body.

67
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,870
I can't helped being bothered about it.

68
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,570
I've got no choice.

69
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,770
If I can't watch the video that was taken,

70
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,270
I'll just have to go back to the scene of the crime again and confirm.

71
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,470
I don't have my wallet.

72
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,370
I may have dropped it in Mr. Miyasaka's room when I went in a while ago.

73
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,370
Huh?

74
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,370
How do you know that you didn't drop in other place

75
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,670
rather than Mr. Miyasaka's room?

76
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,370
I've got this feeling.

77
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,670
Don't do that to me.

78
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,770
Okay, I'll go get it for you, then.

79
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,370
I'll go with you!

80
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,570
You wait here.

81
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,870
Poor thing,

82
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,570
the knife is stabbed so deeply into him.

83
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,370
Oh, no.

84
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,770
He's completely cold...

85
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,870
I found my wallet over here!

86
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,070
So you found it?

87
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,370
Strange.

88
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,370
The uncomfortable feeling of something being wrong

89
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,170
when I first saw him is gone.

90
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,470
Was it just my imagination?

91
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,770
We're eating...

92
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,770
It's good!

93
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,370
It sure is good.

94
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,170
I'm glad.

95
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,970
I wonder if Conan found his wallet?

96
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,370
Miki!

97
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,470
I just don't feel comfortable, just the two of us.

98
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,470
Could I stay here with you?

99
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,170
Sure. Dinner's ready too.

100
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,370
Come here next to me.

101
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,770
Thank you.

102
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,570
Miki, what's the matter?

103
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,670
I just saw

104
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,070
Mr. Takayama run by outside the window.

105
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,970
In this storm?

106
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,670
It can't be!

107
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,570
So, Mr. Takayama was the culprit after all!

108
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,870
I see. He got scared that the police would come

109
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,970
and decided to run for it!

110
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,670
Hey, you guys?

111
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,270
Mr. Kurahashi!

112
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,470
What's the matter?

113
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,370
Did something happen?

114
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,070
The culprit fled!

115
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,170
The culprit?

116
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,070
Mr. Takayama!

117
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,570
Miki saw Mr. Takayama

118
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,770
outside the window fleeing!

119
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,770
Are you sure he went in this direction?

120
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,770
Yes.

121
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,670
He went running eastward.

122
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,870
But, there's a cliff ahead and it's a dead end.

123
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,670
Hey, Mr. Takayama!

124
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,970
Hey!

125
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,070
Mr. Takayama!

126
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,170
This is...

127
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,070
Mr. Takayama.

128
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,270
They're exhausted and all fell asleep.

129
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,970
After Mr. Miyasaka, now Mr. Takayama is dead.

130
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,770
He was probably fleeing and couldn't see in the dark,

131
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,870
so slipped and fell over the cliff.

132
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,470
How stupid can he get.

133
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,070
But, at least it's good that we know who the culprit was, now.

134
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,570
So, the case is closed.

135
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,070
But I wonder if Mr. Takayama was really the culprit?

136
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,170
Of course, there's no mistake about it!

137
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,770
Can you think of another reason

138
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,270
why someone would go bursting out on a stormy night like this?

139
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,770
But, he should've known that even if he went bursting out,

140
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,570
there is no way off this island, right?

141
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,370
Well...

142
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,170
Let's say that Mr. Takayama was the culprit,

143
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,870
the story fits into place too well for him to coincidentally lose his life.

144
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,470
Maybe Mr. Takayama was also killed.

145
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,870
In other words,

146
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,970
we haven't cleared off the list of suspects yet, have we?

147
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,270
Since Mr. Takayama is dead,

148
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,370
you probably want to say that the three of us,

149
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,970
that is, Mr. Okita, Yamamoto and I are the suspects, right?

150
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,970
I'm not the culprit!

151
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,470
I'll show you proof of it right now!

152
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,870
I'll show you the video that I took when I went to Mr. Miyasaka's room!

153
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,870
If you watch this,

154
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,370
it should show you that I didn't kill Miyasaka.

155
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,470
Is he going to play that video?

156
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,470
I'm sorry, but as I mentioned before, I can't bear watching that video.

157
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,870
Yeah, Mr. Miyasaka's dead body is taken.

158
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,670
But, it's to prove that I'm innocent!

159
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,970
I'm sorry but if you can't bear watching it, keep your eyes closed!

160
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,567
Okay, I'm going to play it.

161
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,667
I'm Okita, in charge of the behind-the-scenes.

162
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:06,067
I'm going to charge into Mr. Miyasaka's room from now.

163
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,567
This is Mr. Miyasaka's room.

164
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:15,667
So, I wonder what Mr. Miyasaka is doing right now?

165
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:20,167
The door is slightly opened.

166
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,567
There's something stuck between the door.

167
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:27,967
It looks to be a bottle of foundation.

168
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:31,167
Okay, I'm going inside.

169
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:39,467
What's wrong?

170
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:43,267
Mr. Takayama, Mr. Miyasaka is...

171
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,567
Miyasaka! No way?

172
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,467
Okita! Go get everybody!

173
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,167
Yes, sir!

174
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,567
How about it?

175
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,867
When I went there, Mr. Miyasaka was already dead!

176
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:02,867
Now, you know I didn't do it, right?

177
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:05,067
Which means

178
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,567
that either Saeko or Mr. Yamamoto did it.

179
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,867
Hey! Cut out saying weird stuff like that!

180
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:14,167
She's right! I didn't do it!

181
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,367
I've finally figured out what was bothering me.

182
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,067
Conan.

183
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,567
I got go to the restroom.

184
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,867
Sonoko? Don't tell me that...

185
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,567
What's going on?

186
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,567
When Sonoko dances this dance,

187
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,567
she turns into a great detective called the Deduction Queen!

188
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,867
Deduction Queen?

189
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:51,067
Maybe we've been making a big mistake.

190
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,067
Mr. Okita, I'm sorry to trouble you

191
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:56,267
but will you show us the video one more time?

192
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:00,467
Yeah.

193
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:04,267
Please show us the part where Mr. Miyasaka's dead body is displayed.

194
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,167
I think it's just about here.

195
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:12,367
Mr. Yamamoto,

196
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,967
are you sure that there's no mistake

197
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,967
about this knife being the prop that was used?

198
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:20,367
Yes. I think so.

199
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,667
Please take a good look at it.

200
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,667
Doesn't something look wrong?

201
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,967
Something wrong?

202
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,267
The coke stain's not there!

203
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,767
True!

204
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,667
There's no stain on the handle of the knife.

205
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,667
Hold it.

206
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:43,267
When I went to look for Conan's wallet a while ago,

207
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:46,267
I took another good look at the dead body...

208
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:53,167
and I'm sure that the handle of the knife was stained with coke!

209
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,467
Yes.

210
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:58,367
This means that there were two knives.

211
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:00,867
What?

212
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,267
Two knives?

213
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:04,467
Wait, then what?

214
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:06,967
Do you mean that after he was stabbed once,

215
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,967
he was stabbed again with another knife?

216
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,267
Why would anybody do something like that?

217
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,267
And besides, if so, then when was the knife

218
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,267
stabbed into him a second time?

219
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:17,467
The room is auto locked and the door was locked.

220
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:20,767
Nobody could've gotten inside unless with the master key!

221
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:24,467
But, the door can be opened from inside the room.

222
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,867
From inside the room?

223
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,767
But, only Mr. Miyasaka's body was in the room.

224
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:34,267
What if Mr. Miyasaka wasn't dead yet then?

225
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,467
What is your remark based on anyway?

226
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:37,667
My remarked is based on the

227
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,067
existence of that bottle of liquid foundation.

228
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,567
The bottle of liquid foundation

229
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:45,467
that was stuck between the door of Mr. Miyasaka's room.

230
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,767
It's much too unnatural that it was left

231
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,367
standing upside down stuck between the door.

232
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,767
Don't you sense there was something intentional here?

233
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,667
Intentional?

234
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:59,767
A liquid foundation bottle left standing upside down?

235
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,867
Liquid foundation bottle standing upside down...

236
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:04,867
Candid!

237
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,567
Exactly! He was going to make a candid camera video

238
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:10,767
and surprise everyone by pretending to be dead.

239
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,667
It's most likely that the first knife

240
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,767
that was stabbed into him without the coke stain on.

241
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,767
It was a fake knife with no sharp tip to it.

242
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,267
The blood was paint that's usually used when shooting films

243
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,567
that was spread over the body.

244
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:26,567
He was planning to make a candid camera video

245
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:30,067
by making us find him that way and shocking us.

246
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:33,267
Mr. Miyasaka would surely come up with something like that.

247
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,367
No,

248
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:38,467
this is something that the culprit conned Mr. Miyasaka into doing.

249
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:42,467
The culprit wanted to use it to kill him.

250
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:45,267
However, Mr. Miyasaka did something

251
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,467
that was not included in the culprit's plan.

252
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:51,267
Mr. Miyasaka who was totally unaware

253
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,667
that he was really going to be killed.

254
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:57,767
Playfully put the bottle of foundation where it was.

255
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:00,967
That, although unintentionally turned out to be his dying message.

256
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:04,167
By the way, he needed an accomplice

257
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,567
to work out this liquid foundation thing.

258
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,167
An accomplice?

259
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,967
Come to think of it, back then...

260
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,467
He's got no pulse.

261
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,667
It's too late.

262
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:21,767
Mr. Takayama was the one who confirmed Mr. Miyasaka's death.

263
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:26,267
So, could it be that he was the accomplice?

264
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,267
So, it wasn't a coincidence

265
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:32,067
that he appeared at just the right timing.

266
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:34,167
What's wrong?

267
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,467
Okita! Go get everyone!

268
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:41,067
He did so, to keep me away from Mr. Miyasaka.

269
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,967
Then, Mr. Takayama is the culprit after all?

270
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,067
No.

271
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:50,067
Mr. Takayama couldn't have killed Mr. Miyasaka.

272
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:54,967
Because the crime was committed not after the video was recorded

273
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:56,967
and we returned to the room

274
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,867
after hearing that Mr. Miyasaka was dead.

275
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:02,867
But between the time we left Mr. Miyasaka's room

276
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:06,467
and Mr. Kurahashi went inside the room the second time.

277
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:11,367
During that time, we were all in the lobby.

278
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,767
With the exception of one person.

279
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,067
Yes.

280
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:19,067
The one who could've committed the crime at that time...

281
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:22,367
Miki, I think you should go back to your room and rest.

282
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:23,667
All right.

283
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,667
Excuse me.

284
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:29,767
Is none other than you, Miki!

285
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,167
When you told Mr. Miyasaka and Mr. Takayama

286
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,867
about your candid camera video plan,

287
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:38,067
they both though it was interesting and agreed to it.

288
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:41,267
So, just as you planned,

289
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:44,767
since we thought that Mr. Miyasaka was murdered,

290
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:48,367
we sealed the room off.

291
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,867
After everyone left, you went back to Mr. Miyasaka's room.

292
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:58,667
Then, Mr. Miyasaka who was still alive opened the door

293
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,267
and let Miki in.

294
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,067
If it went according as planned,

295
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,667
they were both going to appear before everyone

296
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,467
and disclose what happened.

297
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:20,567
But, this time, he was stabbed in the chest with one blow.

298
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,967
After lying the dead body in exactly the same position as before,

299
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:26,267
Miki left the room.

300
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:30,467
The door is auto locked, so it will lock itself as before.

301
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:36,367
This way, you acquired a definite alibi for you alone.

302
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,067
Then, you mean Mr. Takayama was...

303
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,567
Mr. Takayama probably thought it strange

304
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:48,067
that Mr. Miyasaka didn't appear to disclose the trick.

305
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:53,067
I guess you all noticed that he seemed jittery and bothered.

306
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:57,167
If Mr. Takayama finds out that Mr. Miyasaka was really killed,

307
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,867
Miki's alibi trick would be revealed.

308
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:05,067
That's why she called Mr. Takayama out to the cliff.

309
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:15,067
Then she comes back to the lobby looking as if nothing had happened.

310
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,967
She lies and says she saw Mr. Takayama fleeing

311
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,467
and tried to set him up as the culprit.

312
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:24,767
It's not a lie! I really saw him!

313
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,867
There's no way you could've seen him.

314
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,567
Because even if you were to look outside in the dark

315
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,667
from this brightly lit lobby,

316
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,967
only the reflection of the inside of this room

317
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,567
would be seen on the window,

318
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,667
and nothing outside can possibly be in view!

319
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,067
Don't just sit there, say something!

320
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,867
I did it.

321
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,267
Miki!

322
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,767
No.

323
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:06,867
I was a nameless actress in the past.

324
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:11,267
One day, I received a really big role

325
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:15,467
as a guest on a drama that Miyasaka was starring in.

326
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:18,267
I went right away to report this

327
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,667
to my only relative, my grandmother.

328
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,267
She was ill in bed, but was very happy for me,

329
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:24,767
and was looking forward to the day

330
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,067
the program would be aired.

331
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,967
However...

332
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:33,067
Takayama and Miyasaka got drunk and were arrested for assault,

333
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,967
so the drama was cancelled.

334
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,067
The part that I acted wasn't aired

335
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,567
and my grandmother passed away.

336
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,567
If those two didn't cause that incident,

337
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:48,867
I would've been able to show her my performance.

338
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:53,267
Ever since then, I never landed a big part.

339
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:56,167
And I gave up pursuing my acting career...

340
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,767
Just to think that

341
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,267
it was all due to Miyasaka and Takayama getting into trouble,

342
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:02,767
I couldn't forgive them.

343
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,367
And yet, those guys...

344
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,667
I'm not going to have my acting career go down the drain

345
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,167
just because of that stupid incident!

346
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:13,567
I'm going to go back to being a star again!

347
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:20,067
To think that the guy who shows no act of repentance

348
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,367
what so ever gets to continue being an actor as if nothing happened

349
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:25,067
while I had to give up mine

350
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,767
is just not right!

351
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,767
That's why...

352
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,367
Enough of your spoiled talk!

353
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:34,367
In the world of acting things are known not to go well.

354
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:38,267
Nevertheless, we all clench our teeth and give it all we got.

355
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:42,167
You can't land a good role before you haven't worked hard enough for it.

356
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,067
Whether you decide to give it up or not is all up to you.

357
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,067
And yet, you not only blame it on somebody else,

358
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,267
you go as far as to kill them.

359
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,667
So much for acting spoiled!

360
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:27,467
After police investigation,

361
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:32,067
the fake knife was found in Miki's room.

362
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:35,667
Oh, no. I over slept.

363
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:40,567
Hey I'm still here!

364
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:44,167
Hey, don't leave me behind.

365
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:49,767
Candid camera succeeds!

366
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:53,167
No joke!

367
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,167
"Next Episode" -That guy is the stalker?

368
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,667
Yep, he came yesterday and the day before yesterday too.

369
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:04,067
If he falls from that height, he's going be critically hurt.

370
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:10,867
He was probably using your practice for something.

371
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:14,467
How dare he use Ayumi for something like that!

372
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:18,767
Right! Let's get the culprit at all costs!

373
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,267
Next Conan,

374
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:24,367
"The Flower Clock Knows"
