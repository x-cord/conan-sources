1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,480
Omura Naoyuki (53) President of Venture Business "Oshiro"

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,810
Koshiro Masakazu (48) R&D Chief of Venture Business "Oshiro"

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,545
Oshiro

4
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:10,110
Reception

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,299
After all that time you spent, this is what you made?

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,040
I can't sell this!

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,739
The products I make are the very best.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,869
You can't sell them because you're incompetent.

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,840
Shut up!

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,010
This company got big because of my management policies.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,890
Excuse me...

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,340
If you hadn't been in charge, we might've gotten even bigger.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,390
Shut up!

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,849
You kicked it!

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,179
I put a lot of effort into making that!

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,760
You may be the president, but you'll pay for that!

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,069
I'm already way past my limit with you!

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,819
Please calm down, sir.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,740
You, too, chief.

20
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:58,990
Please stop.

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,790
Find the question that solves the mystery!

22
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,179
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,079
A venture company never stops trying!

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,229
A hit product determines their fate!

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,919
Always determining the one truth

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,669
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

27
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,140
his name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,400
The Frying Pan of Hatred

29
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:15,311
Iron is very hard.

30
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,181
Not only that, but no matter how hot it gets,

31
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,011
it doesn't melt.

32
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,732
You know that, right?

33
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:22,012
Yeah.

34
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,731
Titanium and aluminum are hard, too.

35
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:25,562
That's right.

36
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:30,651
And because they can all withstand high temps, they're often used to make frying pans.

37
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:34,261
Our company's newest coating technology

38
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:38,372
allows us to make those metals even harder.

39
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:42,591
And this is our company's newest frying pan that utilizes that technology.

40
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:45,002
It perfectly draws out the flavors of the ingredients.

41
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,742
Let me see.

42
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:51,382
Ow!

43
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:53,632
Jeez, Dad.

44
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,021
Ran-neechan, these are delicious.

45
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:02,411
Yeah. They're soft, and the flavors have so much depth.

46
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:03,871
They're amazing.

47
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,542
Thank you.

48
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:09,272
We have lots of delicious hamburger recipes.

49
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:11,611
I'll give them to you later.

50
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:13,002
Really?

51
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:18,932
Now it's time for a word from our company's president, Omura.

52
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,412
Sir?

53
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:23,912
Sir?

54
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:30,172
The president is...

55
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:38,611
He's gone.

56
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,021
Please call the police. Quickly.

57
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:42,372
Mister, the window.

58
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:47,402
There's no one here.

59
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:49,732
They must've fled.

60
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,282
Hey, Mister. What's that?

61
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,632
What's what?

62
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:05,921
President Omura died when he was stabbed in the chest with a knife-like blade

63
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:09,042
by someone who entered through the window.

64
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:14,052
Since his wallet is missing, it's possible that this was a robbery.

65
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:18,891
No way! He was killed by a robber?

66
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:20,212
Sir...

67
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,150
Tomi-san, hang in there.

68
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,120
Have you ordered an emergency deployment?

69
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,120
We've already secured the neighborhood.

70
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,120
If any suspicious persons are discovered, we'll be notified immediately.

71
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,130
Are these all the employees and concerned parties?

72
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,130
Yes. This is everyone who was inside the building.

73
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,439
This building?

74
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,010
You mean this isn't everyone?

75
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,060
No.

76
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,549
That's our research building.

77
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,480
There are people working in there, too.

78
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,049
I see.

79
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,560
In that case, could you have them come here right away as well?

80
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,739
Chief!

81
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,180
Watch out. Please don't enter the room.

82
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,430
The man on the floor is R&D Chief Koshiro Masakazu-san. Is that correct?

83
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,359
Y-Yes. That's definitely him.

84
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,739
How could this happen?

85
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,440
Why did the chief have to die, too?

86
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,570
According to forensics, a gas tank was leaking.

87
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,450
I-It was an accident?

88
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,579
Well, actually...

89
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,700
We found this in the room.

90
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,950
A suicide note?

91
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,519
Koshiro-san's body was right next to the sofa.

92
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,459
Perhaps he took some sleeping pills and was sleeping there.

93
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,880
You mean...

94
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,529
It's possible that Koshiro-san took sleeping pills,

95
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,800
opened the gas valve, and killed himself.

96
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,050
Suicide?

97
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,570
A spark of some kind must have ignited the gas.

98
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,850
Hey!

99
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,389
Don't interfere with the investigation, kid.

100
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,529
Huh? Mister, there's something weird on the floor.

101
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,870
Something weird?

102
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,370
A wallet and a knife?

103
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,500
I see!

104
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,830
Inspector.

105
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,630
What is it, Mori-kun?

106
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,880
Ouch...

107
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,380
President Omura was killed by a robber, and Chief Koshiro killed himself.

108
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,170
I can't believe they're both dead.

109
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,780
Are you all right?

110
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,280
Hey.

111
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,640
Thank you.

112
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,370
Have you found President Omura's killer?

113
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,150
Have you identified them?

114
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,449
Calm down.

115
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,900
I apologize for asking such a rude question,

116
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:17,580
but did President Omura and Chief Koshiro have a bad relationship?

117
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,739
Yes. Recently they'd been arguing all the time.

118
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,420
They had a huge blow up yesterday as well.

119
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,439
After all that time you spent, this is what you made?

120
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,170
I can't sell this!

121
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,929
The products I make are the very best.

122
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,999
You can't sell them because you're incompetent.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,200
Shut up!

124
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,620
I thought so.

125
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,730
But why did the president and head of R&D have such a tense relationship?

126
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:53,779
This company was founded ten years ago as a venture company

127
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,240
under President Omura and Chief Koshiro's joint management.

128
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,399
They produced several hit products and received media attention.

129
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,000
I love this company's frying pans and applied to review their new product.

130
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,839
But recently,

131
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,579
a plan was made to list the company on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

132
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,619
Since then, both the president and chief wanted to take control of the company,

133
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,010
and they fought all the time.

134
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,429
I see.

135
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,520
But is that related to these incidents?

136
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:32,280
We found these in Chief Koshiro's exploded research lab.

137
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,520
Here.

138
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:36,030
That's the president's wallet.

139
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,910
We also found this.

140
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,839
There's blood on this knife.

141
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,410
We confirmed that it's President Omura's.

142
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
The president's blood?

143
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,670
Yes, which means after Chief Koshiro's rage reached its peak last night, today...

144
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,340
What do you want, Koshiro?

145
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,430
You bastard! Could it be?

146
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,480
The chief killed the president and made it look like a robbery?

147
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,360
Which means Chief Koshiro committed suicide over the guilt of murdering another person?

148
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,490
Well, actually...

149
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,790
We found these in the president's office.

150
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,710
In the president's office?

151
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,839
Yes. According to forensics, this medicine bottle contains sleeping pills.

152
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,489
Sleeping pills?

153
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,840
Hold on. Is that other object a gas tank valve?

154
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,819
Yes, which means the following is possible.

155
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,300
Before Chief Koshiro came to kill President Omura, the president visited the research lab

156
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,360
in order to lay a certain trap.

157
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,560
First, he put the sleeping pills in some tea and swapped out the gas valve.

158
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,320
Then he hid the suicide note.

159
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,209
There were signs that one of the gas valves in the research lab had been modified to leak.

160
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:15,210
According to forensics, it may have exploded 30 minutes after it was modified.

161
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,720
Then they killed each other?

162
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,720
President Omura was probably trying to kill Chief Koshiro and make it look like a suicide.

163
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,720
What?

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,230
You're lying!

165
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,659
We found evidence on President Omura's office computer

166
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,230
that he composed the suicide note.

167
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,509
After modifying the gas valve, the president returned to his office.

168
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,070
However, he was killed by Chief Koshiro there.

169
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,080
Meanwhile, Chief Koshiro returned to the research lab, and...

170
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,769
You're lying.

171
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,960
President... Chief...

172
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,620
I should've stopped them that day.

173
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,600
Then this never would've happened.

174
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,980
That day?

175
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,480
But remember what they told us?

176
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,980
Y-Yeah. You're talking about that time.

177
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,349
Excuse me, sir.

178
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,729
Do you think you and Chief Koshiro could get along?

179
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,619
Koshiro and I understood each other once,

180
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,620
but not anymore.

181
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,870
All I have for him is hatred.

182
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,250
Hatred?

183
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,199
He's trying to push me out of this company.

184
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,660
But when that happens, I'm dragging him down with me.

185
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,640
Then everything will be up to you guys.

186
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,970
I poured everything I had into designing products.

187
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,370
The president claimed credit for all of them.

188
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,650
I can't forgive him for that.

189
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,399
If he's going to keep taking my achievements from me, then he and I...

190
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,780
You and the president...?

191
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,700
We'll probably destroy ourselves.

192
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,740
When that happens, the company will be in your hands.

193
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm counting on you.

194
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,040
I can't believe that became their final words.

195
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,539
We respected both of them from the bottom of our hearts.

196
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,550
Both as managers and engineers.

197
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,590
Indeed.

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,380
We joined this company because we wanted to be like them someday.

199
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,080
We never thought this would happen.

200
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,749
There's a lot behind that frying pan.

201
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,070
Yeah, it's sad.

202
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,339
They hated each other and fought over it.

203
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,740
I can't believe it turned out like that.

204
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,950
Yeah, even though they were originally friends who shared the same ambition.

205
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,210
I can't believe they're being taken away at the same time.

206
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,870
Maybe they were bound together by fate.

207
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,490
Huh?

208
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,101
What's this?

209
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,750
Conan-kun, there you are.

210
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,570
Sorry. Hey, Ran-neechan.

211
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:31,850
What do you think this is?

212
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,010
I feel like I recognize it.

213
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,591
Recognize it?

214
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:38,261
It's the hamburger sauce.

215
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:41,190
Oh, right. It's today's sauce.

216
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:43,560
It was this color red, wasn't it?

217
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:45,310
What's it doing here?

218
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,580
Let's check out this room next.

219
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:47,661
Wh-What?

220
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,531
An alcohol lamp cap...

221
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,031
It's shining.

222
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:04,091
It melted?

223
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,361
Could it be?

224
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,780
Conan-kun, is this where you came next?

225
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,640
What are you two doing here?

226
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:13,750
Don't interfere with the investigation.

227
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,671
He's right. Let's go.

228
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:19,020
There was something on the wall of the president's office.

229
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:21,681
And see how shiny this is?

230
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,181
Forensics probably already noticed that.

231
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:29,561
Kogoro-no-ojisan had a question about that and asked to be notified right away.

232
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,221
Got it.

233
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,581
Sauce... Melting...

234
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,571
What is it, Conan-kun?

235
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:42,920
We'll contact you if we learn anything new.

236
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,881
Thank you.

237
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:47,311
Come to think of it...

238
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,070
Hey, kid. Ran.

239
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,540
Is this where you guys have been?

240
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,881
Let's get out of here.

241
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,191
Frying pan!

242
00:15:58,121 --> 00:15:59,131
Dad?

243
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:01,350
Hold on, everyone.

244
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,681
What is it?

245
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:05,760
There's something bothering me.

246
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:07,771
Again, Mori-kun?

247
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:09,971
Hear me out, please.

248
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:15,751
When Koshiro-san stabbed Omura-san, there must have been a lot of blood.

249
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,531
But there wasn't any blood on Koshiro-san's clothes.

250
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,080
The chief was wearing the same clothes I saw him in this morning.

251
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:27,670
He wouldn't have had time to change.

252
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:29,040
It is strange.

253
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,041
There's something else bothering me.

254
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,671
Mori-san, I have the results from forensics.

255
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,671
Detective Takagi, what is the stain in the president's office?

256
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,431
It's apparently hamburger sauce.

257
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,560
When were those hamburgers made?

258
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:47,451
This morning.

259
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:49,860
But why was there sauce in the president's office?

260
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:53,510
It's evidence that someone snuck in there today.

261
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,351
What?

262
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:57,531
Then there's Koshiro-san's research lab.

263
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:01,441
Inspector, could you take a look at the AC controls?

264
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:04,201
It's shining.

265
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:06,200
It's a melting metal.

266
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:09,230
Melting metal? Could it be?

267
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,820
The sauce and the melting metal.

268
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:16,711
These two clues are keys leading us to the true culprit.

269
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:18,460
The true culprit?

270
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,201
First, we can deduce the following scenario.

271
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:25,971
Before the new frying pan was tested this morning,

272
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,901
the culprit entered the president's office,

273
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,751
and stabbed Omura-san with a knife.

274
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:34,711
Then they opened the window,

275
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:37,641
wrote a suicide note,

276
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:42,321
and left the gas valve and sleeping pills on his desk

277
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:46,741
in order to frame Omuro-san for Koshiro-san's murder.

278
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:53,100
Then the culprit headed to Koshiro-san's research lab at the research building.

279
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:57,361
They put him to sleep by making him drink tea containing sleeping pills.

280
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:00,380
They set the knife and wallet on the table,

281
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:01,631
put the suicide note in his desk,

282
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:05,131
and swapped out the gas valve for the one they had modified

283
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,191
to make it look like Koshiro-san had committed suicide.

284
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:13,521
Roughly 30 minutes later, the explosion occurred.

285
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,160
I see.

286
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:20,300
In this case, it appears as though the two of them clashed and murdered each other,

287
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:23,531
but it was all engineered by a third party.

288
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,811
Then who's the true culprit?

289
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:30,661
By the way, Taguchi-san, there's sauce on your right sleeve.

290
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:31,861
What?

291
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:37,541
Your sleeve is at roughly the same height as the stain in the president's office.

292
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:42,801
That's right. You're the true culprit, Taguchi-san.

293
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:44,711
What? Me?

294
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:48,721
Yes. While preparing for the product test,

295
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:51,441
you got red sauce on your sleeve.

296
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:55,881
While in the president's office, you touched the wall with your sleeve.

297
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,911
That proves you're responsible.

298
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:04,970
N-No. Hold on. Th-Th-This is...

299
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:07,870
W-Well... B-But...

300
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:10,111
I didn't go to the research lab!

301
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:14,380
That's right. I have an alibi.

302
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:18,890
When the lab exploded—no, for more than 30 minutes before that,

303
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,891
I was standing in front of everyone.

304
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,711
It wasn't possible for me to swap out the valves.

305
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:26,091
You did something you shouldn't have.

306
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,640
Something I shouldn't have?

307
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:30,431
Yes, out of desperation for an alibi.

308
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:36,101
Apparently iron, titanium, and aluminum are hard metals that don't melt under high heat.

309
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,101
What about that?

310
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:42,101
But there is a metal that melts at 29 degrees.

311
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:45,481
It's called gallium.

312
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:46,970
He's right.

313
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:51,491
Forensics said the metal on the wall controls might be gallium.

314
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:56,540
Normally gallium is a rock-hard metal.

315
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,031
However, its melting point is a mere 29 degrees.

316
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:01,751
It melts at a very low temperature.

317
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:06,751
The culprit used gallium to fill in the section of the valve they shaved off.

318
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:09,410
After swapping out the valve,

319
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:15,221
they set the AC to activate at over 30 degrees 30 minutes later.

320
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:18,440
If you only intended to make it look like a suicide,

321
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:21,301
there was no need to cause a gas explosion.

322
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:24,691
But you were determined to have an alibi

323
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:27,471
so you wouldn't become a suspect.

324
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:30,991
That's why you used the gallium to delay his death

325
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:34,491
and caused an explosion to cover the evidence.

326
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:38,241
However, that became evidence of your guilt instead.

327
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:39,720
You're making this up.

328
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,871
I... I didn't do it!

329
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:47,501
Taguchi-san, there's tears and silver sweat on the handkerchief I lent you.

330
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:51,031
This is gallium, isn't it?

331
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,511
Even a person's body temperature is hot enough to melt it.

332
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:55,401
This is...

333
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:58,390
No. You're wrong!

334
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,640
I see.

335
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,910
Taguchi-san touched the AC controls with those hands.

336
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:03,901
He really was in the research lab.

337
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:05,680
N-No!

338
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,480
Taguchi-san, did you really do it?

339
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:09,231
No!

340
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:13,740
Detective Takagi, could you please search Taguchi-san's locker?

341
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:16,491
I'm sure you'll find a bloody apron in there.

342
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:22,120
Why?

343
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:23,841
Why would you do this?

344
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:28,700
Both the president and chief said the company would be ours

345
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:31,381
once they were gone.

346
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:32,900
No.

347
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:34,381
You can't be serious.

348
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,030
That's right.

349
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:38,790
If those two clash and go away,

350
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,031
then this company will be mine.

351
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:46,651
It'll be all mine!

352
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:18,700
We're having hamburgers again.

353
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,670
Yeah, third day in a row.

354
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:23,540
Do something.

355
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,330
Hey, Ran-neechan.

356
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,210
Are we having hamburgers again?

357
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:31,071
Yeah. After all, Tomi-san gave me a bunch of recipes.

358
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,130
Hey!

359
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:35,590
Ow! Hot! Ow! Hot!

360
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:38,921
Ow! Hot! Ow! Hot!

361
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:43,451
Why can't you guys worry about me?!

362
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:47,610
Episode Preview

363
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:48,481
That's good.

364
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:51,230
Listen to this.

365
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:52,731
What is it?

366
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:56,990
Excuse me. Are you all right?

367
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:58,241
Yeah.

368
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:02,300
Anyway, I'm a genuinely good guy.

369
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:05,741
I can't ignore someone who's in trouble.

370
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:09,250
I'll keep living my life in service of others.

371
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:13,711
The next episode of Conan is "Troublesome Kindness!"
