"Beika Department Store"

2
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:34,295
Excuse me, sir?

3
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:37,395
I'm sorry, I'll leave right away.

4
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:40,795
I just wanted to take a glimpse outside.

5
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:44,195
I mean, the whole floor is sabotaged by a bomb scare,

6
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,595
I can't make myself eat anything.

7
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:49,195
I see...

8
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:50,695
But, of course,

9
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:52,495
I would sure like to give the guys who are hiding

10
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:57,595
in this hot season waiting for their prey,

11
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:01,495
a taste of hot bitter coffee, if I had my way.

12
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:05,295
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

13
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:07,395
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

14
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:09,995
The overall picture of the bomb scare is finally revealed.

15
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:11,995
As well as well as the fate of Akai's phantom.

16
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:13,695
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:15,495
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:17,695
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

19
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,709
In order to solve the mystery of the red T-shirts

20
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,909
that were being sent every week,

21
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:02,409
we headed off to Beika Department Store

22
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,309
and what lay waiting for us

23
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,909
was a man with a bomb wrapped around his body.

24
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:11,109
The masked man who wrapped a bomb around this man

25
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:16,109
wants to find the T-shirts's sender that was supposedly on this floor.

26
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,109
Although it was found that all 13 T-shirts

27
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:23,209
were bought at 12:28 pm every Sunday,

28
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,909
the salesclerk says that she has no recollection who bought them.

29
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,009
What on earth is going on?

30
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,809
From the queer creases that were found on the red T-shirts,

31
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:36,609
I figured out that the snow mountain accident

32
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:38,409
that occurred more than 10 years ago

33
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:41,409
to a mountain climber was connected to this incident.

34
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,509
Wait, dad!

35
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,609
That's right near the bomb.

36
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,409
I'll be fine.

37
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,209
I won't let the bomb go off.

38
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,009
Isn't that right?

39
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,209
Bomb man?

40
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,409
Mr. Ordinary Citizen?

41
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:12,109
"The Target that Sways Red"

42
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:14,809
No, I...

43
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,409
Seeing that although it's 12:28 pm,

44
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,109
no one came to buy the wear,

45
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:22,209
so you figured.

46
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:26,109
It was the trap set by the sender

47
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:28,109
of the T-shirts to lure you out here.

48
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:29,709
That's why you're

49
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:34,109
trying to get that hateful sender of the T-shirts to come out!

50
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,409
Get him to come out, how?

51
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,509
If the sender knew the man's address,

52
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,609
he must also know the face of that man.

53
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:45,009
Because the man made a fuss saying

54
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,909
that the bomb would go off unless the sender is found,

55
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:51,009
he probably hoped

56
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,709
that the sender would come out declaring that it's a lie.

57
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:58,109
Well, I've already figured out who the sender is

58
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:01,009
without having to use a complicated method such as he, though.

59
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,209
What? Really?

60
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,409
The receipts!

61
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:12,409
I don't think he'll be able to get a receipt indicating 12:28 pm.

62
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:16,309
If he asked to have a receipt with that time indicated,

63
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,909
he could probably have it done.

64
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:21,509
But if such a queer shopper came,

65
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,109
the salesclerk is bound to remember.

66
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:28,709
The fact that the salesclerks don't recall such a person

67
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,209
is because the sender himself is the one who issued the receipts.

68
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:35,609
In other words, it's the cashier

69
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,709
at the fitness section that carries red underwear.

70
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:42,209
Ms. Seta, it's you, isn't it?

71
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,609
The cash register of that section is in a small room

72
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:48,609
that is not visible to the customers or salesclerks.

73
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,409
Therefore, it's easy to issue

74
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,609
a receipt indicating 12:28 pm without being suspected.

75
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:57,209
It is also very likely that the sender

76
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:00,409
and recipient know each other's face.

77
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:05,609
Nevertheless, the fact that the recipient couldn't find you,

78
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:09,109
that's the further proof that the sender was you,

79
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,909
who had been hiding in that small room all this time.

80
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,209
Mai... Mai?

81
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,909
Are you Mai?

82
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,009
Mr. Maruoka's daughter?

83
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,909
Yes, that's right, Mr. Fukunishi!

84
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:22,109
My father, who you killed

85
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:24,209
on those snowy mountains 13 years ago.

86
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:27,409
I'm Daisaku Maruoka's daughter!

87
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,809
Don't call me using honorific as if you know me or something!

88
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:33,209
No, he got caught in an avalanche and...

89
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:38,209
Right, the avalanche that happened worked to your advantage

90
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:41,609
and the police didn't check the case any further.

91
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,309
It was closed as a mere case of accident in the snow!

92
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:50,309
But, on Sunday December 28th, 13 years ago,

93
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,709
the morning that you and dad went mountain climbing,

94
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,109
it was written in dad's diary!

95
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:59,309
That if you saw the grand scenery of a summit for the first time,

96
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,509
you would probably turn over a new leaf.

97
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,309
After dad's death, dad was suspected of embezzlement!

98
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,409
You used up the money of the company

99
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:12,009
and put the blame on dad who was your superior, too!

100
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,809
I know that!

101
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:17,109
What... What're you talking about, Mai?

102
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,709
I see, so she's the one.

103
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:23,209
She's the one who...

104
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,709
So, are you satisfied?

105
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:28,009
Let my son go!

106
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,809
Son? What's that about?

107
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:34,909
You're made me do something like this with this letter, right?

108
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,209
Letter?

109
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:37,909
Please let me see it.

110
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,409
I have your son.

111
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,909
If you want him back,

112
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,309
wrap the bomb that's inside around your body

113
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:47,109
and set the remaining bombs

114
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:51,009
to Beika Department Store and sabotage the entire sports floor.

115
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,509
Plead your heart out begging for your life

116
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:55,409
unless you find the sender.

117
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,609
If I get to burst out laughing watching you do this,

118
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,809
I'll give you back your son.

119
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:04,209
I know nothing about that letter.

120
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,509
You've got to be joking!

121
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:08,609
My son's been missing since last week!

122
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:09,709
-What? -What?

123
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,709
Come on, give me back my son!

124
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,409
I see. This is what your purpose was.

125
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,809
What? Dad?

126
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:24,709
Ms. Seta's weakness was that she kept sending red underwear every week.

127
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,409
You felt strong because if you didn't receive such letter,

128
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:31,509
you would never had caused this bomb scare to begin with.

129
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,809
That's why you made up that fake threat letter

130
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,109
and decided that you would deepen the crime of the sender!

131
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,009
Because you had no idea that Ms. Seta

132
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:47,309
had conclusive proof that you were the one who killed her father.

133
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:50,109
Conclusive proof?

134
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:52,009
What kind of proof?

135
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,409
Don't be ridiculous. She'll never have anything like that.

136
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:00,109
The 13 red underwear that Ms. Seta sent you!

137
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:03,709
The fact that the way the shirts were folded according to the crease,

138
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,409
is the shape for a flag signal.

139
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,109
Flag signals...

140
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:10,609
That's when you relay words by waving a red and white flag

141
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:12,709
that you hold in each hand, right?

142
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,809
Right.

143
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:18,109
If you read it according to the order the shirts were sent...

144
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:24,109
Buried...

145
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,109
I...

146
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:28,809
saw...

147
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,509
you...

148
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:33,909
-do it... -Buried, I saw you do it.

149
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,809
Does that mean, the place the body was buried?

150
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,009
So, you been bluffing after all!

151
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,609
Bluff?

152
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,209
It has to be!

153
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,409
Because back then the blizzard was so bad

154
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,609
that you couldn't even keep your eyes open.

155
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:50,309
Even if there have been someone other than me there.

156
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:55,809
Are you saying, no one could've seen you burying the body?

157
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,309
No... That's...

158
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,409
According to Mr. Maruoka's diary,

159
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:01,609
mountain climbing was a first time experience for you.

160
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:03,509
Therefore, being a novice,

161
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:05,509
you couldn't have left the mountain hut

162
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,009
that you were in to go and bury him.

163
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,909
Which means if we dig the area near the mountain hut you stayed,

164
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:15,009
then we should be able to find the corpse, right?

165
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,909
The corpse of the mountain climber

166
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,609
that you killed and buried 13 years ago.

167
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:22,809
You seem to be very sure

168
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:25,309
that nobody was watching you

169
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,009
but there was a witness.

170
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,409
And that's you, the one who murdered him.

171
00:10:57,109 --> 00:11:01,709
By the way, is your son really gone?

172
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,209
Yes, I think he ran away from home like always.

173
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:06,809
I'm stupid.

174
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,109
I embezzled the company money because I wanted to enroll my son

175
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:11,509
into a famous elementary school.

176
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:15,509
I even killed my superior who scolded me for it.

177
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,209
And my son's ran away from home too.

178
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:23,109
Then, will someone call the police

179
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,409
and take Ms. Seta and him to the station?

180
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:26,609
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,509
Please announce to the customers here

182
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,609
that the bombs in the paper bags on this floor

183
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:33,509
are fakes that only emit smoke!

184
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:34,909
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,309
Besides, I'm sure that the riot police called by Ms. Seta

186
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,109
are also nearby too.

187
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:47,309
Yes, I told them to arrest him right away

188
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,909
because I figured all the bombs were fake anyway,

189
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,509
but they wouldn't do it.

190
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,909
How did you figure out that the bombs were fake, Dad?

191
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:00,409
From the lipstick on his shoulder.

192
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:03,709
If he really had a real bomb attached to his body,

193
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,709
he would never ride a crowded train, that's why.

194
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,809
So, that completes the job offer we got for this case,

195
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:14,609
but are you satisfied, Ms. Seta?

196
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,809
Yes, sir! So, you knew after all.

197
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:21,709
That I use a voice changer to call you.

198
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,009
All I wanted is for you to reveal

199
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,809
the meaning of the flag signal that dad taught me

200
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,009
and watch what kind of face he would wear

201
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,409
after hearing it from you.

202
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:34,309
But, to hear him confessing what he did,

203
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,309
you're really great after all.

204
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:37,909
With only that little hint,

205
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:39,809
you realized that it was the accident

206
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,609
at the snowy mountain that occurred on December 28th,

207
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:45,309
and made the little boy check on it.

208
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,409
-That's... -Flag signals

209
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:49,109
are used in places like the ocean

210
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,009
and mountains where voices are hard to hear.

211
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,509
If the message was, "I saw you bury him"

212
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:58,909
it has to be the mountains and not the sea.

213
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:03,409
And the right half of the receipts are deliberately torn off

214
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,709
bringing to mind a snowy mountain.

215
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,609
The red colour of the underwear suggests murder.

216
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,309
If murder is committed in the snow mountain,

217
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:13,209
it'll have something to do with accident in the snow

218
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,309
and it'll be difficult to determine the exact time.

219
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:19,609
I'm sure that the time 12:28 pm

220
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:23,709
indicates the date December 28.

221
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,709
That's what's written on the mail

222
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,109
that was sent to me by somebody I don't know.

223
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:33,209
Let... Let me see it.

224
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:39,109
And, what's come of the bomb scare?

225
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,209
What?

226
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,409
Mail from somebody he doesn't know?

227
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:51,199
Who on earth could've sent him this mail?

228
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,999
The only thing I can say

229
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,699
is that he sender of this mail was definitely

230
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:58,899
on this floor till just a while ago.

231
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,799
What's the matter, Conan?

232
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,799
Nothing...

233
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,899
I was thinking that the person who sent this mail

234
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:07,199
is a really great detective.

235
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,199
-Mail? -Look.

236
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:13,199
Well, I'll leave the rest to you.

237
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,799
-You must feel hot... -It's true!

238
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,299
Dad, don't tell me that you were just reading this mail.

239
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,999
But, the fact that the sender is me,

240
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,199
the daughter of the mountain climber

241
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,699
who was killed in the snowy mountains 13 years ago,

242
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,699
was unmentioned, does it?

243
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:32,999
Boy, you knew about it from Detective Mouri, right?

244
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,799
After all, you called me by my maiden name, Maruoka,

245
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,799
instead of the name on this name plate, Seta.

246
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,999
Yes! When I went into the cash register room

247
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,799
because I wanted to check on the accident that happened

248
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,099
in the snowy mountain on December 28th,

249
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,499
and asked you to lend me the computer,

250
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:52,599
you weren't surprised, were you?

251
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,399
That's how I figured out

252
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,899
you were the one who wanted this case checked

253
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,799
and were somehow involved with the accident in the mountain.

254
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,599
In the picture with Mr. Maruoka who died in the mountain,

255
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:04,099
his daughter was in it too.

256
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:06,999
And, you were wearing a wedding ring,

257
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,799
so I thought maybe you got married and your last name changed!

258
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,099
Really...

259
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,399
You're really something, aren't you, Conan?

260
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,499
Of... Of course.

261
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:21,599
I did all of what I did because Pops told me to do it.

262
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,999
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

263
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:28,999
But, the sender of this mail is quite a great detective himself!

264
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:32,699
Everything aside from your identity hit the bull's eye.

265
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,699
I wonder who it is?

266
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,099
Maybe that person is still here on this floor.

267
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:38,599
Then, maybe if you send a thank you mail,

268
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:39,999
that person will appear?

269
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,499
No, way.

270
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:42,699
From what's written there,

271
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,699
it seems that the person doesn't want to get involved.

272
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,299
What?

273
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,799
Maybe it's him?

274
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,999
I'm sorry!

275
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,799
Did you just receive mail that said, "Thank you?"

276
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,299
Yes, I did.

277
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,199
Then, are you the one who made that deduction?

278
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,199
No, I don't know anything about this mail.

279
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,299
What? But, the mail was sent from your cell phone, right?

280
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:15,599
Yes.

281
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,499
It could be the person who picked up my cell phone a while ago.

282
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:21,499
A man who was wearing a black cap

283
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:24,799
and had a burn scar on his right cheek.

284
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,199
What?

285
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,099
Where is that man?

286
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:29,199
Yes.

287
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,599
He went over to the escalator that started moving.

288
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,799
I think he went downstairs?

289
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:36,199
Conan?

290
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,899
What's up? What's the rush?

291
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,199
Jodie.

292
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,999
Don't tell me you're looking for the same person I am?

293
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,699
No.

294
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:56,899
Just as the message in question said,

295
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,199
it seems that this place is definitely dangerous.

296
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
Message in question?

297
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,499
The message that Shu gave me!

298
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,899
You met him? Mr. Akai?

299
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:12,899
No, when I left my seat for a while at the cafe in the basement,

300
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,199
he secretly wrote it in the back of the coaster!

301
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,999
And, why is it dangerous here?

302
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,399
The bomb scare incident's been solved, right?

303
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,199
Because I saw it.

304
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,899
A sniper-like person was seen from a window of the hotel opposite

305
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,099
this department store.

306
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:34,499
And parked right below, is a black Porsche 356A.

307
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:35,499
Gin!

308
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:38,799
Don't tell me, that he found out that Shu is alive

309
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,499
and is planning to shoot him?

310
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:42,999
Shu!

311
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,399
Where are you, Shu?

312
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,899
There he is. It's Shu!

313
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,199
No, Shu!

314
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,899
Don't go out!

315
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:57,799
They're coming after you!

316
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,199
Shu!

317
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,399
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

318
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:08,899
The rate of taking the blame would be fifty-fifty.

319
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:10,699
You weren't careful and attentive enough,

320
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:12,699
you're to be blame too.

321
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,899
Yes.

322
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:16,999
You looked to have been looking for someone?

323
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:17,999
Shu!

324
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:20,399
Where are you, Shu?

325
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:25,099
There he is! I found him!

326
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:27,299
I found the phantom!

327
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,899
On the left edge of the main entrance.

328
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:32,499
Right to the side of your car!

329
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:35,199
Hurry up and check it out if you're going to, Gin!

330
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,299
Because my finger that's on the trigger

331
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,299
is impatiently waiting and twitching

332
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,999
and may go off any minute!

333
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,599
Akai Shuichi.

334
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,199
Vermouth.

335
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:00,499
Did you get approval from that person?

336
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:03,799
Yes, boss is very discreet and careful.

337
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,299
Maybe too careful that the timing goes off.

338
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,899
What the heck are you doing?

339
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,699
Can I kill him? Or not?

340
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:12,999
Which is it going to be?

341
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,599
What the...

342
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,899
He looked...

343
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:19,099
That guy!

344
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,099
He looked this way!

345
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,799
He looked at me and laughed!

346
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,099
Do I kill him or not?

347
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,199
What do I do?

348
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:29,099
Gin, it's strange, right?

349
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:33,499
The customers are rushing back into the department store.

350
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,999
Where is he? Where'd he go?

351
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,099
The shoppers are suddenly rushing along.

352
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,699
It's hard to lock him on.

353
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:42,799
Hey, doesn't it look bad?

354
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,499
She's got a rifle.

355
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:47,199
Maybe their shooting a film or something?

356
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,599
-Let's go. -What?

357
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,299
Tell Korn too.

358
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,399
Hey, just what's going on? Gin...

359
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,799
Priority on his own discretion again.

360
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,199
Revolting like always.

361
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:05,399
What? Who are you talking about?

362
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:07,699
Like you said,

363
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:11,499
you wish they leave detectives

364
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:14,999
like Sherlock Holmes locked up in novels only.

365
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:38,999
Hey, hurry up and give me the gift certificate!

366
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:42,099
You're giving us 10,000 yen worth, aren't you?

367
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,099
Just what're you talking about?

368
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,199
A boy wearing glasses went around shouting

369
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:48,899
that as an apology of the bomb scare,

370
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,199
you're giving away gift certificate to all the customers who came!

371
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,899
I haven't heard anything sort of thing.

372
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,199
Hey, come on, man!

373
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,599
I came all the way back here.

374
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,799
I see, gift certificates, right?

375
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,499
I wouldn't say that it was too bright.

376
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,199
But, I guess it couldn't be helped

377
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,499
if you wanted to evacuate the customers from here, right?

378
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,599
Subaru?

379
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,099
I had some business to take care of at the Teito Bank

380
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,399
near this department store.

381
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:19,299
So, I did what I had to do and came out saw you all,

382
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:22,899
and ran after you thinking to call you,

383
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:25,199
and got messed up in the incident.

384
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:27,299
Who is this guy?

385
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,499
I hear that his apartment was burnt down.

386
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,799
He lives at Shinichi's house for the time being,

387
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,399
and his name is Mr. Subaru Okiya, a university student.

388
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,799
I see...

389
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,799
But, what was that about?

390
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,699
Conan evacuating the customers a while ago.

391
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,999
It's not worth hearing about.

392
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,799
It's a worthless story

393
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,399
about a bunch of stupid wolves letting the prey

394
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:53,499
that they hunted down get away.

395
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:58,799
But, you live quite a distance away from Teito Bank, don't you?

396
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,299
Why would you have a saving account in a place like that?

397
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:02,599
No.

398
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,899
I had other things to do at that bank.

399
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:07,499
Other things to do?

400
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:12,099
Remember the robbery at that bank some time ago?

401
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,599
In the news that was aired to look back on that case,

402
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,499
I saw my acquaintance.

403
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:21,499
I went there thinking that maybe he was using that bank.

404
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:24,799
If he's using that bank, he should be living in this vicinity.

405
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,899
I was hoping to get lucky and run into him.

406
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:31,399
So, you didn't get to see him?

407
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:35,099
Well, I coincidentally saw him on that floor.

408
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:37,699
But, unfortunately, it seemed to be someone else,

409
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:39,499
so I didn't call out to him.

410
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,099
His face is one that I've known for a long time,

411
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,699
so I'd never mistaken him for someone else.

412
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,299
A stalker, you say?

413
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,899
Unforgivable.

414
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:57,199
Targeting such a fragile woman.

415
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:06,999
Zombie?

416
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:10,199
No matter how you look at it, this is a case of self-defense.

417
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:14,599
Just as I thought.

418
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,099
Next Conan,

419
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:23,099
"The Night the Zombie Died"
