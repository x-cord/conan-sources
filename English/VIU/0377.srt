00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,591
Today's story has to do with Peach Boy.

2
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,191
Clear up the mystery of the legend!

3
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,291
A dog, pheasant, monkey, and even an ogre appear!

4
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,691
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,491
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:31,692
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:59,770
-"Peach Boy!" -"Peach Boy!"

8
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:03,770
"Those sweets you have hanging on your hip..."

9
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:07,770
"I'd like to have one, too..."

10
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,471
Huh? Peach Boy?

11
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:15,370
According to the legend of "Peach Boy",

12
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:18,270
around the middle of the 7th Century, in order to defeat Ura,

13
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,170
the demon that had come from a foreign land

14
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:23,870
to carry out a countless number of atrocities,

15
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,570
the Yamato Court sends out a gallant and renown warrior called.

16
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:27,470
Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto.

17
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:30,670
It is said that this story is based on the battle between these two.

18
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:31,971
But that is not the fact.

19
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:35,970
The fact is in the year 663,

20
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,870
as stated also in the Chronicles of Japan,

21
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:42,170
the Japanese Yamato military that lost in the Battle of Hakusukinoe,

22
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:43,870
built fortifications one after the other

23
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,770
to prepare against the attacks of enemy forces.

24
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:46,870
This story seems to be related to one of the fortifications,

25
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:50,370
Kinnojyo and Kibitsu in Okayama Prefecture where the castle is located.

26
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,971
It seems that here, in Kibitsu, was where the legend began.

27
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,970
There are many ancient tombs in Kibitsuji.

28
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,970
Of course they reflect the culture of those times.

29
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,371
As well as the memories of various people.

"Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 1)"

31
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:20,070
When one thinks of Okayama,

32
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:22,370
what comes to mind is "Peach Boy", right?

33
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:23,670
And "Peach Boy" also brings to mind...

34
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:24,870
Millet dumpling!

35
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,071
Everything is food to you, isn't it, Genta?

36
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:29,770
A dog, right?

37
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:31,470
-A pheasant! -Monkey!

38
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:33,870
-And the demons of Demon's Island! -And the demons of Demon's Island!

39
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,870
Well true, but...

40
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:39,570
After all, this is a weekend trip as well as a history study tour.

41
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:42,670
Yes, we studied beforehand for this.

42
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,170
So please be more professional.

43
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,170
Or that's what I'd like to say,

44
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:48,971
but first of all, I want to eat some Mamakari!

45
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:52,770
Gosh! Not you, too!

46
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:54,171
Sorry. I'm sorry!

47
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:01,770
We've arrived in Okayama!

48
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:04,270
We're transferring to the Sanyo main line next!

49
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,870
Hurry, hurry!

50
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,171
Hey, you don't have to rush so much.

51
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,771
The train's already here!

52
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:36,470
Kurashiki is famous for its fine sight landscape of white walls.

53
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:39,271
Yes, it's what travel-loving girls admire.

54
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:46,471
But before that, this is where I want to go.

55
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,471
-Hello! -Hello!

56
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:09,371
Chibori Park...

57
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:12,371
That's enough, Seiko!

58
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:16,370
What makes you think you can talk to me like that, Saruwatari?

59
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:19,970
You got to go independent because I wrote an article for you.

60
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:22,270
Just how much do you think I had to pay you for...

61
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:26,470
I went out of my way to give you "classmate discount".

62
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,870
You got to be kidding!

63
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:30,370
Are you all right, Ayumi?

64
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,270
Look what you did to Ayumi!

65
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,570
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

66
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:35,870
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

67
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,071
I hope you're not hurt, are you?

68
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,170
Thank you so much.

69
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:45,170
No. We're sorry and embarrassed for acting so childish.

70
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:47,770
I feel bad.

71
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,870
You're right.

72
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,870
I'll bet you're feeling really lucky.

73
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:54,270
Hey, did you both apologize?

74
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,271
Yes.

75
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:59,170
Little lady, does the ice cream we bought for you taste good?

76
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:01,170
Yes, it's delicious!

77
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:02,570
I'm glad!

78
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,070
That's no way to apologize, is it?

79
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:07,370
You're all friends, aren't you?

80
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,170
I don't think it's good to fight.

81
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,170
Friends, huh?

82
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,570
It's true that we're classmates since our elementary school days.

83
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:17,270
But some live in Osaka and others in Tokyo now.

84
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,170
So, it's been about 15 years since we've seen each other.

85
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,070
The last time we saw each other was when we were just about your age.

86
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:27,070
Which means, it's your class reunion?

87
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,170
Sort of.

88
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:31,070
I'm sorry, my name is Agasa.

89
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:34,270
I'm their chaperone, or rather, I'm escorting the children on their trip.

90
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:37,270
I'm Ayumi. Ayumi Yoshida!

91
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,470
I'm Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya!

92
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,971
I'm Genta Kojima!

93
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,270
I'm Conan Edogawa.

94
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,071
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad...

95
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:50,970
"Naoto Momoi (27)" -What a polite introduction.

96
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,770
I'm Naoto Momoi.

97
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:55,170
"Yayoi Kijima (27)" -I'm Yayoi Kijima. Nice to meet you.

98
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:57,770
"Kengo Saruwatari (27)" -From this side, he's Kengo Saruwatari,

99
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,170
-Seiko Inui. -Hi!

100
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:00,770
"Mamoru Onitsura (27)" -And Mamoru Onitsura.

101
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,770
Youth Detective Squad?

102
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:06,370
We named our group something like that, too.

103
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:08,370
And we're gathered because...

104
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,670
I'll tell you!

105
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:12,070
After all, it's what I proposed to begin with.

106
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:15,370
We got together this time to support Momoi's candidacy

107
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:18,670
and also to congratulate his marriage to Yayoi!

108
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,970
Amazing! You're going to be running in the election.

109
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:22,470
And getting married, too?

110
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,270
Congratulations!

111
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:25,970
Thank you.

112
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:29,770
Peach Boy and the pheasant are going to get married.

113
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,770
-So you noticed too, Mitsuhiko? -Yes.

114
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:35,370
You guys are like "Peach Boy".

115
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,170
What's this about?

116
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:38,371
Their names, right?

117
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:41,870
The first two letters of their names

118
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,570
are characters that appear in "Peach Boy".

119
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:47,971
Peach, pheasant, monkey, dog, and demon...

120
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:51,470
Just as expected of the Youth Detective Squad.

121
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:58,570
That's why we acted out "Peach Boy" in our school play because of it.

122
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:00,271
Talk about old story.

123
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,570
How nostalgic.

124
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:07,570
But back then, the stage and interpretation were good.

125
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,571
Especially Shunya.

126
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,470
Shunya?

127
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:15,570
Never mind about the past.

128
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,970
By the way, what now?

129
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:20,070
I'm thinking of all kinds of things.

130
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:22,270
Tomorrow we go treasure hunting, right?

131
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,670
Huh? Right.

132
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,270
Treasure hunting?

133
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,870
That's new to me.

134
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:29,270
I'll explain it at dinner time.

135
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:32,470
Until then, it's free time.

136
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,370
I guess that's it for now then.

137
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:35,771
Bye, little lady!

138
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:39,171
I guess we should get going, too.

139
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:45,370
This is Kurashiki.

140
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:46,971
How nice!

141
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,770
The view has been kept as it was in the Edo period.

142
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:54,070
Right, Doc?

143
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:58,870
Yes. Most of those warehouses were built by the merchants back then.

144
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,270
They used to transport all kinds of merchandise

145
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:04,770
sailing their ships into Kurashiki River.

146
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:08,270
The pasted roof tiles on the east side of this Kurashiki Archaeology Museum

147
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:12,270
are said to be one of the most beautiful in this fine sights district.

148
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:14,470
All the things exhibited here are things excavated from the tombs and ruins

149
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:21,570
of the districts of Kurashiki, Kibitsu and the entire Seto Inland area.

150
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,070
There sure is a lot to learn.

151
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,570
Coming in touch with culture of the past...

152
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:27,371
Can be useful.

153
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,670
But this is the best after all!

154
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,971
It's delicious.

155
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,570
It's Mamakari after all.

156
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:42,370
"Mama carry the food over to me."

157
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,671
There he goes again.

158
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:46,870
A peach?

159
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:50,170
-A peach? -It's a peach, like in "Peach Boy"!

160
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:51,171
Amazing!

161
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:52,671
You got to be kidding.

162
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,070
We've almost got it!

163
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,170
-Genta! -Hang in there!

164
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,970
Hey! Hold on tight!

165
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,870
Be careful.

166
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:04,570
I didn't think it would be real, but...

167
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,970
And inside we find...

168
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:08,470
Envelopes?

169
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:10,171
Inside the envelope is...

170
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:12,570
What's this?

171
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,571
Maybe it's a code!

172
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,271
A code?

173
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:19,470
If it is, it isn't something all that difficult.

174
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,170
It's elementary school level.

175
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:24,370
But it's something worth studying because we're here!

176
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,670
We'll solve the code and excavate a tomb.

177
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:30,270
Maybe we'll be able to find the treasure on Demon's Island!

178
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,470
-Really? -We'll resolve the "Peach Boy" legend!

179
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:35,470
Let's do it! Let's do it!

180
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:36,570
Hey, hey.

181
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,870
Then I'll go rest somewhere nearby.

182
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,570
All of you give it your best.

183
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,770
I'll leave the rest up to you, Shinichi.

184
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:44,770
Is this your doing, Doc?

185
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:47,770
No. I know nothing of it. It's not me.

186
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:50,570
But studying should be fun.

187
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:54,070
What great educational material to study with. How lucky.

188
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,870
See you.

189
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,670
Give me a break.

190
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:01,471
Okay, the Youth Detective Squad launches Operation Treasure Hunt!

191
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:05,671
Hey!

192
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,618
What's with this picture?

193
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:14,118
On its eyes. This eyelash?

194
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,618
Fire, maybe?

195
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,118
Conan.

196
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:21,918
Huh? Oh, that's a very natural way to look at it.

197
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,418
Fire and eye stands for...

198
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,319
Fire and eye...

199
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,818
Fire and eye!

200
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:32,319
It's the Hinomi Yagura (watch tower)!

201
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:38,019
Did you find anything?

202
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,018
Did you find something?

203
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:43,918
This is...

204
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,218
Did you find it, Conan?

205
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,719
Yes.

206
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,318
The treasure.

207
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,419
Open it! Open it!

208
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,718
What's this? It's just filled with junk!

209
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,018
It's out of battery, too.

210
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,518
At the least, it's no treasure.

211
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,518
What are you looking at, Conan?

212
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,818
6 years was a lot of fun.

213
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,618
All except for that one incident.

214
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:16,618
What does "that" refer to?

215
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:17,819
Beats me.

216
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:22,118
Maybe this is a time capsule.

217
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:25,018
-Time capsule? Really? -Time capsule? Are you sure?

218
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,418
If this is somebody's time capsule,

219
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,418
I wonder if it's okay that we dug it up?

220
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:33,518
Of course it's not okay.

221
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,019
But it's obvious that somebody has already dug this up before us.

222
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,418
Maybe this is...

223
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,818
Our rival treasure hunters?

224
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:44,618
If so, we can't let them beat us!

225
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:47,319
Let's hurry and solve the next code, Conan!

226
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,718
A picture of a house and the alphabets "P, I, B, T, I, J,".

227
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:59,318
Just what does it mean? I can't make it out at all.

228
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,018
Well, this is super basic of codes.

229
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,618
So what is it?

230
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:07,018
You move each alphabet to the front one by one.

231
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,718
Which means, it's before "P".

232
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,418
-So, "O"? -Right!

233
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:14,518
The next alphabet before "I" is "H", right?

234
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,118
Next...

235
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:18,718
Ohashi?

236
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,518
The chopsticks you use when eating?

237
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,318
No, it's probably the name of a place.

238
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,318
Somewhere near Kurashiki here...

239
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:27,718
You children. What are you doing?

240
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,518
I guess we meet again.

241
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,619
Well, we were trying to solve a code.

242
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,018
What brings you here?

243
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,318
Aren't you going around with the rest of your group?

244
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,818
Yes, well...

245
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:44,218
I'm not very well liked by everybody.

246
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:45,918
You saw for yourselves just a while ago, didn't you?

247
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,118
But why not? You're all classmates, aren't you?

248
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,018
Since long way back in the past, I could never lie.

249
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,718
The article I was planning for Mr. Onitsura's company

250
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:57,119
was all about his underhanded moneylending.

251
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:02,418
Even when Mr. Saruwatari went independent and opened his own beauty salon,

252
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:05,418
I honestly wrote how good I thought he was.

253
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:09,018
I mean, I can't help it because he's not good.

254
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,918
Then, Yayoi...

255
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,118
I ended up fighting for Mr. Momoi with her.

256
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:16,318
We were going with each other until recently.

257
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,018
Him and I.

258
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:22,418
I see, that's why something about them was awkward.

259
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:25,118
Isn't Shunya coming?

260
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,918
You're sure sharp, renown detective!

261
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,518
I remember you saying that he was in charge of making the script

262
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,318
and interpretation of the "Peach Boy" play that you put on.

263
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,218
Of course, we would've called him,

264
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:39,318
if he were alive.

265
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:41,218
You mean he passed away?

266
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:45,818
15 years ago in a traffic accident, so we couldn't graduate together.

267
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,718
Poor thing.

268
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:51,219
He was full of justice and a really good boy.

269
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,118
Sorry, sorry, it's this dark already.

270
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,218
I'll see you all again.

271
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:58,919
Hang in there, Youth Detective Squad!

272
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,219
Here it is! We've found it!

273
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:07,418
Ohashi.

274
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:08,618
An old house!

275
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:11,818
It sort of sounds like something in a samurai movie.

276
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,818
If I remember correctly, after the development of Shioda,

277
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,818
this Ohashi residence became a great landowner.

278
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:22,618
This house is said to be about 200 years old.

279
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,818
Amazing, Mitsuhiko!

280
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:27,618
Well, it's really no big deal.

281
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,918
I'm glad I did some studying beforehand.

282
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,519
Okay, let's search!

283
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:35,418
I found it! I found it!

284
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:36,618
Not again.

285
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:39,018
-It's already been dug up. -Treasure...

286
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,718
Not this again.

287
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,218
Old comics.

288
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,418
And old stationery.

289
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,418
Not "that" again.

290
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:49,518
I'm sure that somebody is beating us to it!

291
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,018
Okay, next!

292
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,818
The square face of a clown?

293
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,218
What was it called? That symbol used with cell phones?

294
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:58,418
You mean, pictographics!

295
00:15:58,419 --> 00:15:59,618
Right!

296
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,218
This is lower case "t",

297
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:05,018
this is lower case "u", this is "t" too, and...

298
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:08,818
This is "a", but I wonder why it's reversed?

299
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:11,318
T-u-t-a (Ivy).

300
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,418
You mean, ivy, the plant?

301
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,918
Tsuta is ivy in English.

302
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,918
The next word is "square".

303
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,318
I got it!

304
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,518
Over there, over there!

305
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,518
Kurashiki Ivy Square! Over here.

306
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,418
-Ivy! -Right?

307
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,118
How spacious!

308
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,118
This used to be a spinning factory.

309
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,318
It seems that the buildings back then are being used as is,

310
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,718
and turned into hotels and memorial halls.

311
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:39,018
Okay, let's start!

312
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,019
Okay...

313
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:59,718
There's nothing that looks like treasure anywhere.

314
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,119
What the heck is going on?

315
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,318
I get it.

316
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,118
Not only the "a" is reversed,

317
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,718
everything is in the back.

318
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:11,318
Which means, it is in back of this Ivy Square.

319
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,919
I see! Behind!

320
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:18,118
I found it! I found it!

321
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,819
Did you find the treasure?

322
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,718
This again.

323
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,518
This stuffs again?

324
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,718
Talk about depressing.

325
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,919
This is no fun.

326
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:36,618
It's that lady.

327
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,419
No good. She's not breathing anymore.

328
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:43,418
A dying message.

329
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:46,218
O, N, I. Oni (ogre)?

330
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:47,618
Oni?

331
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:51,619
-The killer is an ogre. Like in "Peach Boy"! -Oh, no!

332
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:57,918
So you're the ones who found her.

333
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,018
The Youth Detective Squad...

334
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,118
There they go again.

335
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,418
If the killer is an ogre...

336
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,418
We'll be Peach Boy...

337
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,918
And punish, rather arrest him!

338
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,319
Good grief.

339
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,918
Excuse me, sir. Is that the belongings of the victim?

340
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,618
What? Oh, right.

341
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,618
Huh? Over there, something's not right, is it?

342
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,118
That stamp.

343
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,318
Why is it reversed?

344
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,918
Beats me.

345
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,618
So what?

346
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,518
Well, it's nothing.

347
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,518
Sorry to have bothered you.

348
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,519
So being friends of the victim, the four were interrogated by the police.

349
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:42,918
Which means that none of you has an alibi.

350
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,618
To put it more accurately, I was alone.

351
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,418
Like I said, there were a lot of people at Chibori Park,

352
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,618
so there must be somebody who remembers seeing me.

353
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:52,118
Same here.

354
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,418
I was in the lobby of the hotel that I'm staying at.

355
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,718
There were a lot of people there, too.

356
00:18:55,719 --> 00:19:00,218
Unfortunately, it would be difficult to verify your situation.

357
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,718
I guess we don't have a problem, then?

358
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,618
We were together all the while.

359
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:07,218
You were walking along the fine sights district, you say?

360
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,418
Yes, sir. We were together all the say.

361
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,918
The only time we were alone was when we went to the bathroom.

362
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,118
Even so, we weren't separated for more than five minutes.

363
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,318
I don't mean to be rude,

364
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,018
but we can't take the testimony of a fiance just like that.

365
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,018
Moreover, our investigation shows that you were going with the victim, too.

366
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,319
That's...

367
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:30,019
The other two seem to have had some trouble with the victim, too.

368
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,518
Officer Tsuyama, they're here.

369
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,218
Is that the container that the peach was inside?

370
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:39,418
Yes. It may have nothing to do with the incident,

371
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,418
but we contacted you because we thought we should let you know about it.

372
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,618
It's not that we wanted to report this,

373
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,418
but we figured we had to cooperate with your investigation.

374
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,318
Is that...

375
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,618
Our time capsule with the code we entered?

376
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:55,818
What a surprise.

377
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,218
The code was what specified the place

378
00:19:57,219 --> 00:20:01,918
in which they hid their time capsules 15 years ago.

379
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,418
15 years ago, they put things their precious items inside a time capsule

380
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:07,518
and after exchanging them,

381
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,018
each person buried a capsule other than his own.

382
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:15,418
They make it so that the owners didn't know where it was buried.

383
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:20,518
That's the reason why they were able to leave their true feelings behind.

384
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,918
The fact is that last night the elementary school

385
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,619
that you all attended was raided by someone.

386
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:31,718
This container was also included among the things that were damaged.

387
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:37,218
Then, we received word from them that they picked this up.

388
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:40,718
It must be some work of fate that we ran into you guys.

389
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,418
But what are you going to do stealing something like that?

390
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:44,918
That's why you threw it away, right?

391
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,618
Because you figured it won't bring you any money.

392
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:50,318
Then, is this how it went, officer?

393
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,318
Seiko, as a journalist happened to figure out

394
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,118
who the culprit that raided the school was and was killed instead.

395
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,318
-No. -That's unthinkable.

396
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,118
We're looking at it from a different angle.

397
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,718
Mr. Onitsura.

398
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:06,418
No! I didn't do it. I'm innocent!

399
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,018
Don't get me wrong. At this point you're still only a major witness.

400
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,018
Then, why am I the only who is being detained?

401
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:17,018
How would you explain this dying message?

402
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:19,818
It seems that you were holding a grudge against the victim

403
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:21,419
since she wrote an article about you that you didn't like.

404
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,118
Hey, do you really think Mamoru did it?

405
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,818
Cut it out, Saruwatari!

406
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:31,218
Could be.

407
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:32,718
How dare you talk like that, Momoi?

408
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,318
These days,

409
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,319
it's not surprising who kills who.

410
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,519
This is no time to be treasure hunting.

411
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,818
So the killer is an ogre after all.

412
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:52,219
I sure wish we could catch it!

413
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,918
Genta, you're holding the silverware with wrong hands!

414
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,418
Hold the knife with your right hand and your fork with your left.

415
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,718
What's the different? After all, I'm right handed.

416
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,918
So I want to hold my fork with my right hand.

417
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,418
Do you want to ask for chopsticks?

418
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:10,119
Why didn't you do so in the first place, Doc?

419
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,018
I see. So that's it.

420
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:18,318
If so, the contents of the dying message would change.

421
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,018
Now I'm sure,

422
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:23,018
the killer is among the four of them!

423
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,818
But in order to specify who it is,

424
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:26,818
the remaining two codes will have to be solved

425
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,719
and the buried time capsule needs to be found.

426
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:58,018
"Next Episode."

427
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,218
You're the only one who knew that I was going to dig out the time capsule.

428
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:03,119
Why did you do this?

429
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,918
I wanted to check on something,

430
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,718
so I went alone to bookstores and the library.

431
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,219
Thinking something like this could happen...

432
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,718
I, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, took notes!

433
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:19,018
All right, Mitsuhiko!

434
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:20,918
Good work, Mitsuhiko.

435
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,919
Next Conan, "Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 2)"

436
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,818
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,918
"Left-handed."

438
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:47,919
In the next episode, we finally defeat the ogre!

439
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,519
Conan, give me some more millet dumplings.
