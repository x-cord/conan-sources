1
00:00:01,391 --> 00:00:03,490
I tagged along with Ran and her friends

2
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:07,391
and attended the birthday party of Remi Sekizawa the model.

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,690
At the party, Sera noticed that

4
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,490
I was carrying the antidote for APTX 4869

5
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:16,891
and reported it to her mother, Mary.

6
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:21,791
However, a murder occurred at the birthday party.

7
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,990
Meanwhile, Mary reminisced

8
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:30,690
about the time she was given APTX 4869.

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,490
It was in London.

10
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,490
And the person involved...

11
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:36,290
Tsutomu.

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,791
It's been a while, Mary.

13
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:40,290
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

14
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,390
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

15
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,190
The words "divine punishment" was on the victim's forehead.

16
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,990
What is the truth hidden in the darkness?

17
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,490
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,390
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:51,791
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:40,091
"A Birthday Party with Divine Punishment (Part 2)"

21
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:47,212
When I parted ways with Tsutomu,

22
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:49,112
I was still pregnant with my daughter.

23
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:50,913
Who are you?

24
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,912
That's right.

25
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:04,213
I'm not Tsutomu Akai.

26
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:12,012
I'm the woman who is about to poison you to death

27
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:14,512
with this capsule.

28
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:18,513
MI6 intelligence operative, Ms. Mary Akai.

29
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,812
I finally have you now.

30
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:26,112
I've been hanging around town for quite a while now.

31
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:29,212
While wearing your husband's face, of course.

32
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:34,112
I see. You lured me out to this country

33
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,912
so that you could make our colleagues see him

34
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:39,413
and confirm it was really him.

35
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:44,512
You spent the last three years disguising this meeting as a reunion

36
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:46,312
so that no one realises that this was a trap.

37
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:49,212
Yes. After all, for Tsutomu Akai, who was supposed to be dead,

38
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:53,212
to return to work at MI6, you served as an obstruction

39
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:57,212
as you had made yourself disappear all of a sudden.

40
00:03:57,213 --> 00:04:01,512
Of course, I could tell if my husband was real,

41
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:03,812
just as I have done.

42
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:07,512
Or if it was a disguise by the witch with a thousand faces.

43
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,512
But that's too bad.

44
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:12,012
I've already told my daughter that if I didn't return in time,

45
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:15,712
she is to tell MI6 that Tsutomu Akai is a fake

46
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,612
and leave London right away.

47
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:22,912
In that case, how about I disguise myself as you

48
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:26,912
and go to see your daughter?

49
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:30,812
You talk as if you know where my daughter is.

50
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:35,612
There is no way that you would know if I even have one.

51
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:37,212
You're right.

52
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:42,512
Perhaps I should leave my plan of infiltrating MI6 for later.

53
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:45,213
Then, until I complete...

54
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:48,813
this next objective...

55
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,912
which is to eliminate Mary Akai.

56
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:03,213
I would be in a lot of trouble if you were to stay alive.

57
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,012
How does it feel

58
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:10,313
to die from the poison created by your little sister?

59
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,412
What was that sound?

60
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:22,713
It looked like someone fell into the water.

61
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:34,312
Mum is running late.

62
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,113
What is she doing?

63
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:41,112
Mum! Were you able to see dad?

64
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:42,712
Huh? Mum?

65
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,712
-Masumi. -What?

66
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,212
Who are you?

67
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,812
It's me.

68
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,712
They made me take a strange capsule,

69
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:52,012
so I ended up looking like this.

70
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:55,412
It's Mary, your mother.

71
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:58,012
Really? Are you really my mum?

72
00:05:58,013 --> 00:05:59,412
Yes.

73
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,512
I can't believe it.

74
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:03,512
It's just unbelievable.

75
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:04,513
What?

76
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:09,012
I can't believe Yumi is a murder suspect.

77
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:10,912
It couldn't be avoided.

78
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,612
The only people who could slip some poison into Mr. Hanasaki's cake

79
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:16,212
were the ones who sat at the same table as him.

80
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:20,712
There were four suspects: the model Remi Sekizawa,

81
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:25,512
Remi's sister Yumi, who is also our classmate,

82
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:28,513
Remi's manager, Mr. Mitomu Kushiyama,

83
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:34,205
and Mr. Tsuguo Hatsune, the pastry chef who baked the cake

84
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:36,705
and distributed it to the guests.

85
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:39,005
Not only was the victim poisoned,

86
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:41,505
but the words "divine punishment"

87
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,305
were also written on his forehead.

88
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:47,505
So, the people who had markers on hand are being suspected.

89
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:51,406
It was confirmed that Remi did not have a marker.

90
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:57,805
Mr. Kushiyama, the manager, had a marker in Remi's bag,

91
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,005
but it could no longer be used to write.

92
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:04,605
Yumi was the only person who had a working marker.

93
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:07,605
It's no wonder she would be suspected the most.

94
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:12,405
But whoever poisoned the victim left his or her seat.

95
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:15,805
You're right. Remi and Mr. Kushiyama

96
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:18,105
were sitting on either side of the victim.

97
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:21,105
Mr. Hatsune could have slipped the poison

98
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,605
because he was the one giving out individual cake slices.

99
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:27,405
Miss Remi was sitting between Sekizawa and the victim.

100
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,605
Yes. So, it would have been particularly difficult

101
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:31,605
for Yumi to poison him, right?

102
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:33,005
You know...

103
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:36,405
You called Yumi by her last name without any honorifics.

104
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,405
It's like you're her classmate or something.

105
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:40,806
I should have called her Miss Yumi.

106
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:45,405
Is there any poison in the rest of the cake?

107
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:49,705
No. Forensics contacted me just now.

108
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:52,405
There were high amounts of powdered cyanide

109
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:56,905
in the cake eaten by Mr. Hanasaki.

110
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:58,205
However, they couldn't detect any poison

111
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,405
in the Remi Sekizawa's half-eaten cake

112
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:05,205
or Mr. Kushiyama's untouched cake.

113
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:08,805
There was nothing in the crumbs left

114
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:11,005
on Yumi Sekizawa's plate, either.

115
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:13,005
Of course, there was no poison

116
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,805
in the cake Mr. Hatsune gave to the other guests

117
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:18,706
or the rest of the cake that wasn't given out.

118
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:22,905
There's also the problem with Yumi's bag,

119
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:24,505
which had a working marker.

120
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:27,806
Inside the bag holder under Yumi's seat...

121
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:32,705
There's something resembling a strange black stain.

122
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:34,305
What could it be?

123
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,405
I don't know.

124
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:39,705
That stain wasn't there before Mr. Hanasaki was murdered.

125
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:41,805
-Pardon? -Isn't that right, Conan?

126
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,106
Yes.

127
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:48,805
Here, I recorded a video of Yumi and Remi

128
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,605
blowing out the candles on the cake.

129
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:52,105
Look at the floor.

130
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:54,505
There's no stain, right?

131
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:55,805
You're right.

132
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:58,705
Then, where did the stain come from?

133
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,706
Wait!

134
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,705
Don't enter the crime scene without permission!

135
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,805
Let's get you two out of here.

136
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,705
So, Yumi put her bag

137
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:09,605
inside this bag holder under the seat, correct?

138
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:13,005
Yes. That's why she would have noticed

139
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:15,205
if anyone were to touch it.

140
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,205
So, what are their belongings?

141
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:21,305
Remi has one handkerchief and eye drops for dry eyes,

142
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:23,505
while Mr. Hatsune has a smartphone, cigarettes,

143
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,705
and an oil-based lighter.

144
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:29,305
If that is the case, we'll have to look at possible motives.

145
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:31,405
Does anyone have an idea

146
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:33,606
who would have a grudge against the victim?

147
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,205
Well, I understand

148
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:40,105
not wanting to speak ill of someone who just died.

149
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:43,105
-No. -There are too many.

150
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,105
I wouldn't know where to start.

151
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:48,905
In any case, he has a terrible reputation among my model friends.

152
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,805
He's a capable hair and make-up artist,

153
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,605
but he's always making moves on the ladies.

154
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:55,305
He would demand so much

155
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:58,305
in return for undertaking priority hair and make-up sessions.

156
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,505
He would also ask for a model's measurements

157
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:03,605
so that he could send them clothes.

158
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:05,105
How about you, then?

159
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,305
My sister can be careless,

160
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,705
so she would leave things in the make-up studio,

161
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:12,305
and I'd come to get them back.

162
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:14,805
But sometimes, her things would go missing.

163
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,605
Were they things like wallets and accessories?

164
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:20,105
No. They were things like a can of juice she had drunk

165
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,905
or a half-eaten snack.

166
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,105
What?

167
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:25,905
I asked the other make-up artists and stylists,

168
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:28,105
but they didn't remember throwing the things away.

169
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:30,305
Then, how about you?

170
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,705
He often complained.

171
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:35,905
He would nitpick about things at different stores.

172
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:38,905
Not long ago, he was enraged over the knife and fork

173
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,405
not being parallel to each other on the table.

174
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:45,205
The fork he threw at the employee managed to hit a guest,

175
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,505
and he was widely criticised for it on the Internet.

176
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:51,006
As expected, he put out a statement of apology for it.

177
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:57,505
All of them seem like shallow motives for murder.

178
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:58,605
You're right.

179
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:00,305
Inspector!

180
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:01,605
What?

181
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:05,105
There was a marker in a waste bin in the kitchen?

182
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:07,105
Does that marker work?

183
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:08,106
Yes, sir.

184
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:11,505
The cooks in the kitchen didn't recall throwing it away.

185
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,905
But no one entered or left the kitchen

186
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,905
when the incident occurred.

187
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:20,305
That only applied to the cooks who were in the kitchen.

188
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:25,205
They called out to each other during the blackout, or so they said.

189
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:27,605
But because it was dark,

190
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:32,005
they might not have noticed if anyone snuck into the kitchen.

191
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:35,005
Hold on. The only one who could do that...

192
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:38,105
It was someone who knew where the waste bin was.

193
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:39,805
Mr. Hatsune, the pastry chef!

194
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:41,905
Only you could have done it.

195
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:44,205
No, it wasn't me!

196
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,405
Now that I think of it,

197
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,405
the wall socket where the projector was plugged into

198
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,005
before it turned off due to the plug disconnecting from the socket

199
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:54,105
was next to the door that led to the kitchen.

200
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:58,305
If you were next to that door distributing slices of cake,

201
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:01,205
you could have easily pulled the cord.

202
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:04,705
It's true that I might have been next to that door.

203
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:08,205
When that guy fell, everyone's attention was on him

204
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:11,205
and someone could have pulled the plug.

205
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:12,805
And just when I thought I was cleared from suspicion

206
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:15,105
because I didn't have the marker,

207
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:19,405
I can't stand being suspected once again because of that!

208
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,805
Again?

209
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,605
You are all nitpicking!

210
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:23,905
You're not all that different

211
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,805
from that guy who's always complaining!

212
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,605
Complaining?

213
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:31,705
I see. Mr. Hanasaki wasn't poisoned with the cake.

214
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,305
The culprit went ahead

215
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:36,105
and fed the poison to him directly.

216
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:38,805
And they did it without knowing the words that are distorting the truth

217
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:41,406
would be inscribed on his forehead.

218
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:49,545
Inspector Megure.

219
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:53,244
Think about it carefully.

220
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:54,944
The cooks in the kitchen

221
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:58,644
would be holding knives as they were standing.

222
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,144
No matter how well they knew each other,

223
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,344
I wouldn't want to enter such a dangerous place

224
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:06,044
in total darkness.

225
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:07,544
That's right.

226
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:10,244
But if it wasn't Mr. Hatsune...

227
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:12,844
The suspect would have to add the poison to the cake

228
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:16,044
right in front of Mr. Hanasaki.

229
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,044
-That's the thing. -What?

230
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:22,044
The culprit didn't poison Mr. Hanasaki's cake,

231
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:24,944
but they poisoned their own cake instead.

232
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,444
What?

233
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:31,244
Sera, I've bought two slices of strawberry shortcake.

234
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:34,044
Put them side by side and place them on the table.

235
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:35,945
Okay.

236
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,344
Listen. Let's pretend Sonoko is the victim,

237
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:41,244
and I am the culprit.

238
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,244
When the culprit stood up,

239
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:47,644
they diverted Mr. Hanasaki's attention and did this.

240
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:49,944
The strawberry on the cake at the neighbouring seat

241
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,744
is on its side.

242
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:54,544
That's why Mr. Hanasaki exchanged his cake

243
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:57,244
with the culprit's own.

244
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:59,344
But if he were dissatisfied with that,

245
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:02,944
he could have asked the staff for a new slice of cake.

246
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,744
That would have been the case,

247
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,144
but Mr. Hanasaki couldn't do it this time.

248
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:08,844
Just the other day,

249
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,044
the fork he threw at an employee hit another guest,

250
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,544
and he had just come out with a public apology.

251
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:17,644
People are going to talk about him again if he were to complain

252
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:19,644
about a strawberry that was on its side on his cake.

253
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:20,744
Isn't that right?

254
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,044
The one who left his seat

255
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:26,444
to pick up the phone before touching his cake...

256
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:28,744
Remi Sekizawa's manager,

257
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:31,144
Mr. Mitomu Kushiyama.

258
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:34,744
The strawberry on its side on the cake

259
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,144
you said you haven't touched is proof.

260
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:40,744
No. It was true that my phone rang at that moment.

261
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:44,644
Right? There was an incoming call to my phone, right?

262
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,844
You must have called the number to make an incoming test call.

263
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,144
In a few seconds, you would receive a call back

264
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,544
because that's what the service does.

265
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:55,244
No one could tell if you muted the audio

266
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:56,944
and didn't listen to the message.

267
00:14:56,945 --> 00:15:00,344
If you had the timing right and called the number,

268
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:02,244
the call would come and you would stand up

269
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:06,444
right before he ate his cake.

270
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:10,344
Of course, it had to be after you poisoned your own cake.

271
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:12,644
But what about the marker?

272
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,144
As you already know,

273
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:15,944
the permanent marker I had didn't work

274
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:19,044
because the cap had been removed.

275
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,344
So, how could I have written those words

276
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:22,044
on Mr. Hanasaki's forehead?

277
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,444
Ran, did you buy the thing I asked you?

278
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:28,544
Yes. A permanent marker and nail polish remover.

279
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:30,944
I uncapped the marker and made it so that it doesn't work,

280
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,644
just like you told me to.

281
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:34,144
Thanks.

282
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:36,544
A permanent marker usually stops working

283
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:42,344
because the ink has dried up on the surface of the tip.

284
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:43,844
Just like this.

285
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:48,644
But if you poured nail polish remover into the marker cap

286
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:52,644
and put it back on for a little while,

287
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,944
the acetone in the nail polish remover

288
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:58,845
would dissolve the dried-up ink on the marker tip.

289
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:03,244
And that's how you get the marker to work once again.

290
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:07,244
So, could it be that the black stain on the floor...

291
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:09,044
He must have discarded the nail polish remover

292
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:10,444
from the marker cap onto the floor.

293
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,944
He'd also leave the marker uncapped afterwards

294
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:15,844
so that it wouldn't work anymore.

295
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:17,244
In other words, you predicted that

296
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:20,944
someone would ask Remi to sign her autograph

297
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:26,144
and had her use a non-working permanent marker

298
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:29,644
to leave such an impression.

299
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:31,944
Then, when Mr. Hanasaki fell over,

300
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:33,744
you pulled the projector's electrical cord

301
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:36,044
and made the entire room dark.

302
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,844
Using the light from his glow-in-the-dark glasses,

303
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:40,144
you used the marker you fixed

304
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:43,144
and wrote those words on Mr. Hanasaki's forehead.

305
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:44,844
And that is the truth.

306
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,644
You made him wear those glasses

307
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:49,544
by telling him Remi would find it funny, right?

308
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:50,944
Besides, as her manager,

309
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:54,244
it's possible for you to sit right next to him.

310
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:55,944
By the way, you planted the marker

311
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,544
in the waste bin in the kitchen

312
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:02,144
while getting water for Conan before the party started.

313
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:06,344
You asked if we had any food allergies out of the blue

314
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:09,244
so that you'd have an excuse for entering the kitchen.

315
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,844
This is just my guess,

316
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,044
but you must have predicted that

317
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:15,944
when Remi tried to sign with the non-working marker,

318
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:19,744
she would get a spare from her sister,

319
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:23,144
which you have accounted for in your plan.

320
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,944
Since Remi had the marker,

321
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:27,544
you were able to divert suspicion onto her

322
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:30,144
and then cover for her desperately.

323
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:33,544
And with the discovery of a different marker in the kitchen,

324
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:36,644
she would be cleared of suspicion entirely.

325
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:40,944
Unfortunately, your plan didn't take into account

326
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:43,844
the fact that Remi returned the spare marker to Yumi.

327
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:47,244
But why would Mr. Kushiyama do such a thing?

328
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:50,844
It's so that Remi would develop feelings for him.

329
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:54,544
He must have taken the can of juice and snack

330
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,644
from the make-up room for the same reason.

331
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:58,044
What?

332
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:01,144
When Mr. Hanasaki saw that,

333
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,344
he must have threatened you.

334
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:07,544
Could it be that he demanded money from you as well?

335
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:11,644
Yes. And the amount kept getting higher and higher.

336
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,944
So, I had no choice but to kill him.

337
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:16,545
I had to do it!

338
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,644
Move!

339
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,745
Conan, look out!

340
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:32,444
Are you all right, Conan?

341
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,445
Yes.

342
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,045
I'm glad you're okay.

343
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,344
Case closed!

344
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:39,644
You're right.

345
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:42,145
I have other things to attend to, so...

346
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:46,245
Could it be that Sera...

347
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:11,344
Yes, I've got it, just as you had hoped.

348
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:15,944
It's the antidote that might just bring your body back to normal.

349
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:18,044
Well done.

350
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:20,545
With this, the time they've stopped...

351
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,145
It will finally...

352
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:28,445
move forward again.

353
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:31,144
Anyway, you should come in.

354
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:33,344
You have to get those clothes changed.

355
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:35,744
You're right.

356
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:37,644
What's with the cough?

357
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:39,244
Did you catch a cold?

358
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:42,544
No. They made me take a strange capsule.

359
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:45,045
It might be a side effect.

360
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:48,944
Wimbledon.

361
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:50,944
Is it that time of year already?

362
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:54,144
Yes. I recorded this afternoon's match.

363
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:56,344
More importantly, what are you going to do now?

364
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:57,644
Are you going to the hospital?

365
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:01,644
No. If they had foreseen something like this would happen,

366
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:05,144
it's prudent to think that they would be waiting at the hospital.

367
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:07,644
But unless you have someone figure out

368
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:11,144
what happened to your body and get it back to normal,

369
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,944
you won't stand a chance against those guys.

370
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:16,444
Even with this body, I can still fight.

371
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:18,244
I won't lose to them.

372
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:21,244
But you were just given a strange capsule.

373
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:22,544
Minerva!

374
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:26,144
In any case, we have to find out what that capsule is...

375
00:21:26,145 --> 00:21:28,244
I'll help you!

376
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,344
I'm Holmes' apprentice!

377
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:33,644
Isn't this kid...

378
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:36,845
He looks exactly like the kid we saw at the beach that time.

379
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:41,945
The magician who made Shu laugh.

380
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:49,744
If I recall, at the time, he said his name was Shinichi Kudo.

381
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:50,745
Yes.

382
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:53,544
And that he was Holmes' apprentice...

383
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,844
I'm Shinichi Kudo,

384
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:58,045
and I'm Sherlock Holmes' apprentice.

385
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:03,044
I've had my colleagues at MI6 research him just now.

386
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:07,444
There is a Shinichi Kudo on the flight passenger list,

387
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:10,644
but he's supposed to be a second-year in high school, just like you.

388
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:14,044
Then, did he take his little brother to London?

389
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:16,944
No, he doesn't have one.

390
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:17,945
And the two others travelling with him

391
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:19,844
didn't seem to be part of his family.

392
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,444
Not only that, the strange thing is that

393
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:23,944
Shinichi Kudo is a high schooler detective,

394
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:29,644
and he has been solving numerous cases while we're not in Japan.

395
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:32,544
But he stopped doing so all of a sudden in the last six months.

396
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:36,644
Instead, a young boy has been appearing at crime scenes.

397
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:39,644
That boy looks exactly like the one on the TV, or so they said.

398
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:41,744
They don't just look alike.

399
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:44,345
He's actually Shinichi Kudo, isn't he?

400
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:48,444
Yes. He must have taken the same capsule,

401
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:49,944
and his body changed into that of a child.

402
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:51,544
And it's very likely that

403
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:53,444
he must have reverted his body to normal somehow

404
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:57,044
when he boarded the aeroplane.

405
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:59,444
If there is such an antidote,

406
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,544
you are to approach the boy

407
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:04,344
and retrieve it from him by all means.

408
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:08,245
That's right. And it's finally in my hands!

409
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:13,144
What? The capsule's not in here anymore!

410
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:15,145
But why?

411
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:22,844
I was right to put the antidote for APTX 4869

412
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:24,644
somewhere else just in case.

413
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:26,844
Come on, Conan, let's go home.

414
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:28,944
We'll leave you behind if you don't hurry.

415
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:31,144
Wait for me!

416
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:34,844
Oh, it looks like your mouth ulcer has healed.

417
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:36,045
You're right.

418
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:39,544
Solving mysteries is the best kind of medicine

419
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,644
for a detective, after all!

420
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:43,245
That jerk...

421
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:49,145
"Next Episode" -Here's the guy who has come to save me!

422
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:57,745
I'm sorry, Ryota.

423
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:08,044
This is the head chef's knife, isn't it?

424
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:09,544
Yes.

425
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:14,344
Next Conan, "The Red Sheep's Ominous Game (Part 1)"
