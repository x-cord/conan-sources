1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,630
From June until October, at the police academy,

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:11,719
trainees receive education and training

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,513
as they bond with one another

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,516
to become fully-fledged police officers.

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,812
"Nonbeh"

6
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,440
Welcome!

7
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,899
First things first...

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,111
Cheers...

9
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:37,327
Nothing beats free drinks!

10
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,706
What do you mean, free drinks?

11
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,125
Didn't you hear what Hagiwara said?

12
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,919
This is a mixer with girls from a different classroom.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,005
He said he'd pay for the drinks

14
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,300
if there was an equal number of guys and girls.

15
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,509
So that's why you came

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,221
even though you already have a girlfriend.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,726
Hagiwara himself isn't here yet, though.

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,813
What? You have a girlfriend, Date?

19
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,607
I know!

20
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,400
Do you really?

21
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,111
-What about you, Matsuda? -Say what?

22
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,613
You don't have a girlfriend, then.

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,032
I know...

24
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,707
Hey, Hiro. This appetiser is really good!

25
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,001
I can make this at home,

26
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,337
so I'll teach you how to make it next time.

27
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,923
You're not a good cook, after all.

28
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,508
Sorry about that.

29
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,302
Morofushi, teach me how to make it too!

30
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,012
I don't mind if it tastes bad,

31
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,138
so I want Furuya to teach me.

32
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,725
Back off! Zero has zero interest in anyone

33
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,019
other than older female doctors.

34
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,938
Come on, Matsuda!

35
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,233
If you keep saying such mean things,

36
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,027
I'm going to arrest you!

37
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,321
That would be fun!

38
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,907
That's a nice one, isn't it, Zero?

39
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,409
You're right.

40
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,715
I'm sorry for being late.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,801
On my way here,

42
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,011
I was helping an old lady get up the stairs

43
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,930
because she got stuck,

44
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,726
but I dropped the great fortune slip I got at a shrine just now.

45
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,020
I couldn't find the fortune slip,

46
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,021
and when I went back to the shrine

47
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,316
to get another great fortune slip,

48
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,735
I lost track of the time.

49
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,613
He's got to be lying.

50
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,408
He's so kind...

51
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,702
What?

52
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,913
That was delicious.

53
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,333
You've been drinking too much!

54
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,128
How about we go to a karaoke bar next?

55
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,839
Yes...

56
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,426
Thank you for coming!

57
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,224
In the end, only Hagiwara got all the girls.

58
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,810
So it seems.

59
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,521
Excuse me.

60
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,609
Are you a friend of that tall man over there?

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,818
Yes.

62
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,821
Please thank him for carrying me up the stairs

63
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:22,618
and buying me a fortune slip on my behalf.

64
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,411
-Sure. -Thank you.

65
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,705
So, it was true.

66
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,625
Hagi wouldn't tell a lie like that.

67
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,501
He did change the fact that

68
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,211
it was an old man into an old lady

69
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,340
because it would be better received, though.

70
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,906
Hey.

71
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,824
What's the matter, Hiro?

72
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,327
Hurry up, or we'll leave you behind.

73
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,622
Yes.

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,415
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

75
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,501
unravelling mysteries that come before sleep!

76
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,336
A passionate period of youth shared between classmates.

77
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,004
The cherry blossoms will never scatter!

78
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,506
He sees through the one and only truth.

79
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,299
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,511
His name is Detective Conan!

81
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,324
"Police Academy Arc, Wild Police Story"

82
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,911
"Case: Kenji Hagiwara"

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,126
I sang too much at karaoke last night,

84
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,836
so my throat hurts.

85
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,216
You have my sympathies.

86
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,720
You were the one who sang the most at karaoke, after all.

87
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,733
That is so cool!

88
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,238
That's a third-generation Mazda RX-7!

89
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,740
Who's the guy driving it?

90
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,538
It's just Instructor Onizuka.

91
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,999
So this is your car, Instructor Onizuka.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,210
This isn't any old car.

93
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,338
In a way, I consider this my fighter aircraft.

94
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,424
They got the idea to make cars as lightweight as possible

95
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,928
from the A6M Zero fighter aircraft, after all.

96
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,015
This is the famous car known for having the Spirit of Zero!

97
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,601
Just as I expected from you, Instructor Onizuka!

98
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,604
I knew you'd drive my favourite make of car!

99
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,231
Well...

100
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,234
This isn't actually my car.

101
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,113
It belonged to a senior officer of mine who died in the line of duty.

102
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,908
Four years ago, his daughter told me

103
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,829
she would become a police officer someday,

104
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,540
so I'm holding on to it until then.

105
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,001
Please park it in the garage for me.

106
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,128
Don't scratch it.

107
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,921
Yes, sir!

108
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,716
I hope that the officer's daughter is a looker.

109
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,634
She said she wanted to become a police officer,

110
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,221
so she might be even more stubborn than a guy.

111
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,318
What's this? Did you want to ride it, too?

112
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,236
You and that car are both "Zero", after all.

113
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,905
Not... not at all.

114
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,909
I'm not into flashy cars like that.

115
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,328
So, he is into cars like that.

116
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,123
Come on, only one more lap!

117
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,002
Don't dawdle! Move faster!

118
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,504
I see.

119
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:30,425
So, your parents' home was a car repair shop.

120
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,303
That's how you know so much about cars.

121
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,306
More or less. Jinpei has been coming to the shop,

122
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,225
breaking down and remodelling cars since he was a kid, too.

123
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,727
He never asked for permission,

124
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,022
so my dad scolded him about it.

125
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,233
I just wanted to install gull-wing doors

126
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,609
on a Porsche that one time.

127
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,819
Of course, you'd get scolded...

128
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,613
He wasn't satisfied with only cars,

129
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,200
so he ended up investigating bombs as well.

130
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,201
I could more or less figure out

131
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,120
how they were made just by looking at them.

132
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,915
I liked tinkering with machines,

133
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,835
so I wanted to take over the shop.

134
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,005
So, why did you want to become a police officer?

135
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,007
The shop was doing well

136
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,426
and my dad was about to add branches,

137
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,804
but the economy worsened all of a sudden.

138
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,724
In the end, he had to close the shop.

139
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,436
Compared to that, police officers...

140
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,939
never go bankrupt. Don't you think so?

141
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,524
Well, yes...

142
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,734
When you put it like that...

143
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,239
Half a lap to go! Run with all your might!

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,033
How about we dash on the final stretch?

145
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,703
It's on!

146
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,010
Hey, Hagi.

147
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,222
It sounds like the carburettor isn't managing the fuel very well.

148
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,517
That's why I'm fixing it right now.

149
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,317
I might not be as quick as you.

150
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,235
It's fixed!

151
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,322
You're just as skilful as they say.

152
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,199
Jinpei Matsuda and Kenji Hagiwara.

153
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,536
Are you two interested in joining the Riot Police Unit?

154
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,913
-Pardon? -More specifically,

155
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,916
I would like the two of you to join the bomb disposal squad.

156
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,338
The Riot Police Unit's bomb disposal squad, you say?

157
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,633
Of course, we would be interested!

158
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,511
Pleased to be working with you!

159
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:40,354
That's not how you show your appreciation.

160
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,440
Well...

161
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,734
And you?

162
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,654
Could you give me some time to think about it?

163
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,866
"Morofushi"

164
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:53,743
Hiro, I'm about to head out.

165
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:55,662
Is there anything you want me to buy for you?

166
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,042
I wonder if Hiro went out somewhere.

167
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,063
What will be your reply to that man, Hagi?

168
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:27,235
It looks like he's assessing our capabilities.

169
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,237
I'm glad for the opportunity.

170
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:32,365
I get to be in the same department as my best buddy.

171
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:36,160
Not only that, I get to tinker with machines, which I love.

172
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,370
So, why not?

173
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:39,956
Since I've seen what happened...

174
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:43,042
Since I've seen what happened to my dad's repair shop,

175
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:46,463
it all depends on whether things are going well.

176
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:49,048
I wonder if this is like a brake

177
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:52,843
that stops me from entering the path to destruction.

178
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:53,844
"Lounge"

179
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:57,139
If you're not sure, maybe it's better that you don't join.

180
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,059
The bomb disposal squad...

181
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,563
does some dangerous work, after all.

182
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:07,233
If you're going to eat, I'll join you.

183
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:10,152
No, I'm going to check on Instructor Onizuka's car.

184
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:14,740
I can tell what part of a car is wrong just from its sound,

185
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,243
so I was asked to take a look at the engine.

186
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:20,663
He even told me to wash the car.

187
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,832
I want to graduate from the academy

188
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,043
and join the bomb squad as soon as I can.

189
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,672
Matsuda.

190
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:34,635
Aren't you scared of joining the bomb disposal squad?

191
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:38,764
If I said I wasn't scared, I would be lying.

192
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:42,059
I've always been interested in getting rid of bombs.

193
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,772
Besides, I'm the kind of guy...

194
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,862
who only has an accelerator pedal!

195
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,159
I thought as much.

196
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,260
Speaking of that bike shop,

197
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:19,847
I saw a man with a strange tattoo there the other day.

198
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:21,641
A tattoo of a cup that has a base...

199
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:23,143
I think it's called a goblet?

200
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:32,568
Sorry, but I'm coming with you.

201
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:35,863
You headed out with such an unusual expression on your face.

202
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:37,657
Squad Leader Date?

203
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:41,035
I don't know what you're investigating here

204
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:44,163
and you don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

205
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:45,957
I'll stand by and watch.

206
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,042
I won't be in your way.

207
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:51,964
You might catch me talking to myself once in a while, though.

208
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:56,258
You're really persistent.

209
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:58,135
Didn't I say that we can't disclose

210
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:00,471
personal information about our customers?

211
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:05,434
I just have to meet the man with the goblet tattoo! That's all!

212
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:06,435
Tattoo?

213
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:09,064
You're talking about Irie, aren't you?

214
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:14,068
You're the guy from the cleaners.

215
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:16,654
I can't have you say that, Mr. Tomori.

216
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:21,033
It's all right. These young men are training to become policemen.

217
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:24,036
Thanks for saving us at the convenience store the other day.

218
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:25,246
You're welcome.

219
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:29,041
About that Irie guy... What kind of person is he?

220
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,544
He's the silent type and he runs a hardware store.

221
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:33,671
I was with him when the neighbourhood association

222
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,548
went on a hot springs trip one time.

223
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:37,341
Do you have any pictures of him?

224
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:40,636
Irie doesn't like having pictures taken.

225
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:42,346
You'd usually pose for group photos

226
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:46,434
if you go on a group holiday.

227
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:49,270
Now that you mention it... There is one!

228
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,272
Really?

229
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:56,153
Here it is! Irie is the one in the black tank top.

230
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:02,742
But why are you looking for a tattooed man?

231
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:06,871
It's not uncommon to see tattooed people nowadays.

232
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,165
Even the store clerk

233
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,751
has a scorpion tattoo on the back of his neck.

234
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:15,672
And I have a tattoo of the goddess Kannon on my upper arm.

235
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:19,967
The man I saw in the past

236
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:22,137
had a goblet tattoo on the top of his shoulder.

237
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,852
What was that?

238
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,732
I'm heading for the truck driver's seat!

239
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,942
Sure! Hey, what's going on?

240
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:38,944
We stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake pedal

241
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:40,738
and hit the truck from behind.

242
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,158
But then the bumper got stuck.

243
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,951
And the truck didn't notice,

244
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,745
so it drove away with the car still attached.

245
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,249
Excuse me! There's a car stuck behind you!

246
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,752
This is bad, Squad Leader!

247
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,546
The truck driver is unconscious from illness or something!

248
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,757
Darn it! It's picking up speed!

249
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,551
He must have been knocked out with his foot still on the accelerator!

250
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,262
We need to contact the others.

251
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:07,933
I'm pretty sure that Zero said he would be out right now.

252
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,560
What? There's a runaway truck

253
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,271
with a car stuck to its rear bumper?

254
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,149
Did you say the truck driver is unconscious?

255
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,861
Yes, and it's speeding towards the Hachioji area!

256
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:23,155
Date and I borrowed a soba noodle shop's bike

257
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:25,157
and are chasing the truck.

258
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:28,035
Cars in front, please make way!

259
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:30,746
There is a runaway truck behind you!

260
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:32,039
We're trying our best by using a megaphone

261
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,666
we borrowed from an election campaign

262
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,836
to ask the cars in front to move.

263
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:39,463
Have you called the police and the fire department?

264
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,132
Yes, just in case.

265
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,050
But the police academy is closer.

266
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:46,053
-Cars in front, move! -It might be better to use Instructor Onizuka's car.

267
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:48,639
What? Instructor Onizuka's car?

268
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,851
Speaking of that car, Jinpei is...

269
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,145
What? He's not here!

270
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,941
That's strange. He should be repairing or washing the car.

271
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,871
It's still moving while bumping against a guardrail.

272
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:13,957
But if this goes on, sooner or later...

273
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,046
What's up, big guy?

274
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:23,465
Sorry to keep you waiting!

275
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,758
Are you going to be okay?

276
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,845
I thought new students weren't allowed to drive.

277
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,765
What did you say? I can't hear you over the sound of the engine!

278
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:34,351
We have to stop the truck.

279
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:36,771
That would be a piece of cake!

280
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,151
If I crash into the truck, it will physically stop!

281
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:49,743
It's no good! There's too much difference in weight!

282
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:57,459
Hey, Hagiwara.

283
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,547
Do you think you can do "that"?

284
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,759
Sure thing!

285
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,260
What do you mean by "that"?

286
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,971
Hey! Open up your sunroof!

287
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:12,765
Sure.

288
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,850
What are they doing?

289
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,061
Zero.

290
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:20,439
Don't bite your tongue.

291
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,858
Hey. What are you trying to do?

292
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,362
A car is stuck to the bumper of a truck after a collision,

293
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:28,656
and it's being pulled along.

294
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:32,035
Not only that, the truck driver is unconscious from a seizure.

295
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:36,455
What are you doing in this kind of situation?

296
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:40,460
You have to watch to find out!

297
00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:08,737
That's awesome!

298
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:11,741
Once we reach the front of the car, open up the bonnet!

299
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:17,371
I'll remove the bumper.

300
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:19,540
Get to the truck driver's seat!

301
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,959
Got it!

302
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:28,340
Squad Leader, this road isn't on the GPS.

303
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,551
It might be an expressway that's still in construction.

304
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:32,052
Never mind that!

305
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:34,972
The road is disconnected!

306
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,934
All right! I've removed all the clips on the inside of the bumper!

307
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:40,060
Use the handbrake!

308
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,564
Pull it as hard as you can so that the bumper comes off!

309
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,070
Hurry, Furuya!

310
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,947
We're running out of road space!

311
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:54,241
But even if the brake is pulled suddenly,

312
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:57,453
a ten-tonne truck takes twice the distance a car does

313
00:19:57,454 --> 00:19:59,955
to come to a standstill.

314
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:02,667
Even if he pulls the brake now, the truck won't make it.

315
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:16,639
Besides, I'm the kind of guy...

316
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:21,269
who only has an accelerator pedal!

317
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:26,356
The accelerator! Just use the accelerator pedal!

318
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:28,651
Step on it, Zero!

319
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,665
Oh, no...

320
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,959
It's not going to make it!

321
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,939
Hey! Are you all right?

322
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,834
Your advice was just the right thing.

323
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:29,044
Without that, I would have...

324
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:32,256
It's not me. I just thought...

325
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,136
it was something Matsuda would do.

326
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:39,638
I guess it's not a bad thing

327
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:44,269
to step on the accelerator once in a while.

328
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:13,941
By the way, I haven't heard the details

329
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,944
but you saved a few lives.

330
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,238
It's no big deal, sir!

331
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:23,158
So? Have you finished repairing and cleaning the RX-7?

332
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,661
Of course. The engine is in perfect condition.

333
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:27,746
As for the cleaning, you can see...

334
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:30,041
that it's sparkly clean!

335
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:36,171
Keep at it from now on, too.

336
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:38,632
Yes, sir!

337
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:42,262
RX-7, those are some mighty battle scars.

338
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:48,459
"Next Episode" -Did everyone make all of these?

339
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,673
Yes. Everyone here who's in the circle made them.

340
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:55,550
This can't be...

341
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,051
No...

342
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,262
There's no doubt in it.

343
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:01,681
But I also understand his feelings.

344
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:04,268
After all, Yuri ended up like that because...

345
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:09,480
Yes, I can make it in time somehow. So...

346
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:15,070
