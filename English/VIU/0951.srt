1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:02,438
Heave ho! Heave ho!

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:05,839
Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!

3
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:14,066
The steam locomotive's moving.

4
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,066
It's always so cool.

5
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,467
"Yujiro Tamaki (65)" -Oh, no. It's already 11 am.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,869
Hurry, kids.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,669
Okay!

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,570
Heave ho! Heave ho!

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,469
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,569
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,169
Amidst the whistling,

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,969
a case occurs at everyone's favorite used bookstore.

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,569
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,369
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,570
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,966
"The Whistling Bookstore 2."

17
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,304
"Mizutani"

18
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:37,903
I've come from Tamaki Book Cafe to buy books.

19
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:39,703
"Akiko Mizutani (50)" -I've been waiting for you.

20
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:41,604
Please, come in.

21
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,403
There are so many books!

22
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:49,903
So, which books would you like to sell?

23
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,403
All of them, please.

24
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,003
Very well.

25
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:54,204
Now then.

26
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:57,704
Let me take a look.

27
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,003
Even the cheapest are worth 5,000 yen.

28
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,703
The expensive ones are worth over 20,000 yen.

29
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:15,403
No way. They're that valuable?

30
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,603
They're rare books. They're worth at least that much.

31
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:19,003
Rare books?

32
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:22,403
Valuable books that aren't very common

33
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:26,403
because they're old and unusual or limited editions.

34
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:28,803
-Right? -Yeah.

35
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,503
For example,

36
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:34,403
only 500 copies of this book were published in 1920.

37
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:37,603
There are currently many copies on the market,

38
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:39,203
but this one is in good condition.

39
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:40,803
I don't care what they are.

40
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,303
Will you buy all of them?

41
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:47,103
Excuse me, but are these books yours?

42
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,903
No, they belong to my husband.

43
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:53,204
Does your husband know you're selling them?

44
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,103
Seems you don't have his permission.

45
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,403
It's fine. He's in the hospital.

46
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:02,903
They're just taking up space.

47
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:05,703
What? Are you saying you won't buy them?

48
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,503
No. Personally, I'd very much like to purchase them.

49
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:13,604
But please get your husband's permission to sell them.

50
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:23,703
Pretty, aren't they?

51
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:24,704
Yeah.

52
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:28,203
I took them using my phone's camera.

53
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,904
They're very good.

54
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,603
What happened?

55
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:36,303
There was a little bug inside a book.

56
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,703
That's a silverfish.

57
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:40,603
A silverfish? What's that?

58
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:43,003
Silverfish, written using the characters for paper and fish.

59
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:46,303
They're bugs that like to eat the glue in the binding of books.

60
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:49,203
They're fish even though they're bugs?

61
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:51,803
Look closely at its body.

62
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:54,103
With its silver scale-like skin

63
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:57,103
and the way it wiggles its body to move, it looks like...

64
00:04:57,104 --> 00:05:00,103
Now that you mention it, it does look like a fish.

65
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,903
How filthy. What should I do?

66
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:07,203
It's all right. They're easily dealt with.

67
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:11,503
You need this and some kind of paper.

68
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:14,503
Mr. Yujiro, use this.

69
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:16,103
Thank you.

70
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:17,703
Then you do this.

71
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:19,603
It smells good.

72
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:21,303
Smells like lavender.

73
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:26,303
Silverfish dislike the smell of herbs, especially lavender.

74
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:32,003
Simply place a lavender-scented piece of paper in the bookshelf,

75
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:34,803
and the silverfish will go away.

76
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:36,203
Amazing!

77
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,503
How informative.

78
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,704
I should try that at home.

79
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:46,603
Well, we should get going.

80
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:49,404
Thank you for coming.

81
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:58,404
"Ryosuke Sawada (35)" -Welcome. Sit wherever you'd like.

82
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:04,803
How much are these books worth?

83
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:08,503
An appraisal? Let me see.

84
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:12,203
These are all rare books.

85
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,903
Excuse me.

86
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:16,303
Would they be worth 500,000 yen?

87
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:17,703
Don't be absurd.

88
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:19,103
It depends on their condition,

89
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:22,403
but all together they'd be worth over 200,000 yen.

90
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:24,103
That jerk...

91
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:27,903
I can't accurately appraise them without seeing them in person.

92
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:31,304
If possible, please bring them here.

93
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,104
I'll be waiting.

94
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:46,003
What a truly relaxing space.

95
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:48,003
"Ichiro Tamaki (35)" -Thank you for coming.

96
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:50,103
"Michiko Yoshikawa (27)" -Would you like another coffee?

97
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:52,403
I suppose I would.

98
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:54,803
Is Mr. Yujiro not here today?

99
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,803
He's in the back.

100
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,903
He's currently checking

101
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:01,304
and mending all the books he bought yesterday.

102
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,103
Hey, you came.

103
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:13,303
Are these books...

104
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,903
Yeah, they're Mizutani's books.

105
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:18,103
You bought the rare books, too?

106
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,803
No. Apparently

107
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:22,403
the husband asked that she not sell the rare books,

108
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:25,103
so I bought everything else.

109
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:26,803
Really?

110
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:30,604
Dad, someone named Mizutani is calling for you.

111
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:34,203
It's me.

112
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,603
What? Really?

113
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:40,003
No, nonsense.

114
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:43,203
I understand. I'll head there immediately.

115
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,003
Is something wrong?

116
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:47,103
The rare books were stolen.

117
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:48,703
What?

118
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:52,303
But why did she call you?

119
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:56,503
It seems she believes I stole them.

120
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:58,403
"Mizutani."

121
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:00,503
Hand over the books you stole!

122
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,503
Calm down.

123
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:04,203
Start by telling me what happened

124
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,304
when the books were stolen.

125
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,903
I went out for lunch with a friend today.

126
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:13,503
We finished eating around 1 pm.

127
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:16,603
I came home immediately and discovered

128
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:20,803
the window was broken and the books were missing.

129
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:23,203
You called the police, right?

130
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,303
Yes.

131
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,103
The police said it must've been a professional

132
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,103
based on how the window was broken.

133
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:30,603
I was at the store all day today.

134
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:33,503
I couldn't have stolen from you.

135
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:36,303
That confirms Mr. Yujiro's alibi.

136
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:37,803
We can't be sure yet.

137
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:40,403
He could've gotten someone to steal them.

138
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:42,803
I wouldn't do that.

139
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,603
Those books were at our house for nearly twenty years.

140
00:08:45,604 --> 00:08:49,103
But the moment you appraised them, they were stolen.

141
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:51,303
How do you explain that?

142
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:52,604
Well...

143
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:57,803
She really suspected him.

144
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,203
I know.

145
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:04,003
Hey, let's catch the real culprit.

146
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:07,403
Now, now. Let the police handle the investigation.

147
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:09,703
-What? -What is it?

148
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:11,703
I can't find my phone.

149
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:13,203
It must be at the cafe.

150
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:14,903
Should we go back to get it?

151
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:18,303
Someone's probably still at the store.

152
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:20,304
Sorry. Could we do that?

153
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:28,303
I'm sorry, but the store is closed for...

154
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,503
You came to get some books appraised the other day.

155
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,403
I want to know their exact value.

156
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:38,304
Very well. Allow me to take a look.

157
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:43,903
These are truly good books.

158
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:45,203
They're in good condition.

159
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:48,203
You can get a good price for these.

160
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:52,204
Anyway, what a coincidence.

161
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:57,603
I just recently appraised the same book.

162
00:09:57,604 --> 00:10:00,003
I wasn't expecting to appraise them two days in a row.

163
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:02,204
Oh, no.

164
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:09,803
Sir, where did you get these books?

165
00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:12,903
What does it matter? Hurry up and appraise them.

166
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,403
You stole these from Mizutani's house, didn't you?

167
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:17,703
No!

168
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:20,903
I'm sorry, but I'll be calling the police.

169
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,503
What? These are my books!

170
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,703
You can tell that to the police.

171
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:27,603
Wait.

172
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:28,904
Stop.

173
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,503
Did something happen?

174
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,104
Let's check it out.

175
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,703
Is it a case?

176
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:51,604
Mr. Yujiro.

177
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:55,003
Mr. Yujiro, are you hurt?

178
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,903
You kids again?

179
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:59,903
We came to the cafe next door to get something.

180
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:02,703
Then we saw the crowd.

181
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,403
This isn't my blood.

182
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:06,704
Then...

183
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:12,103
He's a suspect in this case.

184
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,904
What?

185
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,345
What's going on?

186
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,545
I called the police.

187
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:27,445
She discovered the body.

188
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:32,545
I clearly saw him standing next to the body.

189
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:36,645
Inspector Megure, we've identified the man.

190
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:39,745
The victim was Ryosuke Sawada, 35 years old.

191
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,945
He lives nearby and is unemployed.

192
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:44,645
What's the cause of death?

193
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:47,445
A cerebral contusion caused by a blow to the head.

194
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:50,945
The weapon is almost certainly this bloody rock

195
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:52,345
found at the crime scene.

196
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,945
Were there fingerprints on the weapon?

197
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,645
None. But...

198
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:57,845
What?

199
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:00,445
We found traces of hand cream on the weapon.

200
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:02,245
Hand cream?

201
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:03,345
Yes.

202
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:06,145
Come to think of it, I heard those who work with books

203
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:09,645
frequently apply hand cream to prevent chapped hands.

204
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,145
Isn't that right?

205
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:12,345
Yes.

206
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:14,245
Do you have some with you now?

207
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:15,246
Yes.

208
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:19,745
Do you mind if we examine this?

209
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,745
No. Go right ahead.

210
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:24,145
Chiba, take this to forensics.

211
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:25,445
Yes, sir.

212
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:29,745
Now then, could you explain what happened?

213
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:33,145
Yes. I received a phone call from him.

214
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:34,945
He asked me to come to the park.

215
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:37,245
What time was that?

216
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:38,945
Around 7 pm.

217
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:42,145
When I arrived, he was on the ground.

218
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:44,645
I ran to him, but he was already...

219
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:47,245
And your clothes got bloody then?

220
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:48,345
Yes.

221
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:51,445
But why did the victim call you?

222
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:53,445
He didn't tell me why.

223
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:57,545
But I think it had something to do with those books.

224
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:58,946
Those books?

225
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,145
-Dad. -Dad.

226
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,645
Sorry for making you worry.

227
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,246
Officer, those are them.

228
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:14,545
There are about ten books inside.

229
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:19,045
This evening, he brought them to be appraised.

230
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,645
Come to think of it...

231
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:21,945
What's wrong?

232
00:13:21,946 --> 00:13:24,345
I think there was a picture of these books

233
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,246
on the victim's phone.

234
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:29,945
Found it. This is it.

235
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:31,245
This photo.

236
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:35,245
He showed it to me when he came to my store.

237
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:37,545
The victim came here previously?

238
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:41,045
Yes. The first time he only showed me the photo.

239
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:44,445
I told him I couldn't appraise them without seeing them in person.

240
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,245
I see.

241
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:49,645
By the way, how much are these books worth?

242
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:51,945
2,500,000 yen all together.

243
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:54,646
What? They're that valuable?

244
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:03,845
That's the paper I gave you.

245
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:05,645
What does that mean?

246
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,345
Ayumi gave him that notepaper

247
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:11,946
at Mizutani's house to combat silverfish.

248
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:15,145
I noticed the same thing

249
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,445
and suspected he was the thief.

250
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:20,645
What thief?

251
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:21,845
This afternoon,

252
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:25,046
some rare books were stolen from Mizutani's house.

253
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:28,845
-Is that true? -Yes.

254
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,445
So the victim stole the books from Mizutani's house

255
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,145
and came here to sell them.

256
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:36,945
That's why I attempted to call the police.

257
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:40,345
But he rushed out of the store.

258
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,845
Later, he called me to tell me to come to the park.

259
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:46,145
I see.

260
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,146
What?

261
00:14:51,646 --> 00:14:53,645
What is it, Conan?

262
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:56,145
Could you show me that phone again?

263
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,745
What?

264
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,545
You're hopeless.

265
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:00,646
Thank you.

266
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:06,545
I knew it.

267
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:10,245
The black stain in the photo isn't on the actual book.

268
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:13,045
Which means...

269
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,746
There's no scratch on the lens.

270
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,345
What's this?

271
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:20,745
A button?

272
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:22,945
Hey, wait.

273
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,545
What is it, Chiba?

274
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:27,045
There were signs the victim was involved in a struggle.

275
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:29,945
One of his buttons were missing.

276
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:32,445
That must be it.

277
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:35,345
Mr. Tamaki, how do you explain this?

278
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:40,945
We got into a bit of a tussle when I tried to call the police.

279
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:42,845
It's possible it came off then.

280
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:46,245
Why didn't you mention that?

281
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,446
Because...

282
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,545
Hello?

283
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,545
Yes.

284
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:57,145
Yes. Understood.

285
00:15:57,146 --> 00:16:01,445
It was a match for the hand cream on the weapon.

286
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:03,445
What? No way.

287
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:05,845
You fought with the victim,

288
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:10,445
and your hand cream matched the cream found on the weapon.

289
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:13,945
Given all the circumstantial evidence,

290
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,545
Mr. Yujiro Tamaki,

291
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,945
could you come down to the station with us?

292
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:19,045
No way.

293
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,545
There must be some mistake.

294
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:22,945
What will you do?

295
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:25,445
At this rate, they really will arrest him.

296
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:29,146
I know, but I haven't found anything conclusive yet.

297
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,745
Oh, no. I left the water boiling.

298
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:36,146
It's fine. I'll turn it off.

299
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,246
Thank you.

300
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:49,945
Looks like you figured it out.

301
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:52,245
Yeah.

302
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:54,545
Wait one moment.

303
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,845
Mr. Yujiro isn't the culprit.

304
00:16:57,846 --> 00:17:01,145
But the circumstantial evidence...

305
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:05,345
Hand cream is oil-based. It repels water.

306
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:08,345
If he held the weapon with a hand coated in cream,

307
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:09,945
and bludgeoned the victim,

308
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,745
the section the cream stuck to would repel water.

309
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:15,445
No blood would be on it.

310
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:17,945
But forensics reported that

311
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,245
there was cream found on the bloody section.

312
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:24,045
In other words, the cream was applied

313
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,045
after the victim was struck.

314
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,045
But why?

315
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,545
Isn't it obvious?

316
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:33,545
So the real culprit could frame Mr. Yujiro.

317
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:36,445
Who's the real culprit?

318
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:41,745
The real culprit is the other person involved in the book theft.

319
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:44,445
The other person?

320
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:49,645
Take another look at the picture on the victim's phone.

321
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:51,345
This is it.

322
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:55,846
See the dark spot on the photo?

323
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:00,145
You mean this?

324
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,845
But there's no stain on the actual book.

325
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:06,445
You're right. The actual book is clean.

326
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:10,645
In other words, the black spot was caused by a scratch

327
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,945
or stain on the lens.

328
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:17,645
However, I didn't find a scratch on the victim's phone lens.

329
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:20,345
In other words, a different camera

330
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:22,645
was used to take the photo.

331
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:28,345
I saw a photo with a similar dark spot in Mizutani's home.

332
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,245
You're right. You mean the pictures of the flowers.

333
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:34,745
Then the person who took this photo was...

334
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:38,646
Mizutani, could we take a look at your phone?

335
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:45,145
There's a scratch on the lens.

336
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:48,845
It proves Mizutani sent the photo of the rare books

337
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:53,245
to the victim and instructed him to steal them.

338
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:54,946
Well?

339
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:59,345
It's true. I had him steal them.

340
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,445
What? But why have your own books stolen?

341
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:06,845
To be precise, they aren't her books, but her husband's.

342
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:11,045
At first, she tried to sell the books while her husband

343
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:13,645
was in the hospital for some pocket money, but...

344
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:16,445
Mr. Yujiro declined to buy them.

345
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,145
Yes.

346
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:20,845
You're right about the book theft.

347
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:22,645
But the murder is different.

348
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:26,445
Or do you have evidence proving I killed him?

349
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:28,545
Your glasses.

350
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:29,745
My glasses?

351
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:32,545
When you went to turn off the stove,

352
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,245
the steam from the kettle hit your face.

353
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:39,145
Only one of your lenses fogged up.

354
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:43,745
Hand creams are sometimes used to prevent fogging.

355
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:48,745
When you applied the same hand cream as Mr. Yujiro's

356
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:52,545
to the weapon in order to frame him,

357
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:55,545
perhaps you accidentally got some of the cream

358
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:58,146
on one of your glasses lenses.

359
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,845
You're wrong!

360
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:03,545
If you applied the cream after striking him,

361
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:07,645
some blood should be mixed in with the cream.

362
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:10,645
If you carefully examine Mizutani's glasses,

363
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,245
I'm sure you'll find

364
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:15,645
traces of the victim's blood.

365
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:20,246
Mizutani, could we examine those glasses?

366
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:26,545
I did it.

367
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:28,445
I planned to have Sawada sell the books

368
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:31,845
and give him a bit of the money.

369
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:34,945
But when he learned the true value of the books,

370
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:37,845
he realized I was trying to cheat him.

371
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:40,045
He threatened to tell my husband everything

372
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:42,745
if I didn't give him more.

373
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:45,145
So you killed him to keep him quiet?

374
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:48,345
Yes. Even if I paid him a fair share,

375
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:51,345
he might continue to blackmail me.

376
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:54,245
Besides, if I paid him that much,

377
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:56,945
that would leave less for me.

378
00:20:56,946 --> 00:21:01,545
But why frame Mr. Tamaki?

379
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:05,445
If he'd just bought the books,

380
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:09,245
I wouldn't have needed him to steal them.

381
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:13,145
So I deliberately hid that paper in the books

382
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,445
when I had Sawada take them to be appraised.

383
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:19,745
I did it so he'd immediately realize he was the thief.

384
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:24,445
I calculated that they would get into a fight.

385
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:26,945
Then I brought Sawada to the park

386
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:29,245
and had him make the call.

387
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,145
I killed Sawada before Mr. Tamaki arrived

388
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:35,545
and called the police when he found the body.

389
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,746
I thought I'd gotten away with it.

390
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:10,245
"Class 1-B Seedlings."

391
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:12,245
What's this book?

392
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:15,045
It's our class anthology.

393
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:18,145
There aren't many of them, so it's definitely rare.

394
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,145
We think it might be valuable.

395
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,745
It's a good book,

396
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:26,345
but unfortunately, I can't assign a price to it.

397
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:28,145
What?

398
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:30,345
But if you become famous in a few years,

399
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:33,845
it'd be a different story.

400
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,445
Hold onto it until then.

401
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:38,045
Okay!

402
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:40,045
In five years, maybe?

403
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:41,845
Can you become famous in five years?

404
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:43,246
Sure you can.

405
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:46,745
"Next Episode" -Hey, wait.

406
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:50,146
This isn't a restaurant.

407
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:54,845
It's a bunny girl club.

408
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:58,145
There are black bunnies everywhere.

409
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,845
I wouldn't have brought Conan

410
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:02,845
if I'd known it was this kind of place.

411
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,546
I'm fine.

412
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,945
Next Conan,

413
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:13,946
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 1)"
