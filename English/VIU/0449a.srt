1
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:02,344
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:04,244
Turns out to a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:05,644
Here comes the one hour summer special!

4
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:06,944
A serial killer tries to murder a bride and groom

5
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:08,744
at a wedding party full of cops.

6
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:10,244
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:12,044
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,045
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:12,645
You did it.

10
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:18,225
Finally! Finally the day has come!

11
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:20,725
Defeating all my rivals,

12
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:23,926
I am now going to have eternal love with her!

13
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:42,826
Ms. Sato!

14
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,525
Takagi!

15
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:57,726
Yumi? Is that Yumi?

16
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:01,326
Takagi!

17
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:04,925
No, it is not Yumi that I'm going to marry.

18
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:06,425
Not you, Yumi!

19
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:07,925
Congratulations, Yumi!

20
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,126
I'm happy for you, Yumi!

21
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:11,326
Wait a second!

22
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,225
I can't talk?

23
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,125
I can't move my body either.

24
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:17,326
Please help, Chiba!

25
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:19,525
Congratulations.

26
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:23,725
Hey! Chiba, how can you eat a hamburger now?

27
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:24,925
Inspector Megure?

28
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:28,225
-Right, left. Right... -It's no good.

29
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:29,526
Takagi...

30
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,826
Congratulations, Takagi.

31
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:38,725
No. This is not what you think, Mr. Shiratori.

32
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:40,225
Gosh, what should I do?

33
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:41,326
This is bad.

34
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,025
Ms. Sato!

35
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,525
Congratulations...

36
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,726
Takagi!

37
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,325
Ouch.

38
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,525
That hurts...

39
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:59,826
It was a dream. That hurts, but I'm glad it was only a dream.

40
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:10,926
"Love Story of Metropolitan Detectives: Fake Wedding."

41
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,825
This is yours.

42
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:29,826
-Thanks. -No problem.

43
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:34,225
Well, that was a nice wedding.

44
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:35,325
It was.

45
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:38,325
But it would've been nicer if I caught that bouquet.

46
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:41,825
Oh, please. You're too young for that.

47
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:46,125
Or do you have someone that proposed to you already?

48
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:47,925
Well, not really.

49
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:50,526
I just want to wear a wedding dress.

50
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,725
Then I'll get you a cheap rental one.

51
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:01,225
You can wear it and take a picture of yourself.

52
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:02,226
Nevermind.

53
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:04,325
It'll still be expensive though.

54
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:05,526
No, please don't!

55
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:08,825
-Come on! It's just for a little while. -The voice sounds familiar.

56
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:09,826
Come on!

57
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:12,426
What are you...

58
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:16,325
Officer Takagi?

59
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:18,825
-You're going to get married? -Congratulations!

60
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,925
Well, no...

61
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:24,425
Why do I have to see them at a time like this?

62
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:25,625
So who's the bride?

63
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,225
Don't be foolish, Dad. It must be Officer Sato.

64
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:31,525
Wrong answer!

65
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:35,025
The bride is me!

66
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:37,025
Yumi...

67
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,625
-You are Yumi Miyamoto? -What? I thought you liked...

68
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:41,426
I thought you liked Officer Sato, didn't you?

69
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:45,025
Well, it's a long story.

70
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:46,225
Well, well.

71
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,225
You guys look awesome together.

72
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:49,525
Inspector Shiratori.

73
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:53,425
Why don't you get married with her right now?

74
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:56,125
Yeah, that's a good idea, darling!

75
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:57,925
Hey, Yumi.

76
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:58,926
Miwako.

77
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,525
You know what's going on, right?

78
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,825
You guys are the target today.

79
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:05,325
Yes, I know that all too well!

80
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:08,125
And you're also going too far!

81
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:09,726
Yes. I know.

82
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:13,525
-Hey... -What in the world is happening here right now?

83
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:15,125
Well, actually...

84
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,126
Inspector Megure!

85
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:20,725
What? Someone is trying to kill them?

86
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:22,425
Why Takagi and Yumi though?

87
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,925
Actually, they are the fake target.

88
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:32,125
The true target is the bride and the groom who called us for help.

89
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:37,325
Six months ago, a masked robber broke into the bride's house.

90
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:41,225
She was lucky because the groom happened to be there and chased him out.

91
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,425
But the robber said this before running away...

92
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:44,625
You...

93
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:47,525
I will never forgive you.

94
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:51,025
But that's what typical bad guys usually say, isn't it?

95
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:53,825
Why do they have to pretend to be the target?

96
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:56,625
It wouldn't be like this if it were a plain robbery.

97
00:06:56,626 --> 00:07:00,625
We found fingerprints on a cooking knife

98
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:03,125
that happened to match the fingerprints of a man,

99
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:05,325
who is the suspect of four robbery cases.

100
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,926
The robber took six lives during that time.

101
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:15,325
Firstly, he broke into the house silently, so nobody noticed him.

102
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,925
Then he killed the victim by stabbing the throat with a knife.

103
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:22,325
After he took all the valuables

104
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:25,425
and set the house on fire, he immediately ran away.

105
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:27,325
And the night before yesterday,

106
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:30,825
a piece of paper was found in the bride's mailbox.

107
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:36,725
It said, "Happy marriage. My present should be coming to you soon."

108
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:37,825
I see.

109
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:41,625
Now I understand why you guys are disguised as the bride and groom.

110
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:45,225
But why does it have to be Officer Takagi and Officer Yumi?

111
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:46,425
What?

112
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:49,325
Are you saying that I'm not good enough for him?

113
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:50,825
Well, no...

114
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:52,425
What else could we do?

115
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:58,825
The bride, Rei Masudo, and the groom, Masateru Taira look like this.

116
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,625
Here.

117
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:01,626
I see.

118
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:05,225
They look just like Takagi and the girl on the police car.

119
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:06,526
Really?

120
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:10,625
Then, does the real wedding has been cancelled?

121
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:14,925
No. The real wedding will be held, as the bride really wanted to.

122
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:17,925
Well, police officers will be standing at the building entrance

123
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:20,625
so people with no invitation cannot come in.

124
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,525
So I suppose the only chance the killer can attack them

125
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:26,025
is when the bride and groom come out of the church after the ceremony.

126
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:29,325
That's when Takagi and Yumi will come to play.

127
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:31,925
Of course, they'll be wearing protective vests.

128
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:36,625
Plus, all the wedding attendants will be undercover officers.

129
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,425
Is it really going to be okay though?

130
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:41,325
You never know how the killer is going to attack you, you know.

131
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:42,825
Don't worry about that.

132
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:47,325
If anything happens, Miwako is going to come and save us.

133
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,825
-Right? -Yeah.

134
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:50,725
I will save Takagi first though.

135
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:54,725
Gosh! You choose affection over friendship?

136
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:56,525
I can't believe it!

137
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:58,325
What can I say?

138
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,825
It is more likely that the groom is going to be attacked

139
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:03,625
because he is the one who chased the killer out.

140
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,625
Besides, you are too close to him.

141
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:06,726
Miwako.

142
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:12,325
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

143
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:13,825
Sorry if I'm wrong,

144
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:17,025
but you came to the wedding ceremony of Mr. Taira and Ms. Masudo?

145
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:18,026
Yes.

146
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,625
Then, all of you as well?

147
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,425
Yeah.

148
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:25,025
It's going to be at the third ceremony hall at 5 o'clock, right?

149
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:27,126
All right, see you at the hall then.

150
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:30,626
Hey.

151
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,225
Good luck, Rei.

152
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:37,525
Let's see, the third ceremony hall is that way, I think.

153
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:39,425
Hi, Ms. Masudo.

154
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:40,625
I'm Karube.

155
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:42,625
Thank you for the invitation.

156
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,625
This is the first time we see each other in person, right?

157
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,825
Yeah.

158
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:48,725
All right, looking forward to see you at the ceremony hall.

159
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:52,425
They completely believe that you're Ms. Masudo.

160
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,225
Does she look that much like her?

161
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,825
Maybe it's a sign that you guys are a perfect match.

162
00:09:57,826 --> 00:09:59,525
Inspector Shiratori...

163
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:02,025
Maybe that's why I had that dream this morning.

164
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:05,325
All right, I don't want you to get into unnecessary trouble.

165
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:08,725
You guys wait in your room until the ceremony.

166
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:09,726
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

167
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:12,525
Actually, people are coming in and out of this hall,

168
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:14,625
so why don't you wait in the other room?

169
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:15,925
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

170
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:21,225
Now, we should talk to the bride and groom about the situation.

171
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:22,425
-Yeah, we should. -Yes!

172
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:24,325
See you later then, Mouri!

173
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:27,125
Yes, sir! Please be careful!

174
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,325
Hey, why don't you go with them?

175
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,425
What?

176
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,025
You're that famous Detective Mouri.

177
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:35,525
You should go and help them.

178
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:37,025
You're right.

179
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:39,525
-Hey! Wait, Inspector! -Dad!

180
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:41,726
-I'm coming, too! -Hey, Conan!

181
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:46,225
-Excuse me. -Do I know you?

182
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:49,326
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

183
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:53,925
Hey, hey.

184
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:56,225
What are you talking about, Rei?

185
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:58,925
Today is an important day that we've been working on together.

186
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:01,625
Please don't say that we should cancel it now.

187
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:05,225
But, Masateru, somebody is trying to kill us.

188
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:09,025
What if something happens to the guests we invited here today?

189
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:12,025
Don't worry. He isn't going to come.

190
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,925
Trust me.

191
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:14,926
But...

192
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:17,525
Sorry to intrude.

193
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:18,825
Inspector.

194
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,925
How is it? Any news?

195
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:24,225
So far, nothing.

196
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:29,025
We put our officers on the inside and outside of this hall.

197
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:31,525
Plus, we're going to be with you guys when you move around.

198
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:32,925
So there's nothing to worry about.

199
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,025
See? You don't need to worry about anything.

200
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,926
By the way, who is the gentleman behind you?

201
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:42,025
He is Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

202
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:43,625
He just happened to be here today.

203
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:45,325
Hello.

204
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:46,825
That famous detective?

205
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:49,125
So you're the Sleeping Kogoro?

206
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,225
I'll be helping you guys. I'll try my best.

207
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:53,325
Now, I need you to tell me about the incident

208
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:57,825
that happened six months ago in detail.

209
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:58,826
All right.

210
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,925
It was a snowy night,

211
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:03,326
actually midnight, past 12 o'clock.

212
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,925
I woke up as I heard a weird noise.

213
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:11,125
I tried to turn on the light, but it didn't turn on somehow.

214
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:12,725
It was weird.

215
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:14,626
So I went to where the noise was coming from.

216
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:22,626
The man saw me and tried to attack me with the knife that he had.

217
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,426
I ran away desperately in the darkness.

218
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:31,825
But he caught me at the front door.

219
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:34,725
Seriously, I thought I was going to die.

220
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:37,726
But my husband came from the front door and saved me.

221
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,825
Actaually, I had a bad feeling that night,

222
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,325
because she told me that her parents were out on a trip,

223
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:49,025
and there were only two elderly servants in her house.

224
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:52,625
Then, he and the robber started fighting.

225
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:54,125
Hurry and call the police!

226
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:57,125
So I went back to my room and called the police.

227
00:12:57,126 --> 00:13:01,425
When I came back, the man was telling Masateru something,

228
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:02,726
and he ran away.

229
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:09,325
So that's when he said, "I will never forgive you"?

230
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:12,626
-Yeah. -So, were you both okay?

231
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,425
I didn't have any injury at all,

232
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,125
but he was injured on his left hand.

233
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:19,925
I landed on my left wrist at a bad angle

234
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:22,125
while struggling with the robber

235
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:25,225
and I broke my left wrist and thumb.

236
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:28,025
I actually had a cast on my left arm until last week.

237
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:32,025
But we should've gone to that place

238
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:34,025
if we knew that things were going to be like this.

239
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,525
Where is that place?

240
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:38,025
Her father told her that we should leave Japan for a while

241
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,225
because such a dangerous man was trying to hurt her.

242
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:45,226
So he bought us a cottage in Hawaii.

243
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,125
That sounds good!

244
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:51,225
There, we don't need to worry about a robbery like the other one

245
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:54,925
because we got all the security systems in the house.

246
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:56,825
What do you mean "the other one"?

247
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:58,825
There was a robbery in your house as well?

248
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:02,025
Yeah. It was in his house.

249
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:05,225
It happened while she and I were out.

250
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:07,325
Anything stolen?

251
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,725
Nothing.

252
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:11,326
Just that my computer was on after the robbery.

253
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,026
Excuse me.

254
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:18,425
This is Megure.

255
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:21,125
Hey, Chiba.

256
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,125
What? There's a burned dead body with the throat slashed?

257
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,325
Yes.

258
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:27,525
It was found in an empty warehouse by Teimuzu River.

259
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:30,725
It was a man between the age of 30 to 40 years old,

260
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:33,425
wearing a dark blue suit with a white tie.

261
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:36,825
I also got important information from the forensic officer just now.

262
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:39,325
Under his left fingernails...

263
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:42,826
You found fingerprints from the burglar and serial killer?

264
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:47,525
A white tie, so it was formal attire.

265
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:52,425
Hey, did your computer have the guest list for the wedding in it?

266
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:55,725
Yeah. We made that in his room together.

267
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:59,425
That means the burned dead body could be one of guests on the list.

268
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:02,425
The killer murdered him in order to get the invitation.

269
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:07,026
So it is possible that the killer is already in this wedding hall.

270
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:14,636
We have to cancel the wedding.

271
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:17,536
Stop all the weddings in this wedding hall

272
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:21,636
and get all the people out of here!

273
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:26,036
I don't want so many people here with a killer on loose.

274
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:29,036
It's best to get everyone out now.

275
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,336
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

276
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:33,336
Hold on a minute, Inspector.

277
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,736
It's a wedding.

278
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,536
You can't just cancel and ruin our important day

279
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:41,836
without concrete evidence that the killer is here.

280
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,436
But, Mr. Taira,

281
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:45,736
it is likely that you're going to be attacked,

282
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:51,636
because you fought the robber that broke into Ms. Masudo's house.

283
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:56,936
Also, a blackmail was sent to Ms. Masudo's mailbox two days ago.

284
00:15:56,937 --> 00:16:00,936
And now, we found a burned dead body

285
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,136
with his throat slashed in the warehouse.

286
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:05,536
Not only the method of homicide was the same,

287
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:09,936
even the serial killer's fingerprints were also found on the victim's nail.

288
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:12,836
Not to mention that the victim was dressed in formal wear,

289
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:15,236
and after someone broke into your apartment,

290
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:19,736
your computer that was off was turned on when you came back.

291
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:24,036
It is reasonable to think that the robber was the serial killer.

292
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:26,936
He stole the guest list for this wedding from your computer,

293
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:29,236
called someone on the list

294
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:32,136
and murdered him in order to get the invitation.

295
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:35,736
And with that invitation, the killer may be here

296
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:37,936
in this wedding hall right now.

297
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:42,436
That's right. He's trying to take revenge on you at your ceremony.

298
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:46,337
But we don't even know if the dead body was one of our guests or not.

299
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:53,936
Inspector Megure, we got something for the bride and groom.

300
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:56,537
It needs to be opened right now.

301
00:16:58,237 --> 00:16:59,736
What is that?

302
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:02,036
Who gave you that?

303
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:05,036
Well, the hall staff gave me this,

304
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,336
so I don't know where this came from.

305
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:07,636
Hey, hey!

306
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:10,836
How could you bring such an unidentified thing here in this situation?

307
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:13,237
Well, but...

308
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,736
Actually, I've checked it already.

309
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,736
All right, I see.

310
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:22,036
Oh, it's from Ms. Shimizu.

311
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,636
You know, our chat friend.

312
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,036
Then this must be that video.

313
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,636
"Chat friend"?

314
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:32,436
We are into this internet website of hot springs right now.

315
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:35,036
And we're planning to have a party after the ceremony

316
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:38,336
with the people on the website.

317
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:41,536
And this is the video we are planning to play during the party.

318
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:44,836
We asked Ms. Shimizu to check it before the party.

319
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:47,136
I guess she finally finished editing it.

320
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:48,437
Let me take a look.

321
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:52,336
A day with Mr. Taira and Rei.

322
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,736
Last month, Mr. Taira chased a robber out.

323
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,236
Their relationship has become closer and tighter

324
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:57,936
and they have finally got engaged.

325
00:17:57,937 --> 00:18:00,437
Now, what does their lovely life look like? Let's take a look.

326
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,636
-What? You came already? -Yes.

327
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:05,637
Where is this?

328
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:07,636
-The front door of my apartment. -Wait a second.

329
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:08,836
I'll get ready real quick, okay?

330
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,236
All right.

331
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:12,236
Is Ms. Shimizu the one shooting this?

332
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:14,936
Yes. We found out that we live close to each other.

333
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:16,937
So we became close friends in the real world as well.

334
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:19,137
Sorry to keep you waiting.

335
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:23,536
-We're heading to Tropical Land, right? -Yes.

336
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,836
You put your key on the light.

337
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,436
Do you always put it there?

338
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:29,336
Yes, it's my habit.

339
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:32,236
That means Ms. Shimizu could pick up the key

340
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,736
and break into your house any time.

341
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:37,136
She's not that kind of person!

342
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:40,036
She was the one who suggested

343
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,136
that we should report the robbery to the police.

344
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:46,536
She suggested it? You didn't tell the police about the robbery?

345
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:50,137
Yeah, because nothing was stolen.

346
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:52,936
But just in case,

347
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:55,936
the date of the wedding was postponed to the next day

348
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,636
than what was written on the list.

349
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,836
Even if the robber broke into my house and saw the list,

350
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:02,036
he can't come here.

351
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:07,436
But still, the killer could've called someone from the guest list,

352
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,536
pretending to be your friend

353
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:12,036
and confirm when the wedding was going to be

354
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:16,036
or even tell him to come see him, right?

355
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:22,636
Then, why don't the bride and groom go and see their guests in person?

356
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:27,636
The bad man may be there pretending to be your friend, right?

357
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:29,336
Right.

358
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:30,936
Seeing the guests in person?

359
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,736
What if the killer attacks them?

360
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,936
Well, seeing them in person maybe impossible,

361
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:39,536
but we can hide in the next room and check them out.

362
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:43,336
That sounds reasonable under this situation.

363
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:45,336
It's worth trying.

364
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:47,136
We don't want to trigger the killer's criminal act

365
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:48,936
by cancelling the ceremony all of a sudden.

366
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,136
That's true.

367
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:52,936
Will you please confirm the guests?

368
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:54,536
Okay.

369
00:19:54,537 --> 00:19:55,936
Sure.

370
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:59,336
Sato, tell Takagi and Yumi

371
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:03,336
that the killer may already be in this building

372
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:09,136
and that there's a possibility that they are going to be attacked.

373
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:10,736
Understood.

374
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,536
And one more thing, Sato.

375
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:15,836
You need to stay here to protect the real bride and groom.

376
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:16,837
Yes, sir!

377
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:20,336
Masateru, I'm so scared.

378
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:22,337
Don't worry. I'm with you.

379
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:29,636
Hey, guys! Look at me!

380
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:31,636
Tell me, how do I look?

381
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:32,736
Do I look good?

382
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:35,436
Really? Yumi, are you going to get married?

383
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:36,536
Are you kidding me?

384
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:37,736
I'm not going to get married.

385
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,336
It's part of my job!

386
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,136
Hey, Yumi.

387
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:44,936
I don't think you should be talking about this mission to outsiders.

388
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:47,136
Yeah, I know that, idiot!

389
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:49,736
Don't you interrupt my phone conversation, okay?

390
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:50,836
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,636
What? That man's voice?

392
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:54,536
No, it's from the television.

393
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:57,836
Gosh. She is totally opposite from a while ago.

394
00:20:57,837 --> 00:21:00,836
Girls are so unpredictable.

395
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:04,036
The bride is me!

396
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:07,136
Anyway, why was I having that dream this morning?

397
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:09,436
I know we are the scapegoat of the bride and groom

398
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:10,836
but we don't have to have a wedding ceremony.

399
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,237
That must be a prophetic dream.

400
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,936
There's a subconscious desire deep inside your head

401
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:16,536
that you want to marry Kitada.

402
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:19,036
You're just not aware of it yet.

403
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:21,036
What? That can't be true.

404
00:21:21,037 --> 00:21:22,836
Kitada? Why that nerd?

405
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:25,936
But people say, "Truth often comes out from lies."

406
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:29,137
I think it's fate that you and Kitada will be together!

407
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:33,436
Prophetic dream? Subconscious desire?

408
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:34,837
No way!

409
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:37,737
Ms. Sato.

410
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:39,736
That's nonsense.

411
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:43,036
There's no such thing as prophetic dreams or subconscious desires.

412
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,736
There's no truth behind them.

413
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,036
What are you talking about, Officer Takagi?

414
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,436
What are you doing here anyway?

415
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:50,636
You should be waiting in that room. Inspector told you so, right?

416
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:52,436
Yeah.

417
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,636
What do you mean by that?

418
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,536
You shouldn't be listening to our conversation!

419
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:57,836
That's right.

420
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,536
Okay. Let's go, Ms. Sato!

421
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:01,736
Please, stay still.

422
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,636
Why did you have to break your arm just before our wedding?

423
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:06,837
Ms. Sato.

424
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:12,536
What is wrong with that couple?

425
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:13,637
Ms. Sato?
