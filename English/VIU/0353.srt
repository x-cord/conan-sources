1
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:04,191
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,291
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:08,091
A nice spot for the trolley and fishing.

4
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:09,991
Pierce through an unthinkable case and disclose the truth.

5
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:11,391
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:13,291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:15,292
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:57,780
Invited by Sonoko,

9
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:02,080
we all come to a bass fishing contest held at Lake Okutani.

10
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,980
There, we meet the candidates for championship.

11
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:05,980
Ms. Saori Ayukawa

12
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,480
and Mr. Takuya Masubuchi

13
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:12,580
as well as freelance writer, Mr. Toshihiko Funaki.

14
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:14,380
The competition for the first day ends.

15
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:16,980
It's a bit of a concern that

16
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:20,081
that night, Mr. Funaki and Mr. Masubuchi get into an argument,

17
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,080
and sure enough, the following day,

18
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,680
very near the place we were fishing,

19
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:29,581
Mr. Funaki is found dead from a strong impact to his head.

20
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:35,280
I wonder if that place is cursed.

21
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,780
Cursed?

22
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,280
Mr. Mizui, what do you mean?

23
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:43,480
The thing is somebody died there 6 months ago too.

24
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,380
Who is the person that died?

25
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,280
A person called Mr. Kanie,

26
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:50,780
who was also good friends with Ms. Ayukawa and Mr. Masubuchi.

27
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:53,680
A person died there a half a year ago.

28
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:55,780
This is no coincidence.

29
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:00,081
The murderer is probably one of the two!

30
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:09,881
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 2)"

31
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,880
Okay, let's start with you, Mr. Masubuchi.

32
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:18,980
Please tell me where you were between 10:00 to 10:30.

33
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:21,680
Between 10:00 to 10:30...

34
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,980
I was under the steel bridge at that time.

35
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,180
The steel bridge? On which side of the steel bridge?

36
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,580
On the side where the road is!

37
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:30,580
What, the side where the road is?

38
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,380
Yes, that's right!

39
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,480
The steel bridge is where Mr. Funaki was killed!

40
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:40,080
He was found in a grassy area about 100m upstream.

41
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:41,480
It seems so.

42
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:44,781
I was surprised at the great number of police there.

43
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:49,580
I think that he would've had to walk behind you

44
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:51,680
to get to that grassy area.

45
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:54,880
Didn't you notice Mr. Funaki walk behind you?

46
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,580
No, I didn't because I was absorbed in fishing.

47
00:03:58,581 --> 00:03:59,980
Is there anyone who can testify that

48
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:02,880
you didn't move from under the steel bridge?

49
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:03,981
No.

50
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,280
No alibi, eh?

51
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,380
Mr. Masubuchi was near there?

52
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:10,181
May I...

53
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,181
What is it?

54
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:13,180
May I go now?

55
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:17,981
Oh, yeah. I may ask you some questions again later.

56
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:23,081
Sonoko.

57
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,680
Nobody heard any scream.

58
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,781
The rock where he hit his head can't be found.

59
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,980
Conan, are you going to quit fishing already?

60
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,680
I don't feel up to it anymore.

61
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:39,080
But, if you guys want to, go ahead.

62
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:43,080
Yes. Yeah. Okay.

63
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,280
Inspector, we checked the alibis of everyone,

64
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:49,180
from those who brought their own boats to those who rented boats,

65
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,680
but nobody seems to have gone near the place the corpse was found!

66
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,480
So, the boat wasn't used.

67
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:57,980
Which means it's somebody that was alone

68
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:01,381
on the left shore of the lake.

69
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:05,781
Inspector,

70
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:08,480
I went to the inn that the victim stayed over at last night,

71
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:10,880
and I was bothered by something that one of the guests said.

72
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,680
Bothered?

73
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,980
Yes, he says that the victim and Masubuchi

74
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,080
were arguing in the bath room.

75
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,180
I see!

76
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,681
Okay!

77
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:30,780
Well, you seemed to have some sort of conflict with Mr. Funaki.

78
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,980
Hey, kids, it's not for you to listen!

79
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,280
We're fishing.

80
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,780
Yes, we figured if the candidate for champion Mr. Masubuchi

81
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:38,980
picked this place to fish,

82
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:41,580
we may be able to get a large catch here too.

83
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:44,680
Yeah, something as big as a whale.

84
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,280
If we fish something that large, we won't be able to take it home.

85
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,580
You guys...

86
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,080
If we get to fish something like that,

87
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,080
we'll be able to boast about it in school.

88
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:53,680
We can boast about it!

89
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:57,180
All talk, you kids, I tell you.

90
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:59,681
So, how about it, Mr. Masubuchi?

91
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:03,880
Silence could work against you,

92
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:08,580
because a lot of people have seen you and Mr. Funaki arguing.

93
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:09,980
Mr. Funaki...

94
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,580
Mr. Funaki?

95
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:14,280
Mr. Funaki said something ridiculous,

96
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:16,680
that's why I couldn't help shouting at him.

97
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:18,181
Something ridiculous?

98
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:20,181
Well...

99
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:21,680
What is it?

100
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,080
He insisted that I liked Ms. Ayukawa

101
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:29,680
and that he'd play go-between for us.

102
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,480
That's why I sort of blew my top!

103
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,780
Oh, is that all?

104
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:35,980
Yes, Mr. Funaki said that.

105
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:40,180
Ms. Ayukawa would never refuse any offer from him.

106
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:44,780
Ms. Ayukawa would never refuse any offer from Mr. Funaki?

107
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:45,980
Come to think of it, even last night,

108
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:48,881
she followed Mr. Funaki despite looking very unwilling.

109
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,880
A person also died here 6 months ago.

110
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:59,880
Conan, what are we going to do in a place like this?

111
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:02,980
The police already came here and searched,

112
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:05,580
so I'm sure we won't find anything here either.

113
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,480
Let's go back.

114
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:09,180
Mitsuhiko's right.

115
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:11,280
The murder weapon wasn't here.

116
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:14,481
Moreover, we didn't even hear Mr. Funaki scream.

117
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,681
Trolley train?

118
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:39,880
The smell of kerosene.

119
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:41,580
The stain on the vest.

120
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:42,780
I get it!

121
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:44,880
Genta! Mitsuhiko! Let's trace these tracks!

122
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,280
What?

123
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:49,580
Mr. Funaki wasn't killed here!

124
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:54,680
The place where Mr. Funaki was killed is somewhere along the tracks!

125
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:55,981
Let's go!

126
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:01,980
How far are we going to go? There's nothing.

127
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,780
We're going to reach Okutani Station soon.

128
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,580
I'm sure we'll find something.

129
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:08,781
I'm starving.

130
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,580
Isn't that Mr. Funaki's?

131
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:24,581
The actual murder site is here! But how?

132
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,381
Excuse me,

133
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:35,580
did anybody come on this bridge between 10:00 to 10:30?

134
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,780
No.

135
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,780
What about a camera man?

136
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:42,180
Yeah, at about 9:50, he came from the direction of the dam,

137
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:45,680
and went down the steps that you all just came up.

138
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,280
Did anyone cross this bridge after that?

139
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:50,980
Not one person until the police cars came

140
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,780
and this place got boisterous.

141
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:53,980
Oh.

142
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,080
Early in the morning,

143
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:58,480
Ms. Ayukawa came and went down the steps, though.

144
00:08:58,481 --> 00:08:59,980
Ms. Ayukawa did?

145
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:02,780
Yes, at about 7:30, I think it was.

146
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:05,381
She came back after about 10 minutes though.

147
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,380
So, Ms. Ayukawa did come after all.

148
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:15,981
But how?

149
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:22,080
Conan, I just remembered, we gotta return the boat.

150
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,880
Genta, you said that

151
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:26,980
you saw Ms. Ayukawa go up opposite Kutanisuji,

152
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:28,080
but which side of the lake was she on?

153
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,881
Let's see.

154
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:35,180
She was on the left when viewed from the lake,

155
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:37,480
so maybe this side?

156
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:39,780
After climbing back up from this side,

157
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,180
in order to throw a stone at Mr. Funaki

158
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,180
from right under the bridge that is opposite the bridge,

159
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:47,180
she would have to cross this bridge once.

160
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:50,881
But the guard says nobody crossed.

161
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:54,780
But, if he was killed here,

162
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,880
why was his body found where it was?

163
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,380
How was it carried there?

164
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,780
He fell into the lake and naturally drifted to the shore there,

165
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:07,280
where he came to and climbed up. He then passed away.

166
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:10,580
No, Mr. Funaki's body was not wet,

167
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,780
and he wasn't using a boat.

168
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:17,680
It's unnatural that his body was where it was after all.

169
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:19,980
But, I'm certain that he was killed here!

170
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,480
Conan.

171
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:23,080
We're going to be charge extension fee

172
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,680
if we don't return the boat.

173
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,780
What method was used?

174
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:31,581
-Conan, the boat. -Yeah, I know.

175
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,780
Are we going to ride it to the boat house?

176
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:36,281
-I guess so. -All right.

177
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:44,480
Genta, shall we throw this away?

178
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:45,481
What's that?

179
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,680
We picked it up.

180
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,780
Where?

181
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,080
Around the place where Kutanisuji merges with the main stream.

182
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,680
Oh! That handkerchief!

183
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,080
What's up?

184
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:59,181
-That handkerchief is Ms. Ayukawa's. -What?

185
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:02,280
I see.

186
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:04,081
I got it!

187
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,538
The winner for the contest

188
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:15,939
is Mr. Takuya Masubuchi with a total of 30500 grams!

189
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,838
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki will present

190
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,338
the championship trophy on behalf of the chairman.

191
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,638
Please give her a big hand everyone.

192
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,838
Any comments?

193
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,738
I was lucky to have been able to fish at a good spot.

194
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,438
I'll prepare for the next tournament and do my best again.

195
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,738
If you're the killer, I promise I'll find evidence to nail you.

196
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,438
The winner of 2nd place

197
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:43,039
is Ms. Saori Ayukawa with a total of 22680 grams.

198
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,738
Anything to say?

199
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,938
I was hoping for two consecutive wins

200
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:51,238
but unfortunately I've lost to Mr. Masubuchi.

201
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:56,138
I would like to take that big cup home with me next year.

202
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:00,239
Let's give the two winners a big hand once again!

203
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,838
We would like to conclude

204
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,638
the 17th Suzuki Cup Lake Okutani Tournament.

205
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,939
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all so very much.

206
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:18,038
She's doing the same thing as the Sleeping Kogoro!

207
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,138
-What? -Please wait, Ms. Ayukawa.

208
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,638
I still have something I'd like you to tell everyone.

209
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,539
I'd like you to tell us why you killed Mr. Funaki.

210
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,338
What? You mean Ms. Ayukawa...

211
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:36,438
I'd like to know why you did what you did at this tournament

212
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,038
where I'm serving on behalf of the chairman.

213
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,538
Come on, please tell us!

214
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,338
Just what do you think you're saying?

215
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,038
She was in Kutanisuji on the opposite side of the lake back then.

216
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,038
That's not the point.

217
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,438
Because Mr. Funaki was not killed where he was found.

218
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:57,538
What? That can't be!

219
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:00,338
Conan, please show her the stuff.

220
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:01,539
Okay!

221
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:07,038
We found this camera beside the rail tracks of Kutanisuji.

222
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,138
This is Mr. Funaki's camera.

223
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,838
He took pictures for us yesterday so I remember!

224
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,338
What?

225
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,438
The camera of the victim was found in Kutanisuji.

226
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,838
But, why was it in a place like that?

227
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,038
We found it under Kutani Bridge!

228
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,238
And these are the pictures that were printed from the film

229
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,238
that was in the camera!

230
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,039
-Hey! -Oh, yes, sir.

231
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,138
There's a picture of a trolley there, right?

232
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,338
The place that picture was taken from.

233
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:42,838
The place where the leg of Kutani Bridge touches the shore,

234
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,039
a very small flat area.

235
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,238
I asked a railroad buff and found that

236
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:53,639
the place is famous for getting the best shots of the trolley.

237
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,038
Ms. Ayukawa, I hear that you were invited by Mr. Funaki

238
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,938
to have a drink with him last night.

239
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:03,938
At that time, you gave him information of that place

240
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:07,138
where he could take pictures of the trolley

241
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,238
for a railroad buff magazine.

242
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:15,138
But Mr. Funaki was found 3km away, opposite the steel bridge.

243
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:19,138
I just said that's not the point.

244
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,838
Inspector Yokomizo,

245
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,938
didn't you notice the black stain that was on the vest

246
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:26,139
that Mr. Funaki was wearing?

247
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,938
Now that you mentioned it, the forensic officers reported so.

248
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,338
The substance seems to have been oil and soot.

249
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,338
Yes, it's the exhaust of the diesel steam engine

250
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,338
that pulls the trolley along.

251
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,238
Exhaust?

252
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:45,038
Mr. Funaki moved from under Kutani Bridge to the place he was found

253
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,939
on the roof of the trolley.

254
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,939
Carried on the roof?

255
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,238
You threw a rock at Mr. Funaki

256
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:58,238
who was waiting for a chance to take a picture of the trolley.

257
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:00,038
The rock hit him on the head

258
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,838
and he fell on top the roof of the trolley from the impact of being hit.

259
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,038
Then carried on the roof of the trolley,

260
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,838
he crosses the bridge, until the sharp curve

261
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,138
where he is flung off the roof

262
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,039
and his body thrown to the place where it was found.

263
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,638
Such a coincidence exists?

264
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,138
It's no coincidence.

265
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:21,938
There is a train that leaves Lake Okutani Station at 10:50.

266
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:24,838
Ms. Ayukawa calculated it so that.

267
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,139
Mr. Funaki would fall on the roof of that train and killed him.

268
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:32,138
Then, she knew ahead of time

269
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,838
that the body would drop where it did too?

270
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,138
It's most likely.

271
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,338
No way. No matter how much he was off his guard,

272
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,738
that Funaki would never let Saori kill him that easily.

273
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,538
If she dropped something,

274
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:46,838
be it a rock or something from on top the bridge,

275
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,938
the guard at the station at the foot of the bridge

276
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:51,138
would've seen it.

277
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,838
I confirmed with the security guard,

278
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,238
and he said that no one crossed the bridge between 10:00 to 10:30.

279
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,038
If so, Saori couldn't have committed the crime.

280
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,638
It would look to be so for everybody.

281
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,538
But, this is a carefully planned murder committed by Saori.

282
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,238
It can't be.

283
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,538
Because she told me that

284
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,738
she was in Kutanisuji, but opposite the tracks.

285
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:19,538
That's right, isn't it, Saori?

286
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,539
Yes.

287
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,538
But at around 7:30 in the morning,

288
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:25,038
the security guard told me that he saw.

289
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,638
Ms. Ayukawa go down the steps at the foot of that bridge.

290
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,238
Her going there at that time

291
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,238
has nothing to do with the murder, does it?

292
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,838
Conan.

293
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,239
Yes!

294
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,038
What's this? It's just a plain wooden board.

295
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,438
That is a board that Genta and Mitsuhiko

296
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:47,038
who were on the boat picked up.

297
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,238
They found it where Kutanisuji merges with the main stream.

298
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:53,738
Ms. Ayukawa used that board.

299
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:54,839
How?

300
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,038
Ms. Ayukawa who went there at 7:30

301
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,738
placed that board

302
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,238
right above the place that Mr. Funaki would be standing.

303
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:05,138
Half of it was suspended in air and balanced very precisely

304
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:07,338
so it wouldn't fall over.

305
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:10,039
She then placed a rock on the board.

306
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,438
At 10:07,

307
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,638
Ms. Ayukawa appears at the pedestal opposite the bridge

308
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,338
and threw a rock towards Mr. Funaki

309
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,839
who was taking pictures of the trolley.

310
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,438
That's just your imagination.

311
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,938
Do you have evidence to prove that it's a fact?

312
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:54,738
Mr. Masubuchi, didn't you think it strange that.

313
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,538
Ms. Ayukawa was going to Kutanisuji?

314
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,338
I hear that Kutanisuji is not a good fishing spot.

315
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:05,738
Why did Ms. Aukawa who was aiming for championship go there?

316
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,838
Besides, the handkerchief that is attached to the tip of that line

317
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,538
is Ms. Ayukawa's.

318
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,138
You can find handkerchiefs like that anywhere.

319
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:16,238
Please check that handkerchief.

320
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:19,138
You should get luminol reaction from it.

321
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,038
There are no blood stains on it!

322
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,638
Ms. Ayukawa, when Ayumi hurt herself yesterday,

323
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,038
you used that handkerchief, didn't you?

324
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,638
A slight amount of Ayumi's blood should've rubbed off

325
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:33,238
on the handkerchief back then.

326
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:36,738
Of course there is no blood stain anywhere on it now.

327
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:38,738
But, Ms. Ayukawa,

328
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,938
do you know that once a handkerchief is stained with blood,

329
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,838
no matter how clean you wash it,

330
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,638
there will be luminol reaction.

331
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:47,338
How long has it been

332
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:51,238
since you washed Ayumi's wound for her with it?

333
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:54,939
Ms. Ayukawa! Why did you kill Mr. Funaki?

334
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,038
He's been blackmailing me since 6 months ago.

335
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,838
Saori.

336
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,938
6 months ago, a man called Mr. Kanie

337
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:12,238
was found dead in the same place that Mr. Funaki was found.

338
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,338
Mr. Funaki was probably blackmailing you

339
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:17,438
because of something to do with that incident, wasn't he?

340
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:20,338
I had no intention of killing Mr. Kanie.

341
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:24,038
Which means you killed that guy called Kanie?

342
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,938
We were walking along Kutanisuji.

343
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:31,738
I have no intention of getting married for a while yet.

344
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:34,439
So, you like Masubuchi after all, don't you?

345
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:39,339
How about it? Please tell me straight!

346
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,339
Saori.

347
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,038
Mr. Funaki saw what happened.

348
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,639
And he blackmailed you.

349
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,539
Is that it?

350
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,738
I'll keep it quiet to the police, but for doing that...

351
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:05,338
I'm in a pinch right now,

352
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,139
could you lend me about 200 thousand yen?

353
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:16,938
This new model camera cost me close to 1 million yen so...

354
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,639
You know what I mean.

355
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:27,138
I paid him three times up to now, a total of 7 million yen.

356
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,538
Then about a half month ago.

357
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,738
I hear you signed a contract as a Pacific Sports Advisor!

358
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:37,138
How much was the contract fee?

359
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:39,238
It's none of your business.

360
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,738
Oh, well. Please give me 10 million yen.

361
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:47,439
You know what will happen if you refuse, don't you?

362
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,738
Since he told me then, that he wanted to take a picture of the trolley,

363
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,038
I figured if I showed him where it is,

364
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,738
so he would surely take pictures under that bridge.

365
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,438
As long as the timing is right,

366
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,638
the corpse would fall on the roof of the trolley

367
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:04,938
and carried to the same place where Mr. Kanie's body was found.

368
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:07,038
That's what you thought, is that right?

369
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,938
I figured if things went on as is,

370
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,638
I would be blackmailed all my life by that guy.

371
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,639
Then everything ahead of me went black.

372
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,938
I'm really sorry that I spoiled your important tournament.

373
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:20,038
More than for me,

374
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,939
I think this contest was more important for you, right?

375
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:33,339
I'm sorry, Father.

376
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:39,338
Ms. Ayukawa, I'd like to hear about everything in more detail

377
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,638
so please come with us to the station.

378
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:42,839
Yes, sir.

379
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:46,639
Saori.

380
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,838
I'll wait for you no matter how long it takes.

381
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,139
Saori.

382
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,238
Didn't you think it was fantastic?

383
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,938
Sonoko's deduction.

384
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,538
You can say that again!

385
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,338
Really, when did you check all those things out?

386
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,638
Well, you see. I've got my ways.

387
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:35,938
It's a cinch for me.

388
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:38,838
I wonder if I did something so fantastic.

389
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,838
What do you mean you got your ways?

390
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,938
By the way, how'd you guys do?

391
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,538
Did you at least catch one fish?

392
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,038
Well, you see...

393
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,938
Catching big fish is more difficult then solving a case!

394
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:57,039
Next time I come, I swear I'll catch a big one.

395
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:01,274
Aren't you Kazuki Kinukawa the popular child actor

396
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,074
who acts in dramas and movies?

397
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,174
Wow, you look cuter in person!

398
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:08,474
What's with this brat?

399
00:24:08,475 --> 00:24:10,774
It could be that Kazuki's mother

400
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:13,774
is working here under a different name.

401
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:15,674
This is?

402
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:18,275
A mole on the woman's breast?

403
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,774
Next Conan,

404
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:28,875
"The Little Client (Part 1)"
