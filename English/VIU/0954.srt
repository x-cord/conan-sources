1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:04,872
We went to meet Pops client

2
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:08,772
at a bunny girl club called the Black Rabbit Restaurant.

3
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:10,173
But once we're there...

4
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:16,073
"Yuri Asakura (25), Employee."

5
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:23,573
-What? -What?

6
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:33,772
You found arsenic in Ms. Yuri's drink?

7
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:36,672
-Yeah. -It was me.

8
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:40,472
"Gunzo Morooka (50), Rich Man" -Someone was trying to poison me

9
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:44,072
but Yuri drank it instead.

10
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:47,372
You're saying Mr. Morooka was worried about something?

11
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:52,072
Yes. That's what his bodyguards in the parking lot told me.

12
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:55,472
"Atsufumi Fukamachi, Sana Murakami" -Lately he has been acting strange.

13
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:58,372
He'd suddenly lose and gain weight,

14
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:00,573
and was frequently tripping and injuring himself.

15
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:04,073
-But, Mouri... -An injury?

16
00:01:05,573 --> 00:01:08,572
"Miyano Clinic."

17
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:10,373
Well, I'm leaving now.

18
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:14,073
Can I come back if I get hurt again?

19
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:18,772
No. We don't treat boys who fight.

20
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:19,872
What?

21
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:23,672
But if it's an honorable injury suffered

22
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:25,572
while making up with the friend you fought with,

23
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:27,873
then I'll at least put a bandage on you.

24
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,373
I see.

25
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:36,973
So that's how it is.

26
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:46,672
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

27
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,572
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

28
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:50,472
Amuro's memory and a poisoned glass.

29
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:52,472
The trick is one both telling and surprising.

30
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:53,872
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:55,672
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:57,873
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:45,198
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 3)"

34
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:01,827
Excuse me, Officer Takagi.

35
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:02,828
Yes?

36
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:05,327
I found a fake nail.

37
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,527
I thought it might be Ms. Yuri's.

38
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:11,727
It has lilies on it.

39
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,327
Oh, yeah.

40
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,827
That's one of Yuri's fake nails.

41
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:17,627
Where did you find it?

42
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:22,227
The thing is I seem to have stepped on it somewhere.

43
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,427
It was stuck to the bottom of my boot.

44
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:27,627
That's why it's so damaged. Sorry.

45
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:30,827
It must've come off when Ms. Yuri collapsed.

46
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,227
It couldn't be helped.

47
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,027
Hey, miss.

48
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:37,227
Does Ms. Yuri always wear those fake nails?

49
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:38,827
Yeah, she does.

50
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:42,227
I suggested she wear some different ones sometimes

51
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:45,927
but she insisted it was her trademark.

52
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:47,927
Really?

53
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:50,227
Today has been an awful day.

54
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:51,727
Awful how?

55
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:54,727
I unfortunately stepped on Ms. Yuri's fake nail

56
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,227
and I dropped my wallet at some point.

57
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,627
Your wallet?

58
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:02,127
Yeah but apparently Amuro found it

59
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:05,027
in front of the bathroom.

60
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:06,927
Amuro did?

61
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:08,727
What about me?

62
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:10,927
Nothing.

63
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:13,727
Well, you couldn't help stepping on a fake nail

64
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,927
that fell on the floor.

65
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,327
It's not like we're walking around

66
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:21,728
with magnifying glasses like Sherlock Holmes-style.

67
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:24,827
That's it.

68
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,728
They could've used that.

69
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:32,628
That's why the culprit was able to poison Ms. Yuri's glass.

70
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:37,428
They used her fake nails as a target.

71
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:42,227
How many times do I have to tell you, Inspector?

72
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:44,827
It's true that I passed by Yuri

73
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,127
while she was holding her glass...

74
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:50,328
Excuse me, coming through.

75
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,827
But it was only for a moment,

76
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:57,327
I couldn't have poisoned her glass.

77
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:00,327
I couldn't have poisoned it either.

78
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,327
I just bumped into her

79
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,428
and spilled wine on her.

80
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:08,427
Oh, I'm sorry.

81
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:11,227
I didn't have time to poison her glass.

82
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:15,427
I wasn't wearing my glasses

83
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:17,928
when she set her glass on the table.

84
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:21,927
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:23,927
It suddenly starting ringing

86
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:26,727
while I was checking my messages.

87
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:29,027
Even if I wanted to poison her glass,

88
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:33,627
I didn't know which one was hers.

89
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:36,627
So why don't you let us go

90
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:40,127
so we can visit her in the hospital?

91
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:41,727
I'm worried about her.

92
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:45,827
I understand your concern but you're just a customer.

93
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,827
Why are you so worried?

94
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:50,327
Because...

95
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:53,427
I'm a regular of hers.

96
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,727
That's what you say

97
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:58,627
but maybe she was actually pushing for marriage

98
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:06,427
and you want to watch the girl you poisoned out of desperation die?

99
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,027
I...

100
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,927
Maybe he wants to go to finish her off.

101
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,327
Are you talking about yourself?

102
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:19,027
If she dies, you'll become the restaurant's top earner.

103
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:22,427
Then the restaurant will pay you a big bonus, right?

104
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:23,927
So, what?

105
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:28,127
Are you saying I poisoned Yuri for that?

106
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,227
I heard from Yuri.

107
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:32,727
I heard you're struggling

108
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:36,327
to pay for your seriously ill father's surgery!

109
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,827
Didn't I tell you?

110
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:39,627
Don't worry about the money.

111
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:43,327
Just focus on getting better.

112
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:46,427
I'll do something about the money for the surgery.

113
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:49,627
What? At least I'm not an old man who was trying to pay her

114
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:51,327
to stop contacting him!

115
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:54,127
Pay her? What are you talking about?

116
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:56,327
Don't play dumb.

117
00:07:56,328 --> 00:08:00,827
Some of the girls saw your butler over there

118
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,727
trying to pay off Yuri.

119
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:07,428
Sounds like she turned him down, though.

120
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:10,427
What's she talking about, Fukamachi?

121
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:13,027
I, uh...

122
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:14,927
In any case...

123
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,827
The three of you will remain here

124
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:20,827
for questioning for a while.

125
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:24,627
After all, you're the only ones

126
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:27,127
who could have poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass.

127
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:30,527
But, Inspector Megure.

128
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:33,427
I don't think the rich man did it.

129
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:36,427
Rich man? You mean Mr. Morooka?

130
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:37,428
Yeah.

131
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,527
Why do you think that?

132
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:40,727
He passed by Ms. Yuri

133
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:47,427
while heading to his car parked outside the restaurant

134
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,727
to get his butler's glasses, right?

135
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:50,827
Yeah.

136
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:56,027
When we talked to the bodyguards by his car earlier,

137
00:08:56,028 --> 00:09:01,127
they said the rich man just came with Pops to get the glasses.

138
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:04,627
They didn't notice anything strange at all.

139
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,127
Anything strange?

140
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,227
If I poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass,

141
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,027
I would definitely be checking the time

142
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,127
or glancing at the restaurant,

143
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:18,327
thinking she must've drunk the poison by now

144
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:22,328
and there must be a huge commotion inside the restaurant.

145
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,027
You're right.

146
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:29,827
The same thing goes for that bunny girl.

147
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:32,427
Even if she poisoned Ms. Yuri

148
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:34,527
when she spilled wine on her,

149
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:38,727
when Ms. Yuri covered her glass with a coaster

150
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,927
and went to the changing room

151
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:43,027
to change her stained cuffs,

152
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:48,228
she wandered off somewhere to answer a call from a customer.

153
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,127
Hello, Mr. Adachi?

154
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,127
Hello again.

155
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,027
I'm sorry but we're full right now.

156
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:01,427
A table should open up in about an hour.

157
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:05,627
If it were me, I wouldn't leave no matter what.

158
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:10,127
After all, someone else might accidentally drink

159
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,327
from the poisoned glass.

160
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,227
I see.

161
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:15,327
Right?

162
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,627
Don't you agree?

163
00:10:17,628 --> 00:10:20,127
Uh, yeah.

164
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:21,327
Which leaves...

165
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:26,628
the man sitting by Ms. Yuri's glass the whole time.

166
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,227
It could only have been you,

167
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:37,128
Mr. Atsufumi Fukamachi the butler.

168
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:51,054
Weren't you listening to what Fukamachi said?

169
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:53,754
He wasn't wearing his glasses

170
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,754
when she set her glass on the table.

171
00:10:56,755 --> 00:11:02,354
How was he able to identify her glass and poison it?

172
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:05,354
Mr. Fukamachi had something on him

173
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:07,154
that could substitute for glasses.

174
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:10,754
What? Substitute for glasses?

175
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:12,154
Is that true?

176
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,754
No.

177
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:17,754
I was just checking my messages on my phone then.

178
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:18,854
Hear that?

179
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:22,754
He says the only thing he had was his phone.

180
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:24,754
Yes, so...

181
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:25,854
Wow!

182
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,754
Phones are amazing!

183
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:32,454
Hold on. Conan, they're in the middle of an important conversation.

184
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:38,054
Yeah but if I use the camera on the phone and zoom in

185
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:41,154
I can clearly see you all the way down to your fingertips.

186
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,454
It's like a magnifying glass.

187
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:44,555
What?

188
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:51,854
He's right. If you use a phone like this...

189
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:54,554
You might be able to see without glasses.

190
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:55,654
Come to think of it,

191
00:11:55,655 --> 00:12:00,154
Ms. Yuri always wore fake nails with lilies.

192
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:05,155
You could use those to identify her glass.

193
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:10,854
But Fukamachi wasn't wearing his glasses

194
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,354
because I happened to step on them and break them.

195
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:17,754
That wasn't a coincidence. He planned it.

196
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:18,854
What?

197
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:23,054
If he knew you put sauce on your rolled omelets,

198
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,754
he could've placed the sauce far enough away from you

199
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:29,654
that you'd have to take a step to reach it.

200
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:32,255
By dropping his glasses by your feet...

201
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:36,054
he could make it look like

202
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,054
they were coincidentally stepped on.

203
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:41,554
He had you step on his glasses

204
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:44,254
in order to use that trick,

205
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:48,354
but probably also to distance you from the crime scene

206
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:51,855
so suspicion wouldn't fall on you.

207
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:54,954
However, it didn't pay off.

208
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:57,654
You passed by Ms. Yuri while she was holding her glass

209
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:00,654
when you went to get the glasses

210
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,854
and suspicion fell on you anyway.

211
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:06,154
Is that true, Fukamachi?

212
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:09,454
And after you left the restaurant,

213
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,455
he deliberately triggered his phone's alarm.

214
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,654
He made Ms. Yuri set her glass on the table

215
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,355
to check for an earthquake report.

216
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,454
Then he used his phone's camera's zoom function

217
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:25,454
to identify her glass,

218
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:28,155
and poisoned it.

219
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:35,754
It's likely he used two separate phones to sound the alarm

220
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:38,654
and use the camera's zoom function.

221
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,854
So if you search Mr. Fukamachi,

222
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:46,154
you'll probably find two phones on him.

223
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:49,354
I'm sorry, Mr. Fukamachi,

224
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:50,754
but we'll need to search...

225
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:53,554
There's no need.

226
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:56,254
I do have two.

227
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,054
I bought a second one

228
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:00,954
and practiced countless times

229
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,754
for your late wife.

230
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:08,054
You poisoned Yuri for my wife?

231
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:13,054
Yes, so you'd finally open your eyes.

232
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:15,255
Open my eyes?

233
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,154
If more time had passed since she passed away,

234
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:22,654
I wouldn't say anything.

235
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,754
But it hasn't even been six months,

236
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:30,954
and you're already infatuated with that young girl.

237
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:36,254
I served your wife since she was a child.

238
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:39,154
I felt so sorry for her.

239
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:46,554
I selfishly offered her money to stay away from you

240
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:47,854
but she refused.

241
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,455
With no other choice, I sent that threatening letter.

242
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:55,354
But it had absolutely no effect,

243
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:58,654
so I decided to use force.

244
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:02,354
I thought if the girl you were chasing were harmed,

245
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:07,655
you would stop visiting the club.

246
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,554
Sir.

247
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:14,254
This is my final request to you.

248
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:18,554
Please don't make your wife sad anymore.

249
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:21,954
Fukamachi, you've got it all wrong.

250
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,654
That girl...

251
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:27,254
Yuri isn't just some girl I'm chasing.

252
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:29,854
She's your daughter.

253
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:30,954
Right?

254
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:32,955
-His daughter? -His daughter?

255
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,854
Don't be ridiculous!

256
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:38,855
Don't tell me

257
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:44,154
it's because they both put sauce on their rolled omelets.

258
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,254
No.

259
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:47,454
That's just their taste.

260
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,054
It's unusual but coincidences do happen.

261
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:55,554
But the unique way they hold their chopsticks.

262
00:15:55,555 --> 00:16:00,254
It can't be a coincidence that they both hold

263
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,255
their pointer finger away from their chopsticks.

264
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:10,054
When you were young and eloped,

265
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:12,854
the daughter you had while living in Tottori for four years

266
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:14,554
was Ms. Yuri.

267
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:17,254
If she learned to hold her chopsticks

268
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:20,254
by copying you as a child,

269
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:23,354
then it all makes sense.

270
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:27,354
You lost and gained weight

271
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:30,854
so you'd have to get your suits tailored.

272
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,654
You began tripping frequently

273
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:36,255
so you'd tear your suits and have to buy new ones.

274
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,954
It was all to create a reason

275
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,754
to go to the clothing store next door

276
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:44,854
so you could come here

277
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:48,354
and see your daughter, wasn't it?

278
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,854
Yeah.

279
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:52,354
I didn't have to see how she held her chopsticks to know instantly

280
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,654
that she was my daughter.

281
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:58,554
She looked just like her mother I eloped with.

282
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:02,654
And I'm the one who named her Yuri.

283
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,954
I see.

284
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,954
So that's why...

285
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:08,754
Are you okay, Yuri?

286
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:10,854
Yuri!

287
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:13,454
He called her informally.

288
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:18,054
Sir, you could've told me.

289
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:20,254
I couldn't tell you

290
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:24,354
I wanted to see the daughter I had when I eloped.

291
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:27,854
Not to you, who was so devoted to my wife.

292
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:29,954
But...

293
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:35,354
Besides, my wife and I never had children,

294
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,955
which made it all the more difficult.

295
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:42,854
Although I may not have known,

296
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:47,054
but she was your daughter...

297
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:50,955
What have I done?

298
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,954
I see.

299
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:56,954
Thank you for calling.

300
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,554
Goodbye.

301
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,654
What was that?

302
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:02,654
The hospital called just now.

303
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:04,754
Ms. Yuri has regained consciousness

304
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:09,054
and her condition is improving steadily.

305
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,655
That's great!

306
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:14,754
I'm glad.

307
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:16,754
I'm so glad.

308
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:17,955
Fukamachi.

309
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:20,854
In a little while,

310
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:24,054
let's go see Yuri together and apologize.

311
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:25,554
No, sir.

312
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:29,754
I couldn't face her.

313
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:31,054
It's all right.

314
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:34,254
She'll forgive you if you explain why.

315
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:36,654
After all, she's my daughter.

316
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:38,255
Sir...

317
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:41,455
Thank you.

318
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,754
Anyway, I'm surprised you knew

319
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:51,754
I was losing and gaining weight to see my daughter.

320
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,454
I suppose.

321
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:56,354
I understand.

322
00:18:56,355 --> 00:19:00,255
When I was a kid, there was a doctor I wanted to see.

323
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,954
I'd get injured on purpose

324
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:14,754
so I could go to her clinic.

325
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,554
Excuse me, Amuro.

326
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,054
-Yes? -Thank you.

327
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:21,254
I heard you found my wallet.

328
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:24,354
Oh, that was yours?

329
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:25,355
Yes.

330
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:28,054
Was everything still inside?

331
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,354
Yes.

332
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:33,054
My cash, my house keys and everything else was still inside.

333
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,654
I see.

334
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:36,455
That's good to hear.

335
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:04,655
You let your guard down, Shuichi Akai.

336
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:09,855
I could say the same thing to you.

337
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:13,055
Bourbon.

338
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:15,954
Don't be ridiculous.

339
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:18,954
You lost the moment I saw through your disguise

340
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,754
as Subaru Okiya.

341
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:26,655
What if I knew you'd try to sneak in here today?

342
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,654
That you'd make a spare key

343
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:35,455
and receive orders to investigate Shinichi Kudo?

344
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:47,854
Looks like I'll have to pull the trigger

345
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:50,455
to keep your mouth shut.

346
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,654
You...

347
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:13,854
Hello. I'm Yusaku Kudo, owner of the house.

348
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:15,755
I'm Yukiko.

349
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:21,554
Unlike last time,

350
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:25,455
you don't seem to have brought anyone with you.

351
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:31,954
Why don't you enjoy a cup of tea prepared by my wife?

352
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:34,955
Would you like lemon or milk?

353
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,654
"Next Episode."

354
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:48,854
What are you trying to catch with that giant net?

355
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,254
Well...

356
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:52,154
"Welcome to the Village Operated Insect Man Ranch!"

357
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:54,954
Insect man ranch?

358
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:56,254
Welcome!

359
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:57,654
Seriously?

360
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:59,155
"Kabutoya Restaurant."

361
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:04,155
-An insect man? -An insect man?

362
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:13,355
