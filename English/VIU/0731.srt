1
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,378
I'm sorry for being late.

2
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,778
You're late.

3
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:17,878
For you.

4
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:20,578
What's this?

5
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,078
Hey.

6
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:30,478
Don't open it until I get a hold of all seven of them.

7
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:32,778
I'm asking you, what is it?

8
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:35,278
When I get a hold of all of them, I'll contact you.

9
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:37,378
I promise.

10
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:38,378
Yumi.

11
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:40,378
Yumi.

12
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:43,478
Yumi.

13
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:45,678
Assistant Inspector, Yumi Miyamoto!

14
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:51,778
I wish you wouldn't snooze on duty!

15
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:08,778
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

16
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:10,478
are slashed by the light of deduction.

17
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:12,478
Assistant Inspector Yumi Miyamoto's secret?

18
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:14,678
A new character, who makes sharp deductions appear!

19
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:16,278
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:18,078
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,678
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,680
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 1)"

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,980
Yumi. Did something happen last night?

24
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,080
Sorry.

25
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,980
Last night I played overnight mahjong

26
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,380
with the officers at Marubo.

27
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,080
Overnight mahjong isn't good,

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
for work or for your skin!

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,180
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

30
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,980
By the way, what did you mean by getting hold of all seven?

31
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,880
Did I say something like that?

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,680
Yes, you were talking in your sleep,

33
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,380
"Just when are you going to get a hold of all that?" like so.

34
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,580
It's something that my ex used to say.

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,980
When I told him that I wanted to break up

36
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,680
because I'm going to become a police officer,

37
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,480
he pushed a strange envelope at me

38
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,980
and said, "Wait, until I get a hold of all seven."

39
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,980
But, no matter how long I waited,

40
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,380
he never got in contact with me again,

41
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,680
so I brushed him off!

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,880
I told him off saying that I'm not waiting anymore,

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,280
I don't want to see his face,

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,180
or hear his voice ever again!

45
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,580
Where did you get to know him?

46
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,480
On the train when I was a university student.

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,680
He was living in a good district

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,380
so I guess he was some rich dude or something?

49
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,880
But, I wonder what he meant by the "seven" whatever's?

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Beats me.

51
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,280
I'll bet it's just some nonsensical.

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
Wasn't he a sailor or something?

53
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,680
North Atlantic, South Atlantic,

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,580
North Pacific, South Pacific,

55
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,580
the Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Antarctic Ocean.

56
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,480
Maybe he wanted you to wait for him

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,880
until he completed crossing all 7 seas!

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,980
Conan?

59
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,080
Was he tanned?

60
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,380
No, he was pale and looked like an introverted freeloader to me.

61
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,880
He seemed to go out a lot, but it was on an irregular basis

62
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,880
and it didn't look as if he was working.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Maybe he was going around praying to the "Seven Deities of Good Fortune"?

64
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,180
Is that when you go around to shrines and temples

65
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,080
on New Year's day collecting the dolls of the 7 gods?

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,880
My mother does that every year!

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,180
Those are easy to get a hold of, no?

68
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,980
One other thing thinkable is

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,080
"The seven deadly sins".

70
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,580
Pride, envy, wrath, sloth,

71
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,480
greed, gluttony, and lust.

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,380
What good is there in collecting stuff like that?

73
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,880
Maybe the "Seven Deities of Good Fortune" is highly likely.

74
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,380
It was Christmas when he said that too.

75
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,880
I mean, why do I have to tell you guys something like this?

76
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,980
Geez.

77
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,080
And, what did you do with that envelope?

78
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,280
I don't know!

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,080
You're the one who bumped into me, no?

80
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,580
What? Hey!

81
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,680
What's your trip?

82
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,980
Reverse a bit, will you?

83
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,780
Will you park on the shoulder?

84
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,980
Yes, ma'am!

85
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,480
Hey, just what do you two think you're doing?

86
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,280
Yumi had a boyfriend?

87
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,780
I don't feel like we've met for the first time.

88
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,980
Maybe you're...

89
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,180
Yes.

90
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,880
The one who gave me a parking ticket at Haidocho the other day.

91
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,580
Chiba is completely forgotten me.

92
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,780
You shouldn't cross the street!

93
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,480
Once you break the rule and let yourself go,

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,380
it turns into a habit, you know!

95
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,380
A habit is hard to get rid of, once it becomes a habit!

96
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,180
Don't tell me you don't know something basic like that?

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,480
It's from Sakurako.

98
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,380
What? I'm on duty now.

99
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,680
What? Somebody is dead?

100
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,680
But, that's not in my line of work.

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,480
Is it nearby?

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Yes.

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,580
Hey, wait a second.

104
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,680
No matter what you do, don't touch anything.

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
I'll be right over.

106
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,880
What's with those children? They went charging off.

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,180
I just got a call from a friend of mine saying

108
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,980
that someone's been killed.

109
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
Where?

110
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,080
At Chateau Beika Mansion near here.

111
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,380
Chateau Beika Mansion?

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,580
Just as I thought it was here after all.

113
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,580
Have you been here before?

114
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,880
No!

115
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,280
Never to a mansion like this where only rich people seem to be living.

116
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,580
Ms. Miyamoto.

117
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,380
Long time no see.

118
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,880
Hello.

119
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,380
You've been here before, after all.

120
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,480
Shut up!

121
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,980
And what floor did you say it was?

122
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,080
The 18th floor.

123
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,280
No joke. No joke.

124
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,880
"Itami"

125
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,280
Next door?

126
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,980
Police ladies of the mini police car, you're here too.

127
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,580
Aren't you both in the traffic control division, Yumi?

128
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,880
I thought that cases like this were not handled by you.

129
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,580
You can leave it to us!

130
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,880
You're not supposed to handle this either!

131
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,480
I just came to take you people back.

132
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,680
Conan's not around.

133
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
He's inside!

134
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,880
He told us to wait here.

135
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,180
No joke! He's inside?

136
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,280
What's this, what's with you, sonny?

137
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Is he someone you know, Sakurako?

138
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,480
Yes.

139
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,680
If I remember correctly, his name is...

140
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,480
Conan Edogawa!

141
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,680
I met you before at a crime scene, didn't I?

142
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,780
Ms. Sakurako Yonehara.

143
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,380
Yes. During the optical illusion case.

144
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,080
Sonny, your way of talking has changed from a while ago?

145
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Because when you were with everybody,

146
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,380
you were talking like any child would.

147
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,880
But now, you sound just like a detective.

148
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,680
Oh, well, you see...

149
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,080
"Sakurako Yonehara (23)" -I've started working here

150
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,480
"Housemaid" -as a maid from last week,

151
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
and I'm messed up in something like this again.

152
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,780
Sakurako.

153
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,980
Naeko!

154
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,080
I'm sorry!

155
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,380
I panicked and impulsively called you, Naeko.

156
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,480
Everything will be okay.

157
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,080
I already contacted the officers.

158
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
Well...

159
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,280
no matter how you look at it, it doesn't look to be a murder case.

160
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,080
But, would you please tell me about it?

161
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,780
The fact is, about an hour ago,

163
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,980
I had it out with my wife, Chiyoko.

164
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,580
I decided to go out with Sakurako here

165
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,980
to give my wife some time to get cooled off,

166
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,380
"Naganobu Itami (52)" -isn't that right?

167
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,380
"Resident of the mansion" -Yes.

168
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,380
I didn't finish buying ingredients for dinner tonight yet

169
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,780
so I went to a supermarket nearby with Mr. Itami.

170
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,680
My wife sprained her wrist

171
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,080
and ended up not being able to do housework,

172
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,880
so I had no choice but to hire a maid.

173
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,780
Since I didn't want her to get hysterical again

174
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,280
and aggravate her wound even more.

175
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,180
Besides, my eye turned out this way too so...

176
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,080
What happened to your eye?

177
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
When my wife gets angry she has a habit of throwing things.

178
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,480
And because of this, I asked for a day off today.

179
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,880
And when you came back,

180
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,080
you found that your wife had committed suicide?

181
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,780
No, I finished shopping in about 30 minutes

182
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,580
and came back with Mr. Itami.

183
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,380
When I opened the front door,

184
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,380
I heard the sound of this bedroom door slam shut.

185
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,680
So, I think she was still alive then.

186
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,780
I did knock on the door and called out to her.

187
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,280
But since there was no answer,

188
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,880
I thought she was still angry.

189
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
That's why I had Sakurako make me coffee

190
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,780
and after we talked about trivial things for about 30 minutes,

191
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,580
I knocked on the door again

192
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,180
and went inside...

193
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,480
this is what I saw.

194
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,780
I had no idea that my wife was so deadlocked over a brawl like that.

195
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,180
I see.

196
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,580
And?

197
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,480
What about this memo at your wife's feet?

198
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
It's a will written by her about how worried she is

199
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,880
about my wound, our son's exam

200
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,580
and about our niece's Shichigosan celebration.

201
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,380
She put so much thought into writing these.

202
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,380
She apologized for crossing over leaving us all behind.

203
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,680
This is undoubtedly a suicide.

204
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,380
No.

205
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,280
It could be homicide, you know?

206
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,880
That will was written on the memo pad that was on the desk,

207
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,280
torn off and placed here, right?

208
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
But, look. If you take a good look,

209
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,080
only the part by the two lower holes of the paper are left

210
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,480
on the metal binding.

211
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
But as to the will, three holes are torn off.

212
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Don't you think that's strange?

213
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,780
No joke?

214
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,280
True.

215
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,480
Besides,

216
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,380
the words on that will are pretty distorted.

217
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,480
See! It seems that your wife used to leave memos behind on the pad,

218
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,880
but she always wrote only her name at the end.

219
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,380
But in that will only, she wrote her full name.

220
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,680
It looks strange to me, you know?

221
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,380
True.

222
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,680
Was the door to the entrance locked?

223
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Yes. I opened it, but it was definitely locked.

224
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,880
Then, who has the spare key?

225
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,780
Just my wife, Sakurako, my son, Yasuie and I.

226
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,680
Where is your son now?

227
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,280
I think he's at driving school.

228
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,380
He mentioned that his driving test was coming up soon.

229
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,880
And I heard that there's another spare

230
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,180
in the mailbox on the first floor too.

231
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,780
That mailbox is locked, I presume?

232
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
Yes.

233
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,080
It's the dial type and not easy for outsiders to open.

234
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,580
7 to the left, 2 to the right,

235
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,780
and 3 to the left.

236
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,080
There's one other person who knows the numbers to the dial.

237
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
What?

238
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,180
When I was taking out mails from that mailbox yesterday,

239
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,380
I was in a fix

240
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,980
because I forgot the memo with the numbers to the dial written on it,

241
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,380
but a man told me what the numbers were!

242
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,480
Why do you know the number?

243
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,980
Didn't you drop a memo with the numbers of the dial on it,

244
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,880
the other day when you tried to open the mailbox?

245
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,080
I was the one who picked that memo up,

246
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,680
but doesn't it ring a bell?

247
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,580
But I don't think you had even a second to look at it.

248
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,380
That much time is more than enough for me.

249
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,780
I'm good at remembering things like this.

250
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm number one in Japan.

251
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,580
No, maybe I'm the best in the world.

252
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,380
Is he a resident of this condo?

253
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,580
Yes. He lives next door.

254
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,180
He's an unshaven, shabby guy.

255
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,380
If I remember correctly, his name is...

256
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,780
If he lives next door, it's faster if we just go there!

257
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,580
-Yes. -Oh, hey.

258
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,180
Hey, wait.

259
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,680
Yes, what is it?

260
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,980
Yumi, my baby!

261
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,080
Yumi, my baby?

262
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,080
-Do you know him? -Yes.

263
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,580
He's my "ex".

264
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:22,407
Then, let me get this straight.

265
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,307
In order to give your wife some time to cool down

266
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:26,407
after you had it out with her,

267
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,907
you left to go to the supermarket together

268
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:31,207
with the maid for 30 minutes.

269
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:34,407
After you returned home and opened the door

270
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,907
you heard the door of this bedroom close

271
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:40,807
and called out to her but since there was no answer

272
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:43,707
you decided to wait another 30 minutes.

273
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,907
Therefore, you killed time together with the maid in the kitchen,

274
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,607
chatting and having coffee.

275
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,007
Then, you went to knock on the door again,

276
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,507
and went inside this time.

277
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:54,407
That's when you found that your wife had hung herself

278
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,207
with an electric cord.

279
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:57,407
Yes.

280
00:14:57,407 --> 00:15:00,007
By the way, what did you fight over?

281
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:04,307
-Stocks. -Stocks... did you say?

282
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:07,407
My wife was hooked on stocks recently,

283
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,007
and when I cautioned her about it she got hysterical.

284
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,807
I see.

285
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:15,407
Well, my son who'll be graduating university soon

286
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,307
hasn't found a job yet.

287
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:20,707
I think she'd been feeling a lot of stress too.

288
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:22,607
You have a son?

289
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:23,807
Yes.

290
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:27,407
Ever since he began living on his own near the university,

291
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:29,707
he doesn't come around much though.

292
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:33,207
But, he called the other day.

293
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:34,507
Saying that he wanted Mr. Itami to buy him a car

294
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:36,607
after he gets his driver's license,

295
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:40,107
and that he'll be bringing over the car catalogs.

296
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,207
Catalogs?

297
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,307
But, Mrs. Itami was against it saying that he's not even employed yet

298
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:46,207
so there's no need for a car.

299
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:48,907
She shouted at him and hung up.

300
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,007
You're the one that was at the scene

301
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:53,107
during the optical illusion case.

302
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:57,607
Yes, sir. I ended up like this again. This is my work place.

303
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:58,707
Please at all costs don't be a person

304
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,007
who summons death like Mr. Mouri does.

305
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:03,607
Inspector.

306
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,507
But, why was this incident reported by Ms. Miike

307
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:10,107
of the traffic control division?

308
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:11,107
That's because...

309
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,607
Sakurako saw the corpse

310
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:17,807
and Ms. Naeko Miike, a police woman who is also her friend.

311
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:21,207
Well, I came here because I happened to hear about it too!

312
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:22,807
Conan?

313
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,607
No wonder all the children were at the entrance.

314
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:31,607
But, Conan, how did you get inside this condo?

315
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:35,107
We came in together with a person who had a child with her,

316
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:38,207
making believe that we were that child's friends.

317
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:41,707
-That's not too cool. -Geez.

318
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:45,707
Naeko, are you classmates with Sakurako?

319
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:50,107
No, she's a childhood friend who lived near me!

320
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:54,007
I'm a year older than Sakurako.

321
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,207
Well, at any rate,

322
00:16:57,207 --> 00:17:01,707
the only people here were you, your wife and the maid?

323
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:05,707
Yes. I haven't seen my son for over a year.

324
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:10,207
If so, who's the man that is standing behind you, Yumi?

325
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:12,707
He's...

326
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:17,607
I live next door and I'm Yumi baby's...

327
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:20,307
"Shukichi Haneda (28)" -I'm going with Yumi

328
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,107
"Resident of the mansion" -and my name is Shukichi Haneda!

329
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,307
What?

330
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:25,507
I'm his ex!

331
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:27,907
I've already broken up with him though!

332
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:32,107
But, what brings your boyfriend here?

333
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,407
My ex-boyfriend said that

334
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,907
he remembered the number to the dial of the mailbox

335
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,407
where the spare key was inside,

336
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,107
so I dragged him out here!

337
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:43,507
You look familiar too.

338
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:44,507
Now that you mentioned it,

339
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:47,507
I think I've heard that name somewhere before too.

340
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:50,807
Don't tell me that you saw him on a fugitive want list or something.

341
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:54,107
Don't be ridiculous.

342
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,807
Well, but there was a will at the feet of the corpse too.

343
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:00,307
I guess we could conclude this to be suicide.

344
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:05,707
But Conan mentioned that it may not be suicide.

345
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:06,807
What?

346
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:13,707
I see. True!

347
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:17,407
This will and the place where this letter was torn off doesn't match!

348
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:19,407
What's written on the will is,

349
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:21,907
I'm sorry for wounding you.

350
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:24,707
I pray you'll get well soon.

351
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:27,107
Yasuei, good luck in your exam.

352
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,307
I'm sure you'll pass it.

353
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,707
When celebrating Ichiko's Shichigosan,

354
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:34,607
please let her wear my dressy kimono.

355
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:35,807
Please forgive me for crossing over

356
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,707
before all of you and leaving you behind.

357
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:39,607
Chiyoko Itami.

358
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:43,707
Is there anything suspicious about the contents?

359
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,207
No.

360
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:50,307
As you can see, my eye is bruised from the ashtray

361
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,307
that my wife threw at me last night.

362
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:53,807
My son Yasuie did mention

363
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:57,707
that his driving license test was coming up soon.

364
00:18:57,707 --> 00:19:00,407
And, my younger sister's daughter

365
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,707
is going to be seven years old this year.

366
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:04,807
So, she's celebrating Shichigosan.

367
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,907
Why did your wife throw an ashtray at you, though?

368
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:10,007
My wife has a habit of throwing things when she gets angry.

369
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,407
I saw her do it too.

370
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:13,707
That's why I think that the cell phone

371
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,107
that was found on the floor in front of the bedroom

372
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:17,407
was thrown there by Mrs. Itami too.

373
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,307
The cell phone was found on the floor?

374
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,407
Yes.

375
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,107
When I came back from shopping,

376
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:27,107
and first knocked on the bedroom door I noticed it there.

377
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,107
Where is that cell phone?

378
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,807
I have it with me

379
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:34,907
I was going to give it back to my wife when was in a better mood.

380
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:40,907
There is no outgoing or incoming call history today.

381
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:42,607
If this were a homicide,

382
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:45,507
I thought it may have been used for some trick or something but...

383
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:48,207
It seems to have nothing to do with the case.

384
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:52,207
So, Mrs. Itami didn't commit suicide after all.

385
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:53,607
After all?

386
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:56,107
Because Mrs. Itami used to say

387
00:19:56,107 --> 00:20:00,207
that she was loved by God and that she was a lucky person!

388
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:02,207
A lucky person?

389
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:03,407
Which means?

390
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:08,007
I think she's referring to the time several years ago,

391
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:12,107
when the plane that she was on board was about to crash.

392
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:14,407
Then, were you on board that plane too?

393
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:17,807
No. I was scheduled to ride it too but,

394
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:21,607
I broke my leg skiing just before I was scheduled to board the plane.

395
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:23,507
That's why it's hard to believe

396
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:26,807
that Mrs. Itami would commit suicide over a simple brawl.

397
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:30,507
But, that was more like my wife's habit to say things like that.

398
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:33,707
Besides, something's not right about that will too.

399
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:35,007
What's not right?

400
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:38,507
Mrs. Itami caught a cold when she was 7 years old

401
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:40,507
and wasn't able to celebrate Shichigosan

402
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,507
and she mentioned that until the Coming of Age Day,

403
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,507
she didn't have any opportunity to wear a kimono.

404
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:49,407
I see.

405
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:58,007
So, that was the one kimono she had prepared?

406
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,207
Just what're you talking about, Chukichi?

407
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:03,607
She's saying that she didn't make a kimono!

408
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:05,707
I keep telling you, I'm Shukichi!

409
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:07,607
How many times do I have to keep telling you that it's not Chukichi!

410
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:10,107
Chukichi is a better name for you!

411
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:12,607
Looking shabby like that.

412
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:15,507
The one prepared move?

413
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,507
If I'm not mistaken...

414
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:20,307
I get it.

415
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:21,807
If from that point of view,

416
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:24,507
the unnaturalness of that will is...

417
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:27,907
Although it's not enough to see the entire picture yet,

418
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:31,007
if I take it move by move in due order...

419
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:35,107
Right?

420
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:37,207
Mr. Shukichi Haneda?

421
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,807
So, this will is quite questionable after all.

422
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:46,407
Yes, I guess we'll need to analyze the handwriting.

423
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:48,707
Yeah. Moreover,

424
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,007
it bothers me to think that a person who has hurt her wrist

425
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:54,007
would choose a method such as suicide by hanging herself

426
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:57,507
which is a difficult feat to do with one hand.

427
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:59,107
True.

428
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:00,907
Inspector Megure!

429
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:03,407
We got a testimony of a suspicious character being seen!

430
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:04,407
What?

431
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,407
According to the concierge on the first floor,

432
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:11,507
a suspicious looking person wearing a cap, mask and glasses,

433
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,807
as if hiding his face went in and out of the condo!

434
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:40,707
Officer Chiba!

435
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:44,207
I'm not letting you go!

436
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,407
I'm not anybody suspicious.

437
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:49,407
Like they say, perps return to the scene of the crime.

438
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:51,707
Before finding Mrs. Itami's cell phone,

439
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:56,507
Sakurako you said that you heard the bedroom door close, right?

440
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:57,807
Yes.

441
00:23:57,807 --> 00:23:59,507
I can't tell you.

442
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:00,707
It's a woman, isn't it?

443
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,407
I'll bet you were meeting some woman somewhere!

444
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:04,707
Next Conan,

445
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:08,607
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 2)"
