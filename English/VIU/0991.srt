1
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:07,077
Hired to find the culprit who killed Oide Fusaya-san's father,

2
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:12,021
the old man and I tracked down the thief who burglarized the Oide family home

3
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:16,432
around the time of death of Fusaya-san's father Raita-san, Taira Yasushi.

4
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:23,208
However, Taira claimed he only burglarized the house while Raita-san was asleep.

5
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:27,758
Was it Taira who murdered Raita-san

6
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:32,348
and set the gears of tragedy in motion for the Oide family?

7
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,368
Or was it...?

8
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:42,858
Ah, Fusaya.

9
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:52,618
Fusaya, where have you been?!

10
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,868
We're almost there, Fusaya.

11
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,368
Where do you think you're going, Fusaya?!

12
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:10,468
Fusaya, come here.

13
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:17,348
Don't laugh at me.

14
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:19,858
I'm pretty serious about this.

15
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:25,458
I'll be back, Dad.

16
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:31,517
Find the question that solves the mystery!

17
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:33,667
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

18
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:35,528
A series of tragedies befall a family!

19
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:38,097
Identify the culprit and stop the gears from turning!

20
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,737
Always determining the one truth

21
00:01:39,738 --> 00:01:41,707
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

22
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,998
his name is Detective Conan!

23
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:29,808
The Automatic Tragedy (Part Two)

24
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:37,832
If this case was the premeditated murder of Oide Raita,

25
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:41,172
that would make what Taira said rather curious.

26
00:03:41,942 --> 00:03:44,141
He was snoring in his sleep.

27
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,631
Right on the floor here.

28
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,092
That testimony.

29
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:50,592
That's it!

30
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:51,452
All right!

31
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,091
Did you figure something out?

32
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:56,321
I haven't figured anything out, so I'm going back to the Oide family home.

33
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:57,352
I see.

34
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:01,101
Inspiration will surely strike if we go to the crime scene,

35
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:05,102
the same way we figured out Taira Yasushi was the burglar.

36
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,021
So, why are we taking the train instead of a rental car today?

37
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:15,622
Because today, taking public transportation is good luck.

38
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:17,631
We're relying on fortune telling now?

39
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,622
Wait, is this what he was reading so intently earlier?

40
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:25,632
If we'd taken the train yesterday, we might've solved the case already.

41
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:29,072
Now then.

42
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:31,611
Fusaya-kun.

43
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:33,911
Mori-san, what are you doing here?

44
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:37,142
I thought I'd examine your place again today.

45
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:41,321
I see. In that case, my sister went to the hospital.

46
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:41,932
I'll give you the key.

47
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,461
Thank you.

48
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:46,961
Fusaya-san, you're dressed rather formally.

49
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,711
Do you have a date or something?

50
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:51,661
No. I've got an interview.

51
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:53,372
Your necktie is crooked.

52
00:04:55,692 --> 00:05:00,602
My father was worried that I couldn't find a job until the very end.

53
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:04,162
I thought doing whatever it takes to get one would be a good way to honor his memory.

54
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:08,462
They're closed today, but I asked them to make some time for me.

55
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:12,651
I'm sure they'll understand if you explain your feelings to them.

56
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:13,831
They surely will.

57
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:15,302
Thank you.

58
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,302
All that's left is to find my father's killer.

59
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:24,261
Leave it all to me, the great detective Mori Kogoro, to handle the case.

60
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:26,692
You should focus on your interview.

61
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,312
Mori-san.

62
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,942
So, we came all the way here...

63
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:38,661
But I'm still not getting any ideas.

64
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:40,452
It's strange, isn't it?

65
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:42,051
What is?

66
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:45,962
When Taira snuck into the house to steal the money,

67
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:49,941
Oide Raita-san was sleeping on the floor around here, right?

68
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:50,612
Huh?

69
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:53,962
They have a sofa, so why was he sleeping on the hard floor?

70
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,101
He was probably overcome by extreme sleepiness.

71
00:05:57,102 --> 00:06:01,222
When I've had a lot to drink, I end up sleeping wherever when I come home.

72
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:06,801
But Raita-san was looking for Fusaya-san that day, so that couldn't have been it.

73
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,381
Maybe he drank his cares away.

74
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,232
He's not you.

75
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:14,562
In that case, he must've been really tired or...

76
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:16,612
Sleeping pills.

77
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,951
In that case, the culprit

78
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:23,122
secretly drugged Raita with sleeping pills before Taira snuck into the house.

79
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:29,521
After confirming they'd taken effect, they tried to kill him.

80
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,992
But then...

81
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:33,132
Taira snuck into the house.

82
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:37,731
The culprit hid somewhere and watched to see what he'd do.

83
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:41,182
After watching Taira burglarize and flee the house,

84
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:46,312
they killed Raita as planned.

85
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:53,541
In that case, why did the culprit bother putting him to sleep?

86
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:56,191
Because he would've resisted otherwise.

87
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:58,652
In other words, the culprit is a weak person.

88
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:00,532
Like a woman?

89
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:05,662
I hate to imagine it,

90
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:08,152
but is that a possibility?

91
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,351
A woman? Could it be?

92
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:13,362
All right. In that case...

93
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:14,502
Mister?

94
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:16,342
We'll have to go to the hospital to check.

95
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:19,422
Sounds like he's zeroed in on the culprit again.

96
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,761
What? A woman?

97
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:23,612
Yes.

98
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:27,512
Did Raita mention having problems with anyone?

99
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:29,851
She's a young woman.

100
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:31,491
Who are you talking about?

101
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,371
She was there yesterday by the station.

102
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,471
A very suspicious-looking woman.

103
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:36,022
Oh.

104
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,991
Oh, that's who you meant.

105
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:44,262
Who did you think I was talking about?

106
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:45,282
Nobody.

107
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:50,631
She's around your age, wears sunglasses, and has a mole right here.

108
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:51,042
What?

109
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:54,151
Do you mean Kuremi?

110
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:55,511
So you know who she is?

111
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:56,542
Y-Yes.

112
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,291
Soho Kuremi-san.

113
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,691
She was my classmate in middle school.

114
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,621
Last night she came here to visit us.

115
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:04,241
She's your friend?

116
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,052
She was here last night?

117
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:07,002
Yes.

118
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:10,031
When I ran into her the other day, I told her I'd gotten engaged.

119
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,812
She seemed very happy for me.

120
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:15,482
Where can I find this Soho Kuremi-san?

121
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,601
H-Hold on.

122
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:19,381
She gave me her business card the other day.

123
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:20,232
This is it.

124
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:20,902
Thank you.

125
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:24,412
She's a pharmacist?

126
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:27,761
In other words, she could've acquired some sleeping pills.

127
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,561
Thank you for your help.

128
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:30,412
Now then.

129
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:31,972
Excuse me.

130
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,041
Wait, Mister.

131
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,501
Does Kuremi know something?

132
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:38,342
Maybe there's something he wants her help with.

133
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:42,421
On the day of the incident, when the two of you returned home,

134
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,842
Raita-san was in the living room angry about Fusaya-san running away from home, right?

135
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:48,491
Not in the living room.

136
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:51,381
He was at the bottom of the stairs just inside the entrance.

137
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:52,292
Yeah.

138
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:55,851
Dad was really angry while he was fixing the shelf.

139
00:08:55,852 --> 00:09:00,271
Fusaya leaving home must have really come as a shock.

140
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:04,311
Remember that last phone call he made to you?

141
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:05,741
Did something happen?

142
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:06,692
Yeah.

143
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:09,912
He called to ask if we'd found Fusaya.

144
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,531
I see.

145
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:15,192
You haven't even found anyone who's seen him.

146
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:19,921
I'm sorry. I suddenly feel sleepy.

147
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,591
The rest is up to you.

148
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:23,922
Hey, Dad?

149
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:29,421
Since his voice was so indistinct, I thought it must have really gotten to him.

150
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:32,932
What time did you receive that final phone call?

151
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,842
Around 3:30.

152
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:36,752
Is something the matter?

153
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:38,192
No.

154
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:41,071
I'll pass on your story.

155
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:42,052
Bye.

156
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:44,192
Tebai West Pharmacy

157
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,811
Take care.

158
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:47,772
Thank you.

159
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:49,452
Next customer, please.

160
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:52,112
You're Soho Kuremi-san, aren't you?

161
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:57,191
You seem to recognize me.

162
00:09:57,192 --> 00:10:01,572
You know who I am, don't you?

163
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:09,331
Soho Kuremi-san, after running into your former classmate,

164
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,852
you heard about her engagement.

165
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:15,301
She was engaged to the son of a wealthy family.

166
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:17,852
Jealous that she was marrying into money,

167
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:20,862
you plotted to inflict misfortune upon her.

168
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:22,182
Huh?

169
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,252
There's something odd about this culprit.

170
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:28,772
By making her father Raita a murder victim.

171
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:34,622
That day, you visited the Oide family home

172
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:39,872
and secretly drugged Raita using sleeping pills you procured from your workplace.

173
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:43,481
The sudden sleepiness Raita mentioned

174
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,632
was due to the sleeping pills he was given taking effect.

175
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:50,132
In other words, Raita must've fallen asleep immediately afterwards just past 4 PM.

176
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:55,492
But he was killed 30 minutes later at 4:30.

177
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,801
They successfully put him to sleep as planned,

178
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:01,402
so why didn't the culprit act right away?

179
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,261
That 30 minute delay.

180
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:05,631
What does it mean?

181
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,521
I'm beat.

182
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:10,532
I can't believe I got injured after getting caught up in that accident.

183
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:15,332
Although I did receive a bunch of money in compensation.

184
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:18,912
That kind of thinking will get you killed.

185
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:22,362
Your injuries may not have been serious, but it's still a concussion.

186
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:30,261
That's what you thought of me?

187
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:30,682
Huh?

188
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:32,991
It's true that I was jealous.

189
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,182
I think she got what she deserved with this case.

190
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,751
When you started showing up everywhere I went, I laughed.

191
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:42,981
I thought they must really be struggling if they hired a famous detective.

192
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:46,691
But it sounds like you're actually a hack.

193
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,112
Wh-What?

194
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:52,532
I haven't fallen so low that I'd commit murder over something like that.

195
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:54,911
Could you not make a fool of me?

196
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:59,671
Then why did you keep showing up wherever that family went yesterday?

197
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:02,811
Is watching them from a distance and pretending to visit them

198
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:04,592
so I could laugh at them a crime?

199
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:07,842
It's certainly true that you're behaving suspiciously.

200
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:11,031
Don't treat me like a criminal when you don't even have any evidence.

201
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:13,581
Then at least help me with my investigation.

202
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:15,012
You're so persistent.

203
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:18,821
I'll give you some special information if you'll leave me alone.

204
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,432
Wh-What is it?

205
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:22,551
I saw a suspicious person exit that house

206
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:27,051
on the day of the incident when the 4:30 PM notice played.

207
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:29,051
What? What kind of person?

208
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:33,452
A short man wearing a hat with shaggy hair and a prominent nose.

209
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:39,311
Shaggy hair, prominent nose, wearing a hat,

210
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:40,982
and short.

211
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,372
That's Taira.

212
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:46,991
What? He's not the culprit?

213
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:50,901
I held onto that information so the family would owe me a favor.

214
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:51,752
Hold on.

215
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:55,481
Was he carrying a large bag of some kind?

216
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:56,892
A bag, huh?

217
00:12:57,592 --> 00:13:02,302
I think all he had with him was a small shoulder bag.

218
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:07,261
Which means Taira didn't take the weapon with him.

219
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:09,401
He's starting to sound innocent.

220
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,282
Satisfied?

221
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:16,832
Good luck finding the real culprit, Mr. Great Detective.

222
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,782
Later.

223
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:21,082
Damn it!

224
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:24,542
What? From the autopsy?

225
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,922
Yeah. He asked me to check in a hurry.

226
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:31,491
If it was Mori-san's request, then I suppose I can show you.

227
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:34,831
But will you understand what you're looking at?

228
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:37,931
I'll tell him exactly what I saw. Don't worry.

229
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:38,932
Will you?

230
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:47,732
Single blow only

231
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:49,482
I knew it.

232
00:13:49,722 --> 00:13:53,592
The person who set the gears of tragedy in motion for the Oide family was...

233
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,939
Really?

234
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,219
Yeah, I really got the job.

235
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,760
That's great.

236
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,990
Now Dad can rest in peace.

237
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,519
You came, Fusaya.

238
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,249
Sorry, Mom. Did I wake you?

239
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,240
It's fine.

240
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,589
I was just dreaming about you.

241
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,369
We were all celebrating you landing a job.

242
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,789
Mom, your dream came true.

243
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,250
What? You mean...

244
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah. They're going to hire me.

245
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,670
That's great. That's so great.

246
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,520
Hello? Yes.

247
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,890
Really? Yes.

248
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,540
Yes, I'll head back immediately.

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,890
What is it?

250
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,439
That was Mori-san.

251
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,020
He figured out who the culprit is.

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,520
Hiring him was the right choice after all.

253
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,219
You're getting married, and I got a job.

254
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,530
The gears of tragedy will finally stop turning now.

255
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,670
I'm going to go hear what he has to say.

256
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,660
Is it true?

257
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,000
After all, it's only been a day.

258
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,040
Well, he is a great detective.

259
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,670
You're right.

260
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,969
There's no harm in praying to god or asking great detectives for help.

261
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,180
What does that mean?

262
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,650
I'll meet you at your home.

263
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,560
Oide

264
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,859
Where have you been?

265
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,099
What about you?

266
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,820
How did things go with the suspicious woman?

267
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,779
She was just suspicious, nothing more.

268
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,869
I didn't find a single piece of evidence.

269
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:54,079
I see. Speaking of evidence, they didn't find any sleeping pills in Raita-san's body.

270
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,679
No alcohol either.

271
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,960
What?

272
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,000
That means my deduction is fundamentally wrong.

273
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,010
Wait, how do you even know that?

274
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,770
Lieutenant Tagiri asked me to tell you.

275
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,840
Mori-san.

276
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,640
You truly are the country's greatest detective.

277
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,629
Who is it? Who's the true culprit?

278
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,070
What?

279
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,450
Actually, I, uh—

280
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,520
I'm still working on that...

281
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,200
Mori-san?

282
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,070
Let's figure that out together.

283
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,710
Is this the rumored Sleeping Kogoro?

284
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,210
Allow me to describe my reasoning.

285
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:45,440
The culprit thought to have snuck into this house and killed your father

286
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,720
never existed in the first place.

287
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,420
What do you mean, Mori-san?

288
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,230
Before I explain the truth, I'd like to confirm something with you first.

289
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:04,739
The morning of the incident, Raita returned just as you were leaving the house

290
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,740
in order to avoid troubling your sister and her fiancee.

291
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,130
He returned to speak with you about your future, but the two of you got into a fight.

292
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,000
That's right. Why are you bringing that up now?

293
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,139
Was your fight with your father rather intense?

294
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,010
For example...

295
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,760
Yeah. Dad was really angry while he was fixing the shelf.

296
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,289
Your sister was referring to the hanging shelf up there.

297
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,270
And your fight was violent enough that it broke.

298
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,369
We got into a scuffle, and I threw my father off of me.

299
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,280
His back struck the wall, causing the shelf to fall.

300
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,200
I left while that was happening.

301
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,529
And that was around 10 AM.

302
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,529
Yes. More importantly, what do you mean, there's no culprit?

303
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,290
My father is—

304
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,170
Dead. You've heard the cause of death, haven't you?

305
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,170
Yes, but I'd never heard the term before.

306
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,050
Acute epidural hematoma.

307
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,589
Yes, I believe that's what it's called.

308
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,929
They're quite tricky.

309
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,729
Often the moment a person strikes their head and their time of death don't match.

310
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,180
What?

311
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,489
People who strike their head and fall unconscious due to a concussion

312
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,449
often recover quickly and appear totally lucid as though nothing happened.

313
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,200
This is known as a lucid interval.

314
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,110
The state can persist for three to six hours.

315
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,120
However, they then rapidly lose consciousness and die shortly later.

316
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,619
You're saying that's what happened to my father?

317
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,340
Most likely.

318
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,210
You mean...

319
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,770
Why don't you show a little more consideration for your family?

320
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,550
You and Raita got into a scuffle here.

321
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,040
The hanging shelf fell, and its corner struck Raita on the head.

322
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,990
That's when the acute epidural hematoma developed.

323
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,850
Raita probably lost consciousness for a moment,

324
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,370
but once the lucid interval began,

325
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,509
he got up as though nothing had happened.

326
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,500
Fusaya!

327
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,380
After that, he fixed the shelf,

328
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,000
and helped your other family members look for you,

329
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:32,130
but eventually he was overcome by fatigue as he lost consciousness.

330
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,200
Unaware that a burglar had entered his home...

331
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,139
The time is 4:30.

332
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,279
Please be careful as you return to your homes.

333
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,840
...he died.

334
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,760
But that's just one theory, right?

335
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:56,080
There could be a true culprit who snuck in after that burglar fled

336
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,580
and bludgeoned my father to death!

337
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,330
That's not possible.

338
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:08,090
There were no wounds on Raita's head aside from the one caused by the fatal blow.

339
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,000
And when the shelf was examined earlier,

340
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,090
it matched Raita's injury.

341
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,460
That's the truth, Fusaya-kun.

342
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,300
Which means my father died

343
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,010
because of me.

344
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,740
I prayed at this shrine yesterday evening and this morning, too,

345
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,869
for Mori-san to find the culprit.

346
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,620
Your prayers were answered.

347
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,629
Now we can finally begin preparing for your wedding.

348
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,380
Fusaya has found his way, and you'll be able to leave the hospital tomorrow.

349
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,529
The light has finally fallen on our family.

350
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,380
Yeah.

351
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,430
You can count on me, Fusaya-kun.

352
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,470
I promise I'll save the entire Oide family.

353
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:57,740
I, the great detective Mori Kogoro, so swear.

354
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,890
Mori-san, it's my job to stop the gears of tragedy from turning.

355
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,390
Fusaya-kun, you should decide how you'll live for yourself.

356
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,129
Thank you.

357
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,150
For my dad, my sister, my mom.

358
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,150
For my entire family.

359
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:17,760
I...

360
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,780
Tebai Police Station

361
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,729
After all, I'm the country's greatest detective.

362
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,460
Hey, Mister.

363
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,370
It's time for the last train.

364
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,520
Come on, old man. Wake up already.

365
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,470
Taking public transportation is good luck? Yeah, right.

366
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,350
We've arrived.

367
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,850
Well? Pretty tasteful, right?

368
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,860
I had a bite, but it's good.

369
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,560
Say, "Ah."

370
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,360
What was that?

371
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,559
What's wrong?

372
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,620
I-It's an emergency.

373
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,590
The manager...

374
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,620
The next episode of Conan is "Murder at the Townhouse Café!"
