1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:04,502
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:05,802
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:08,402
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:11,302
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:14,602
We succeeded in getting Kir or Rena Mizunashi

6
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:18,002
to serve as a source of information concerning the Organization,

7
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,402
but this turns out to be way riskier than we could imagine.

8
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:24,902
The president of a foreign talent production company

9
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:27,902
is murdered at New Beika Hotel.

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:31,502
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -Four suspects are his secretary Ms. Irina Palmer.

11
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:34,202
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -English teacher, Mr. Hal Buckner.

12
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,702
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Model, Mr. Toby Keynes.

13
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:40,702
"Andre Camel, age 27" -And surprisingly, agent Camel of the FBI.

14
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:43,702
The message President Sunouchi seems to have written

15
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:45,002
just before passing away,

16
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,702
that the killer seems to have taken with him,

17
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:49,502
"Jodie Starling" -said this...

18
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,502
Bring my tux.

19
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:54,402
Bring my tuxedo please.

20
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:57,202
Just what does this dying message mean?

21
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:02,502
Just then, agent Akai of the FBI receives a call.

22
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:07,102
-Yes. -It's me, Rena Mizunashi.

23
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:09,902
Well, the thing is I don't feel comfortable here.

24
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:13,402
I want to get out of here, so I want you to help me.

25
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:15,502
"Gin"

26
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:19,202
I'll send you the time and place later by email, then.

27
00:01:19,202 --> 00:01:20,602
Yeah.

28
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:23,502
"James Black" -Was that Rena Mizunashi?

29
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:24,702
Yes.

30
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:28,402
She wants me to meet her now, just the two of us.

31
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:29,802
If she's saying just the two of you,

32
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:31,402
it could be a trap.

33
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:33,602
I'd advise you not to go.

34
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:34,902
Yes.

35
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:37,202
If it is a trap though,

36
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:38,402
if I don't go,

37
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:40,402
there's a ten to one chance that they'll kill her.

38
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,502
She's being suspected by the Organization.

39
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:47,402
But...

40
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:48,802
I'll be fine.

41
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:52,502
I pride myself for having pretty sharp hunches.

42
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:55,502
She is an agent of the CIA,

43
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:56,602
so I'm sure she's thought up something

44
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:57,902
to make it through this too.

45
00:01:57,902 --> 00:02:01,102
At any rate, let's call Jodie

46
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:03,002
and think of what we as FBI agents can do...

47
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:08,002
What seems to be the matter?

48
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:28,502
Sizzling hot suspense.

49
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:31,102
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

50
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:32,702
The members of the Youth Detective Squad burst into laughter.

51
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,602
At the magic words that discloses the culprit.

52
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,102
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:37,702
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:39,702
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

55
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:11,548
"Red and Black Crash: Desperation."

56
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:15,347
That's what the report from Chiba said.

57
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,647
As a result of the investigation,

58
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,347
it has been found that Irina

59
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:21,647
who is not able to sufficiently read and write Japanese

60
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:26,147
was corresponding with the president in English.

61
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,647
It has been confirmed that Hal is working

62
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:30,347
as an English teacher at a prep school nearby.

63
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:33,947
Toby is working as a fashion model.

64
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:37,047
All this has been verified as true.

65
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:42,247
As to Camel, we will believe agent Jodie's words,

66
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:45,247
claiming that he is a FBI agent.

67
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:46,747
That will be all as far as we're concerned.

68
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:50,347
Oh, but please wait a little while more!

69
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:54,647
Hey, did you solve the thing about the memo?

70
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:57,547
That's still under investigation.

71
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,547
Memo?

72
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,747
She's talking about the dining message, right?

73
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:04,347
I think you meant to say dying message, Genta.

74
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,147
That...

75
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,247
If we're just going to have to wait here,

76
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:10,847
I'd like to be given permission to leave for about two hours.

77
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,747
The class that I'm in charge of is scheduled to start pretty soon.

78
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,047
Me too.

79
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:18,047
May I leave to go to the hotel reception?

80
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:21,347
I've got to do a lot of canceling and stuff.

81
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:24,247
Besides, maybe I'll get to find out something

82
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:27,147
about the person the president was scheduled to meet today too.

83
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:28,647
I guess so.

84
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:30,047
I think it'll be okay

85
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,047
if you're escorted by a police officer?

86
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,147
As for Hal,

87
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:37,447
I'll have to ask you to cancel today's class.

88
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,447
If so, I'd like to tell the prep school head

89
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:42,247
the reason I'm not teaching today in person

90
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,247
since it's really nearby.

91
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:47,747
Yes.

92
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:52,147
-Chiba. -He will escort Irina

93
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:54,647
and he will accompany Hal.

94
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:56,347
Let's go, then.

95
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,547
I mean there's a dead man here

96
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:03,047
and they're more concerned about their class and party.

97
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,547
Some nerve.

98
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:08,047
Don't you think so, Inspector?

99
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:10,947
I see. That's the story.

100
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:15,247
That's why the killer took the memo with him.

101
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:18,347
-What the heck! -Huh? What's wrong?

102
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:20,547
I figured that maybe Shu would be able

103
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,047
to figure out the meaning of the tuxedo memo,

104
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:24,947
but my cell phone hasn't been working well since this morning

105
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:27,347
and I can't get through.

106
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:28,747
Jodie?

107
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:31,647
I'll lend you my cell phone for a while then.

108
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:32,847
You don't mind?

109
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:36,547
The email addresses and phone numbers are in here, aren't they?

110
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,347
It's okay.

111
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,747
As for the mails, I moved the data the other day.

112
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:41,747
And as to the phone numbers,

113
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:43,947
as long as I pull out the SIM card,

114
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,447
no one can look at them.

115
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,947
If you insert the SIM card of your cell phone,

116
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:51,847
it'll become your cell phone.

117
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:55,147
Since my cell phone is the same type as yours.

118
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,447
But won't it be inconvenient for you,

119
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:58,947
not having your cell phone?

120
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:00,347
No problem.

121
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:02,647
Because I have another one.

122
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:04,047
Thank you.

123
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,147
Then, I'll use it for now.

124
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:08,447
But, doesn't it seem kind of strange?

125
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:11,547
On the outside, it's changed and of a different shape,

126
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,447
yet the contents of the cell phone

127
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:16,047
is what you've been using for a long time and know very well.

128
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:19,647
-Huh? -Just what're you talking about?

129
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,247
You know...

130
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:25,047
Just like Mr. Camel who was actually a FBI agent,

131
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:27,847
we should never judge anything by its cover.

132
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,647
Thank you.

133
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:33,547
Thanks to you, I've solved the mystery of that memo.

134
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:36,447
I hate to butt in when you're all elated,

135
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,747
but will you explain it so that a man like me can understand it too?

136
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:43,647
Okay, I'll explain.

137
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:46,547
There's a magic spell

138
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:48,647
that will tell you who the culprit is at once.

139
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:50,247
Magic spell?

140
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:51,847
Are you saying that chanting that spell

141
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,747
will reveal the culprit?

142
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:54,847
Yep.

143
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:57,947
Although we need to get a lot of things ready.

144
00:07:57,947 --> 00:07:59,447
Ready?

145
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:02,247
First we need chairs for the number of people involved.

146
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:06,447
That's all you have to say.

147
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:07,647
Easy, right?

148
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:11,047
Are you really sure, we can find the culprit by doing so?

149
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:13,747
Yep. I'm sure because it's a magic spell

150
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:15,747
that Shinichi told me about.

151
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,547
Try it.

152
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:18,947
If Kudo's the one who said so,

153
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:20,547
it just might work.

154
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:21,947
Hey, Conan.

155
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:25,047
What's the spell that will reveal the culprit?

156
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,447
Tell us...

157
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:30,347
That's why all we need to say in front of the suspects is...

158
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,747
Liar.

159
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:37,147
You gotta be kidding.

160
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:38,947
If that will reveal the culprit,

161
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:40,847
who needs the police?

162
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,547
That's what I figured they'd say.

163
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:46,247
So what is it you're really supposed to say?

164
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:48,647
Tell us, without putting us on.

165
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:51,447
I mean, I'm serious. That's what to say.

166
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,647
Officer Takagi.

167
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,047
Huh?

168
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:58,647
Just watch.

169
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,947
Will you go get four chairs for the four suspects?

170
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:04,047
Oh, but I think it would be better for them to come to the station

171
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,847
if we're going to interrogate them.

172
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:06,947
No.

173
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,147
It's to determine who the culprit is.

174
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:11,247
As long as they're there, it will become obvious.

175
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,347
What? Really?

176
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:16,947
Yeah, most probably.

177
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:20,347
"Haido Central Hospital."

178
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,347
Tonight at 19:00.

179
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:38,747
Raiha Pass where the seventh left curve ends.

180
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:40,047
At this hour of the night,

181
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,047
there aren't many cars going by that pass.

182
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:47,747
Just the perfect place for a secret meeting.

183
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:50,947
Are you sure, you're going to be okay?

184
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:54,547
Yes, please believe me.

185
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:56,247
And, of course, her.

186
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,647
Akai.

187
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:06,147
Okay, then, please take care of things.

188
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,547
I'm counting on you.

189
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:12,647
Yeah.

190
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:37,501
Inspector Megure, everything's set in place.

191
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,001
Okay.

192
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:42,201
Will the four suspects go

193
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:44,301
and stand in front of your respective chairs?

194
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,401
What're you going to do?

195
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,701
It's kind of scary.

196
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:49,701
If you're going to interrogate us,

197
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,701
wouldn't one to a room be better?

198
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:55,301
Well, let's do as the Inspector says.

199
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,101
It's not like he's going to ask us to play musical chair

200
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:58,801
or anything so.

201
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,801
Oh, please don't sit yet.

202
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,401
I wonder if he's really going to say that magic spell?

203
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:06,001
No, he won't.

204
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:08,301
He'll be the laughing stock if he does.

205
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,501
Now that all four of you are here, first...

206
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,401
Shiraunplee!

207
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,801
How come you guys are all sitting down?

208
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:56,801
Oh, because the Inspector just said...

209
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:11,301
Sit down please.

210
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:13,101
That's what the word Shiraunplee sounds like

211
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:14,501
to the ears of foreigners

212
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,101
who are used listening to English.

213
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,701
It sounds like the English.

214
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:21,201
Sit down please.

215
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:24,301
More so, if they're standing in front of chairs.

216
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:29,101
In other words, he looks like a foreigner,

217
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:30,901
but he's Japanese inside.

218
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:34,001
And, if the person is not used to hearing English,

219
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,201
it would sound like what it's really supposed to mean,

220
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:38,701
that is the Japanese word play innocent.

221
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:41,801
Do you know what this means?

222
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:43,001
Mr. murderer.

223
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:46,701
-Murderer? -Him?

224
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:51,101
-Why? -Agent Jodie...

225
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,501
I still don't understand what is going on.

226
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,101
Neither do I.

227
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:57,601
Let me go over the case, okay?

228
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:58,701
The one who was shot

229
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:01,601
is the president of a foreigner's talent production.

230
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,801
From the fact that the president was supposed to meet

231
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,401
a new foreign talent today.

232
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,501
Because the police arrived to the site of the scene right away,

233
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,001
there were four suspects,

234
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:14,501
his secretary, Irina who was the first to find him.

235
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:17,401
Then foreigners who were in this hotel at the time of the crime,

236
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:20,601
English teacher, Mr. Hal Buckner.

237
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,101
Mr. Toby Keynes, the model.

238
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:27,201
And for some reason, the man who was training on the stairs,

239
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:30,901
FBI agent, Mr. Andre Camel.

240
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:33,701
The clue is the thing that was on top the president's desk,

241
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,401
a memo paper that had been torn off.

242
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,401
Because there were blood stains

243
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,301
on the president's hand and the edge of the memo,

244
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:44,701
it was deduced that the president wrote something just before he died,

245
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:47,501
and that memo was taken away by the murderer.

246
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,901
And from the traces of what was left on the paper below the memo,

247
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:52,801
the words, bring my tux.

248
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:56,001
The phrase please bring my tuxedo was thought out.

249
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,301
According to his secretary, Irina,

250
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:01,601
the president was scheduled to attend a party today

251
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,901
and the memo was probably a message

252
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:07,101
that the president had left for her.

253
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:09,401
You already understand, don't you?

254
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:13,201
So, why did the killer take a plain memo away?

255
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:14,501
I get it!

256
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:16,601
It's because he couldn't read the English!

257
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:20,001
The murder couldn't understand the memo,

258
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:23,101
so he got scared and took it with him.

259
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,701
It's most likely that after the murderer shot the president,

260
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,101
he was looking for something,

261
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,901
but realized that the president

262
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:35,001
was holding a pen and a memo paper.

263
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:37,701
Thinking that something had been written about himself,

264
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:40,401
the killer hastily tore off the memo sheet and took it with him.

265
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:44,301
However, the president was already dead at that time.

266
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,601
If it were a person who could read English,

267
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,001
he could see right away

268
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:50,101
that it was just a message to the president's secretary.

269
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:52,901
In other words, the man who teaches English at a prep school,

270
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,801
Mr. Hal Buckner,

271
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,201
and the secretary who was corresponding with the president in English,

272
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,701
Irina,

273
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:02,601
and FBI agent, Mr. Camel can all be marked off the suspect list.

274
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,701
The one who most probably walked off with the memo sheet

275
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:08,001
is the man who is presumed to not have been able to read English,

276
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,301
Mr. Toby Keynes.

277
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:12,701
He's the only likely one left.

278
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,701
Where's the proof?

279
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:22,201
Don't tell me that you're going to make a murderer out of me

280
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,701
just because I don't understand English?

281
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:28,501
What would you guys do?

282
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:31,901
If you see a memo sheet with bad things written about you on it.

283
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:34,101
I'd probably throw it away as soon as I pick it up.

284
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,701
I'd be pissed.

285
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,901
I wouldn't even want to read it.

286
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:40,801
But, what if it was written in a code

287
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,601
or something that you don't understand?

288
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,801
Then, I would never throw it away.

289
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:47,601
I'd be concerned about what's written.

290
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,101
I'd take it home and check up on in.

291
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:53,201
Then the murderer most probably...

292
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,301
Excuse me, let me check you.

293
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,901
Here it is!

294
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:03,901
Inspector!

295
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,401
I was going to take it home

296
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:13,201
and ask my American girlfriend's younger brother

297
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:17,001
what was written on it.

298
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,501
Girlfriend?

299
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,401
Yeah, my girlfriend.

300
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:22,401
I can't ask her directly anymore,

301
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,701
because after being slave driven by the president,

302
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:30,801
she died at the end of last year from over work.

303
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,401
Slave-driven?

304
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:34,201
Right.

305
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,701
She was made to sign a contract that was written in Japanese.

306
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:41,101
She could speak a little Japanese,

307
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,301
but couldn't read at all.

308
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,501
Moreover, it was a contract binding her brother as joint guarantor,

309
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:50,901
to take full responsibility if she ended up not being able to work.

310
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:53,701
So, I came here wanting to at least save her younger brother

311
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:54,901
and threatened the president with a gun,

312
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:58,401
hoping to get hold of the contract.

313
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,701
I made him scout me out in the city.

314
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:05,101
He had the nerve to say that he didn't have the contract

315
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:08,301
and he'd have his secretary bring it over,

316
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:11,701
so I inadvertently ended up pulling the trigger.

317
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:12,701
Which means...

318
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:16,201
that the file the president asked me to get was...

319
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,701
Yeah, the contract she signed should also be in it.

320
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:24,601
If I knew that his secretary was a girl like you,

321
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:27,601
I guess I didn't have to kill him.

322
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:33,101
But that Shiraunplee thing really got me.

323
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,601
How did you figure it out?

324
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:36,801
That I'm a foreign looking man who is 100% Japanese,

325
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,801
unable to speak a word of English?

326
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:40,801
Reception.

327
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:42,001
Huh?

328
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:44,201
Reception.

329
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:48,201
When the secretary left saying she was going to the hotel's reception,

330
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,901
Toby, you said...

331
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,101
I mean there's a dead man here

332
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:58,201
and they're more concerned about their class and party.

333
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,301
Some nerve.

334
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:04,501
Right. When a foreigner says hotel's reception,

335
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,601
it's equivalent to the front desk of a hotel in Japanese.

336
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:11,601
That's how I figured out you couldn't speak English, Toby.

337
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:14,701
It means the front desk.

338
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:17,301
I thought that something wasn't right.

339
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:18,601
Looking back at things,

340
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:23,001
maybe I should've had my American father teach me more English.

341
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,601
All I learned from my father was how to shoot a gun.

342
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:29,701
How to shoot a gun?

343
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:33,601
Yeah, because he belong to the US-Japan troop

344
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:35,401
stationed here in Japan.

345
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,701
Although my father didn't want to,

346
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,001
when we went on a trip to Guam,

347
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,801
I begged him to teach me.

348
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:47,101
But, I wish he taught me more...

349
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:49,001
of what shooting a person,

350
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,501
and what the consequences could be.

351
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:54,601
I never ever want to go through this again.

352
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,301
Every time I pull the trigger,

353
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,101
it feels like I'm losing my soul

354
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:01,701
that super revolting feeling.

355
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:07,301
"Mouri Detective Agency."

356
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:10,101
Conan and dad really are like fired bullets

357
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:12,301
that never come back once they go out.

358
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:15,501
No dinner for them tonight.

359
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,101
New York.

360
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,501
FBI?

361
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:27,501
Come to think of it, that person I met back then was also...

362
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:35,901
A Japanese person with long hair?

363
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,001
What? A gun?

364
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:55,101
My body...

365
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,801
won't move.

366
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,001
Hey, hurry up!

367
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:02,401
Jump in! He must be the serial killer!

368
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,501
But...

369
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:08,501
Shinichi's still inside.

370
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,301
What the...

371
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:13,701
Oh, hey...

372
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:14,801
Are you Japanese?

373
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:20,001
I'm asking you, are you Japanese?

374
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,201
Oh, yes.

375
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,101
Did you see a suspicious looking man?

376
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:25,601
Huh?

377
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,901
A Japanese man with long hair dyed silver.

378
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,901
No, nobody like that.

379
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,001
Did you find him, sir?

380
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,801
No.

381
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,601
At any rate, this place is dangerous.

382
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,201
Turn right on the corner over there

383
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,701
and you'll come out to the main street.

384
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,501
Hail a cab there.

385
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:49,301
Oh, but I'm waiting here for my friend.

386
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:52,301
He's a high school sophomore like me.

387
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:55,401
Let me tell you as well as that friend again.

388
00:20:59,101 --> 00:21:01,901
Get lost! Get out of here, quick!

389
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,901
He was a FBI agent.

390
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:15,101
And once more...

391
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,001
You're crying again.

392
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,701
Huh?

393
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:31,001
You're always crying.

394
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,401
Does it bother you?

395
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,601
No.

396
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:39,601
You just remind me...

397
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:41,701
of a woman who closely resembled you.

398
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:46,701
A stupid woman who feigned composure,

399
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,901
but used to cry when no one was watching.

400
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:53,601
A woman who closely resembles me.

401
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:56,501
I wonder who he was referring to.

402
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,601
Do I have to tell you how I feel, for you to understand?

403
00:23:52,201 --> 00:23:53,301
"Next Episode."

404
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,801
Did the strings that were connected

405
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,901
become a double-edged sword?

406
00:23:57,901 --> 00:24:00,201
Who will outfox the other,

407
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:03,701
who will triumph and laugh at the end?

408
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,601
What is the meaning of their last conversation?

409
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:09,601
When will the mystery be solved?

410
00:24:09,601 --> 00:24:12,801
The long Friday the 13th ends.

411
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:17,701
Next on Detective Conan,

412
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:22,201
"Red and Black Crash: Killed on Duty."

413
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:40,201
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:42,401
Bullet.

415
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:45,701
Everybody, don't forget FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

416
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,201
What do you mean?
