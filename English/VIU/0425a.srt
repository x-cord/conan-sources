1
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:08,926
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:12,426
The broadcasting of Detective Conan has reached its tenth anniversary.

3
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:13,626
From now on...

4
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:17,226
We shall sustain our continuous effort and offer you our best...

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,326
TV show.

6
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,326
Movies.

7
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:22,226
-And Shounen Sunday too! -And Shounen Sunday too!

8
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:24,026
And us, the Youth Detective Squad too!

9
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:26,226
-What? -What?

10
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,826
-Please keep rooting for us! -Please keep rooting for us!

11
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:30,226
That being said!

12
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:32,926
Let's ready ourselves for some major hype today!

13
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:35,626
Singing for us is our beloved Shin...

14
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:39,326
Conan Edogawa with "I'm Here"!

15
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,327
Take it away!

16
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:43,326
He said, "take it away", but isn't Conan's singing...

17
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:44,327
No doubt...

18
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:45,427
I know, right?

19
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:48,126
The glasses kid is on it?

20
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:50,026
No way!

21
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:51,727
Hey, for real?

22
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:56,727
"I'm Here by Conan Edogawa."

23
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:05,027
"When tomorrow comes, my tears will have dried."

24
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:11,327
"My heart will have come around."

25
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:19,627
"For the sake of you, with your beautiful smile"

26
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:25,527
"I will always be here."

27
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:31,727
"The full moon seems to run red."

28
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:35,326
Hey, isn't that unfair?

29
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,626
We apologize for the trouble so early in the year.

30
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:39,926
Sonoko...

31
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:44,626
Today we have a tenth anniversary extended special story just for you!

32
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:48,426
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out."

33
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:50,026
Sounds ominous.

34
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,226
Chock-full of content for two and a half hours, please enjoy it!

35
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:56,026
Ran, I don't have any screen time in this episode!

36
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:58,426
Well then, let's kick off with this intro!

37
00:01:58,427 --> 00:01:59,527
Start.

38
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,077
While flourishing as a high-school detective,

39
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,777
I was shrunken into a child by the Black Organization

40
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:11,678
with their mysterious drug.

41
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:14,977
Hailing from an immoral criminal syndicate,

42
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:17,678
they placed little weight on the lives of others.

43
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:19,678
"The Black Organization."

44
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:24,377
As such, the war between myself and the Black Organization

45
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,777
has continued day after day.

46
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:30,478
Yes. The war fought as Detective Conan Edogawa.

47
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,577
"Ai Haibara."

48
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:36,877
The codename for that drug is APOPTOXIN 4869 (APTX 4869).

49
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,577
It's something I developed for the Black Organization.

50
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:44,377
However, it remains in prototype testing.

51
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:45,677
Ai Haibara.

52
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:47,777
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

53
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:49,978
In the Organization, she was known as Sherry.

54
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:54,377
I began to distrust the Black Organization

55
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:57,377
and escaped by taking the drug.

56
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,477
That's after my elder sister was murdered.

57
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:02,377
By him.

58
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:03,378
Gin.

59
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,277
"Gin."

60
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:06,677
This man was precisely the scoundrel

61
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:09,078
who is responsible for changing me into this state.

62
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:11,377
"Vodka."

63
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,077
Along with his partner Vodka,

64
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,678
it's likely they've been involved in numerous crimes.

65
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:21,478
By chance, we once ran across Gin's car in the middle of town.

66
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:24,777
We tried to tail them

67
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:27,478
but Haibara was soon captured by their compatriots.

68
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,677
Haibara, you're in danger!

69
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:33,778
They're coming!

70
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,877
I instructed Haibara to drink Paikar,

71
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,977
an alcohol that would temporarily revert her body to normal.

72
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,578
And tried to aid her escape.

73
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:46,977
But...

74
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,078
Gin had been lying in wait there.

75
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:56,977
Hurry into the chimney!

76
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:58,677
It was exceedingly dangerous,

77
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:01,478
but somehow, I managed to retrieve Haibara from them.

78
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,577
The FBI agents, Jodie and Akai,

79
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:10,378
began their investigation in secret.

80
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:12,777
Those two were after...

81
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:15,277
"Vermouth" -Vermouth.

82
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:17,577
Vermouth disguised herself as the school physician,

83
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:20,478
Dr. Araide, while searching for Sherry.

84
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:26,077
And eventually, she found us.

85
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:30,377
I inadvertently requested a house call without suspecting anything

86
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:33,877
since Ai's cold had become severe.

87
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:35,977
Our cover was blown.

88
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:38,477
Both Haibara's and mine.

89
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,277
My apologies for being so last minute,

90
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,377
but would it be all right to take you there now?

91
00:04:42,378 --> 00:04:46,577
I disguised myself as Haibara and accepted Vermouth's invitation.

92
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,977
The FBI also set up a trap.

93
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:52,177
Vermouth, the FBI and I.

94
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:54,178
It became a spectacular battle between us three.

95
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:00,278
Vermouth's plan of targeting Haibara went astray.

96
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:09,677
From this incident, we acquired some information on the Organization.

97
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:13,877
Right. It turns out the dial tone for their boss's e-mail address

98
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,477
resembles the "Seven Kids" melody.

99
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,178
"Seven Kids."

100
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:22,377
And tonight, along with this "Seven Kids" melody,

101
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:24,678
an assassination plot will soon be put into motion.

102
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:27,778
Just who is their target?

103
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,477
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for waiting!

104
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,277
We're proudly presenting you, the next vice president,

105
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:46,977
candidate for the whole town, Kevin Brown.

106
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:48,778
Please give a big hand.

107
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:11,778
-Kevin... -Kevin...

108
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,278
I did it!

109
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:34,177
500 yards.

110
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,278
Cleared.

111
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:39,778
It's your turn next!

112
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:12,178
Just as expected!

113
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:11,577
600 yards, cleared!

114
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:14,677
Kevin Brown dies three times!

115
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,078
Four times.

116
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:20,578
They're pretty good.

117
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:04,977
Too bad!

118
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,778
If I clear this one...

119
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:09,678
It's my win!

120
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:16,778
I got this.

121
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:25,877
It seems 600 yards is as far as they can go.

122
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:27,877
That's it...

123
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:29,877
Gin!

124
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:31,677
Wait! Let me try once more!

125
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,778
There's no need to.

126
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:39,678
Our prey this time will be only 200 or 300 yards away at most.

127
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:42,578
That means...

128
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:45,377
Chianti.

129
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,178
Korn.

130
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:51,578
You got work to do.

131
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:07,977
I don't have all day!

132
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,078
I'm sorry!

133
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:30,177
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

134
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:31,977
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

135
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:33,677
Finally, a confrontation with the Black Organization!

136
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:36,877
Dire straits comes one after another and ultimately the target of terror!

137
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:38,277
He sees through the one and only truth.

138
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,977
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

139
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,978
His name is Detective Conan!

140
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,578
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out."

141
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:23,278
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out."

142
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:36,684
How was it?

143
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:39,484
That concludes our "Yoko Okino's Four-Minute Cooking".

144
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:43,684
Today's guest was Detective Kogoro Mouri.

145
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:44,884
All right, then!

146
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:47,884
See all at the same time next week!

147
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:49,684
Great, okay!

148
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,784
That's all for today!

149
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,085
That's right!

150
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,284
You were great, Dad!

151
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:58,584
Really! It was a live broadcast

152
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:00,884
but you were so calm and just great!

153
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:03,385
No... It wasn't all that great.

154
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:10,784
Yoko, you're way too beautiful that the noodles have gotten too hot

155
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:14,284
and excited that the Yoko's Soy Sauce Ramen that I made,

156
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:15,784
as you can see, have become soggy and soft.

157
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:18,085
It's knocked out.

158
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:23,884
You're the one who's soft with women.

159
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,484
We're lucky though!

160
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:28,884
Since "Morning Live Seven" was filmed on a holiday,

161
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:31,584
we got to come and watch the program being shot live!

162
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:33,085
Yep.

163
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:38,984
Come to think of it, we didn't have breakfast yet.

164
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,184
If it's okay with you,

165
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,684
why don't we have breakfast at the restaurant at this TV station?

166
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,284
That sounds good!

167
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:47,984
Then, please go ahead and wait for me there!

168
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:50,284
I have someone I want you to meet, Mr. Mouri.

169
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:52,285
So I'll make a call now.

170
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:05,484
Sorry for the call, this is Okino. Were you sleeping?

171
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:08,084
What's the matter, Conan?

172
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:10,884
No, it's nothing.

173
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,484
This is bad.

174
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,584
Whenever I see somebody using the cell phone,

175
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:18,185
it immediately brings back memories of Vermouth.

176
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,684
The e-mail address of the of the boss of the Black Organization

177
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,484
who shrunk my body with a drug.

178
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:28,285
That melody, "Seven Kids"...

179
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:36,084
That e-mail address is one that you should never open

180
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,884
since it's Pandora's box.

181
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:39,984
Yes... I know.

182
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:41,485
Really?

183
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:44,084
Maybe I should've made Japanese omelette rice.

184
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,084
Mr. Mouri!

185
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,685
Thank you for waiting!

186
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:51,884
Yes...

187
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,884
Huh? If I remember correctly,

188
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,484
you're usually sitting on the side of the screen

189
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,384
on the "Sunday Night News".

190
00:14:57,385 --> 00:15:00,585
Yes! She's Announcer, Rena Mizunashi!

191
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,085
Nice meeting you.

192
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:09,685
I'm the Famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri!

193
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:13,484
I'm his daughter, Ran.

194
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:14,984
This is Conan.

195
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:16,384
Hello!

196
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,884
Pleased to meet you.

197
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:19,185
Come on!

198
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:25,184
Hey, Yoko?

199
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,584
Are you serious about discussing something like that

200
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:29,484
to a famed detective?

201
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:30,884
Don't worry!

202
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:33,984
I'm sure that Mr. Mouri will be able to work something out!

203
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:35,184
But...

204
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,884
Is something bothering you?

205
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:39,284
Yes.

206
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:42,384
Come on, Yoko...

207
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:45,084
Ring... Ring the bell and run away?

208
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:48,384
Are you asking me to catch the one who is doing that for you?

209
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:50,584
See... It's rude to ask him something like that, after all!

210
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:53,784
But it doesn't seem to be just a simple prank.

211
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:56,284
What do you mean?

212
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,484
Well...

213
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:00,684
The person rings the bell only early in the morning on Saturdays.

214
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:05,384
I was waiting again today in hopes of finding out who was doing it

215
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:06,985
but when I opened the door...

216
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:10,784
as soon as I heard the doorbell rang,

217
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:14,285
there was no one in sight anywhere.

218
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:20,084
-No way! -I've been afraid to open the door since then.

219
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:23,284
You mean it happened where you live?

220
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:26,884
Yes. At my condominium in Haido-cho.

221
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:27,984
If it's okay with you,

222
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,884
why don't you have Mr. Mouri go over to your place

223
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:32,584
and check things out?

224
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:36,184
I can't go because I have work after this but...

225
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:38,384
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

226
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:39,485
What?

227
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:47,984
There's nowhere for people to hide near the door.

228
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:48,985
Yeah.

229
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:52,385
Why don't we try ringing the doorbell then?

230
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,884
Are you ready?

231
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,685
Then, I'm going to ring the doorbell.

232
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,184
Dad?

233
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:13,785
Are you all right?

234
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:17,884
Yes, sort of...

235
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:21,984
But now we know that there's practically no time to hide.

236
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:25,484
Yeah. Could you tell me more about it inside?

237
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:28,084
Sure. Please come in.

238
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:29,485
Sorry for intruding.

239
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,184
Let me get you slippers.

240
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,884
I don't need slippers. Thank you.

241
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:37,984
Of course, there're no slippers for kid!

242
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:39,884
Thank you!

243
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,784
This way, please.

244
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,185
Sorry for intruding.

245
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:49,285
You sure have a lot of locks, don't you?

246
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:53,384
Really. You got four locks all together.

247
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:55,984
Living alone as a woman could be a bit dangerous.

248
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:58,184
Well, I guess so.

249
00:17:58,185 --> 00:17:59,684
Would you like something to drink?

250
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,384
Coffee, please.

251
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:03,384
I'll help you!

252
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:04,485
Okay!

253
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:11,684
I guess I'll set a wiretap to pick up the sound at the front entrance

254
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:15,184
when the doorbell rings.

255
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:18,784
I'll set it up on the wall outside the door.

256
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:21,185
If I put it here, I can easily retrieve it later.

257
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,084
Just in case it peels off and gets lost,

258
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:29,185
I'll wrap this transmitter in the chewing gum too.

259
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,085
Okay, all set!

260
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:45,084
Just now...

261
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:47,485
Just now, I feel like I was being watched by someone.

262
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:50,185
Conan?

263
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:52,884
Will juice be okay?

264
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:54,184
Oh, yep!

265
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:55,484
Is anything the matter?

266
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:57,584
No, it's nothing.

267
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,985
Okay then, juice for you.

268
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,184
Is it just my imagination?

269
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,285
Or...

270
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:18,184
So somebody's been ringing your doorbell from two months ago.

271
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:22,984
Yes. It happens every Saturday at around 6:30 am since then.

272
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:25,585
Did something happen two months ago?

273
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:28,184
The only thing I remember is that,

274
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:31,084
I was shifted from the program "Morning Live Seven"

275
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,884
to "Sunday Night News".

276
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:35,584
Although I'm not the main announcer for either program.

277
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:39,384
You got to know Ms. Yoko doing "Morning Live Seven", then?

278
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:42,384
Yes. We were both working the program

279
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:45,484
on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

280
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,884
If so, the prank could've started being played on you

281
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:50,484
since two months ago.

282
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:53,884
Yes. Because when I was still doing "Morning Live seven",

283
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:56,484
I used to leave for work at 4 am on Saturday.

284
00:19:56,485 --> 00:20:00,184
Is the prank being played on you throughout the two months?

285
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:02,784
It is. Every Saturday.

286
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,585
Oh! But there was just one time that nothing happened.

287
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:12,184
I was abroad the week before last from Monday to Friday to cover news.

288
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:16,284
On the Saturday, a day after I came home, nothing happened.

289
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:20,585
It could be that I was tired and couldn't hear the doorbell, though.

290
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:24,684
And on the Tuesday after the three day holiday in October,

291
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:26,185
the same prank was played.

292
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,484
That was the only day the prank was played on Tuesday, though.

293
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:34,384
And just once there was something weird outside the door.

294
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:36,284
Something weird?

295
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,484
A bottle with some drug inside was found outside the door.

296
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:42,084
I had a doctor acquaintance check it after that

297
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:44,484
and found out that it was a sleeping drug.

298
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:46,284
Sleeping drug?

299
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:49,184
It's a stalker.

300
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:51,984
It's probably a warning that he's planning to put you to sleep

301
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,484
and do evil things to you.

302
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,684
No way.

303
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:57,784
Did you notice anything else left by the door?

304
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:59,784
Besides the sleeping drug.

305
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:01,485
Something else?

306
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:05,484
What is it?

307
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:06,984
Around three nights ago,

308
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,884
it seems that someone was in the house next door

309
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,784
that is supposedly vacant.

310
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:11,984
What?

311
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:14,884
Three nights ago is Tuesday, right?

312
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:17,484
Yes. At a little before midnight,

313
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,185
I finished taking a bath and was relaxing on the bed.

314
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:34,284
I thought next door was supposed to be vacant

315
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:36,085
so I take a look from the veranda.

316
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:43,184
It was pitch dark next door,

317
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:46,085
so I thought that the sound came from outside.

318
00:21:56,585 --> 00:22:00,184
So I called the management company in the morning

319
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,085
but I was told, "You must've been dreaming".

320
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:08,585
There's a high chance that the man is a stalker.

321
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:14,284
That man had the spare key to the house next door.

322
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:16,284
Not only three nights ago,

323
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:19,484
but especially on Friday nights he slept in the house next door.

324
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:23,084
And the following day, he rang your doorbell.

325
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:25,084
I see. If it's the house next door,

326
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:28,284
he can hide right after ringing the doorbell.

327
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:33,184
That's why you couldn't find the culprit.

328
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,684
Since when was the house next door vacant?

329
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:40,885
Probably from about six months ago, I think.

330
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,984
Just as I thought, it's locked.

331
00:22:47,985 --> 00:22:52,684
We may be able to get clues on the man if we go inside.

00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:56,284
Why don't we call the management company and have them open the door?

333
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:58,484
But from the feeling I got last time,

334
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:00,485
I don't think that they'll help at all.

335
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:25,285
No good.

336
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:49,584
"Ki-Mi-Wa."

337
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:53,285
"Ki-Mi-Wa"?
