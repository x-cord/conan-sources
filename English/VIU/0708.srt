1
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,725
On Sunday, right after summer vacation...

2
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:12,725
it was after we went to watch a movie with Dr. Agasa.

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:17,525
It's 2:00 pm sharp!

4
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:20,525
I just saw the clock strike 2:00 pm.

5
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:23,258
Yes, yes, how lucky of you.

6
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:25,558
Genta, your voice is too loud.

7
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:30,358
Hey, look at that! On top of the building!

8
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:32,558
What is it now?

9
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,858
Could they be fighting?

10
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,358
What a dangerous thing to do in a place like that.

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,658
He's been pushed off!

12
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:05,758
Aim for a 100% solution.

13
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:08,358
Clear all mysteries and codes.

14
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:10,458
Falling slowly, a strange phenomenon.

15
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,658
An unthinkable mystery that moves time.

16
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:14,158
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,058
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:18,158
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,666
"The Man Who Fell Slowly".

20
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:14,166
Excuse me.

21
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,466
Is the person who reported this is here?

22
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,666
Yes, it's me.

23
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,866
I happened to pass by here, on my way back from shopping.

24
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:40,266
That's why I called 911 right away.

25
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,766
I see.

26
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,666
That's strange.

27
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,666
Hey, sir!

28
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,966
He didn't commit suicide.

29
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,466
It's not an accident either.

30
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:52,366
Somebody pushed him off the roof.

31
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,666
What?

32
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,366
I'm Sakai, a paramedic from Beika.

33
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:01,066
About the fall accident I reported just a while ago,

34
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:04,266
there's a possibility of it being an attempted murder.

35
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,566
Yes.

36
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:09,466
The victim is Mr. Masaaki Ogata, age 37.

37
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,166
He resides in Central Beika City.

38
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,866
Miss.

39
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,766
You called the ambulance

40
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:17,566
at about 2:10, right?

41
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:19,866
Yes, at 2:10 sharp.

42
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:25,466
It's only been five to six minutes since the ambulance got here, right?

43
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:29,266
And right now, it just about 2:20 pm.

44
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,366
The estimated time it takes for the ambulance

45
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:35,466
to arrive at the scene is about five to six minutes.

46
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:37,066
The approximate time of the call was made

47
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:40,066
can be calculated by subtraction.

48
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:42,066
I see.

49
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,766
Wait.

50
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:46,566
We saw the man being pushed off...

51
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:47,566
That's right.

52
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,466
At 2:00 pm sharp.

53
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:50,466
Yeah.

54
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:54,166
In other words, it was a long fall that took 10 minutes to hit the ground.

55
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,066
And this building is only five stories tall.

56
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,366
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

57
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,566
Was this building that low?

58
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:05,766
No. It looked at least five stories tall.

59
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,566
-Hey. -Wait.

60
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:13,766
Hey, wait. There's an elevator.

61
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,666
But look at it.

62
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,766
"Out of order" -It's out of order.

63
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:27,066
He must've fallen right around down here.

64
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,766
I see, so that's how it is.

65
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,466
The first two floors are protruded

66
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,066
and there is a veranda on the third floor.

67
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,166
I see.

68
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,566
The man who was pushed off from here,

69
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:42,366
fell onto that veranda.

70
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:45,466
Then, he fell from there to the ground.

71
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,166
That's why it took 10 minutes.

72
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,166
Poor thing that he had to fall twice.

73
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,766
Anyway, let's go search inside the building.

74
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,666
According to the lady a while ago,

75
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,766
nobody came out of this building.

76
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:01,366
More than 10 minutes have passed already.

77
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,366
Maybe the culprit got away from the backdoor.

78
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,466
Backdoor!

79
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:07,866
A clue to the culprit maybe left there.

80
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,166
I'll go over that way!

81
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,166
-Okay! -Okay!

82
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,266
Hey, you guys!

83
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:16,266
In that case, we'll go check out that veranda.

84
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:20,266
From that location, it's this room you'll end up with.

85
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,566
"Ogata Finance" -Ogata Finance?

86
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,466
If I'm not mistaken, the victim was...

87
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:28,666
The victim is Mr. Masaaki Ogata, age 37.

88
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,966
Maybe this is his office.

89
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:33,266
A money lender?

90
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:35,266
Hey, Shinichi.

91
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:38,066
So, this is where the crime took place.

92
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,066
What?

93
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,166
"Out of order" -What?

94
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,666
After we found the backdoor...

95
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,366
It's chain locked, which means...

96
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:52,766
The culprit didn't flee from this backdoor.

97
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:54,766
If so, than where on earth did he escaped?

98
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,966
It seems that they were fighting.

99
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:05,366
I don't think it's good to go inside on your own.

100
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,766
A driver's license?

101
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:12,166
Ryohei Honda.

102
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,266
Since this is on the sofa that's toppled,

103
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,866
one the victim was struggling with must've been him.

104
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,066
Maybe he's the culprit.

105
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,566
We don't know that yet.

106
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,666
Hey, you guys.

107
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,866
The emergency stairs.

108
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,866
I'm sure that the culprit

109
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,666
ran down to the emergency stairs from the third floor and fled.

110
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,166
It's muddy here.

111
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,166
There are no footprints or what so ever here.

112
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,566
That can't be.

113
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:44,266
If the culprit neither used the front door nor the backdoor,

114
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,866
or even the emergency stairs,

115
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,266
where on earth did the culprit flee from?

116
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:52,266
No, there could be no other way.

117
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,466
Which means

118
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,766
the culprit is still inside this building.

119
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,166
He's hiding!

120
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,066
Then, I'll call Conan.

121
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,066
No.

122
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,566
Mitsuhiko?

123
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,066
Are you saying that we're looking for

124
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,666
the culprit who's hiding on our own?

125
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:10,966
-This is... -Yes. Drag marks.

126
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,466
And blood stains, too.

127
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:16,066
It seems that the culprit

128
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:20,166
dragged the victim who fell from the roof into the room once.

129
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,466
And then pushed him off again from here.

130
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,966
Glasses.

131
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:27,366
It resembles the one that the owner of the driver's license,

132
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,966
Honda was wearing.

133
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:33,066
It was found outside on the veranda, which means

134
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,666
as he was pushed off the roof,

135
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:40,166
the victim Mr. Ogata tore it off from the culprit.

136
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,666
If those glasses are unmistakably belong to the man called Honda,

137
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,466
then we've got the culprit already.

138
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,266
I guess there's nothing for us to do.

139
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:49,766
But if the culprit was planning to push him off again,

140
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:55,666
why did he drag Mr. Ogata back into the room?

141
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,966
For what?

142
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:06,166
Are you the ones who witnessed Masaaki Ogata being pushed off?

143
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,966
But you shouldn't be in here on your own.

144
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,166
Not whilst accompanied by Mr. Agasa.

145
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,866
I'm very sorry.

146
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,266
Since you're here from headquarters,

147
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:18,166
it goes to show that Mr. Ogata is no ordinary citizen, right?

148
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,966
He's a notorious loan shark.

149
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,066
Chiba!

150
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:26,566
There are glasses outside on the veranda.

151
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,166
And this, too.

152
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,866
A driver's license?

153
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:31,766
Ryohei Honda?

154
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:36,066
Ryohei Honda...

155
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:39,366
It seems that these glasses are his too.

156
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,366
Yeah.

157
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:44,866
There seems to be no doubt that he came here and had it out with Ogata.

158
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:47,366
We'll have the district police to check it out for now.

159
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,666
Okay.

160
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:52,766
Okay, I'll go check the roof, then.

161
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,966
Okay.

162
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,166
I think it's better to tell the police

163
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,266
that the culprit is still inside this building

164
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,166
rather than look for him ourselves.

165
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,566
Let's do all that we can on our own first.

166
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,966
Mitsuhiko.

167
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:11,066
I'm vexed at myself!

168
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,566
Only if we'd have been more observant,

169
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:16,366
maybe we could've identified the culprit.

170
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,866
Mitsuhiko.

171
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,166
Okay.

172
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,266
I'll go search upstairs.

173
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,466
I'll go to the basement.

174
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:24,966
Launch search!

175
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,166
"Ogata Finance"

176
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,366
Yes, this is Takagi.

177
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:34,966
What? The whereabouts of Ryohei Honda is unknown?

178
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,966
Okay. I got it. Good work.

179
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,666
It seems that he went out without telling anyone where he was going

180
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,966
and hasn't returned home after leaving his residence after noon.

181
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:47,766
He seems to have run into his old acquaintance yesterday

182
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:51,966
and went out to see that person.

183
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,666
That's the report we got. It seems conclusive already.

184
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,366
But it still bothers me.

185
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:01,366
Why was the body dragged back into the room?

186
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,866
Oh, no.

187
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:08,066
"Komehana Boots Shop" -Boots?

188
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,966
Nothing strange about it, right?

189
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,366
It's raining.

190
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,866
But this receipt is last night's.

191
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:16,766
The weather forecast yesterday said that it would be a fine day today.

192
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:20,466
"Ogata Finance"

193
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,666
He's not here in this room either.

194
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,466
He wasn't hiding anywhere upstairs!

195
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:31,566
That was really fast. Did you really check carefully?

196
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,766
For sure.

197
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,666
You guys.

198
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,866
What was that scream just now?

199
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:38,166
It's Ayumi!

200
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,166
She said she was going to check the basement.

201
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,666
Hey, Ayumi!

202
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,366
Ayumi.

203
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,866
Ayumi, are you all right?

204
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,266
Ms. Yoshida!

205
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,666
Are you okay? Ayumi!

206
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,466
A mouse...

207
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,666
I'm glad you weren't bitten.

208
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:02,266
Rather, thank God you weren't caught by the culprit.

209
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,566
Yeah.

210
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:06,066
There's no chance that Honda would still be here.

211
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:07,066
Who's Honda?

212
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,366
-You've already know who the culprit is? -You know about the culprit?

213
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:11,666
Well, no.

214
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,166
There's only one car,

215
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,366
so does that mean it belongs to that man?

216
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,066
Is something matter?

217
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,366
-Boots? -Yeah.

218
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,466
Together with something else that's bothering me.

219
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:26,466
A shovel?

220
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:29,666
The way these two things would be utilized is...

221
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,866
It's pretty limited.

222
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:35,166
"Out of order" -No clue on the roof.

223
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,966
Is there anyone here?

224
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,766
This is the police.

225
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:46,066
If anyone is here, please answer me.

226
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:57,366
Who is Honda?

227
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,366
You know him too, don't you?

228
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:01,766
So, nothing's conclusive yet.

229
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,166
Yes, Takagi here.

230
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,066
Oh, it's you, Chiba.

231
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:11,466
Caught? Who is it?

232
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,666
Me. I was caught by the culprit.

233
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,466
What? The culprit?

234
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:24,432
I didn't ask you to come.

235
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:27,432
I just asked for a get-away car.

236
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,832
It was you after all, Honda?

237
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,932
So he's the guy called Honda.

238
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:36,232
The culprit was still inside this building after all.

239
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,032
-Yes. -Right.

240
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:41,232
Why'd he do something like this?

241
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:42,932
Why'd you do it, Honda?

242
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:46,332
Why'd you kill Ogata?

243
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,032
Who are you?

244
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:49,932
Did you forget me?

245
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:52,432
I don't remember anything!

246
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,832
It seems he's got amnesia.

247
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:58,632
Amnesia?

248
00:13:58,632 --> 00:14:00,732
That's why he did this.

249
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:02,732
Honda, listen to me.

250
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:05,932
You're not the type of person that do something like this.

251
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:09,332
I arrested you eight years ago

252
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,332
for alleged robbery.

253
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:13,632
I committed a robbery?

254
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:14,732
Yeah.

255
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:18,932
With a guy you happened to run into at a pub.

256
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:22,632
But the only clue that we had was that your accomplice had a hoarse voice

257
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:24,932
and that wasn't enough to nab him,

258
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,432
so you ended up serving time alone.

259
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,832
But after completing your sentence,

260
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:32,232
you changed into a fine man!

261
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:33,732
Not only that.

262
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:36,332
After taking your father's small factory,

263
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:41,032
you took in people who had criminal records like you as factory workers

264
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:43,332
and supported them.

265
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:46,132
I did something like that?

266
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,132
He's a very good man.

267
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,832
-Yes. -Yeah.

268
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:53,732
Why would somebody like you go back to commit another crime?

269
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:56,032
What's your connection with Ogata?

270
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:57,932
Yes, a connection.

271
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,232
Between this man and the victim.

272
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,632
Come to think of it, a while ago...

273
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:06,532
He seems to have run into old acquaintance yesterday

274
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,832
and went out to see that person.

275
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:12,832
If that's case...

276
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:25,632
I got it. So, that's how it was.

277
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:29,332
Honda, what went on between you and Ogata?

278
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:30,432
I've been trying to tell you.

279
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:32,732
I don't know what on earth is going on.

280
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,432
Where am I?

281
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:47,832
It seems that I had it out with someone over there.

282
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:56,632
I... I pushed him down from here?

283
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:59,632
I was afraid of getting caught.

284
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:03,132
But I had a headache and felt faint.

285
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,332
I figured out that I should hide myself.

286
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,732
When I finally thought that I could somehow manage to move...

287
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:17,432
"Out of order" -No clue on the roof.

288
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:19,332
Is there anyone here?

289
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:20,932
This is the police.

290
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:23,432
Police?

291
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,532
I didn't want to get caught.

292
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:30,732
But why did I try to kill him to begin with?

293
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,532
If he doesn't know,

294
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:35,232
there's no way anyone else would know.

295
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:38,532
So, there's no other way than for a detective to solve it for him.

296
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,432
Why did I try to kill that man?

297
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:45,132
You're wrong, Mr. Honda.

298
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:49,132
Didn't you come to visit Masaaki Ogata

299
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:51,932
because he was an old acquaintance of yours?

300
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:54,032
Old acquaintance?

301
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:55,332
Officer Takagi,

302
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:59,732
I think that Masaaki Ogata had a hoarse voice.

303
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,932
Yes, a very gruff one.

304
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,632
Can't you remember, Mr. Honda?

305
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,332
It's the man with a hoarse voice.

306
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:10,332
You became acquainted with that man eight years ago at a pub.

307
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,432
It couldn't be.

308
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,132
Eight years ago,

309
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:17,232
a man with a hoarse voice.

310
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:19,732
I got to know him at a pub.

311
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:23,332
A man with a hoarse voice...

312
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:24,932
It's him!

313
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:27,132
He looked completely different,

314
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,132
but his voice...

315
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:34,932
I'll collect the money from you even I have to go to hell!

316
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:36,932
You get that?

317
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,732
What's with you?

318
00:17:42,532 --> 00:17:44,632
It's you after all.

319
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,732
It's true it's been eight years ago,

320
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:52,232
but the statute of limitations hasn't run out yet.

321
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,232
So you're telling me to turn myself in?

322
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:55,732
If you pay for your sins,

323
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,232
you can live your life under the sun

324
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:59,932
without feeling guilty towards anyone, right?

325
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,432
I was somehow trying to get him to turn himself in.

326
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:09,532
He's a good person after all, isn't he?

327
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:10,532
But...

328
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,132
That good man ended up...

329
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,532
So how'd you end up killing Ogata, then?

330
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:17,632
I don't remember that part.

331
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:19,832
It's the other way around.

332
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,632
Since you knew the wrongdoings of the past,

333
00:18:23,632 --> 00:18:25,932
Masaaki Ogata tried to get rid of you.

334
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:27,132
After killing you,

335
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:29,432
he was probably planning to take your body to the remote mountains

336
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:31,032
to bury and hide it.

337
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,632
After making preparations to do so,

338
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,932
he called you over to come to your office that was empty

339
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:36,532
because it was a holiday.

340
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,032
Ogata carried out his scheme.

341
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,932
But he failed to kill you.

342
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:47,932
So he ended up pushing you off the roof.

343
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,432
Which means that when we saw it...

344
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,132
The one who was pushed down...

345
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:57,832
Was Mr. Honda?

346
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:02,732
Then Mr. Honda, who Ogata was ready to finish off

347
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:05,232
was dragged back into the office.

348
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:09,532
As proof of this... See? His jacket is soiled.

349
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:11,832
But the one who fell to the ground

350
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:13,932
was the one called Ogata.

351
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:15,332
Exactly.

352
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:16,932
However back then,

353
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:19,032
Mr. Honda had incurred a severe blow to his head

354
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,832
that was bad enough to cause amnesia and passed out.

355
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:25,132
So he couldn't have pushed Masaaki Ogata down.

356
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:28,432
If so, there's only one plausible explanation.

357
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:31,232
Masaaki Ogata, after finishing his target off,

358
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:35,232
was scheming to bury and hide him as planned.

359
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:36,432
In order to do so,

360
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:40,432
he had to hide traces of Mr. Honda coming over.

361
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:47,832
I've got to get rid of that too.

362
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:49,832
Where's his glasses?

363
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:51,132
Are they here?

364
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:55,732
There it is.

365
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:59,532
However, he was leaning on a really slippery surface.

366
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,032
Back then... Remember?

367
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:14,532
In other words, it was not that one person was pushed off twice,

368
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:17,832
but two people switched places partway

369
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:20,832
in a matter of 10 minutes.

370
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:24,832
So that's the truth behind the long fall.

371
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:31,932
What a bummer.

372
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:36,732
Honda.

373
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:40,732
It may be true that you did nothing

374
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:43,532
as far as Masaaki Ogata is concerned.

375
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:46,932
But you attacked and went as far as to confine Officer Chiba.

376
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:48,232
But Inspector...

377
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:50,132
That's a fact.

378
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:52,132
Inspector.

379
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:54,132
You'll have to come with me.

380
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:55,232
Yes, sir.

381
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:57,132
I feel sorry for him.

382
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,232
-Yeah. -Yeah.

383
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:00,532
Conan.

384
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:04,232
There's nothing I can do about it.

385
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:07,232
He may have panicked after losing his memory,

386
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,932
but he did what he did and that's fact.

387
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:11,532
Besides,

388
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:15,132
I think he understands more than anyone else does.

389
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:18,032
I'm sorry for troubling you.

390
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:19,432
Not at all.

391
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:22,232
Never mind the handcuffs.

392
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,032
I'm asking him to come along voluntarily.

393
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,432
But before that, let's take you to the hospital.

394
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:31,432
Let's have them treat your head wound, Mr. Honda.

395
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,832
Masaaki Ogata was arrested

396
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:35,832
under charges of the robbery that was committed eight years ago,

397
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:39,832
as well as the attempted murder against Mr. Honda soon after the incident.

398
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,232
Both of the charges were dropped shortly.

399
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:08,432
Dr. Agasa, you really did a good job again this time too, didn't you?

400
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:10,332
-For sure. -Yes.

401
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:12,332
Well, I guess so.

402
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:16,032
A rainbow.

403
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:20,132
-Splendid. -It's pretty!

404
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,532
I knew that things would turn out this way to begin with.

405
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,832
That the incident would start at 2:00,

406
00:23:25,832 --> 00:23:27,132
that is, it would start out like the movie "The Double Hour"

407
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:29,832
but end up happily like when one views a double rainbow.

408
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:31,632
Another one of his puns.

409
00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:33,532
I went out of my way to compliment him.

410
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:35,132
All down the drain.

411
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,132
Another punch line with a long decent.

412
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:39,932
What a far-fetched analogy.

413
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,632
It's like always.

414
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:44,932
"Next Episode" -What seems to be matter?

415
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:50,232
That's the concept of the design plan

416
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:52,532
that Mr. Murase showed to Mr. Inomata.

417
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,032
I think it would be more accurate to say that

418
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,132
this is not an accident, but rather a homicide.

419
00:23:57,132 --> 00:24:00,932
However, why was Mr. Inomata there?

420
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:01,932
This is...

421
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:09,232
Next Conan,

422
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:11,332
"Unidentified Impact".

423
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:31,232
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,132
"Cable tie".

425
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:34,632
-A guitar. -A bass.

426
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,232
-And drums. -Who's the vocalist?

427
00:24:36,232 --> 00:24:38,032
No band here.
