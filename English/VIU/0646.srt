1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:05,759
But Ran, you really are unrivaled!

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,559
Having won the Kanto Karate championship and all!

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,459
It was all thanks to the "Rounding Heel Kick"

4
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:14,759
my elder, Kazuha taught me!

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,059
I feel sorry for her opponent.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,259
Well then, today I'll treat you

7
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:21,659
to the cake buffet at Haido Hotel as promised,

8
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,259
so eat and get stronger!

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,759
I'll be sure to eat a lot and get super strong!

10
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:29,759
Won't you get fat instead?

11
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,159
If all the cases are men,

12
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,959
all hidden mysteries are women.

13
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,959
Could he be Shinichi's new rival?

14
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,159
A handsome mysterious detective appears!

15
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,759
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,459
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:02,759
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

18
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:31,582
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 1)"

19
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,399
So?

20
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:36,499
What did Shinichi say?

21
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:39,099
When you told him about your victory...

22
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,799
you also gave him your answer to that, right?

23
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:43,099
What answer?

24
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,899
The answer to that guy's confession in London!

25
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,899
I did inform him about my victory, but...

26
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:53,399
not my reply to that.

27
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:56,399
Since I also only reported my victory through email,

28
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:59,699
I guess I just feel uneasy talking to him directly.

29
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,199
What the Flipping Heck, Lady?

30
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,699
Don't you realize how many days it's been since then?

31
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:08,499
Well, how many days?

32
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:10,799
I bet Shinichi is now like that.

33
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,799
Oh, Ran, why hasn't she responded to my feelings?

34
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,799
Don't tell me she has someone else in her heart?

35
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,999
Oh, no, if that's the case, I'm doomed!

36
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,699
No choice but to cry!

37
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,399
Cry until these tears are used up!

38
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,599
He's probably depressed with those thoughts.

39
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,199
No way.

40
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,599
Come on, you think I'm like that?

41
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,999
If you take it too slow,

42
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,999
Shinichi may have a change of heart!

43
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,899
His attitude is kind of...

44
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:42,199
but he's surprisingly popular, see?

45
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,999
"Kind of"?

46
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:49,699
One day, a powerful rival suddenly appear you know.

47
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:54,099
Pervert! This guy's a groper!

48
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,599
No, I'm not..

49
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,599
Don't act all innocent!

50
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,799
You touched my butt just now!

51
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,799
Ran, it's payback time!

52
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:03,899
Wait.

53
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,899
I'm done for, if I get hit!

54
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,999
As expected of Kanto's champ.

55
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,899
Great moves!

56
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,699
Jeet Kune Do!

57
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,099
Ran.

58
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,699
Sonoko, stay back.

59
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:32,999
This pervert is strong.

60
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,899
Oh, if you would let me explain!

61
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,199
I'm absolutely...

62
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,399
This person's not a pervert!

63
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,599
Because I saw it!

64
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,299
I saw how that person seized the hand responsible

65
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,299
for touching Sonoko's butt.

66
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:52,099
And then that's why Sonoko mistook that person's hand.

67
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,099
For, this.

68
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,099
No.

69
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:56,899
So the pervert...

70
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,099
was you?

71
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,699
I'm so sorry!

72
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,799
Forgive me!

73
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:11,599
Never show yourself again, idiot!

74
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:13,999
I'm so sorry!

75
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,599
I almost kicked you without even making sure.

76
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,299
No problem, no problem!

77
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:21,299
I'm just glad we've cleared up our misunderstanding.

78
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:23,799
On second look, what a hot guy!

79
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,899
Besides...

80
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,699
Since you're my type,

81
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,899
I'll forgive you.

82
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,699
What the heck was that?

83
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,799
The pervert's victim was me, you know.

84
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,399
I'm joking.

85
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,899
Where you headed?

86
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:40,599
To Haido Hotel.

87
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,199
What a coincidence!

88
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,899
I'm headed to that hotel too.

89
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,699
Are you really?

90
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,299
You'd better not be making that up, jerk!

91
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:53,699
Thank you for earlier, little boy!

92
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,899
"Haido Hotel"

93
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,699
Oh, no? You have no vacancies?

94
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,499
How come? I made a reservation, you know!

95
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:06,499
My sincere apologies.

96
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,899
We should have declined,

97
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,999
but our oversight caused the problem.

98
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:13,399
Well, it sure seems he really has some business with the hotel.

99
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,799
Then, any other rooms available?

100
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,499
About that...

101
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,299
We are currently renovating our hotel annex,

102
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:22,799
so we have fewer rooms available and are now all occupied.

103
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,399
Isn't there anything you can do?

104
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,899
Say, let's hurry and go eat some cake.

105
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,799
I'm really hungry.

106
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,399
All right.

107
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,699
Still, isn't he so cool?

108
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,899
And as strong as you, Ran!

109
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:41,999
If he fought with Makoto, I wonder who would be stronger at Karate?

110
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,299
That wasn't Karate.

111
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:46,099
That was Jeet Kune Do.

112
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,299
"Jeet Kune Do"

113
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:49,999
Movie star Bruce Lee

114
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:52,599
took the art of Kung Fu he had been practicing as a child.

115
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,799
And combined it with boxing, judo, wrestling,

116
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:58,099
savate, aikido and other forms of fighting

117
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,599
to develop this martial art!

118
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,299
But, it has a number of attacks that target vital points

119
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:05,499
such as the eyes and throat, so it's pretty fierce.

120
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:08,699
As usual, you know all kinds of weird things!

121
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,799
Regardless, where are they having the cake buffet?

122
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,499
We've come to a place where there's somehow nobody around.

123
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:21,299
On the net, it says it's at the cafe on the second floor.

124
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:24,399
Then, let's go to the second floor and take a look!

125
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,599
There are elevators over there.

126
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,399
Oh, where are you going, little boy?

127
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,999
To the cake buffet on the second floor.

128
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:37,099
Then, you can't get there using this elevator.

129
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,299
This one goes to the annex.

130
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,599
The annex?

131
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,399
But didn't they say the annex was under renovation?

132
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,399
Sorry for troubling you.

133
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,699
No problem.

134
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,899
We should help each other when in need!

135
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,899
Mrs. Hirukawa!

136
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,999
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

137
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,299
How'd it go with him?

138
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:04,299
At first he was drunk and shouting curses as usual, but...

139
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:07,199
After I scolded him severely, he started crying.

140
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,099
He cried?

141
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,099
Yeah.

142
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,499
He said that, after he had sobered up,

143
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:13,399
he'd apologize to everyone and admit his sins,

144
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,199
so he'd like us to go to his room.

145
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,099
Really, now?

146
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,299
But could he just be planning to spew nonsense

147
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,099
to dodge our question?

148
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,199
In order to get us off his back.

149
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,599
Good point. He might say that

150
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,799
he doesn't remember saying anything of the sort

151
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,199
if we ask him about it later on.

152
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,899
Then, why don't we record this repentance?

153
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:38,799
That way, the other victims could hear it as well.

154
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,899
But, I don't have any recording devices with me.

155
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,299
Me neither.

156
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,499
In that case, let's take my car

157
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:48,599
and the three of us can buy one!

158
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:52,699
Since he said it'd be a while before he sobered up.

159
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,399
And we should be able to find

160
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,999
at least one electronics shop in this area, right?

161
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:58,299
You're right.

162
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,799
No way! You're cutting off the line for the cake buffet?

163
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:07,599
Yes. More customers than we'd expected came,

164
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,899
"Cake Buffet Now Closed" -so there weren't enough cakes.

165
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,599
If you're going to hold a cake buffet,

166
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:13,099
you should prepare a whole lot and go out with a bang!

167
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,699
A bang!

168
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,499
What was that sound just now?

169
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,299
Could be the parking lot?

170
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:29,799
Hold on!

171
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,299
This is bad.

172
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:38,299
Call an ambulance!

173
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,099
What just happened?

174
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,999
We were just backing up the car

175
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,499
when this man fell from above!

176
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,099
Isn't this...

177
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:54,599
Him?

178
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,699
It is! It's Uesumi!

179
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,699
What's the matter?

180
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,999
Hold on, who's that over there?

181
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:05,099
Someone suspicious was on the roof just now!

182
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:06,099
What?

183
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,999
Do you remember what that person looked like?

184
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,999
I saw the clothes.

185
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:16,199
It might have been an acquaintance.

186
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,099
Ran, call the police

187
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,099
and keep watch over this place with the security guard!

188
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,499
-What? -I'm going with these people

189
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:24,399
to the roof to take a look!

190
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:35,599
So this elevator has both front and rear doors?

191
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,799
What are you doing, Mrs. Hirukawa?

192
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,899
Can't I just stay here?

193
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,599
I'm so scared.

194
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,999
No way!

195
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:46,699
You're the one who saw them, Mrs. Hirukawa!

196
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,899
Shoes on top of a jacket.

197
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,199
Then, suicide?

198
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:06,599
Then, what was the person's shadow that Mrs. Hirukawa saw?

199
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,899
The jacket flapping in the wind.

200
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,399
Maybe that's what I saw.

201
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,599
It's all my fault.

202
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:17,799
I pushed him too hard with my words.

203
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,499
No, this was most likely...

204
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,399
A murder.

205
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
Isn't that right?

206
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,599
Conan?

207
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,700
Murder, you say?

208
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,000
Are you saying you saw someone push him off from here?

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
No.

210
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,400
I just happened to overhear your conversation stating that

211
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,800
the man who fell to his death was quite drunk.

212
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,600
Due to my line of work, my ears are quite good.

213
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,500
Your line of work?

214
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,200
But, why isn't this a suicide?

215
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Look, his shoes are lined up properly.

216
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,700
That's just a preconception, you know?

217
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,200
I've seen innumerable jumper suicide scenes up until now, but...

218
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,500
Just about none of the bodies had been shoeless.

219
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,100
You've seen innumerable jumper suicide scenes?

220
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,900
Well, I guess the most influential theory

221
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,700
would be that it's a key plot device in movies or TV dramas?

222
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,900
"If you see shoes lined up on a roof, it's most likely suicide."

223
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,600
It would be a convenience condition

224
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,800
for dramas to strike that chord emotionally.

225
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
Nowadays not so much, but...

226
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,300
The same goes for detective dramas in the past

227
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,500
that would show blood gushing out of the mouths of people

228
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
who hung themselves.

229
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In reality, blood will not flow out.

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,100
But it's easier for viewers to understand the death,

231
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,900
and it has more impact.

232
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,600
Although...

233
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,200
Having seen those sorts of dramas or movies,

234
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,900
there are cases you'd think the victims

235
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,000
should remove their shoes before jumping off, but...

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,700
Seeing how the man who fell to his death

237
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,400
had been heavily intoxicated

238
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,900
and requested time to sober up.

239
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,600
In such a groggy state, there's no way

240
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,500
he'd do things such as take his jacket off

241
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,900
and place his shoes neatly atop it.

242
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,600
And even the possibility

243
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,500
that some random person placed this here as a prank...

244
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,400
Must be rejected since the shoes are directly above

245
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,000
where the man fell to his death.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So that brings us to...

247
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,900
No other conclusion but that this was a disguise jumper suicide,

248
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,700
and the culprit deliberately lined the shoes up here, see?

249
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,000
Right?

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
Little boy!

251
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,600
Then, where is the culprit?

252
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,900
I bet he'll be arrested real soon now.

253
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,800
Since, before I came up here to the roof,

254
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,900
I asked the guard to keep watch over the elevator and stairs.

255
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,800
What's all this?

256
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Who in the world are you?

257
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,500
My name is Sera.

258
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,900
Like this little boy here.

259
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm a detective.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What?

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There wasn't anyone there?

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,100
Are you saying there wasn't anyone at all

263
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,500
except this man who fell in the annex?

264
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,300
No.

265
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,200
According to the guard who had been watching the elevator and stairs,

266
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,700
you all were the only ones who had passed.

267
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,700
By the way, just who would you be?

268
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,100
A detective, it seems.

269
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,700
A detective?

270
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,000
Another one of these pain-in-the necks?

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,500
But, why was this man there?

272
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,700
The annex was under renovation, so nobody should've been there.

273
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,400
The deceased Teigo Uesumi

274
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,800
was the son of the owner of this Haido Hotel.

275
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,000
They made an exception and let him use one of the rooms,

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,600
in order to avoid the media, it seems.

277
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,200
"Media"?

278
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,100
Is that person famous?

279
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,400
Yeah, sort of. He was arrested in the past

280
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,100
for being the ringleader of a remittance scam,

281
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,300
but was acquitted on insufficient proof

282
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,800
and is now being written up about in the weeklies.

283
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,500
But the media caught wind of it,

284
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,600
and a huge uproar about it went on until last week.

285
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,700
Mr. Uesumi flew off the handle at his media interviewers.

286
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,100
And broke the sixth floor window with a fire extinguisher.

287
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,700
Because of that, guests staying in the annex reduced,

288
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,700
and even the hotel couldn't accommodate him anymore.

289
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,200
There had been rumors that they were using

290
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,900
the annex renovation as an excuse

291
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,500
to force him to move overseas.

292
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,800
Yes, we victims also heard that rumor,

293
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,700
and that's why we came to meet Uesumi.

294
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,100
Before he could flee overseas...

295
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,800
We wanted him to at least give an apology.

296
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,700
Then, were you able to see Mr. Uesumi?

297
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Yes, I was the first one to go to his room

298
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,200
but he suddenly burst into tears

299
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,300
and said that he'd admit to his crimes and apologize.

300
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,900
But said he wanted some time to sober up.

301
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,300
We thought we might as well record his repentance.

302
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,600
So the three of us decided to go

303
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,500
and buy a recording device from a nearby electronics shop.

304
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
We got into my car in the parking lot,

305
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,400
but just as we backed up...

306
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,800
He came falling right before our eyes!

307
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,300
Just as you backed up the car?

308
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,700
Inspector.

309
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,100
It might be that someone tied a string or something

310
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,000
to connect Uesumi and the car

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and as a result that caused him to fall.

312
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Was there anyone who touched your car or the body after he fell?

313
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,700
Don't know.

314
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
I don't think anyone did!

315
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,200
As soon as this lady said she saw a suspicious figure on the roof,

316
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,300
I immediately went up to the roof with her and the others!

317
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,000
And in the meantime, I told Ran and the others

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,300
to help the guards watch the car and the body.

319
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
-Right? -Yeah.

320
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,100
It seems the suspicious figure was something I mistook, though.

321
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,500
In that case, there may still be traces of some sort of contraption.

322
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,200
Inspect it thoroughly!

323
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,000
-Roger! -But, this is strange.

324
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,100
While I was waiting for the elevator,

325
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm pretty sure it stopped on the sixth and second floors.

326
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,300
It stopped?

327
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,500
When did that happen?

328
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,600
During the commotion of the man falling and all...

329
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,800
Right after this little boy

330
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,900
brought the lady and the others to the elevator

331
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,300
and headed to the roof.

332
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,300
The elevator went nonstop to the top floor

333
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,300
but took its time coming back down.

334
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,000
But, if I recall, there should have been two elevators.

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,900
It appears that only one had been working.

336
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,300
Since they figured Uesumi was the only one staying there.

337
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,200
Then, it may be that someone else is still lurking in the annex.

338
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
Yeah.

339
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,500
The investigators are searching every nook and cranny,

340
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,300
but there are no results of anyone having been found yet.

341
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,200
The surveillance cameras?

342
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,500
They're in the elevators and the hallways, right?

343
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
About that...

344
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,700
when Mr. Uesumi wreaked havoc,

345
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,500
he sprayed paint all over the hotel annex.

346
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,000
And even the surveillance cameras were all sprayed over.

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,100
They're all blacked out and nothing can be seen.

348
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,200
In short, the inside of the annex is a black box.

349
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,400
No one can tell for sure who did what inside of it.

350
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,500
This is getting to be exciting, right, sonny?

351
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,700
Please watch what you say!

352
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,100
A person just passed away, you know!

353
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,500
Oh, yes. Sorry.

354
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,100
Anyway...

355
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,600
It seems it's necessary for us to check it out.

356
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,800
The reason the elevator supposedly stopped

357
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
on the second and sixth floors.

358
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm telling you it did!

359
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,700
But even if you tell that to the police detectives...

360
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,100
Let's just tell them anyway!

361
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,600
What is it?

362
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,300
Well, you see, it's just a rumor, but...

363
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,200
They say it appears in this annex.

364
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Appears? What does?

365
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,500
A ghost, it's a ghost!

366
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,400
At night, some people seem to have seen

367
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,800
an unoccupied wheelchair that belonged to an elderly man

368
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,200
wandering around the annex!

369
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,100
It could be that ghost was the one

370
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,600
who pushed the elevator button.

371
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,300
Now see here.

372
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,900
If no one was sitting in the wheelchair,

373
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,300
how could you tell, it was an elderly man's ghost?

374
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,800
It was my father.

375
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
The one who fell victim to the remittance scam

376
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,400
was my mother.

377
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
But she collapsed due to the shock

378
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,100
and had to be hospitalized, so...

379
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,900
my father deliberately booked a room in the annex

380
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,200
so that he could plead to Uesumi in front of his room every day.

381
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,300
Saying, "I won't ask you to return the money,"

382
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,300
"but please apologize to my wife"

383
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,500
But when my father found out about my mother's death in the hospital,

384
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,900
on the evening of that day...

385
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,400
He committed suicide in the room he was staying.

386
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,400
My father had been using an electric wheelchair

387
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,100
on loan from the hotel due to his disabilities.

388
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,900
I guess that's how the rumor started.

389
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Incidentally, what room did your father stay in?

390
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,900
It was on the second floor.

391
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,900
The graffiti certainly is terrible.

392
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,900
No choice but to renovate, huh?

393
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,000
Officer Chiba!

394
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,900
You found anyone?

395
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,400
Not yet.

396
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
Oh? Why is the wheelchair here?

397
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,500
I don't know.

398
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,200
When I found it, it was still moving.

399
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,700
It was moving?

400
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,100
Since there was a weird fishing line

401
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,400
attached between the wheels,

402
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
I checked with the hotel.

403
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,800
They said this was the electric wheelchair

404
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,200
that the fallen Uesumi had been borrowing.

405
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,700
So did he have bad legs?

406
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,800
No, it seems he was just using it to cruise around the annex.

407
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,100
What an unbelievable guy.

408
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,600
It's possible that Uesumi was the one

409
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,400
behind the aforementioned ghost commotion.

410
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,500
If he had planned to scare the three victims

411
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,400
who came to visit on 2F where the elderly man committed suicide,

412
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,900
By manipulating the unoccupied wheelchair with a fishing line...

413
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,600
if we think of it this way...

414
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,600
That would certainly make sense.

415
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Even so, this fishing line is extremely long.

416
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
And there are some broken rubber bands at the tip of this.

417
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
The footrests have marks

418
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,300
indicating they've bumped into something.

419
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,200
The man who fell to his death

420
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,300
was the ringleader of a remittance fraud group

421
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,900
that had caused a public uproar Teigo Uesumi.

422
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,000
Mrs. Hirukawa and other victims from his scam

423
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,100
visited this Haido Hotel.

424
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,900
While waiting for Uesumi,

425
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,400
who had wept and admitted to his crimes, to sober up,

426
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
they decided to go buy a recording device for his confession,

427
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,300
and just as they started driving,

428
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,100
Uesumi came tumbling down.

429
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,900
On the roof, we found Uesumi's

430
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,600
clothes and shoes lined up perfectly, but...

431
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,500
It was actually a setup to disguise this as a suicide.

432
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,700
According to the testimony of this self-proclaimed detective,

433
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,000
after we had rushed up to the roof,

434
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,300
he saw the elevator stopping at the sixth and second floors

435
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,700
before coming down to first floor.

436
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,100
And a wheelchair still in motion was found on the second floor.

437
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,300
A long line had been tied between the wheels

438
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,000
with broken rubber bands attached at the tip.

439
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Doesn't this mean that the culprit utilized this wheelchair

440
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,200
to make Uesumi fall to his death?

441
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,400
But, how did he do it?

442
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,600
Moreover, just who is this guy calling himself "Sera"?

443
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,800
I've figured out, the culprit!

444
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,900
What?

445
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Can you tell us your deduction, Sera?

446
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,700
We'll listen and let you know if there are any erroneous parts.

447
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,000
All right.

448
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,300
The voice. Is that Kudo?

449
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,700
Once I told Shinichi about the case over the phone,

450
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,500
he said he figured it out!

451
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Shinichi Kudo?

452
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,200
Next Conan,

453
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,400
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 2)"

454
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,300
Next Conan's Hint:

455
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,100
"Paint Cans"

456
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,300
-He's such a handsome chum! -I wonder.

457
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Why, are you jealous?

458
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,600
You'll find out in the next episode.
