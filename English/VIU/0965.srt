00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,360
Happy New Year, everyone!

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,649
Thank you for all of your support last year.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,530
We'll do our best to mouse-merize you again this year.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,770
Thank you!

Nichiuri TV New Building Completion Commemorative Movie

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,270
The Legendary Kaiju

8
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,199
Yaiba Kick!

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Or the Invincible Superhero

10
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,199
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,930
Production Announced!!

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,799
Isn't it amazing?

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
It's Gomera VS Yaiba!

14
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,539
It's a dream team-up!

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,259
I wanna see it now!

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,069
But since they're announcing production, they're probably starting filming now.

17
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,849
It won't be released for a while.

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,099
What? But I wanna see it now.

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,939
Anyway, I can't believe they're making a kaiju movie

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,860
to commemorate the construction of their new building.

21
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,149
Where there's a will, there's a way.

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,399
Well, yeah.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,179
But because of that, because of our strange connection to Gomera and Yaiba,

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,950
all of us were invited.

25
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,380
So good!

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,479
So, were you invited through your dad?

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,400
Nah, her.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,269
Gomera is so cool!

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,260
Uh, yeah...

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,579
Kazuha-chan, I didn't know you like kaiju.

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,270
Gomera is special.

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,049
When I was a kid, I watched his movies at the theater with Heiji.

33
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,770
I was so moved!

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,270
Really?

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,439
But starting in "Forever," after "Final Battle," the actor inside the costume changed.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,799
His movies have been kind of off for a while, but now we're getting this.

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,320
I'm so excited!

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,109
I thought I knew everything about Kazuha, but there's still so much I don't know.

39
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,409
Let's watch it together.

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,390
Heiji!

41
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,290
What?

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,619
Let's take a picture with Gomera!

43
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,889
Sheesh.

44
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,800
Give me a break.

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,340
He's still going, though.

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm taking the picture.

47
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,310
Say cheese.

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,779
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

49
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,269
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

50
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,649
Taking a photo with Gomera!

51
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,949
A murder occurs at the grand opening of a new building!

52
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,119
Always determining the one truth

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,929
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

54
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,610
his name is Detective Conan!

55
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:54,020
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba (Prologue)

56
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,429
Hello, everyone.

57
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,779
Thank you for coming to the Nichiuri TV New Building Completion Commemorative Movie

58
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:09,660
Nichiuri TV New Building Completion Commemorative Movie "Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba" Announcement Event

59
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,549
I recognize that producer.

60
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,729
Yeah. They call him the hit maker of Nichiuri TV.

61
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,170
He even appears on TV sometimes.

62
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,420
He started making movies in the past few years.

63
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,949
From TV to movies, huh?

64
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,430
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

65
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,009
You're the great detective Mori Kogoro-san, aren't you?

66
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,180
Yes.

67
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,099
I'm Yonekura's subordinate.

68
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,690
My name is Kosugi.

69
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,190
Nice to meet you.

70
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,289
I look forward to working with you at tomorrow's film shoot.

71
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,099
What? Film shoot?

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,370
Dad, it was written on the invitation!

73
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,219
W-Was it?

74
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,829
Yeah, mister.

75
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,660
They're filming a crowd scene at Osaka Castle Park tomorrow.

76
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,199
Crowd scene?

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,159
They're filming a scene in which people flee from the kaiju that appears at Osaka Castle!

78
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,209
Et... cetera?

79
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,419
Extras.

80
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,589
We're playing those extras, right?

81
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,680
We get to be in the movie, too, right?

82
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,619
Yes, of course.

83
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,849
Yes!

84
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,549
But since it's a crowd scene, there will be a lot of people there.

85
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,619
Then let's dress so we really stand out.

86
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,779
Like Kaito Kid?

87
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,690
Good idea!

88
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,000
Yonekura-san?

89
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,249
What's wrong? You were scowling.

90
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,739
Nothing. Just thinking.

91
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,549
See you later.

92
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,060
See you later.

93
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,010
Scenery Warehouse B Always Close the Door

94
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,020
Hey, Kosugi.

95
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,460
Where are you, Kosugi?

96
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,780
Jeez. You scared me.

97
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,050
Damn it. Why'd Onda have to do that?

98
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,209
They're giving us a rather long time to chat.

99
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,410
Yeah.

100
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,080
What's going on?

101
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,340
They seem flustered.

102
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,630
Yeah.

103
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,170
Hey, kid!

104
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,600
What's going on?

105
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,130
Wait...

106
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,939
What is that?

107
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,590
Excuse us!

108
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,200
Let us through!

109
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,479
Hey, you kids!

110
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,950
You can't go in there!

111
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,529
What's going on here?

112
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,310
W-Well...

113
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,870
Wh-What's this?!

114
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,709
Have you called the police?

115
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,879
Yes, just now.

116
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,870
Hey, don't touch the body!

117
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,139
What an awful way to go.

118
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,439
Stabbed right in the stomach with a fang.

119
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,639
Yeah.

120
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,490
Go ahead.

121
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,180
Thanks.

122
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,819
The victim is Yonekura Isato.

123
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,770
He worked here as a producer.

124
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,539
I see. Anyway, it sure is dark in here.

125
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,739
Can't we make it any brighter?

126
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,879
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,660
The electrical system's having problems, so it doesn't get any brighter.

128
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,009
Jeez. In that case...

129
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,639
Hey, you there!

130
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,290
Yes?

131
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,329
Open the door. That'll make it a little brighter.

132
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,670
Well, actually...

133
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,000
This door closes unless it's propped open.

134
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,920
Are you stupid?

135
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,339
Then keep it open with a doorstop or something.

136
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,639
Now, now.

137
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,169
Either way, it doesn't look like this was foul play.

138
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,499
It shouldn't be a problem.

139
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,959
I guess...

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,350
You guys okay with that?

141
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,009
Are we okay? No matter how you look at it...

142
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,230
Look at the victim's right hand.

143
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,610
What about his right hand?

144
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,850
What's going on here?

145
00:09:55,851 --> 00:09:58,739
The blood's been wiped off of just his pointer finger.

146
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,730
Yeah.

147
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:03,029
And look at the phone next to him.

148
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,870
The phone?

149
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,350
What's this?

150
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:08,750
I see. The fingerprint ID button...

151
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,499
The victim was probably conscious for a while after he was stabbed in the stomach.

152
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,760
He took out his phone and unlocked it.

153
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,420
And wiped the blood from his pointer finger so it would recognize his fingerprint.

154
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,709
Got it. I'll have the data on the phone analyzed immediately.

155
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,739
Yeah.

156
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,849
Inspector Otaki!

157
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,650
What?

158
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,150
Take a look at this rope.

159
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,599
I see. It's frayed, but this didn't break naturally.

160
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,410
Yeah.

161
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,849
It looks like a pretty tough rope, so they must've had some trouble cutting it.

162
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,129
Hey, there's some kind of scratch right here.

163
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,469
Yeah. That cut must have been made by the end of a knife or something.

164
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,940
A knife cut on the top of the shelf?

165
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,579
In other words, the culprit dropped the knife while cutting the rope, and cut the shelf there.

166
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,390
Yes.

167
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,480
But the cut is too small. I'm not sure we'll be able to identify the weapon.

168
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,320
Yeah, but now it's clear.

169
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,940
This wasn't an accident.

170
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,320
It's a murder.

171
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,330
I can't believe what happened to Yonekura-san.

172
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,549
I don't know what's going on anymore.

173
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,710
So, how's the security of the warehouse that is the crime scene?

174
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,129
It's unlocked using these key cards.

175
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,299
Who had a key card?

176
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,220
Including Yonekura-san, I believe it was about fifteen people.

177
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,839
The new kaiju in there were being kept confidential

178
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,529
until they were announced at today's event,

179
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,730
so only a few people were allowed to enter the room.

180
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,169
I see.

181
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,599
That narrows down the suspects quite a bit.

182
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,959
Yeah.

183
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,820
Excuse me.

184
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,600
Yonekura-san wasn't killed in an accident?

185
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,109
We're investigating it right now.

186
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,610
Anyway, I heard you got into a fight with the victim.

187
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,479
What? I-I...

188
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,490
The staff saw you arguing.

189
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,869
Apparently this movie was originally your idea,

190
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,559
but the victim stole it.

191
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,500
You're wrong!

192
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,500
I discussed and planned everything with Yonekura-san!

193
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,010
But he took all the credit.

194
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,549
No!

195
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,090
Hey, mister.

196
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,449
Why did you go to the warehouse when you did?

197
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,180
What?

198
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,339
I received a note from Yonekura-san saying to come to the warehouse at 2:30.

199
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,469
Yonekura-san was to leave for Bangkok immediately after the event,

200
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,289
so I thought he wanted to discuss something before then.

201
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,479
So, where's that note now?

202
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,889
I threw it away.

203
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,820
That's what it said to do.

204
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,580
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,779
Aw, darn. The Yaiba show's canceled.

206
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,340
I hope tomorrow's film shoot happens as scheduled.

207
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,319
I'm so tired of waiting that I'm hungry.

208
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,719
Genta-kun, you're always hungry.

209
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,259
The Yaiba show is more important.

210
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,470
But they're not doing the show.

211
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,140
Ai-chan?

212
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,860
Is something wrong?

213
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,030
It's nothing.

214
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,120
I see.

215
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,279
Jeez. Not a peep from Heiji either.

216
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,049
What should we do, Ran-chan?

217
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,910
Let's wait a little longer.

218
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,619
Huh? Come to think of it, where's Conan-kun?

219
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,509
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him in a while.

220
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,289
Maybe he's with Heiji-oniisan.

221
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,170
Did he run off again?

222
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:14,069
Yeah, come to think of it, Yonekura-san was glaring quite intensely at his phone.

223
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:16,689
Do you know what time that was?

224
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:23,749
It was right after the first afternoon meeting, so it might have been around 2:20.

225
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,449
Hei-chan!

226
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,568
We're ready for you.

227
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,338
I'll be right there.

228
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:31,559
Thanks.

229
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,288
Of the staff that had key cards to the warehouse,

230
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:41,469
only two others besides Kosugi were in the back at the time of the crime.

231
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:45,088
That's great. So, who are they?

232
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,229
I had them wait in the meeting room.

233
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:51,448
Sorry to make you wait so long.

234
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:53,609
How long were you going to make us wait?

235
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:58,359
Unlike the police, every second matters in our business.

236
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:03,869
We're busy enough without what happened to Yonekura.

237
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,148
You're awfully aggressive.

238
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:09,499
Is there something you don't want to be asked about?

239
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:11,869
Who are you?

240
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:13,608
Me?

241
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:17,299
I'm high school detective Hattori Heiji.

242
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,179
I've heard of you.

243
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:27,489
You're that brat claiming to be Kudo Shinichi's rival high school detective of the west.

244
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,969
You sure you're not using your dad's connections to fabricate your achievements?

245
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,069
Hey, guys.

246
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,648
It's fine.

247
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,699
I've got some questions for you concerning Yonekura-san's death.

248
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,268
Wasn't Yonekura's death an accident?

249
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,158
Why's a detective getting involved?

250
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,808
Or what?

251
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:55,459
Are you saying someone killed him?

252
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:58,958
You were Yonekura-san's subordinates, weren't you?

253
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,728
Yeah, that's right.

254
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:03,878
He called us Team Yonekura.

255
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,599
But we came up with most of his recent plans.

256
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:12,048
They called him the hit maker,

257
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:15,099
but he was just a pretty face.

258
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,788
And with Yonekura-san out of the way, you guys could take the top spot.

259
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:22,028
That sounds like a motive to me.

260
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:23,488
Don't be ridiculous.

261
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:25,998
Hold on, what about Kosugi?

262
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,989
He was part of Team Yonekura, too.

263
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,298
Why isn't he here?

264
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,749
Shouldn't you be worrying about yourselves right now?

265
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,249
Where were you and what were you doing around 2:30 PM today?

266
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,879
You're checking our alibis?

267
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:48,348
At that time, I was in the third floor meeting room planning the filming.

268
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:49,389
Why?

269
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,899
Why are these two so strangely confident?

270
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,888
No, wait.

271
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,098
Around 2:30,

272
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:04,608
I had a girl get me some painkillers from my car in the basement parking lot.

273
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,409
Painkillers?

274
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,409
Look at this.

275
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:11,909
I tripped three days ago and twisted it.

276
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:17,788
I had her come get my car keys around 2:20,

277
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:21,919
and she brought me the medicine at 2:30.

278
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:26,588
It took her a long time just to get some medicine.

279
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,299
Yeah.

280
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:33,038
The elevator never arrived because of today's event.

281
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,308
Not only that, but she said the stairs from the first floor to the basement were packed,

282
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:39,809
so it took her a while.

283
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,589
That's about a ten minute gap in his alibi.

284
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:47,449
If he couldn't use the elevator, he must've used the stairs.

285
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,078
His foot is injured.

286
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,948
It would've been tough for him to travel back and forth between the third and sixth floors

287
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,449
and commit a murder in ten minutes.

288
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:58,459
So, Kouchi-san, what about you?

289
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:04,459
I was checking bathrooms and other deserted areas for suspicious objects alone.

290
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:08,469
I didn't meet any acquaintances, so I have no alibi.

291
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:12,349
But I couldn't have killed Yonekura.

292
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,219
Why not?

293
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:17,228
I'm afraid of heights.

294
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,328
What?

295
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,788
I've got a severe case of acrophobia.

296
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:25,338
High places are naturally out of the question, and I can't climb ladders.

297
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:30,239
I heard Yonekura was crushed beneath a kaiju.

298
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:36,749
Which means the culprit climbed the scaffolding and cut the rope holding the kaiju, right?

299
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,999
I couldn't climb a scaffold.

300
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:41,668
You sure that's true?

301
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,749
A person can claim anything if it's just talk.

302
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:45,918
Are you stupid? You know it's true.

303
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,279
Is that right?

304
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:01,268
We should use something to prop this open.

305
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:02,229
Yeah.

306
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,309
Inspector Otaki might come get us.

307
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:10,328
Those two are suspicious.

308
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:15,059
Yeah, but only Kosugi had the motive and opportunity.

309
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,118
Hei-chan, where are you?

310
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,289
Otaki-han, over here.

311
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,648
We finished analyzing Yonekura-san's phone.

312
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:25,798
Really?

313
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,388
Yeah. It seems Yonekura-san took a picture of the culprit.

314
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:33,799
That's amazing. That solves the case.

315
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:38,309
Actually... Well, you'll see.

316
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:44,348
It's impossible to identify them from this blurry photo.

317
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,098
Otaki-han, where are Mihara and Kouchi?

318
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,569
What? They headed down to the first floor.

319
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,359
Don't let them out of the building!

320
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:52,549
What?

321
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:58,408
Don't let them out? What do you mean?

322
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:00,349
Look closely at that photo.

323
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:06,468
That warehouse was dark because of electrical issues, but there's a little bit of light.

324
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:07,879
Y-Yeah.

325
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:10,728
Where do you think that light came from?

326
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:11,879
Where?

327
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,258
The door. The door was open, and the hallway light entered the room.

328
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,219
Yeah, but that door closes on its own.

329
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,229
That's right. Someone was holding the door open.

330
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,008
In other words, there were two culprits.

331
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:29,859
Kouchi-san and Mihara-san were working together.

332
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:34,359
Kouchi-san helped Mihara-san and his injured foot on the stairs,

333
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:39,849
and Kouchi-san helped Mihara-san climb the scaffolding from below.

334
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,208
This is Otaki!

335
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:48,089
If you see Kouchi and Mihara, secure them!

336
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:53,719
Hey, you two!

337
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,728
The spare key should be around here.

338
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:00,429
Found it.

339
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:02,488
Drive the car.

340
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:03,139
Got it.

341
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,439
Stop!

342
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,349
Let go!

343
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:08,519
Open the door!

344
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:12,948
Mihara has been secured!

345
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:14,858
Kouchi is fleeing in Yonekura's car!

346
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:16,699
It's a large black SUV!

347
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:21,879
Damn!

348
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:26,919
Ran!

349
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:31,209
Kazuha-chan!

350
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,299
Kazuha-chan!

351
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:09,889
Ran-chan!

352
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,269
Ran-neechan!

353
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:12,698
Ouch...

354
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,479
Thank you.

355
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,079
Inspector Ayanokoji!

356
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,628
My, my.

357
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:23,409
We meet again, Conan-kun.

358
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:28,069
I won't be arrested.

359
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:51,939
Isn't it about time you explained what you're doing at the same crime scene?

360
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:57,719
The Osaka and Kyoto Police will have to form a joint investigation headquarters.

361
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:01,199
It's a kaiju!

362
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:02,948
Help!

363
00:24:02,949 --> 00:24:04,819
Ayumi-chan! This way!

364
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:09,579
Of course! It's Kamen Yaiba!

365
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:15,279
The next episode of Conan is "Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba, Interlude!"
