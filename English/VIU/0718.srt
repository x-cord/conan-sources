1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,070
Pops is invited over to the villa in Shizuoka prefecture,

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,370
where Mrs. Chika Kaido does her writing work

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,870
as a writer of mystery novels,

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,770
because she wanted him to tell her about

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,670
his experience as a famed detective. However...

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,770
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Mouri.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,370
Those two are hooked up with each other.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,570
Yes?

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,770
Those two?

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,270
My husband Yuichi and my disciple Kohko.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,470
In other words, I'm an eyesore to them both.

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,870
But, I'm not letting them have their way.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,570
I'm sly and strong like an ogre, you see.

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,070
Mrs. Chika may look strong

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,170
but she's actually a very weak person.

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,870
She's always depressed and in a slump

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,370
and can't sleep a wink unless she relies on sleeping pills.

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,570
Chika puts on a tough front

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,770
but she's actually a sensitive woman.

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,470
I was surprised when I saw her looking absentmindedly

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,370
at the knife in the kitchen.

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,770
She probably had a tough time going on living

23
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,770
so could've been contemplating suicide.

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,070
Okay then, Mr. Mouri. I hope you get a good night's rest.

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,270
-Oh. -Goodnight.

26
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,170
What's with those people?

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,670
They invite me to come over

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,370
but don't listen to what I have to say at all.

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,570
They suddenly start talking about family affairs too.

30
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,670
Oh, what a beautiful moon.

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,270
True.

32
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,570
Tonight should be a good night for working on my manuscript.

33
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,070
But, there's a proverb that goes, happiness is short-lived.

34
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,970
This could be the last time.

35
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,070
I had no idea what were on the minds of the three

36
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,170
till the incident occurred.

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,570
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,670
are slashed by the light of deduction.

39
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,970
The whereabouts of the murder triangle

40
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,970
is not known till the following day.

41
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,470
His name is Detective Conan!

44
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:10,824
"The Devil's Circuit"

45
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:17,324
Oh, Mrs. Kaido was laughing late at night?

46
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,124
Yeah. I think it was about 02:00.

47
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:22,224
When I got up to go to the restroom.

48
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:25,724
I wonder what was so funny.

49
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,724
Something really good must've happened.

50
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:29,824
I guess so.

51
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:35,124
I wonder if all three of them are still asleep.

52
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:37,224
But, it's already after 08:00.

53
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:39,324
It's time at least one of them is awake already.

54
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:40,824
Let's go check them out.

55
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:43,424
Uh, the curtains are still closed.

56
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,324
I wonder if nobody's really up yet.

57
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:48,224
Uncle! Look!

58
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:51,424
Mr. Kaido! Mrs. Chika!

59
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,624
Darn! I'm busting the door down!

60
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:59,824
Judging from rigor mortis, she died late last night.

61
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,024
Since there are no signs of external wounds,

62
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,124
she could've died of an illness.

63
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:05,724
Or, maybe she drank poison.

64
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:08,124
Either way, we'd better go let Mr. Kaido know!

65
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:11,424
Mouri here, I'm coming in!

66
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,224
No good. He's dead.

67
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:19,924
There are no signs of external injuries either.

68
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:24,224
Sleeping pills, eh.

69
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:28,924
Don't tell me that?

70
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,324
Her too?

71
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:35,624
At any rate, Ran, call the police!

72
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:36,724
Okay!

73
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:39,424
Uh, Pops. This pitcher...

74
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:41,324
seems to have been a set with the glass cup

75
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,524
that was found beside Ms. Shimura, right?

76
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,724
Looks to be so.

77
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:48,524
Huh? It's wet.

78
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:51,624
Uh, the floor here is wet.

79
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:54,924
The water of the pitcher probably spilled or something I guess?

80
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:58,024
In the trash box, there's an empty can of beer

81
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,524
and two chocolate bars.

82
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,324
And, some tissue.

83
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:04,724
Uh. I wonder why this chocolate bar was thrown away?

84
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,324
It's not even opened.

85
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,924
Beats me.

86
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:13,824
It seems she was still working when she died.

87
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:17,124
Maybe a dying message or something is written.

88
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:18,724
Can't be.

89
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:22,624
Oh! Something's come up.

90
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:24,524
An Ironic Circuit.

91
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:26,024
Bombed the wrong target.

92
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:30,124
"The lone winner who survives gets to laugh out loud."

93
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,324
It doesn't look like a dying message.

94
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:39,024
Maybe it's an idea memo for a novel.

95
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,724
Dad! The police say they'll be here right away!

96
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:42,924
Okay.

97
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:48,324
Long time no see! Mr. Mouri!

98
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,524
Long time no see, Yokomizo.

99
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,224
Yes!

100
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:56,624
Oogawara, this is the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

101
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,724
I'm Tomonori Oogawara.

102
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:02,424
I hear that you've done a lot for Inspector Yokomizo.

103
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,724
Well, not really.

104
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,324
But! We the police are working towards

105
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:09,924
and trying to mature into an organization

106
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:11,524
that doesn't have to rely on people like you

107
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:14,124
by improving day by day.

108
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:19,024
At any rate, Mr. Mouri, please take us to the victims.

109
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:21,324
Yeah. This way.

110
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,424
Inspector Yokomizo!

111
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:32,924
Why do we need a guy like him taking charge of the site?

112
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:34,924
Well, don't let it bother you.

113
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:39,424
There's a box with 20 chocolate bars inside it on the desk.

114
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,924
Inside the box there were 17 bars left,

115
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:44,024
and near the box there was one empty wrapper left,

116
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:46,624
presumably of a chocolate bar that had been eaten.

117
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:49,424
Furthermore, from the closet of her husband,

118
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:53,424
Mr. Kaido's room, a syringe was found.

119
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:54,524
As a result of the coroner's inquest,

120
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,624
it was found that they died of poisoning.

121
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:00,824
The body was turned over to undergo a judicial autopsy.

122
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:05,224
Uh, Dad. Is this suicide or homicide?

123
00:08:06,724 --> 00:08:08,524
You don't know.

124
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:13,024
I heard that Mrs. Kaido liked that chocolate bar

125
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:16,924
and used to always eat it while working.

126
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:20,924
And yet, I wonder why she threw those two away?

127
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:23,224
Moreover, it seems that Mrs. Kaido

128
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:26,324
used to take five tablets of sleeping pills every night.

129
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,924
But, it seems that her husband Yuichi

130
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,924
was against her taking sleeping pills.

131
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:35,424
Huh? But wasn't there an empty bottle of sleeping pills

132
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,524
near the corpse of her husband?

133
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:40,324
In other words, that was Chika's.

134
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:42,924
Hey, where'd you get that?

135
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,024
Oh.

136
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,124
I found it in the living room.

137
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:47,424
Let's see...

138
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,624
I love to take long baths,

139
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:54,624
and gulp down cold beer after coming out.

140
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:57,524
But my doctor told me I shouldn't.

141
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:01,324
There was an empty can of beer in the trash box, right?

142
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,424
It seems she bought that pitcher

143
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:05,024
because the doctor told her to stop drinking beer.

144
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,824
So that she could drink it after taking a bath.

145
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:09,524
The assistant that went to buy it with her

146
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:11,724
seems to have taken a liking to it.

147
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:14,524
Assistant, you mean Ms. Shimura?

148
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:15,924
This is it?

149
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:18,824
What? 1.2 million yen?

150
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,024
A pitcher like that?

151
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:22,424
So, it's the price for you, eh.

152
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:25,424
What? Mrs. Kaido passed away?

153
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:26,724
When?

154
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:28,824
Before that, who may I ask are you?

155
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:32,824
I'm Toda of a monthly magazine called Mystery Paradise

156
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,924
in charge of Mrs. Kaido.

157
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:36,424
She sounded so well

158
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:38,724
when I talked to her on the phone last night and yet...

159
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:43,324
Sorry for questioning you here.

160
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:44,424
No, don't be.

161
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:47,624
And you seem to have called her last night?

162
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:50,324
Yes, on her mobile.

163
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,624
She didn't answer the first time,

164
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:56,424
but on my second try at around midnight...

165
00:09:56,424 --> 00:10:00,624
And how are you getting along so far?

166
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:03,424
It's going to be a fantastic masterpiece, Mr. Toda.

167
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:08,024
I'll turn over the history of Japan's mystery novels.

168
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,924
Either way, she was full of zeal.

169
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:13,924
If so, this is most likely not suicide.

170
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:16,624
I see, okay. Good work!

171
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:19,624
We got the result of the autopsy

172
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:22,724
along with the report from the forensics.

173
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:28,024
First of all, around 23:30, Mr. Yuichi Kaido passed away.

174
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:31,724
The sleeping pill that he drank was laced with poison.

175
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:36,324
Next, at around 01:00, Ms. Kohko Shimura passes away.

176
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:38,924
Poison was laced on the inside of the glass

177
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:41,624
in which she drank tea with.

178
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:46,024
And Mrs. Chika Kaido dies at around 02:00.

179
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:50,024
Poison was inserted in the chocolate bar that she ate.

180
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:52,924
By the way, about that chocolate bar,

181
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:56,324
there was another one laced with poison inside the box.

182
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,924
But including the two that were found in the trash box

183
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:03,324
and the other ones no poison was detected.

184
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:06,524
Which means the three were most likely killed.

185
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:07,824
Yes.

186
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:10,324
What? Why is it homicide?

187
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:11,424
If they wanted to commit suicide,

188
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:14,324
all they had to do was drink the poison directly.

189
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:16,924
They would never go out of their way to lace the glass cup with poison

190
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,524
or, do something as bothersome

191
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:22,024
as to insert poison into the chocolate.

192
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:23,624
In other words, that chances are high that

193
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:25,824
they were poisoned to death.

194
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:31,124
Also, all three were killed by different poisons.

195
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,024
What?

196
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,024
Then, don't tell me that...

197
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:39,024
Yes. It's possible that there are three murderers.

198
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:43,624
It's true that although a person was out to kill three people,

199
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:47,024
there would be no need to prepare three types of poison.

200
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:49,424
But, it's strange that three different culprits

201
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:52,524
would kill three different people on the same day.

202
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,724
Inspector. All the things that were laced with poison

203
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:59,424
belonged to Mrs. Chika Kaido, weren't they?

204
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:00,824
Yeah.

205
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:04,324
If so, can't we look at it this way?

206
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,424
Although there may have been three culprits,

207
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:08,924
their target was just one person.

208
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:10,724
Mrs. Chika Kaido.

209
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:15,524
What? Then, it means that her husband and Ms. Kohko Shimura...

210
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:18,724
Poor thing, I guess that just happened to end up as victims.

211
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:21,024
-Uh, Pops. -Huh?

212
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:24,224
Didn't Mrs. Chika say something strange yesterday?

213
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:28,424
Something about her being an eyesore to the two.

214
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:31,024
Just what does that mean, Mr. Mouri?

215
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:34,024
Her husband and Ms. Kohko Shimura

216
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:36,524
were having an extramarital affair.

217
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:39,124
That's right, isn't it?

218
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,024
Is that right?

219
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:44,624
It seems that her husband wanted a divorce.

220
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:48,524
However, since Mrs. Chika was a very proud person,

221
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:51,024
she had no intention of granting him one.

222
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:53,524
In other words, in order for them to get together

223
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:57,024
they had no choice but to get Mrs. Chika Kaido out of their way.

224
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:59,624
Of the three culprits, two of them

225
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:03,224
were Yuichi Kaido and Kohko Shimura!

226
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:07,824
I see. That explains what they said yesterday, right?

227
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:11,024
Although Mrs. Chika seems to be strong,

228
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,224
she's actually a very weak person.

229
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:18,424
She was probably contemplating suicide.

230
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:22,524
It was probably what they had schemed before killing her

231
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:24,624
to make her death look like suicide.

232
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:28,124
They tried to set you up as an eyewitness, didn't they, Dad?

233
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:31,324
It's true that from the syringe that was found

234
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:32,624
in Yuichi's room,

235
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:36,224
poison laced on the chocolate bar was detected.

236
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:37,724
This does it.

237
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:41,524
Moreover, his prints were detected on all the chocolate bars

238
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:44,924
that were found in Mrs. Chika Kaido's study.

239
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,924
All the chocolate bars?

240
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:50,524
Including the third culprit, "X"

241
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:55,224
each of them schemed to kill Mrs. Chika Kaido.

242
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:58,824
But, ironically, not only Chika,

243
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:03,824
but also Yuichi Kaido and Kohoko Shimura ended up

244
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:06,424
killing each other with the poison that they used.

245
00:14:06,424 --> 00:14:10,724
But who then is the third culprit "X"?

246
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,724
I hear that the editor

247
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:13,924
always goes through a tough time trying to deal with

248
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:16,624
the selfishness of the novelists that they're in charge of.

249
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:19,024
Isn't that right, Mr. Toda?

250
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,224
Mr. Mouri? I wonder about that deduction of yours.

251
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:26,124
You were full of hate for Mrs. Chika, weren't you?

252
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,924
Oh, no.

253
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:30,124
I think it's most appropriate to figure out

254
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:32,324
who would benefit most from her death

255
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:34,324
if we want to arrive at a motive.

256
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,424
If a novelist suddenly dies,

257
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:39,024
this would be very attention gathering.

258
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:42,124
If this happens, wouldn't the books and magazines

259
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,324
connected with the novelist sell very well?

260
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:45,924
I see!

261
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:48,524
What do you mean, I see!

262
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:52,624
I didn't kill her! I really didn't!

263
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:58,024
I wonder why Yuichi's prints were on all of the chocolate bars?

264
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:00,924
Not only that, but the empty can of beer

265
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,824
that the doctor had told her not to drink

266
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,824
that was found in the trash box.

267
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:07,524
And, Chika who was laughing out loud late at night

268
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:10,524
that Pops said he saw.

269
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:14,516
Darn. There are too many unexplainable things.

270
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:20,342
The thing that bothers me though is...

271
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:26,242
I'm sly like an ogre and strong.

272
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:28,542
What did she go out of her way to say something like that?

273
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:33,642
I wonder if everyone really suspects him.

274
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:37,042
I can't believe that he's the culprit, though.

275
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,542
Don't worry,

276
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:53,042
I'm sure that Pops will come up with the right solution.

277
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:58,042
So that's the story.

278
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,742
What's the matter, Conan?

279
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,842
Here, this! I'll get going before you.

280
00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:05,142
Hey, Conan.

281
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:11,442
Inspector Yokomizo, were Yuichi's prints also detected

282
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:13,842
on the syringe that found?

283
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,442
No, they seem to have been wiped off

284
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,642
so nobody's prints were found.

285
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,242
But, isn't it strange?

286
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,242
That the prints on the chocolate bars are left behind

287
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:23,742
and yet the ones on the syringe are wiped off?

288
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:26,242
Well, I guess so, but...

289
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:30,742
Mr. Toda. You called Mrs. Chika twice last night, didn't you?

290
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:34,042
Yeah. At first I called her around 23:30.

291
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:37,242
But, Mrs. Chika didn't answer that call, right?

292
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:40,742
I found out from Mrs. Chika the second time I called her

293
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:44,342
that she was taking a bath from about 23:00.

294
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,042
What about it?

295
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:50,542
Pops is a great detective after all!

296
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,242
He figured out the entire mystery, he says.

297
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:54,442
Right, Pops!

298
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,442
Huh?

299
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:59,642
Huh? Oh, well...

300
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:04,742
So, as I was saying the third culprit is Mr. Toda...

301
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,642
-you'd think, but not so. -What?

302
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,042
Are you turning back on what you said at this point?

303
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:14,742
Mr. Toda, I hear that

304
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,842
Mrs. Chika Kaido was depress over a slump.

305
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:21,242
Oh, yes. From some time ago.

306
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,642
It doesn't matter whether she was going through

307
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,642
a slump or not, is there!

308
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:29,242
If she was really killed, that is...

309
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:32,442
The third culprit "X"

310
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,042
is she herself.

311
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,142
The one who laced the chocolate bars with poison

312
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:38,842
was Mrs. Chika Kaido, herself.

313
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:42,142
That was of course to commit suicide.

314
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:45,142
Then, Mrs. Chika Kaido committed suicide?

315
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:47,142
No, she didn't commit suicide.

316
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:50,342
Huh? But, you just said so yourself, didn't you?

317
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:57,142
As Mrs. Chika Kaido would say, an ironic circuit has spun.

318
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,742
She is a very proud novelist

319
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,942
and she felt like annihilating herself from this world

320
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:03,742
after her continued slump.

321
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:06,142
But, she could bear thinking that

322
00:18:06,142 --> 00:18:09,342
her husband and his lover would become happy after her death.

323
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:11,342
So, as her death gift to him,

324
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,942
she decided to frame her husband as criminal

325
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,742
who had killed his wife.

326
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:19,642
First of all, she inserted poison

327
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:22,842
into her chocolate bar to commit suicide.

328
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:28,742
Then she hid the syringe that she used inside Yuichi's room.

329
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:31,842
In the meantime, aside from all that was being schemed,

330
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:34,642
her husband and Ms. Kohoko Shimura

331
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:38,842
were also each scheming to kill Mrs. Chika Kaido.

332
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:43,042
Mrs. Chika Kaido had been taking a bath from around 23:00.

333
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,142
During this time, Ms. Kohko Shimura

334
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:47,142
switched Chika's sleeping pills with ones

335
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:50,342
that were laced with poison.

336
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:54,042
And at about 23:30, Mr. Yuichi Kaido

337
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,942
laced poison onto the glass cup set to the pitcher

338
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:59,842
from which Chika drinks water out of after taking a bath.

339
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,742
And then, at that time,

340
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,142
as if to calm himself down,

341
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:08,642
he takes Chika's sleeping pills with him,

342
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:12,842
drinks it, and the first one, Mr. Yuichi Kaido dies.

343
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,542
Then at around midnight, when getting out of her bath,

344
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:20,342
Mrs. Chika got a call from Mr. Toda.

345
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:22,642
She then, probably inadvertently

346
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:24,942
dropped the pitcher to the floor.

347
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:29,042
I'll turn the history of Japanese mystery upside down.

348
00:19:30,142 --> 00:19:32,542
But, I guess she couldn't bring herself to drink the water

349
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,042
that spilled out of the pitcher she dropped.

350
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:40,042
She went to the kitchen and changed her mind.

351
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:43,042
She figured that she was going to die soon anyway

352
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,042
so she brought the beer that the doctor told her not to drink

353
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,342
back to her study and drank it.

354
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:50,942
Then, just before 01:00,

355
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:53,142
Ms. Kohoko Shimura who probably couldn't get to sleep

356
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:57,742
comes over to the kitchen uses the glass to drink tea.

357
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:03,242
The second person, Ms. Kohoko Shimura dies.

358
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:05,142
And then, at 02:00.

359
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,442
Chika who returns to the kitchen again

360
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,142
discovers the body of Kohoko

361
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,842
and the glass cup on the floor.

362
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:16,842
She concluded that her husband had thought of poisoning her.

363
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:23,842
She then figured everything out.

364
00:20:23,842 --> 00:20:27,342
That the two had mistakenly killed each other

365
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,642
in an attempt to kill her.

366
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:33,642
She had lost all though of committing suicide anymore,

367
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:35,142
so she threw the chocolate bar that she had laced poison with

368
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:36,842
into the trash box.

369
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:38,342
I've got to live!

370
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:41,642
I'll live and write a novel...

371
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,042
about the pathetic twosome!

372
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:46,542
"An Ironic Circuit"

373
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:48,742
"Bombed the wrong target"

374
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:52,442
"The lone winner who survives gets to laugh out loud"

375
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:03,442
And, the third person, Mrs. Chika Kaido dies.

376
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:08,642
Hey, wait a second, Mr. Mouri.

377
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,942
To think that she would mistakenly eat the chocolate bar

378
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,542
that she had planned to commit suicide with,

379
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:16,142
is a little outrageous, don't you think?

380
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,742
Another ironical circuit had spun.

381
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:21,042
Huh?

382
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:25,442
The first call that you made to her at 23:30, Mr. Toda.

383
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,842
It's most likely

384
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:31,142
Yuichi was lacing poison just around that time.

385
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:33,142
Surprised at hearing the phone ring,

386
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:35,842
he dropped the chocolate bar.

387
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:37,542
It was then that the position

388
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,542
of the poison laced chocolate bar changed places.

389
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:44,342
There's no other explainable situation,

390
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:48,442
for all the chocolate bars having his prints on them, is there?

391
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:14,842
How about it, Oogawara?

392
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:16,242
Now you know,

393
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:19,542
why I want Mr. Mouri to help me out, don't you?

394
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,642
Yes, sir!

395
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:24,742
I've seen with my very eyes the greatness of a renown detective.

396
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:25,742
So he says.

397
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:29,242
As long as you understand, it's okay with me.

398
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:34,342
Hey, Dad, come off with that remark.

399
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:36,642
I goofed a bit.

400
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:38,742
I can't laugh about Pops.

401
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:47,342
Inspector, the laundry is left in the washing machine

402
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,842
after being spun dried.

403
00:23:48,842 --> 00:23:51,442
How come you remember so accurately

404
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:53,642
the time the washing machine running?

405
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,342
It was making a loud rattling noise,

406
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:59,342
but stopped once after about five minutes,

407
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:02,142
so I guess the person heard the noise or something.

408
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:03,742
It stopped once?

409
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:09,642
Next Conan, "Platinum Ticket Commotion"

410
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:34,642
Dad!
