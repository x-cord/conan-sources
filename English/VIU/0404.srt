1
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:05,896
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:07,596
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,597 --> 00:00:09,096
With the treasure and the girl's smile.

4
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:10,596
The angel comes down to us at last.

5
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,372
It is time for us to get them all.

6
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:13,896
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:15,496
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:17,597
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,569
We, the Youth Detective Squad, got a client.

10
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,169
Her name is Yuriko Matsunaka,

11
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,369
a student in the other class of our grade.

12
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,869
She visited us

13
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,569
because her great-grandfather,

14
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,870
Gozo Isegawa, left a riddle and wanted Yuriko to solve it.

15
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,970
And so,

16
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:15,869
a mysterious guy named Clock took us

17
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,669
to a place called the Angel's Mansion,

18
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,470
to solve the riddle that Gozo Isegawa left behind.

19
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,770
Now it's time.

20
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,769
Here is the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

21
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,969
-What? -What?

22
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,069
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

23
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,369
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

24
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,870
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

25
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,870
What are you doing?

26
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,569
That's it! Guys, get off the floor...

27
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,070
Yuriko!

28
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:04,470
"Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 2)"

29
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,470
"South Angel Tower's Dungeon."

30
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,569
Hey, guys!

31
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,569
Are you guys okay?

32
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,569
Yeah, I'm okay.

33
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,769
Looks like we really fell down.

34
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,469
Genta...

35
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,069
Hey, something's wrong with Genta!

36
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,170
Hey! Genta...

37
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,170
Another grilled eel, please.

38
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,269
He hasn't slept since last night, right?

39
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,569
Genta!

40
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,470
There's only 9 hours left until the time limit!

41
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,570
Where is this? Where are we?

42
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,069
Remember what Mr. Clock said?

43
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,269
Keep in mind, this Angel's Mansion is a huge labyrinth.

44
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,669
A labyrinth. A labyrinth?

45
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,069
What do we do?

46
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,770
There's nothing we can do but wait.

47
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,570
No way...

48
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,770
So we can't get out of here?

49
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,269
Mitsuhiko, it's all your fault.

50
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,769
What? It's not my fault!

51
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,770
Yeah, it is.

52
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,369
It's because you were trying to be cool in front Yuriko.

53
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,469
You're not that kind of guy. You shouldn't have acted like that.

54
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,169
Okay, but you were doing exactly the same thing,

55
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,969
saying "I'm gonna beat Conan", weren't you?

56
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,069
Haibara and Ayumi, you girls were too!

57
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,569
I just...

58
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,069
I just wanted to...

59
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,569
You too, Conan!

60
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,369
You ran into the Angel's tower, acting all self-righteous!

61
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,969
Isn't that why this happened?

62
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,469
You guys should've been waiting outside.

63
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,969
What do you mean by that?

64
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,869
You're saying Yuriko was kidnapped all because of us, not you!

65
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,970
-You wanna fight? -Why not?

66
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,970
It hurts...

67
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,769
Stop!

68
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,569
Guys, please don't fight! We're all friends, right?

69
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,069
Yeah, but they're saying it's all my fault.

70
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,369
Who else is going to get Yuriko back

71
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,669
if the Youth Detective Squad split up?

72
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,369
She's always alone.

73
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,170
Right now, at this moment too.

74
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,169
Sorry, I was wrong.

75
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,069
No, I was wrong!

76
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,070
No.

77
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,169
I was wrong.

78
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,769
Did Conan just apologize?

79
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,170
He did.

80
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,869
Well, everything's going be fine!

81
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,269
As long as the Youth Detective Squad is together,

82
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,369
this labyrinth is like nothing, right?

83
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,370
Yeah, that's right!

84
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,269
It's tough to motivate kids, isn't it?

85
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,969
Shut up.

86
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,369
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

87
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,469
Yes?

88
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,169
You found human bones in the East Mansion, right?

89
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,069
Which direction was the head facing?

90
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,369
The direction?

91
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,969
Let me think.

92
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,569
Here's the south,

93
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,069
and I went into the East Mansion one like this, so...

94
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,469
It's facing that way.

95
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,569
The dead man was lying on his stomach, facing the fireplace.

96
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,069
I guess that's where the thieves ended up, like Mr. Clock said.

97
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,069
When a man falls down on his stomach,

98
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,669
the head shows where he was heading.

99
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,169
Mitsuhiko already saw that the fireplace

100
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,569
was connected to where the bones were.

101
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,869
So, this labyrinth should lead us at least to the East Mansion.

102
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,669
Great! You're my man!

103
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,969
Yeah, but more important is how we get there

104
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,769
before we become bones, right?

105
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,969
The labyrinth of Minotaur.

106
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,970
What?

107
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:40,669
Hey, remember?

108
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,469
The half-man half bull monster in front of the mansion.

109
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,869
In the ancient Greek myths,

110
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,169
Minotaur is a son of a king, who incurred the God's displeasure,

111
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,969
and the God made Minotaur half-human half-bull.

112
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,369
Since Minotaur became awfully violent as he grew up,

113
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,569
the king decided to put him in a huge labyrinth,

114
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,269
so he could never come out.

115
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,969
So that monster is somewhere in this labyrinth?

116
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,470
Come on. No.

117
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,869
What's important is after that.

118
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,969
Every year, the king sent seven Athenian kids to the labyrinth as tribute.

119
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,569
When the hero of Athens, Theseus, heard of this,

120
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,169
he went to challenge the labyrinth and defeated the Minotaur.

121
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,370
He returned from that so-called "Labyrinth of No Return".

122
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,569
By using a ball of string.

123
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,769
-A ball of string? -A ball of strings?

124
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,769
A ball of string?

125
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,569
Right. He tied the string to the gate of the labyrinth,

126
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,469
and pulled it while walking inside.

127
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,969
On the way back, all he needed was to follow the string.

128
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,669
I see.

129
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,069
Then, we should do the same thing.

130
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,669
Yeah, we should.

131
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,469
You ladies do not have to do it.

132
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,470
Right, Conan?

133
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:54,570
Right.

134
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,069
Hey look, I think we passed here once already!

135
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,970
Okay, then I think we should've turned right on that corner, not left.

136
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,469
You're all right, Mitsuhiko?

137
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,069
Don't you worry.

138
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,270
I wouldn't catch a cold such an important time.

139
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,769
Don't know if this is enough, the yarns.

140
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,969
Well, I think it's showing how close we got to the exit.

141
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,670
Let me help you guys!

142
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,469
Sorry, guys.

143
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,969
Don't worry, man!

144
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,569
Our job is to find a way to get out of here.

145
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,569
Your job is to solve the riddle, so just keep thinking.

146
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,770
Genta.

147
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,969
That's right! Every man has his own specialty, right?

148
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,369
Mitsuhiko.

149
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,770
You guys...

150
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,869
-What's wrong? -The time is over now, isn't it?

151
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,469
No, I just solved the second riddle. But...

152
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,169
Hey, guys, look!

153
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,269
There, that guy.

154
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,770
It's just straight up ahead!

155
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,569
"East Mansion" -We're save.

156
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,970
That was scary.

157
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,669
Yuriko!

158
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,369
-What? -What?

159
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,469
Yuriko, are you all right? Are you hurt?

160
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,769
You jerk!

161
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,569
You planned to kidnap her from the beginning, didn't you?

162
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,669
Certainly not.

163
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,970
I just kept Ms. Yuriko away from the pitfall. That's all.

164
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,969
I just screamed because he grabbed my arms all of a sudden.

165
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,069
I'm so sorry for causing you trouble.

166
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,269
I really don't know what to say.

167
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,569
Actually, it was pretty fun, wasn't it?

168
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,570
Oh, yes.

169
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:37,969
It was just like a little adventure, you know.

170
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,869
Right, Conan?

171
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,570
Yeah, it was.

172
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,269
Edogawa, I remember you were saying you solve the second riddle.

173
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,169
Yeah. But we got only three hours or so.

174
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,969
We can no longer see the treasures.

175
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,469
-Why not? -Why not?

176
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,569
"The tail becomes the head"

177
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,269
is telling us to head towards that direction, which is north.

178
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,469
And also, "rat" means midnight.

179
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,769
So in order to open the North Angel Tower,

180
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,669
we have to wait until midnight tonight,

181
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,169
but our challenge ends at 9 pm tonight.

182
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,570
No way!

183
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:18,669
Mr. Clock, you knew the answer of the first part of the riddle, right?

184
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,670
What?

185
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:20,869
That's why you just saved Yuriko

186
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,869
and let the rest of us fall into the pitfall

187
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,169
after finding the black crystal.

188
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,069
No. You planned to get in our way, didn't you?

189
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,769
Less than 3 hours left,

190
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,970
I'm still hoping from my heart that you to solve the riddle.

191
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,639
"North Mansion."

192
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:55,153
Here.

193
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,942
One more hour left.

194
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:04,542
There must be a way to open the gate

195
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:06,343
of the North Angel Tower somehow.

196
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,642
Everyone is trying hard.

197
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:12,143
Think...

198
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:16,742
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

199
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:19,242
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

200
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:21,743
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

201
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:28,443
The angel is scary.

202
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:32,742
No way.

203
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:34,143
But if it's true, then...

204
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:44,942
I see. Now I get it!

205
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:46,142
A ladder!

206
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,543
Somebody, get me a ladder!

207
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,042
Excuse me, where's a ladder?

208
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:56,642
You need it at the North Angel Tower, the direction of "rat", right?

209
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,942
No, I need it in the East Angel. East!

210
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:00,043
East?

211
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,243
"East Angel Tower."

212
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:23,143
-Be careful, Conan! -Good luck!

213
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:45,143
As I thought.

214
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:49,443
The wait is over. Here comes the flute!

215
00:13:56,943 --> 00:13:59,942
Now, what am I going to see

216
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:03,243
when this light hits the Angel in the direction of "rat".

217
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:09,142
An angel will come down and play the flute of the black crystal

218
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:11,343
to show us the treasures.

219
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,442
Hey, it's over there.

220
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,942
An angel has come down to the forest!

221
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,942
-What? -Are you serious?

222
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:34,242
It's the shadow.

223
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:36,242
The shadow of the angel, playing the flute!

224
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,942
"The song of the angel is my very treasure", right?

225
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,942
It's on the hill where the charcoal burner's lodge is.

226
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:44,842
That's where "the song of angel" came down!

227
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,342
I got it! We still got 30 minutes.

228
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:50,143
Now let's go!

229
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,543
Mr. Clock?

230
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,042
It is Yuriko's treasure!

231
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:07,742
You're an adult. Good adults don't steal things!

232
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,342
Mr. Clock.

233
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,543
No, it's not that. Yuri...

234
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:16,543
Do not interrupt me. There's no time.

235
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:33,543
Oh, no!

236
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:35,643
No more labyrinth, please!

237
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:51,443
-I can't see! -I can't see!

238
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,542
This is Mr. Gozo Isegawa's,

239
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:58,743
Yuriko's great-grandfather's treasures, isn't it?

240
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:02,443
What is that?

241
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:07,442
The game is over, Mr. Clock.

242
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:09,842
Tell us the truth.

243
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,342
I know you were trying to get these treasures from the beginning.

244
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:14,642
You were Mr. Isegawa's secretary.

245
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:16,542
You heard and solved the all the riddles

246
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,442
before anybody else, right?

247
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:19,642
Solved everything...

248
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:23,942
Yeah, but in the same way as I did, in the wrong way.

249
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:27,242
The fact that he told us the riddles in the evening shows that.

250
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:30,042
I'm sorry but it's not time yet.

251
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:32,042
If he presents the riddle at 9 pm,

252
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:33,542
the challenger has to wait until the noon of the next day,

253
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:36,342
to get into the North Angel Tower.

254
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,742
When the challenger realized the second question,

255
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:41,342
in which he has to go into the North Angel Tower.

256
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:44,342
But the earliest he can get into the Tower is the midnight of that day.

257
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:45,742
So no matter how hard you try,

258
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:48,542
there's no way you can break it within 24 hours.

259
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:51,042
No! It wasn't me...

260
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,242
But if he really wanted the treasure,

261
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:57,742
he could've tried his deduction

262
00:16:57,743 --> 00:16:59,642
and realized the flaw in the riddle, don't you think?

263
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:04,042
Sure he could, but he didn't.

264
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:07,142
Because it would be a crime if he snatched the treasure!

265
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:10,742
He wanted to have the treasure officially.

266
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,542
Officially...

267
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:14,242
What I'm trying to say is

268
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:17,443
he is the one with the 18th right of inheritance.

269
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:23,442
It makes sense that he was watching us, interfering with us,

270
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,542
erasing all the clues the previous challengers left,

271
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:28,342
because he was waiting for his turn.

272
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:34,942
No! It was Master's, Mr. Isegawa's, will to set the riddle time at 9 pm.

273
00:17:34,943 --> 00:17:37,242
Yeah, right. Who would believe that?

274
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:40,142
I would! Because...

275
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,142
Because that knife wasn't to hurt us,

276
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,342
but to make us realize the presence of the high-voltage current.

277
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:47,642
The footsteps sounded like it was an adult.

278
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:49,942
He is the only adult in here!

279
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,142
I don't think he was trying to monitor or interfere with us.

280
00:17:52,143 --> 00:17:55,842
I think he was trying to protect Yuriko and us.

281
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,042
Now, please, be careful.

282
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,942
Some of the security systems are actually quite dangerous.

283
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:05,142
I think so too. Mr. Clock isn't a bad person.

284
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:07,342
Yuriko!

285
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,943
When I was in that room...

286
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,342
Okay, Fair enough.

287
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:33,242
Yuriko's parents gave up on their grandfather and left the house.

288
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,242
Ai, I don't think that's...

289
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:37,442
Because of his nature of hating people.

290
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,642
There's no way such person

291
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:41,842
would tell his secret to a stranger even if he's the secretary.

292
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:44,642
So, my point is Mr. Clock is related to Mr. Isegawa.

293
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:47,642
He's related to my great-grandfather.

294
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,742
But at the same time, he was also someone Mr. Isegawa hated so much

295
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,942
so that he had to lose his name,

296
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,242
execute his master's will,

297
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:58,042
and remain in this mansion until someone solves the riddle.

298
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:01,542
There's only one person we can think of here.

299
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,342
Probably, you are...

300
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,842
Okay, that's enough!

301
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:09,142
It wasn't the gold blocks Mr. Clock was trying to reach!

302
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:10,243
It was that.

303
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:15,342
Yuriko?

304
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:18,942
No! It's Mr. Isegawa's granddaughter,

305
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:20,742
Which is also Mr. Clock's wife.

306
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:25,242
What? So that means Mr. Clock is Yuriko's...

307
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:26,742
He's Yuriko's father.

308
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:30,942
He's someone Mr. Isegawa hated the most but also related to him.

309
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:36,743
Yuriko's father must be the one because he ran away with his wife!

310
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:43,942
Mr. Isegawa loved his granddaughter, Yuriko's mother, so much.

311
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:48,042
He said she reminded him of his wife a lot.

312
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:53,142
So, he was desperate to get her back when we ran away from him.

313
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:54,143
"Grandfather."

314
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,642
Around that time, he had a lot of connections

315
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,242
with the underground community.

316
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:01,742
I didn't know what he would do if he got mad.

317
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,842
So I decided to leave my wife and Yuriko who was just born,

318
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:07,742
to protect them.

319
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:09,442
I made a deal with Mr. Isegawa.

320
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:13,042
I work for him so he leaves my family alone.

321
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:15,242
To ease his anger, it was necessary to serve him

322
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:18,443
with all my heart and soul.

323
00:20:19,643 --> 00:20:22,943
Master, it's getting windy now.

324
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:26,943
I know but I like doing this.

325
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,342
And one day I realized,

326
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:36,942
he truly loved his family

327
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,842
from the bottom of his heart.

328
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:41,942
He didn't know the way to show it well.

329
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:44,842
Raging Bull was a difficult

330
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,942
but kind old man who valued his family.

331
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:51,442
And it was last year that Mr. Isegawa suddenly started saying that

332
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:55,142
he wanted to settle with his granddaughter or Yuriko's mother.

333
00:20:55,143 --> 00:21:00,642
So I looked for my family and found out about my wife's death.

334
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:03,442
Mr. Isegawa collapsed rapidly with disappointment

335
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:06,142
and died with the riddle.

336
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:09,242
Presentation of the riddle is 9 pm.

337
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:12,442
If the riddle is solved, you are free.

338
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:14,943
Forgive me, Matsunaka.

339
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:21,542
I'm Yoshito Matsunaka,

340
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:23,143
Yuriko's father.

341
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:28,942
Your mother made that riddle when she was a child.

342
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:30,442
Mom made it?

343
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:34,442
Yes. So great-granddad chose that riddle

344
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:36,542
because there was only one person who would know the answer.

345
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:40,743
It's you, because you're her daughter.

346
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:45,842
Dad!

347
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:48,442
Yuriko. Sorry.

348
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,743
I'm sorry. Yuriko.

349
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:27,842
Later, Mr. Clock decided to change the Angel's Mansion

350
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:31,342
into a theme park of bulls and labyrinth,

351
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:35,742
simply because Yuriko said it was her great-grandfather's dream.

352
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:37,043
Haibara.

353
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:41,542
I think so too.

354
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:44,742
Probably, Mr. Isegawa made that huge labyrinth secretly,

355
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:48,142
to please his kids.

356
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:51,242
And also, to rebuild his family relationship.

357
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:53,143
Now, his dream has finally come true.

358
00:23:58,043 --> 00:24:00,842
"Next Episode" -A peace sign?

359
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:02,442
Smile!

360
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:04,442
What is this?

361
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,543
"Comedian. Stage name: Smiley Peace."

362
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:08,742
Smiley Peace?

363
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,742
Is that a dying message?

364
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:14,542
He was saying Mr. Mizuhara was more important than his own life, I heard.

365
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:16,543
More than his own life?

366
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:22,542
If that's so, then that dying message makes sense!

367
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:28,043
Next Conan, "The Man Who Called the Ambulance".

368
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:45,942
Next Conan's Hint:

369
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,242
"Peace sign."

370
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:50,042
Next week, you'll see Officer Takagi that you've never seen before!

371
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:51,142
Is that true?

372
00:24:51,143 --> 00:24:52,943
Yeah, kind of.
