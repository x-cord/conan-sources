1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
"Beika Aquarium"

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,100
The dolphins were cute, weren't they?

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,200
They were really leaping, weren't they?

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Super powerful, weren't they?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,600
But, Dr. Agasa sure is late.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,700
I wonder how far he went to park the car?

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,700
He probably went to Yakisobuns!

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,000
There's a hamburger shop called Yakisobuns

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,400
near the parking lot you see.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm sure he was lured by the smell and went to eat it.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Because somebody keeps bugging him to go on a diet.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,200
So, Dr. Agasa doesn't get to eat lunch or dinner then.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
Yakisobuns, sounds good!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,900
I want to eat some too!

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,300
Same here!

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,200
Don't worry.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,600
They have parfaits with bananas shaped like dolphins,

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,700
scallop pastas served on sea otter plates,

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,600
and a lot of other cute, delicious dishes here at this cafe too.

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,500
You sure know a lot about this place.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,600
Why do you know so much?

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400
Well, because...

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,300
I smelled it.

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,300
You suddenly ended up coming here today didn't you, Ran?

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,300
Did you come here before?

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,700
I got it!

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,400
You came here on a date with your boyfriend.

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,500
It's nothing like that.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,300
I just came here with him.

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,100
-She's blushing. -I said, that's not it.

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,200
If you came here with her before

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,500
you should've gone to another aquarium, no?

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,200
When I came here before,

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,800
so many things went on that I didn't get to see the place like I wanted to.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Who are you texting anyway?

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,600
Who else but the fatso?

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,900
"Incoming text message. Ai Haibara"

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,600
Text mail?

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Just how long are you going to keep on eating?

40
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,200
She knows.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,700
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

42
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,400
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,300
An underwater corridor that is like the bottom of the sea.

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
The shark witnesses the incident.

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,000
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,700
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,000
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:10,194
"Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 1)"

49
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:14,494
Amazing!

50
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,394
There are so many kinds of fishes!

51
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,994
It's like we're in the ocean?

52
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,876
It's a shark, shark!

53
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,276
Awesome!

54
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,776
How big!

55
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:32,276
They're just like sharks,

56
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:34,076
that's what a detective is.

57
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,576
How nostalgic.

58
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:40,076
That Holmes freak and self-loving super snob.

59
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:43,476
Not even a year has passed since then

60
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:45,276
but it seems like such a long time ago.

61
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:49,176
I wonder if back then...

62
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:54,376
he already liked me.

63
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:59,676
Sorry to keep you waiting.

64
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:00,776
Dr. Agasa!

65
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,476
You're more than late!

66
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,876
The dolphin show's finished.

67
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,176
You got green dried seaweed between your teeth!

68
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,876
You were at Yakisobuns after all.

69
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:19,976
Come to think of it, I waited here back then too.

70
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:21,976
In front of this shark.

71
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:29,176
You're late.

72
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:32,176
How rude to tell me to come and be late.

73
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:33,576
Sorry... really sorry.

74
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,176
A lot of things came up, you see!

75
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:39,176
Rather, why didn't you wait for me by the entrance?

76
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:40,976
I had to look all over for you.

77
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:44,076
I had this great urge to come see the shark, you see.

78
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,576
"Mom. About dinner." "Sonoko. I'm getting better. Thank you."

79
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:50,376
It's text mail from Sonoko.

80
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:53,676
She seems to have recovered quite a bit from her cold.

81
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:55,676
I see.

82
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:05,876
Okay then, let's get on with it, shall we?

83
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:07,776
Preliminary check of the what-you-ma-call plan?

84
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:09,876
It's not a what-you-ma-call plan!

85
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,976
It's the great coincidental two lovers meet again

86
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,276
at the aquarium project!

87
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:21,776
First, I invite Dad to come to this aquarium with me.

88
00:06:21,776 --> 00:06:25,176
He meets Mom in this fantasy filled space

89
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,176
where the fish are swimming about!

90
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:30,476
They recall the time when they fell in love

91
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:32,176
and living apart with each other ends!

92
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:37,676
You're the one who brought this plan up to begin with, right, Shinichi?

93
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:40,276
You suggested that the aquarium would be a good place

94
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,376
because Dad likes fish!

95
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:46,576
Yeah, but Sonoko's the one who thought up the name of this plan.

96
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:49,776
But, if it was just to check this place out beforehand,

97
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,776
you could've come by yourself, right, Ran?

98
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:55,776
Well, but I never came to an aquarium

99
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,776
and I was too anxious to come here all by myself!

100
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:01,176
I know too, that you didn't want to come

101
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:04,776
to such a lovey-dovey date spot for lovers like this

102
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:07,776
with somebody like me.

103
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:12,076
But, I couldn't help it because Sonoko caught a cold

104
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:13,676
and I couldn't think of anybody else to ask, but you...

105
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:16,776
I'm not saying I didn't want to come.

106
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:19,876
Then come with me to the cafe here, okay!

107
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:23,176
They seem to have a lot of cute menu here.

108
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:27,876
Please help me out with my parents by making suggestions, okay!

109
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:29,976
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:33,776
My parents are just an excuse.

111
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:39,076
Maybe it's not such a great idea to meet in front of the sharks.

112
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,976
They don't give off good images.

113
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:43,876
The real truth is I want to come here with Shinichi.

114
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:48,076
Shinichi...

115
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:51,976
What do you think?

116
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:53,176
Think what?

117
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:55,876
My clothes, clothes!

118
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,876
I kind of really like this dress you see.

119
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,276
I guess it's nice?

120
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:03,776
Is that all?

121
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:06,576
If you want somebody to evaluate how your clothes look that badly,

122
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,976
why don't you ask your Mom?

123
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:10,876
You're having dinner with her tonight, aren't you?

124
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:14,576
Why do you know about it?

125
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:17,176
Fantastic. It's a spotted eagle ray!

126
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:23,276
There it is... Shinichi's bad character.

127
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:27,776
Although he suddenly says things like he's seen right through you,

128
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,176
he'll keep you in suspense

129
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,676
and not tell you the reason why he knows what he does.

130
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:36,476
Answer me.

131
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,776
I didn't even tell Dad or Sonoko yet

132
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:42,776
why do you know when I'm going to be seeing Mom?

133
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:46,176
Don't tell me you snuck a look at my cell phone.

134
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:49,576
After you looked at Sonoko's text mail just a while ago,

135
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:50,676
you went back one mail

136
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:53,576
and checked what came in before, right?

137
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:56,376
It's only natural to think that you have other plans today

138
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:59,776
and were confirming the time.

139
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:03,876
But, you didn't look at the cell phone display back then, did you?

140
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,176
It's easy to tell by looking at the movement of your fingers

141
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:11,076
and that the person you're communicating with is your Mom.

142
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,376
You're not answering me at all.

143
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:18,776
A fashion magazine that you normally wouldn't buy

144
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:20,176
is in your bag, right, Ran?

145
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:23,776
There's a name card stuck in between the pages

146
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:27,776
and judging from the fact that you seem to be quite confident

147
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,176
about what you're wearing today,

148
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:31,376
I'm sure that you were scouted by an agent as a reader's model,

149
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,476
and had your picture taken,

150
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:36,176
and obviously got carried away with the idea,

151
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,676
enough to buy that fashion magazine.

152
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:40,876
You can also go around bragging that your picture may be shown

153
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,576
in this corner of this magazine.

154
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:45,176
That's something to be happy about...

155
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:47,176
They wouldn't give a name card to a girl

156
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:48,976
that they just wanted to make the numbers

157
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:50,976
so it's most likely that you'll make it on the magazine.

158
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:54,276
The problem is, scouts like that would only be seen

159
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,876
on the main street of 3-chome around here.

160
00:09:56,876 --> 00:10:00,776
And it would be the long way around to come to this aquarium

161
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:04,376
The question is, why did you take that road.

162
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:08,276
You must've wanted to drop by somewhere before coming here.

163
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,876
The moment I looked at your lips,

164
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,576
I figured out the answer.

165
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:13,576
Lips?

166
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:16,376
It's a bit glossy.

167
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:20,576
Since you don't use lip cream,

168
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:23,776
you must've eaten some oily food.

169
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:27,476
There are fast food stores along that main street

170
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:30,776
so it's thinkable that you had a hamburger

171
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:33,976
to make up for the breakfast you missed.

172
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:37,076
But, since you were all for eating at the cafe here,

173
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,676
so I guess that's not it.

174
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:41,176
If so, the only thing thinkable is,

175
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:44,376
you took pieces of test foods

176
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,176
at the supermarket try-out corner!

177
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:50,576
That supermarket has a sufficient amount of try-out food corners

178
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:52,876
and today happens to be their bargain day.

179
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:54,776
You probably went there

180
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:57,676
to check out some side dishes for dinner,

181
00:10:57,676 --> 00:11:02,176
which prices may come down even more later, right?

182
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:03,776
If so,

183
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:06,576
you're planning to use those side dishes

184
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:09,976
for your Dad's dinner tonight.

185
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:14,076
Why would you who are thrifty and a good cook do something like that?

186
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:16,476
Because you have no time to be doing so.

187
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:21,876
Because you promised to have dinner with somebody tonight.

188
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,476
Most naturally you're going to proudly wear those clothes

189
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,976
that caught the eyes of the scout that called out to you.

190
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:29,276
Of course the person you're going to dinner with

191
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:31,476
isn't Sonoko who has a cold.

192
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:33,876
Which means the only one left,

193
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:37,076
and judging from the way you looked when checking your text mail

194
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:40,576
that partner's got to be your Mom!

195
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:47,376
It seems you have other reasons for not being able to cook though.

196
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:50,576
Oh, and just because you came here

197
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,176
despite being late since your picture was taken

198
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:55,576
don't run anymore today, okay?

199
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:56,776
Why not?

200
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,376
That's because well...

201
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:03,276
It'll make you sad.

202
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,876
Why is running going to make me sad?

203
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:09,376
Oh, well, just make sure you don't run.

204
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,976
My name is "Ran" you know!

205
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:15,176
So, I was born to run.

206
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:17,576
Shut up already!

207
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:19,376
Okay, if you want it that way.

208
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,876
Ran, go back to the entrance and get the staff for me!

209
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:29,576
Quick!

210
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:31,476
Please let me through!

211
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:33,076
Shinichi.

212
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:47,053
I'm telling you, let me through.

213
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:54,253
Hey, are you all right?

214
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,553
Back off!

215
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:57,053
Pull away a bit more.

216
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:02,653
No good. No pulse already.

217
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,453
One pierce through the heart.

218
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,853
The murder weapon is that knife

219
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:13,753
that's sticking out of that convenience store bag.

220
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:14,853
Shinichi!

221
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:18,053
I brought the staff!

222
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:21,253
Close off the doorway of this aquarium immediately

223
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:23,553
and call the police!

224
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,753
The police?

225
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:26,053
Hurry!

226
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:27,353
Okay.

227
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:31,153
Make sure nobody goes near the corpse.

228
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:32,653
Corpse?

229
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,953
Don't tell me he's dead?

230
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:39,753
Yeah, he was stabbed by someone in the aquarium.

231
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,453
But, how?

232
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,053
We heard no scream or anything.

233
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,653
And yet, how'd you know?

234
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:48,353
I smelled it.

235
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:55,353
Red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin that carries oxygen

236
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:58,253
and its main substance is iron.

237
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:00,553
Well, when you lick a wound,

238
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,853
it tastes like rusty iron, doesn't it?

239
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:05,753
So, naturally it would smell like iron too.

240
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:08,153
I didn't smell anything though.

241
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:10,853
Just like a shark.

242
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:14,553
The shark's sense of smell is able to detect

243
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:18,153
even a drop of blood that has been diluted to 1/100.

244
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:20,353
They're sense of hearing is even more superior,

245
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:23,253
and they can hear an irregular low-frequency sound

246
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:25,153
of below 40 hertz from a distance of 2 kilometers away,

247
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:27,953
approach their prey with their sense of smell

248
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:29,953
that I just mentioned,

249
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,753
and they determine the precise location and go for it.

250
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:36,953
After smelling blood they go to the scene

251
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:40,953
and with all the faculties they possess they determine who the perp is.

252
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:43,753
Once they bite, they use their sharp teeth called evidence

253
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:47,053
and sink it deep into the perp until he gives himself in.

254
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:53,253
That's what a detective is.

255
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:00,253
I see.

256
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:04,053
The bossy youth who took charge of the crime scene

257
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:07,853
was you after all, Shinichi Kudo.

258
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:11,553
I just happened to be at the scene with Ran, so I couldn't help myself.

259
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:15,753
I asked around to see if there were any eye-witnesses of the perp

260
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:17,653
but, no luck.

261
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:22,753
The two of you dating at an aquarium?

262
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:24,253
Does it look that way?

263
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:26,853
It's nothing like that at all!

264
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:28,253
I was only playing!

265
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,653
He'll really think that's what it was

266
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:32,053
if we get all worked up about it, right?

267
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:35,953
How can you be that way when a person was just found dead?

268
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:42,153
It seems that the murder weapon is the knife that is beside the corpse.

269
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:43,653
The perp seems to have stabbed him

270
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:45,353
using the knife that was inside the convenience store bag.

271
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:46,753
The perp probably did so

272
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:50,753
to prevent the blood of the victim splattering on him.

273
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:53,153
The knife was placed sideways in the bag,

274
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,553
so that it could pierce right through the heart

275
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,953
without being blocked by the bones.

276
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:59,953
In addition, to make sure that a large amount of blood wouldn't splatter

277
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:04,053
the perp covered the knife with the jacket

278
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:06,253
and pulled it out carefully finally hiding the wound with the jacket

279
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:07,953
and left.

280
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:10,953
Well, then the victim probably would've shouted,

281
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:13,153
so I'm sure there were eye-witnesses around?

282
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:16,553
No, please look in back of his neck.

283
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:21,453
There's a trace of a stun gun being pushed against his neck.

284
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,153
If he was unconscious before he was stabbed,

285
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:25,953
he wouldn't have uttered a word.

286
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:30,053
When I got to him, there was still a bit of blood flowing,

287
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:32,553
so I think he was stabbed only a few minutes before that.

288
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:36,053
By the way, the stun gun was inside the inner pocket of his jacket.

289
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:39,653
This is it.

290
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:41,253
The perp probably said something

291
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,753
like there's a weird looking fish at the bottom of the aquarium

292
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,953
and made the victim look to the bottom inside.

293
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:50,353
Then, when the victim leaned against the rim of the fish tank to look in,

294
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:52,753
the perp probably pushed the stun gun against the back of the victim's head

295
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:54,753
rendered him unconscious.

296
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:56,753
That way, there would be no exaggerated movements,

297
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:59,253
and the victim would just slump down in place,

298
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:02,353
which after, the perp could stab him without making a scene.

299
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:06,853
Then, the victim may have known the killer.

300
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:10,953
There were no driver's license or name card in his wallet,

301
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:13,853
so first thing, we would have to identify the victim.

302
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:15,953
As to that...

303
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:20,253
the name of the victim is Kunihito Shumoto, age 26.

304
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:23,253
He part-times at a service station in Haido-cho.

305
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:24,853
It seems that he asked for a day off

306
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:27,353
saying that he had something to do today.

307
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:31,853
Therefore, I think that the victim came here with his girlfriend.

308
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:36,953
A girl about 5'4", wearing a mini skirt, who loves dolphins.

309
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,253
How do you know all that?

310
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:42,453
There was a cell phone inside the victim's pocket,

311
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:46,953
so I chose a number at random from his list of contacts!

312
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:49,253
"I found a cell phone,

313
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:51,353
but would you know who the owner is?"

314
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,353
I left a message like so.

315
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:56,253
That's how I got the name.

316
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:57,453
So I went on and asked,

317
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:00,153
"Would you know where the owner is so I can deliver it?"

318
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:03,953
Then she told me where he was part-timing

319
00:18:03,953 --> 00:18:06,053
so I called there too.

320
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:09,553
I told him not to do that on his own discretion though.

321
00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:11,253
No...

322
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:12,953
No need for worry!

323
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:14,953
Because I said that they should call the police

324
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:19,353
the next time they received a similar type of call.

325
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:20,553
You're really...

326
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:22,853
Then, you found out about the girl that the victim could've been with

327
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,253
at the place he part-timed?

328
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:28,253
No. I looked at the receipt that was inside the wallet of the victim.

329
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,753
The store's a cafe inside this aquarium.

330
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:36,353
The time's about 15 minutes before I found the corpse.

331
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,853
The details on the receipt show

332
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:40,953
one cup each of black tea and coffee

333
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,553
so, there's no mistake that he was with someone.

334
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:47,053
The time was 5 minutes before the dolphin show began

335
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:50,753
so, it seems they were killing time at the cafe till the time of the show.

336
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:56,353
A dolphin key holder was shown on it too,

337
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:58,653
but the victim had no such thing on him.

338
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:02,253
So, I can only think that he gave it to his dolphin-loving girlfriend.

339
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:04,453
Then how did you come up with her being around 5'4" tall

340
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:06,853
and wearing a mini skirt?

341
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:10,053
Well, I guess you wouldn't be able to understand yet, Ran.

342
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:13,453
What's that suppose to mean? How rude!

343
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,153
Just what do you mean, Shinichi?

344
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:22,553
From around the victim's shoulder,

345
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:25,953
elbow and thigh,

346
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:29,453
you can smell the fragrance of a woman's perfume, can't you?

347
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,853
The places where a woman puts on perfume

348
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:33,353
are the back of the ear lobes,

349
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:35,053
the back side of the hair,

350
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:37,153
the wrists, the sides of the stomach,

351
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:41,553
the hem of their skirts, the ankles of their feet and et cetera

352
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:44,053
but if the smell of perfume got on the victim,

353
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:46,353
when his woman companion walked hand in hand with him,

354
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,053
the perfume that smells on his shoulder

355
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,553
would've been the perfume she placed

356
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,653
behind her ear lobes and behind her hair

357
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:55,953
The victim is about 6' tall,

358
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:58,253
so judging from where the smell of the perfume is,

359
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:01,253
the woman would be about 5'4" tall.

360
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:04,753
Then, taking into consideration she may have been wearing high heels

361
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:07,253
being that she was on a date, subtract about 2 to 3 inches

362
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:10,353
making her about 5'2" tall.

363
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:13,353
The smell of perfume on his elbow is the perfume that was on her wrist,

364
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:17,953
and the smell on his thigh is probably what came from the hem of her skirt,

365
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:20,753
so judging from the location and the height of the woman,

366
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,653
she would've been wearing a mini skirt.

367
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:31,953
Well, people usually only put perfume on one part of their bodies, though.

368
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:35,453
Then, are you saying that the woman is not used to using perfume?

369
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:38,553
Not always so...

370
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:40,753
It could be that she always wears the same perfume

371
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,953
so her nose is used to it

372
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:47,853
and she is under the impression that she needs to use more.

373
00:20:47,853 --> 00:20:49,453
Mom said so.

374
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:52,253
So, Ran, take care not to put too much on too.

375
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:54,053
None of your business!

376
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:58,353
But, why is that woman not showing up?

377
00:20:58,353 --> 00:21:00,953
After all, her boyfriend's been murdered.

378
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:04,653
I wonder maybe they've just started going out together

379
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:07,453
and she doesn't want to get involved.

380
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:11,653
Or, maybe it's because she's the one who stabbed him.

381
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:14,653
Please collect all the cell phones,

382
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:19,853
cameras and videos of everyone here in this aquarium!

383
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,853
Maybe the scene when the perp stabbed the victim

384
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,453
has coincidentally been recorded.

385
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:25,953
I guess so.

386
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,253
"No entry"

387
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,653
Shinichi.

388
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:32,253
There are more than 100 here!

389
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:35,353
Are you going to check the images in all these devices?

390
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:38,153
Moreover,

391
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:40,853
most of the pictures are of fish.

392
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:42,553
I would think so.

393
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,953
"Kunihiro Shumoto. Incoming call"

394
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,653
"Kunihiro Shumoto"

395
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:47,453
"Incoming call"

396
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:50,153
Why are the phones ringing one after the other?

397
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:52,053
Before you came, Inspector,

398
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:55,453
I text mailed out to the people on the contact list of the victim's phone.

399
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:58,553
I'm calling the people who haven't responded to the mail,

400
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:00,853
one after the other now...

401
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,053
If I tell them that the police would be checking the picture,

402
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:06,853
I'm sure they'd all switch on their cell phones.

403
00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:11,353
Then, let's call the three hear what they have to say!

404
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:17,053
As well as ask them why they're ignoring his phone calls as well.

405
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:45,153
"Next Episode" -Nao's ex-boyfriend was murdered?

406
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:48,653
It's been a year since they split, though.

407
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:52,653
I was just picked up by him last week.

408
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:55,353
Ran, will you lend me your cell phone?

409
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:56,953
Don't break it.

410
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:59,753
Because I finally got Dad to buy it for me.

411
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:03,253
I see, that's why the perp chose it.

412
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:11,853
Next Conan, "Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 2)"

413
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:30,253
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:32,453
"Gloves"

415
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:33,453
A surprised re-encounter.

416
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,253
Lovey-dovey revitalization strategy.

417
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:36,853
It ain't gonna work anyway.
