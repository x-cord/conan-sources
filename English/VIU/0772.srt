1
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,800
"Beika Aquarium"

2
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,600
The dolphins were cute, weren't they?

3
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,700
They were really leaping, weren't they?

4
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,500
Super powerful, weren't they?

5
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,100
But, Dr. Agasa sure is late.

6
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,200
I wonder how far he went to park the car?

7
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
He probably went to Yakisobuns!

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,500
There's a hamburger shop called Yakisobuns

9
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,900
near the parking lot you see.

10
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,300
I'm sure he was lured by the smell and went to eat it.

11
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Because somebody keeps bugging him to go on a diet.

12
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,700
So, Dr. Agasa doesn't get to eat lunch or dinner then.

13
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,500
Yakisobuns, sounds good!

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,400
I want to eat some too!

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
Same here!

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,700
Don't worry.

17
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,100
They have parfaits with bananas shaped like dolphins,

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,200
scallop pastas served on sea otter plates,

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,100
and a lot of other cute, delicious dishes here at this cafe too.

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,000
You sure know a lot about this place.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,100
Why do you know so much?

22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,900
Well, because...

23
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,800
I smelled it.

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You suddenly ended up coming here today didn't you, Ran?

25
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,800
Did you come here before?

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,200
I got it!

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,900
You came here on a date with your boyfriend.

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,000
It's nothing like that.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,800
I just came here with him.

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,600
-She's blushing. -I said, that's not it.

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,700
If you came here with her before

32
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,000
you should've gone to another aquarium, no?

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,700
When I came here before,

34
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,300
so many things went on that I didn't get to see the place like I wanted to.

35
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,900
Who are you texting anyway?

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,100
Who else but the fatso?

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,400
"Incoming text message. Ai Haibara"

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,100
Text mail?

39
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Just how long are you going to keep on eating?

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,700
She knows.

41
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,200
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,900
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

43
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,800
An underwater corridor that is like the bottom of the sea.

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
The shark witnesses the incident.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,500
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,200
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,500
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,900
"Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 1)"

49
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,200
Amazing!

50
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,100
There are so many kinds of fishes!

51
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,700
It's like we're in the ocean?

52
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,300
It's a shark, shark!

53
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,700
Awesome!

54
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,200
How big!

55
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,700
They're just like sharks,

56
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,500
that's what a detective is.

57
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,000
How nostalgic.

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,500
That Holmes freak and self-loving super snob.

59
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,900
Not even a year has passed since then

60
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,700
but it seems like such a long time ago.

61
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,600
I wonder if back then...

62
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,800
he already liked me.

63
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

64
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,200
Dr. Agasa!

65
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,900
You're more than late!

66
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,300
The dolphin show's finished.

67
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
You got green dried seaweed between your teeth!

68
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,300
You were at Yakisobuns after all.

69
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,400
Come to think of it, I waited here back then too.

70
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
In front of this shark.

71
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,600
You're late.

72
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
How rude to tell me to come and be late.

73
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
Sorry... really sorry.

74
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,600
A lot of things came up, you see!

75
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Rather, why didn't you wait for me by the entrance?

76
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
I had to look all over for you.

77
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,500
I had this great urge to come see the shark, you see.

78
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,000
"Mom. About dinner." "Sonoko. I'm getting better. Thank you."

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
It's text mail from Sonoko.

80
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,100
She seems to have recovered quite a bit from her cold.

81
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
I see.

82
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,300
Okay then, let's get on with it, shall we?

83
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,200
Preliminary check of the what-you-ma-call plan?

84
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,300
It's not a what-you-ma-call plan!

85
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,400
It's the great coincidental two lovers meet again

86
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,700
at the aquarium project!

87
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
First, I invite Dad to come to this aquarium with me.

88
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,600
He meets Mom in this fantasy filled space

89
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
where the fish are swimming about!

90
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,900
They recall the time when they fell in love

91
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,600
and living apart with each other ends!

92
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,100
You're the one who brought this plan up to begin with, right, Shinichi?

93
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,700
You suggested that the aquarium would be a good place

94
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,800
because Dad likes fish!

95
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, but Sonoko's the one who thought up the name of this plan.

96
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,200
But, if it was just to check this place out beforehand,

97
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
you could've come by yourself, right, Ran?

98
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Well, but I never came to an aquarium

99
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
and I was too anxious to come here all by myself!

100
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
I know too, that you didn't want to come

101
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,200
to such a lovey-dovey date spot for lovers like this

102
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,200
with somebody like me.

103
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,500
But, I couldn't help it because Sonoko caught a cold

104
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,100
and I couldn't think of anybody else to ask, but you...

105
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm not saying I didn't want to come.

106
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,300
Then come with me to the cafe here, okay!

107
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,600
They seem to have a lot of cute menu here.

108
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,300
Please help me out with my parents by making suggestions, okay!

109
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,400
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
My parents are just an excuse.

111
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,500
Maybe it's not such a great idea to meet in front of the sharks.

112
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,400
They don't give off good images.

113
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,300
The real truth is I want to come here with Shinichi.

114
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
Shinichi...

115
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,400
What do you think?

116
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Think what?

117
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,300
My clothes, clothes!

118
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,300
I kind of really like this dress you see.

119
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
I guess it's nice?

120
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,200
Is that all?

121
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,000
If you want somebody to evaluate how your clothes look that badly,

122
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
why don't you ask your Mom?

123
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,300
You're having dinner with her tonight, aren't you?

124
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Why do you know about it?

125
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,600
Fantastic. It's a spotted eagle ray!

126
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,700
There it is... Shinichi's bad character.

127
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,200
Although he suddenly says things like he's seen right through you,

128
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
he'll keep you in suspense

129
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,100
and not tell you the reason why he knows what he does.

130
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Answer me.

131
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,200
I didn't even tell Dad or Sonoko yet

132
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
why do you know when I'm going to be seeing Mom?

133
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,600
Don't tell me you snuck a look at my cell phone.

134
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,000
After you looked at Sonoko's text mail just a while ago,

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,100
you went back one mail

136
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,000
and checked what came in before, right?

137
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,800
It's only natural to think that you have other plans today

138
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,200
and were confirming the time.

139
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,300
But, you didn't look at the cell phone display back then, did you?

140
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,600
It's easy to tell by looking at the movement of your fingers

141
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,500
and that the person you're communicating with is your Mom.

142
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,800
You're not answering me at all.

143
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,200
A fashion magazine that you normally wouldn't buy

144
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
is in your bag, right, Ran?

145
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,200
There's a name card stuck in between the pages

146
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,200
and judging from the fact that you seem to be quite confident

147
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,600
about what you're wearing today,

148
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm sure that you were scouted by an agent as a reader's model,

149
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,900
and had your picture taken,

150
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,600
and obviously got carried away with the idea,

151
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,100
enough to buy that fashion magazine.

152
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,300
You can also go around bragging that your picture may be shown

153
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,000
in this corner of this magazine.

154
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,600
That's something to be happy about...

155
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
They wouldn't give a name card to a girl

156
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
that they just wanted to make the numbers

157
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
so it's most likely that you'll make it on the magazine.

158
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,700
The problem is, scouts like that would only be seen

159
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,300
on the main street of 3-chome around here.

160
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,200
And it would be the long way around to come to this aquarium

161
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,800
The question is, why did you take that road.

162
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,700
You must've wanted to drop by somewhere before coming here.

163
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,300
The moment I looked at your lips,

164
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,000
I figured out the answer.

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Lips?

166
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,800
It's a bit glossy.

167
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
Since you don't use lip cream,

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,200
you must've eaten some oily food.

169
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,900
There are fast food stores along that main street

170
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,200
so it's thinkable that you had a hamburger

171
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,400
to make up for the breakfast you missed.

172
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,500
But, since you were all for eating at the cafe here,

173
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,100
so I guess that's not it.

174
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,600
If so, the only thing thinkable is,

175
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,800
you took pieces of test foods

176
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,600
at the supermarket try-out corner!

177
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,000
That supermarket has a sufficient amount of try-out food corners

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,300
and today happens to be their bargain day.

179
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,200
You probably went there

180
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,100
to check out some side dishes for dinner,

181
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,600
which prices may come down even more later, right?

182
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
If so,

183
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,000
you're planning to use those side dishes

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,400
for your Dad's dinner tonight.

185
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,500
Why would you who are thrifty and a good cook do something like that?

186
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,900
Because you have no time to be doing so.

187
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Because you promised to have dinner with somebody tonight.

188
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,900
Most naturally you're going to proudly wear those clothes

189
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,400
that caught the eyes of the scout that called out to you.

190
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,700
Of course the person you're going to dinner with

191
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,900
isn't Sonoko who has a cold.

192
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,300
Which means the only one left,

193
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,500
and judging from the way you looked when checking your text mail

194
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,000
that partner's got to be your Mom!

195
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,800
It seems you have other reasons for not being able to cook though.

196
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, and just because you came here

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,600
despite being late since your picture was taken

198
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,000
don't run anymore today, okay?

199
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
Why not?

200
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,800
That's because well...

201
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,700
It'll make you sad.

202
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,300
Why is running going to make me sad?

203
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,800
Oh, well, just make sure you don't run.

204
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,400
My name is "Ran" you know!

205
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,600
So, I was born to run.

206
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Shut up already!

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
Okay, if you want it that way.

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,300
Ran, go back to the entrance and get the staff for me!

209
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,000
Quick!

210
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,900
Please let me through!

211
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,500
Shinichi.

212
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,800
I'm telling you, let me through.

213
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm telling you, let me through.

214
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
Hey, are you all right?

215
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
Back off!

216
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,000
Pull away a bit more.

217
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,600
No good. No pulse already.

218
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,400
One pierce through the heart.

219
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,800
The murder weapon is that knife

220
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,700
that's sticking out of that convenience store bag.

221
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,800
Shinichi!

222
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,000
I brought the staff!

223
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,200
Close off the doorway of this aquarium immediately

224
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,500
and call the police!

225
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,700
The police?

226
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,000
Hurry!

227
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,300
Okay.

228
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,100
Make sure nobody goes near the corpse.

229
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,600
Corpse?

230
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,900
Don't tell me he's dead?

231
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,700
Yeah, he was stabbed by someone in the aquarium.

232
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,400
But, how?

233
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,000
We heard no scream or anything.

234
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
And yet, how'd you know?

235
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,300
I smelled it.

236
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,300
Red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin that carries oxygen

237
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,200
and its main substance is iron.

238
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,500
Well, when you lick a wound,

239
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,800
it tastes like rusty iron, doesn't it?

240
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,700
So, naturally it would smell like iron too.

241
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
I didn't smell anything though.

242
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,800
Just like a shark.

243
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,500
The shark's sense of smell is able to detect

244
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,100
even a drop of blood that has been diluted to 1/100.

245
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,300
They're sense of hearing is even more superior,

246
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,200
and they can hear an irregular low-frequency sound

247
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,100
of below 40 hertz from a distance of 2 kilometers away,

248
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,900
approach their prey with their sense of smell

249
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
that I just mentioned,

250
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,700
and they determine the precise location and go for it.

251
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,900
After smelling blood they go to the scene

252
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,900
and with all the faculties they possess they determine who the perp is.

253
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,700
Once they bite, they use their sharp teeth called evidence

254
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,000
and sink it deep into the perp until he gives himself in.

255
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
That's what a detective is.

256
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
I see.

257
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,000
The bossy youth who took charge of the crime scene

258
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,800
was you after all, Shinichi Kudo.

259
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,500
I just happened to be at the scene with Ran, so I couldn't help myself.

260
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,700
I asked around to see if there were any eye-witnesses of the perp

261
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,600
but, no luck.

262
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,700
The two of you dating at an aquarium?

263
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,200
Does it look that way?

264
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,800
It's nothing like that at all!

265
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
I was only playing!

266
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,600
He'll really think that's what it was

267
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,000
if we get all worked up about it, right?

268
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,900
How can you be that way when a person was just found dead?

269
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,100
It seems that the murder weapon is the knife that is beside the corpse.

270
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,600
The perp seems to have stabbed him

271
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,300
using the knife that was inside the convenience store bag.

272
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,700
The perp probably did so

273
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,700
to prevent the blood of the victim splattering on him.

274
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,100
The knife was placed sideways in the bag,

275
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,500
so that it could pierce right through the heart

276
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,900
without being blocked by the bones.

277
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
In addition, to make sure that a large amount of blood wouldn't splatter

278
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,000
the perp covered the knife with the jacket

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
and pulled it out carefully finally hiding the wound with the jacket

280
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,900
and left.

281
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Well, then the victim probably would've shouted,

282
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,100
so I'm sure there were eye-witnesses around?

283
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,500
No, please look in back of his neck.

284
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,400
There's a trace of a stun gun being pushed against his neck.

285
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,100
If he was unconscious before he was stabbed,

286
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,900
he wouldn't have uttered a word.

287
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,000
When I got to him, there was still a bit of blood flowing,

288
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,500
so I think he was stabbed only a few minutes before that.

289
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,000
By the way, the stun gun was inside the inner pocket of his jacket.

290
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
This is it.

291
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,200
The perp probably said something

292
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,700
like there's a weird looking fish at the bottom of the aquarium

293
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,900
and made the victim look to the bottom inside.

294
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,300
Then, when the victim leaned against the rim of the fish tank to look in,

295
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,700
the perp probably pushed the stun gun against the back of the victim's head

296
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
rendered him unconscious.

297
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
That way, there would be no exaggerated movements,

298
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,200
and the victim would just slump down in place,

299
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,300
which after, the perp could stab him without making a scene.

300
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,800
Then, the victim may have known the killer.

301
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,900
There were no driver's license or name card in his wallet,

302
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,800
so first thing, we would have to identify the victim.

303
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,900
As to that...

304
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,200
the name of the victim is Kunihito Shumoto, age 26.

305
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
He part-times at a service station in Haido-cho.

306
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,800
It seems that he asked for a day off

307
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,300
saying that he had something to do today.

308
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,800
Therefore, I think that the victim came here with his girlfriend.

309
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,900
A girl about 5'4", wearing a mini skirt, who loves dolphins.

310
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,200
How do you know all that?

311
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,400
There was a cell phone inside the victim's pocket,

312
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,900
so I chose a number at random from his list of contacts!

313
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,200
"I found a cell phone,

314
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,300
but would you know who the owner is?"

315
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
I left a message like so.

316
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,200
That's how I got the name.

317
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
So I went on and asked,

318
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,100
"Would you know where the owner is so I can deliver it?"

319
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,900
Then she told me where he was part-timing

320
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,000
so I called there too.

321
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,500
I told him not to do that on his own discretion though.

322
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,200
No...

323
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,900
No need for worry!

324
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
Because I said that they should call the police

325
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,300
the next time they received a similar type of call.

326
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,500
You're really...

327
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,800
Then, you found out about the girl that the victim could've been with

328
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,200
at the place he part-timed?

329
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
No. I looked at the receipt that was inside the wallet of the victim.

330
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,700
The store's a cafe inside this aquarium.

331
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,300
The time's about 15 minutes before I found the corpse.

332
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,800
The details on the receipt show

333
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,900
one cup each of black tea and coffee

334
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,500
so, there's no mistake that he was with someone.

335
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,000
The time was 5 minutes before the dolphin show began

336
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,700
so, it seems they were killing time at the cafe till the time of the show.

337
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,300
A dolphin key holder was shown on it too,

338
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,600
but the victim had no such thing on him.

339
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,200
So, I can only think that he gave it to his dolphin-loving girlfriend.

340
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,400
Then how did you come up with her being around 5'4" tall

341
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,800
and wearing a mini skirt?

342
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, I guess you wouldn't be able to understand yet, Ran.

343
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,400
What's that suppose to mean? How rude!

344
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,100
Just what do you mean, Shinichi?

345
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
From around the victim's shoulder,

346
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,900
elbow and thigh,

347
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,400
you can smell the fragrance of a woman's perfume, can't you?

348
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,800
The places where a woman puts on perfume

349
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,300
are the back of the ear lobes,

350
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,000
the back side of the hair,

351
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,100
the wrists, the sides of the stomach,

352
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,500
the hem of their skirts, the ankles of their feet and et cetera

353
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,000
but if the smell of perfume got on the victim,

354
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,300
when his woman companion walked hand in hand with him,

355
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,000
the perfume that smells on his shoulder

356
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,500
would've been the perfume she placed

357
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,600
behind her ear lobes and behind her hair

358
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,900
The victim is about 6' tall,

359
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,200
so judging from where the smell of the perfume is,

360
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,200
the woman would be about 5'4" tall.

361
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,700
Then, taking into consideration she may have been wearing high heels

362
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,200
being that she was on a date, subtract about 2 to 3 inches

363
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,300
making her about 5'2" tall.

364
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,300
The smell of perfume on his elbow is the perfume that was on her wrist,

365
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,900
and the smell on his thigh is probably what came from the hem of her skirt,

366
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,700
so judging from the location and the height of the woman,

367
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,600
she would've been wearing a mini skirt.

368
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,900
Well, people usually only put perfume on one part of their bodies, though.

369
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,400
Then, are you saying that the woman is not used to using perfume?

370
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,500
Not always so...

371
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,700
It could be that she always wears the same perfume

372
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,900
so her nose is used to it

373
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,800
and she is under the impression that she needs to use more.

374
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,400
Mom said so.

375
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
So, Ran, take care not to put too much on too.

376
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,000
None of your business!

377
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,300
But, why is that woman not showing up?

378
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,900
After all, her boyfriend's been murdered.

379
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,600
I wonder maybe they've just started going out together

380
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,400
and she doesn't want to get involved.

381
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,600
Or, maybe it's because she's the one who stabbed him.

382
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Please collect all the cell phones,

383
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,800
cameras and videos of everyone here in this aquarium!

384
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Maybe the scene when the perp stabbed the victim

385
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
has coincidentally been recorded.

386
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,900
I guess so.

387
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,200
"No entry"

388
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,600
Shinichi.

389
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,200
There are more than 100 here!

390
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,300
Are you going to check the images in all these devices?

391
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,100
Moreover,

392
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,800
most of the pictures are of fish.

393
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,500
I would think so.

394
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,900
"Kunihiro Shumoto. Incoming call"

395
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,600
"Kunihiro Shumoto"

396
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,400
"Incoming call"

397
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,100
Why are the phones ringing one after the other?

398
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,000
Before you came, Inspector,

399
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,400
I text mailed out to the people on the contact list of the victim's phone.

400
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,500
I'm calling the people who haven't responded to the mail,

401
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,800
one after the other now...

402
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,000
If I tell them that the police would be checking the picture,

403
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm sure they'd all switch on their cell phones.

404
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,300
Then, let's call the three hear what they have to say!

405
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:50,000
As well as ask them why they're ignoring his phone calls as well.

406
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,100
"Next Episode" -Nao's ex-boyfriend was murdered?

407
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,600
It's been a year since they split, though.

408
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I was just picked up by him last week.

409
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,300
Ran, will you lend me your cell phone?

410
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,900
Don't break it.

411
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,700
Because I finally got Dad to buy it for me.

412
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,200
I see, that's why the perp chose it.

413
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Next Conan, "Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 2)"

414
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,200
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,400
"Gloves"

416
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
A surprised re-encounter.

417
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,200
Lovey-dovey revitalization strategy.

418
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,800
It ain't gonna work anyway.
