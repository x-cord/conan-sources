1
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:07,363
Look at this!

2
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:09,963
This fantastic figurine!

3
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:13,963
These beautiful numbers of georamas!

4
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:15,863
This is super!

5
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:17,163
You think so, don't you? Don't you?

6
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:19,663
The creator is Mr. Masahiro Kitajima!

7
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:23,563
He's the most focused on plastic figurine creator now.

8
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:24,963
I can't really tell what's so good about it,

9
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:27,463
because it's so small and neatly arranged.

10
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:28,763
How wretched that you

11
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:31,363
don't understand this technique.

12
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,063
How about you, Conan?

13
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:35,763
I don't know about trains and stuff

14
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:38,863
but the georamas sure are great.

15
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:42,063
Each and every branch is a perfect replica.

16
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,963
Just as would be expected of you, Conan!

17
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:48,563
Mr. Kitajima is known as a genius plastic art creator of nature.

18
00:00:48,563 --> 00:00:51,163
On top of that, his exhibition work for this year's World Tournament

19
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:52,663
has already been decided on!

20
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,363
Mr. Kitajima!

21
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,863
You're Mr. Masahiro Kitajima, aren't you?

22
00:00:57,863 --> 00:01:01,363
How can you make such splendid figurines like these?

23
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:02,963
"Masahiro Kitajima (27), Pro-modeler" -Well...

24
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,663
"Masahiro Kitajima (27), Pro-modeler" -I guess it's imagery.

25
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:07,263
The richer the image I have,

26
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:09,363
the better figurine I come up with.

27
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:12,063
I see, so it's image.

28
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:13,963
Masahiro!

29
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:17,063
"Reika Kameyama (26), Kitajima's lover" -Reika, you've come.

30
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:19,663
It's a big day for you after all.

31
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,963
Cut it out, people are watching.

32
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:25,563
Hey, hey, you guys.

33
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,563
Come look at my figure characters too.

34
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:31,963
Wow, how pretty.

35
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:34,763
The colors are so beautiful.

36
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,863
Yes. I guess so.

37
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,963
"Shunichi Morishita (25), Pro-modeler" -I think you already know

38
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:42,163
but this is the most popular robot anime around now.

39
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:45,363
I stayed up all night to make it.

40
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:46,863
Fantastic, don't you think?

41
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:49,963
How childish.

42
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:53,763
Yes, on this day, at this convention hall,

43
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:56,563
the Plastic Model Figurine Festival was being held.

44
00:01:56,563 --> 00:02:00,463
We came to watch this festival.

45
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:15,763
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

46
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:17,563
are slashed by the light of deduction.

47
00:02:17,563 --> 00:02:19,463
A crime is committed at the event hall.

48
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:21,463
The secret of the figurines is pursued.

49
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:22,863
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:24,963
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:27,363
His name is Detective Conan!

52
00:03:56,373 --> 00:04:01,473
"A Much Too Perfect Figurine"

53
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:05,673
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

54
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:08,673
Let's go home already! I'm hungry!

55
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,273
Please wait.

56
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:12,073
I wonder what color would match

57
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:14,273
the "Masked Yaiba" that I'm making now.

58
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,173
Somebody!

59
00:04:18,573 --> 00:04:19,873
Conan!

60
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,373
Hey, Conan.

61
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,173
One stab right through the chest.

62
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:38,373
He's...

63
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:41,573
Mr. Kitajima?

64
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:44,773
Hold it!

65
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:45,773
Move!

66
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,673
Are you all right? Ai, Ayumi!

67
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:59,673
Yes, I'm fine! Ai saved me.

68
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:02,273
Geez, shape up.

69
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:03,773
Sorry, sorry.

70
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,373
You heard the lady scream,

71
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:12,573
so you ran over and found Mr. Kitajima lying on the floor here.

72
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,473
Is that right?

73
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:17,273
Yeah, we found him.

74
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:20,473
The victim is Mr. Masahiro Kitajima.

75
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:24,473
Yes. He's one of Japan's top plastic art modelers!

76
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:27,873
Top modeler?

77
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,673
He's a professional at making plastic models.

78
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,473
Okay, okay, I got it.

79
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:36,673
You children go home for today, all right.

80
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:40,673
Come on, we even nabbed the perp too!

81
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,673
You mean Ai did.

82
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:44,173
Inspector Megure!

83
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:46,373
I have Mr. Hiroto here with me.

84
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:52,273
It's him! I'm sure he's the perp!

85
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:57,373
"Kenji Hiroto (32), Model Magazine Reporter" -He is Mr. Kenji Hiroto.

86
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:00,373
He says he's an editor for a plastic model toys magazine.

87
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,373
Is that correct?

88
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,273
Yeah, like I told you

89
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:08,873
I just came to interview Kitajima!

90
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:11,973
Then, why did you run away?

91
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,373
I was shocked. So I...

92
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:19,273
I mean, after all, to see Kitajima like that...

93
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:22,373
He's not the one?

94
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:26,173
No. He didn't have the murder weapon on him.

95
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:28,873
By the way, Dr. Agasa,

96
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:33,173
I think that this is something not good for children to see.

97
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:34,373
I understand.

98
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,173
Come on all of you, let's go home.

99
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:38,173
Come, come...

100
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,173
-This is just the beginning. -How lame...

101
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,773
I'm sorry, all of you.

102
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:43,673
Officer Takagi.

103
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:49,373
How long has Mr. Kitajima been dead from the time we found him?

104
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,473
Just a few minutes I guess.

105
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:54,973
Was he killed by a sharp knife after all?

106
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:58,273
Yeah, it seems to be a knife of some sort...

107
00:06:58,273 --> 00:06:59,973
You haven't found it yet?

108
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:03,473
No, though we've been looking for it right through.

109
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:05,973
The woman clerk who came to serve them didn't have anything either?

110
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:08,773
She had nothing of that sort on her.

111
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:12,873
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet.

112
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:15,573
I just know that he's the perp!

113
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,973
I wonder about that.

114
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,873
If it was only a matter of a few minutes

115
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,673
from when Mr. Kitajima was killed to the time he was discovered...

116
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,673
If that person's the perp,

117
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:28,073
it's highly likely that he has the murder weapon on him.

118
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,273
Or he may have hid it somewhere nearby.

119
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:32,873
But, it hasn't come out from anywhere.

120
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:34,373
I see.

121
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:37,273
I wonder where the murder weapon disappeared to?

122
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,173
Officer.

123
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:41,373
What should I do?

124
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:43,473
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:46,173
The Inspector would like to have a word with you,

126
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:47,973
so please wait a little while more.

127
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:50,073
The man who makes robots!

128
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:52,773
So you guys are here too.

129
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,673
What's the matter, sir?

130
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:59,073
Well, I was in the waiting room on the other side right through.

131
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:01,473
Then, I heard some commotion,

132
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:03,973
and when I went out, the person in charge was there,

133
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:07,373
saying that something terrible had happened to Mr. Kitajima.

134
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:10,573
And were you with the person in charge right through?

135
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:16,273
Yeah, he was with that person right through.

136
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:19,073
Was there a knife near Mr. Morishita?

137
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:22,973
No, not anything from him nor the waiting room.

138
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:25,073
He's not the one either?

139
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,773
Morishita.

140
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:30,673
Mr. Hiroto.

141
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:35,273
Aren't you the one who killed Mr. Kitajima, Mr. Hiroto?

142
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:37,773
-What? -What the...

143
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,373
I mean your interviews are the pits.

144
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:42,073
You take the figurines with you without permission

145
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:44,373
and touch them even if you're told not to touch them.

146
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,573
Mr. Kitajima was going around telling all the other modelers

147
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:50,773
not to accept interviews with you!

148
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:52,973
Talk for yourself, Morishita.

149
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:54,973
You're just as suspicious, you know.

150
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:59,073
I hear that you borrowed a lot of cash from Kitajima!

151
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,073
I heard that you haven't been able to pay him back for years,

152
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,373
and were even crying your eyes out lately.

153
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:06,873
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

154
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,473
Masahiro!

155
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,273
Is it really true? That Masahiro was killed?

156
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:14,373
-Hey, miss. -Masahiro, Masahiro!

157
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:16,673
Masahiro!

158
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:18,373
How could something like this have happened?

159
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,573
The real killer appears.

160
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:26,273
It's you two, Mr. Hiroto and Mr. Morishita too,

161
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:29,073
I'll bet you two are the perps.

162
00:09:29,073 --> 00:09:31,073
Give me a break.

163
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:33,273
I hear that you were having a tough time lately

164
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,773
because he wanted to break up with you.

165
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,673
We're not breaking up.

166
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:38,973
No way.

167
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:42,973
I was going to get married with Masahiro, you know!

168
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,573
I wonder about that!

169
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:47,473
You heard about it too, right, Morishita?

170
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:49,973
Oh, well, sort of.

171
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,773
You people!

172
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:54,073
Doctor, take the children.

173
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,773
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,573
-Come on, let's go! Come, come. -What? Come on, doctor.

175
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:01,473
Hurry, we're going home.

176
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,673
It was just starting and yet.

177
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:07,473
I thought that we could corner the perp, and yet...

178
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:09,773
Where's Conan?

179
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,973
Ms. Reika Kameyama.

180
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:19,573
Where were you when the incident happened?

181
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:21,473
I was out.

182
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:23,173
After I met him at the hall,

183
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:26,473
I got a text mail from Masahiro.

184
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:30,473
To wait for him at the open lot by the river near the hall.

185
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:33,573
But, he didn't show up no matter how long I waited,

186
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,773
so I came over to his waiting room

187
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,573
and this is what I see.

188
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:40,473
It's true that a text mail was sent

189
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,673
from Mr. Kitajima's cell phone to Reika.

190
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:46,073
11:25 am.

191
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,673
That's 10 minutes before the crime occurred.

192
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:54,873
Which means that Mr. Kitajima was killed after he texted this mail.

193
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,173
Conan.

194
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:00,773
The police officers are?

195
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:04,073
Yeah, there's commotion over there.

196
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:05,073
How is it?

197
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:06,573
I can't reach it.

198
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:08,873
Officer, what happened?

199
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:14,473
Something seems to be stuck between the vending machine and the wall,

200
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,973
but we can't get it out.

201
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:18,773
I think I can get it out because I'm small.

202
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:19,973
Leave it to me.

203
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:28,973
So, that's it.

204
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:30,373
Genta, a handkerchief!

205
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,273
Yeah!

206
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,873
Okay! Here goes!

207
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,273
Okay! Good work, Genta!

208
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:43,373
Yeah!

209
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:50,973
This is...

210
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,173
Blood stain?

211
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,481
Ms. Kameyama.

212
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:01,981
Does this broche look familiar to you?

213
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,581
Yes, it's mine.

214
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:07,781
There was a little blood on it.

215
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:13,381
According to forensics it's unmistakably, Mr. Kitajima's blood.

216
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,381
Oh no, I've been missing that broche from yesterday.

217
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:19,181
Right, I haven't seen it since yesterday.

218
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,181
Since when yesterday?

219
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,281
Last night.

220
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:25,081
I brought a bouquet of flowers to congratulate him.

221
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,181
Ever since then.

222
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,481
Excuse me.

223
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,381
I just remembered

224
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:35,281
but the thing is I saw you.

225
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:38,781
No. Never, I'll never part with you!

226
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:41,381
I'm going to go out in to the world

227
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,481
and make my name as a modeler.

228
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:45,581
You're just getting in my way!

229
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,581
No.

230
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:49,881
Did you have that in mind to begin with?

231
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,181
How cruel.

232
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:57,481
I'm never going to forgive you!

233
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,781
I'll kill you!

234
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:02,981
Is that correct, Ms. Kameyama?

235
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:05,881
True, I did say that.

236
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:08,181
But, I didn't do it!

237
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:12,281
So, you're the one who killed him after all.

238
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:14,481
In other words, is this how it went?

239
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,181
You received his mail,

240
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:18,281
got scared because he wanted to split with you

241
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,981
and so you went to the waiting room.

242
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,981
But you only ended up getting into an argument again.

243
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:35,881
After that you went out of the hall right away,

244
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,781
pretended to wait for Kitajima

245
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,881
and threw the murder weapon into the river!

246
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,281
I see.

247
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:47,481
Ms. Kameyama, it seems I need to hear a little more from you.

248
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:49,881
Oh no. I didn't do it!

249
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:59,181
So, that woman's the killer.

250
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:01,081
But it's a little vexing, isn't it?

251
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,481
I guess so.

252
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:05,381
They treated us like children to the very end.

253
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:09,381
Darn, I going to take my anger out on dinner!

254
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,481
The broche, splattered blood...

255
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:26,281
Something's strange after all.

256
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:28,681
Hey, you guys.

257
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:31,481
Great footwork, young lady.

258
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,181
Thank you.

259
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:34,481
What's with you?

260
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,181
Did you come to take revenge, or what?

261
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:37,481
Stop it.

262
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,981
I'm not taking him on.

263
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:42,581
I may look all right, but the fact is I'm depressed.

264
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,281
After all, I let a scandal go by.

265
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:49,381
Scandal? Are you referring to Mr. Kitajima?

266
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:51,781
Sir, what is this scandal you're talking about?

267
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:55,081
Hey, this has nothing to do with you kids.

268
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,081
See you.

269
00:14:57,781 --> 00:15:00,081
Okay, okay.

270
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,081
Please wait!

271
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,481
That is it?

272
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:07,581
Mr. Kitajima was a hero for these children.

273
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:10,581
If he had any hidden secrets,

274
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,081
will please tell them about it?

275
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,581
Dreams are best kept dreams.

276
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:22,481
No. I think it'll do these children more good to know the truth.

277
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:24,081
Well, why not?

278
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,781
He already passed away.

279
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:31,381
The thing is, there were rumors going around

280
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,781
that maybe Kitajima had a ghost modeler.

281
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:35,181
A ghost modeler?

282
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:38,381
Yeah. His natural landscapes creations

283
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:41,381
were masterpieces when compared with other modelers.

284
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:46,681
But it wasn't that he was like that to begin with.

285
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:50,181
Only, in these past few years he suddenly...

286
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,581
On top of that,

287
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:55,081
nobody's ever seen him making the figurines in person.

288
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,181
I see.

289
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,881
So, you were hiding in that waiting room

290
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,881
to confirm whether the rumor was true or not?

291
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:01,881
Yeah.

292
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:06,581
Right.

293
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:08,881
It's been bothering me from the start.

294
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:10,981
Since the time I came to this hall.

295
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,781
Conan, what's the matter?

296
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:18,681
Could this be it...

297
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:21,981
Mitsuhiko, doesn't this color look similar

298
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,181
to the color used for Mr. Kitajima's georama?

299
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:26,981
It's Masked Yaiba!

300
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:29,081
I'm using the same color

301
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:31,281
for the masked Yaiba that I'm making now too.

302
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,581
So, the finish is...

303
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:35,281
Yes, no mistake about it.

304
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:36,781
It's the same color.

305
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:39,781
I see. So, that's the story.

306
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:42,781
You're all still here?

307
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:44,681
Hurry on home.

308
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,881
Like I said, Dr. Agasa.

309
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:52,781
What is this, gathering everybody here like this?

310
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:55,881
I'm sorry. I know it's really sudden but...

311
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,081
There are several things that keep bothering me

312
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,081
as to the crime that occurred.

313
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:03,781
First of all, it's Reika's broche

314
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:06,481
that was found on the floor of the corridor.

315
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:09,981
Mr. Kitajima's blood was found on the broche.

316
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:12,881
But, please take a good look at her clothes.

317
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:15,481
There is no blood on it at all.

318
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,681
Do you think it's possible

319
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:22,081
that splattered blood would pinpoint just the broche?

320
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:25,981
Then, are you saying that someone left

321
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:28,981
the broche with blood stain on it to frame her?

322
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,681
But, that's no very likely.

323
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:34,681
And there's another strange thing.

324
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:37,781
Mr. Morishita, it's about you.

325
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:39,381
Me?

326
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:43,081
Yes, when I first met you.

327
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:45,081
This is the most popular robot anime around now.

328
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:48,881
You explained that you were working all night making a piece,

329
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,981
and your clothes were soiled with paint.

330
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:52,881
Yes, the one you're wearing.

331
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:54,381
However...

332
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:02,281
Please take a look at that robot.

333
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,681
It's what Mr. Morishita made.

334
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,381
The colors are vivid.

335
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:09,281
The colors are completely different from the color on his clothes.

336
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:11,081
Why is that?

337
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:13,981
Inside Mr. Morishita's paint case

338
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:17,581
there was paint the same color as the stain on his clothes.

339
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,381
It's this!

340
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,781
This color is for some reason

341
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:26,781
the same as the color used for Mr. Kitajima's georama.

342
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:32,281
There were rumors going around that Mr. Kitajima had a ghost modeler.

343
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:37,681
Mr. Morishita, isn't it you who was ghost modeling for him?

344
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,981
That's right.

345
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:40,981
He was making me do it!

346
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,781
My mother is ill,

347
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:45,181
so I borrowed money from Kitajima.

348
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,181
But, because of his outrageous interest my debt ballooned to no end

349
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:49,781
and I couldn't pay him back!

350
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:51,981
Then, he tells me...

351
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:54,081
If so, Morishita...

352
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:58,381
make my pieces for me too, okay?

353
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:00,981
Moreover, Mr. Kitajima was preparing

354
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,881
to enter the world tournament with your figurines.

355
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,981
Of course you'd feel bad about it, wouldn't you?

356
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:09,781
That's why you killed Mr. Kitajima.

357
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,381
No! That, and this case is totally not connected!

358
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,681
However...

359
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:19,181
if it were so, everything falls perfectly into place.

360
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:25,481
Last night, you coincidentally saw Mr. Kitajima and Reika arguing.

361
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,181
Back then, you picked up the broche

362
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,481
that Reika dropped in the corridor.

363
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:36,481
Today, you killed Mr. Kitajima,

364
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:38,681
smeared the broche with his blood

365
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:42,381
and threw it inside behind the vending machine in the corridor.

366
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,081
In order to frame Reika up as the perp!

367
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:49,681
Of course you lured Reika out by texting her mail,

368
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:53,681
and didn't forget to make sure you had an alibi too.

369
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:01,881
Please cut it out already.

370
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:05,281
You should never take something so ridiculous seriously.

371
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:07,081
I didn't do it.

372
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,981
Right, the murder weapon!

373
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,981
Where's the murder weapon?

374
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:13,881
I didn't have anything like that on me, you know!

375
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:20,081
Mr. Kitajima was known as a genius for making natural landscape.

376
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:22,681
But that was actually really about you,

377
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,681
his ghost modeler, wasn't it?

378
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:30,781
This color was found in your paint case.

379
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:32,781
Natural light green.

380
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:35,581
It's used for Masked Yaiba, so I know it!

381
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:36,981
There's one thing in this room

382
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:39,981
of the same color that is from nature.

383
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,181
Can you tell what is it, everyone?

384
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:43,581
Over there!

385
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,481
I'm never going to forgive you!

386
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:56,681
I'll kill you!

387
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,681
Mr. Kitajima said...

388
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:01,181
that the important thing when making figurines

389
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:04,681
is to have rich images.

390
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,981
That's why you imagined too, didn't you, Mr. Morishita?

391
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:11,981
When you saw the flowers that Reika brought.

392
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,981
I see.

393
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,381
He painted paint onto the blade to begin with,

394
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:26,581
and committed the crime.

395
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:29,381
It's all Kitajima's fault!

396
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:33,381
He asked me to ghost model for him, that's why I...

397
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:36,781
I'm not to blame!

398
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,581
Everybody complimented us so much.

399
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,181
And, besides, they gave us all these plastic model toys.

400
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:08,981
All ended well. But...

401
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:10,581
Okay!

402
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:12,781
Conan, thanks!

403
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:15,781
I've already made Yaiba.

404
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:18,381
After making the plastic model, I'm hungry!

405
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,781
Food! Food!

406
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:23,281
Hey, come on, make it yourselves!

407
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:27,281
Making 4 or 5 wouldn't make much difference, would it?

408
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:29,781
Food. Food.

409
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:33,881
You guys!

410
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:35,581
I guess 6th won't hurt then.

411
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,881
Come on!

412
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:40,281
For you.

413
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:44,781
Don't open it until I get a hold of all seven of them.

414
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:46,681
What? Somebody is dead?

415
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:50,881
This is undoubtedly a suicide.

416
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,781
No.

417
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,581
It could be homicide, you know?

418
00:23:55,881 --> 00:24:00,781
So, that was the one kimono she had prepared?

419
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:03,281
If I'm not mistaken...

420
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,781
Next Conan,

421
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:08,681
