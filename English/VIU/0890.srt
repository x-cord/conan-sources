1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,558
Class 1-B was assigned

2
00:00:02,559 --> 00:00:05,758
assistant homeroom teacher, Rumi Wakasa, out of season.

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,158
"Rumi Wakasa (37), Class 1-B Assistant Homeroom Teacher"

4
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:11,058
We went to the old storage shed to look for lime

5
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:14,759
at the request of said clumsy and fearful teacher, but...

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,558
Ayumi!

7
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,658
You picked up a schedule in the storage shed, right?

8
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:39,358
Yeah, I still have it.

9
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,559
See?

10
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,659
Did you figure something out, Conan?

11
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,259
I see. So that's how it is!

12
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:51,158
Now that I take a closer look,

13
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,658
there's something wrong with this schedule, isn't there?

14
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,858
Surely not even upperclassmen

15
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,159
have seven class periods in grade school.

16
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:06,058
Then, what is this chart?

17
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:07,858
Since it was in the storage shed

18
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,058
where we found the skeleton holding the code,

19
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:14,258
this is probably...

20
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:16,359
Probably?

21
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,658
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

22
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,858
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

23
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:25,158
A basement, a skeleton and a code on a string.

24
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,258
Keep your eyes on Ms. Wakasa!

25
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,858
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,758
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,259
His name is Detective Conan.

28
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,610
"The New Teacher's Skeleton Case (Part 2)"

29
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,709
It's probably what?

30
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,109
It's probably the key to the code.

31
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,709
The key...

32
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,109
To the code?

33
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,609
What's that?

34
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,009
A hint to help us read the code.

35
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,109
What?

36
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,809
Look closely at the code.

37
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,409
The characters on the right side are the days of the week.

38
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,109
Every day of the week is represented.

39
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,409
You're right.

40
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,609
But the "water" for Wednesday is missing.

41
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,909
That's the water radical.

42
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,009
River, lake, swim.

43
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,709
A lot of characters that incorporate the water radical

44
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,009
are related to water.

45
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,409
Really?

46
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,109
Then, what are the characters on the left?

47
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,309
They're parts of characters for school subjects.

48
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,109
Language is "ware".

49
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,709
Math is "nobun".

50
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,309
Social studies is "kai".

51
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,609
Science is "sato".

52
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,109
Art is "ko".

53
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,609
Physical education is "hon".

54
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,210
Homeroom is "shita".

55
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,409
So knowing that,

56
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,809
we can fill in the forty-nine spaces

57
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,809
on this seven by seven grid with Chinese characters.

58
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,509
And if you apply the Japanese alphabet to them

59
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,910
starting at the top left...

60
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,009
You get this chart.

61
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,509
Wow!

62
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,209
It seems like we should be able to read it

63
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,709
when we wrap it around a pen now.

64
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,009
I'll read out the code,

65
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,409
so you guys check it against the key.

66
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,209
Understood!

67
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,909
The first character is the earth radical and nobun.

68
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,509
Well...

69
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,409
It's the earth radical and nobun, so...

70
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,509
Su!

71
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,609
Next is the water radical and ko.

72
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,909
That's ma!

73
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,409
Next is the fire radical and ko.

74
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,909
Ho.

75
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,009
It's sumaho (smartphone)!

76
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,309
Looks like it really is a key.

77
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,409
Yeah.

78
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,909
What's next?

79
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,609
Tree radical and ko.

80
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,610
Me!

81
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,609
Water radical and ware.

82
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,710
U!

83
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,109
Sumahomeu...

84
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,009
Soneareta...

85
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,109
Ebuemua...

86
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,509
What does that mean?

87
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,709
Is it some kind of incantation?

88
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,110
Gosh. I was so sure this was it.

89
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,709
Thanks for waiting, everyone.

90
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,609
We're finished with classes for the day.

91
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,509
We'll play dodge ball in our next PE class.

92
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,109
Hooray...

93
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,009
Okay, everyone. Let's clean up and go home.

94
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,010
Okay...

95
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,909
Even if you apply the Japanese alphabet vertically

96
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,209
instead of horizontally to the key,

97
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,309
you still get "yuteshiriso, utsuawoko, movunimua".

98
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,909
Maybe it's not the Japanese alphabet but the English alphabet.

99
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,409
The English alphabet has twenty-six characters.

100
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,509
Most of the forty-nine spaces would be leftover.

101
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,209
I suppose you're right.

102
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,409
The other things that's bothering me

103
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,609
are these X's drawn here and there on the chart.

104
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,710
What do they mean?

105
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,209
I'm disappointed, though.

106
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,209
We couldn't crack the code.

107
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,009
-Yeah. -Who cares?

108
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,409
I doubt there's any point in cracking the code

109
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,409
we found in the hand of a thief who died in an accident ten years ago.

110
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,009
-Yeah, but... -That was quick.

111
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,309
There's already a story online

112
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,709
about the skeleton we found in the storage shed.

113
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,009
They even included a photo of the headband with the code.

114
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,309
Seriously?

115
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,310
Seriously.

116
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,509
They're calling it a "mysterious code".

117
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,009
Excuse me, children.

118
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,609
Ms. Wakasa.

119
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,809
The teacher of another class asked me

120
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,909
to get some lime for their science class tomorrow.

121
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,110
I see.

122
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,909
I saw three line markers

123
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,109
next to the skeleton in the storage shed.

124
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,009
There's probably lime inside those.

125
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,909
So?

126
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,509
So, if you don't mind...

127
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,510
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,909
You want us to come with you because you're scared, right?

129
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,110
Well, yes.

130
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,409
Sorry for making you come with me again.

131
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,109
Ms. Wakasa, you really are a scaredy cat.

132
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,409
Well, there was a skeleton in there until recently.

133
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,810
In any case, let's get the lime and leave before it gets dark.

134
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,009
This room has been ransacked.

135
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,409
It was tidy earlier, right?

136
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,609
Could forensics have left this mess while investigating?

137
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,309
No, they weren't investigating.

138
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,009
It's more like they were searching for something.

139
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,709
Could someone have come after the police left?

140
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,409
But why?

141
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,909
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

142
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,809
What time was that news story posted?

143
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,709
Well...

144
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,509
Two hours ago.

145
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,809
Two hours ago...

146
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,409
That's plenty of time to come here after seeing the code online.

147
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,209
Wait. You don't think...

148
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,409
Yeah.

149
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,209
The guy who wrote that code may have died ten years ago,

150
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,709
but the purpose of the code still lives.

151
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,809
Then we have to solve the code!

152
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,609
Let's check the basement where we found the skeleton first.

153
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,109
The person who searched the storage shed could be hiding down there.

154
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,309
What?

155
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,609
Ms. Wakasa, can you open this trapdoor?

156
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,009
What?

157
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,609
But what if someone jumps out?

158
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,909
It's okay.

159
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,110
I'll put them to sleep using my tranquilizer gun.

160
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,010
Tranquilizer?

161
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,509
-I'm opening it. -Okay.

162
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,810
Here goes.

163
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,609
The basement hasn't been ransacked.

164
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,809
So they haven't been down here to search yet.

165
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,309
Or they noticed us coming.

166
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,309
And ran away.

167
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,409
Well, they wouldn't be able to run

168
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,609
if we discovered them in the basement.

169
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,409
Maybe they're planning to return

170
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,809
once the students and teachers leave

171
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,409
and it's dark outside to resume their search for something.

172
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,309
So? What is this "something"?

173
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,110
We'll have to crack the code to find out.

174
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,309
Gosh. I know I can solve it

175
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,609
if I figure out what those three X's mean.

176
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,309
Normally, you'd think

177
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:21,209
it's the redundant "iue" characters in "waiueo",

178
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,709
but then the X's should be in the third

179
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,309
through fifth squares on the bottom row.

180
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,909
What do those X's mean?

181
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,809
Conan, let's carry the lime out.

182
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,109
Sure.

183
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,609
Today was the worst.

184
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,709
I want to go home, have a drink, and go to sleep.

185
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,409
Ms. Wakasa, you drink?

186
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,909
Yes, I do.

187
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,309
My favorite is whiskey.

188
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,610
One glass, and I can sleep with an Ebisu-like smile on my face.

189
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,509
Whiskey... Ebisu...

190
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,909
That's it!

191
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,209
This code isn't in modern alphabetical order.

192
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,210
Then the three phrases of the code are...

193
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:16,509
That code really is connected to that ten year old case.

194
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,009
Hey, Conan.

195
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,809
What are you doing?

196
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,910
Can't find the lime?

197
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:31,987
I'm hungry now.

198
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,388
Who's there?

199
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:36,987
What's wrong, Ai?

200
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:41,488
I thought I saw someone watching us from behind the entrance door.

201
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:44,287
Maybe it was my imagination.

202
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,188
No, maybe not.

203
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,887
If I'm right,

204
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,787
after the police collected that skeleton from the basement and left,

205
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:57,087
someone ransacked this storage shed in search of something.

206
00:11:57,088 --> 00:12:01,887
The ones who murdered the wealthy man ten years ago

207
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,887
and stole 200 million yen worth

208
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:08,787
of gold ingots.

209
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:11,587
That very same group of thieves.

210
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:13,087
What?

211
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:16,187
Does that mean you cracked the code?

212
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:19,887
Yeah, because of what Ms. Wakasa said earlier.

213
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:22,988
What? What I said?

214
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:26,587
Ebisu and whiskey.

215
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:30,687
Long ago, those words were written...

216
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:33,187
Like this.

217
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,987
What are those characters?

218
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,987
There are weird characters mixed in.

219
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,787
They're no longer used,

220
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:41,487
but they're characters from the Iroha poem.

221
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:45,087
The katakana "a" with a line under it is "ye".

222
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:48,587
The character that looks like the "i" in "ido" is "wi".

223
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:51,387
So if you apply the Iroha characters

224
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:55,188
to the code instead of the modern alphabet...

225
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,888
You get this.

226
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,487
I see.

227
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,887
The obsolete "ye" and "wi" characters

228
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:06,587
correspond to the spaces marked with X,

229
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:10,187
and the last X is a leftover space.

230
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:14,687
Yeah. And if you read the code using this chart...

231
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:16,487
You get "Wakemaeha, youishita (Your shares are ready)"

232
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:20,387
"Sugunikoi! (Come immediately!)"

233
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:21,887
Is that...

234
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,187
Yes. That skeleton

235
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:27,587
belonged to the boss of the thieves who met here.

236
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:32,487
He exchanged the ingots for cash and had their shares ready.

237
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:34,887
And ten years later, after seeing the news story

238
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:38,187
and realizing their boss prepared their shares

239
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:39,787
before his accidental death,

240
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:42,287
they came here to look for it

241
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,787
thinking the cash could still be inside this storage shed.

242
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:48,187
I found heaps of cash in the lime

243
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:51,187
inside the line markers in the basement.

244
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:52,587
No way!

245
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:55,487
But couldn't he have emailed them?

246
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:56,587
If they'd been emailed,

247
00:13:56,588 --> 00:14:00,087
that would have led the police to the money if they were arrested.

248
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:01,787
I see.

249
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:04,587
In any case, we should tell the police.

250
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:08,587
We may not want to tell them about the money yet.

251
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,187
Why not?

252
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:12,387
If the police act,

253
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:15,187
the thieves won't come back here.

254
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:19,187
So we'll round them up first.

255
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:23,188
Just like Holmes did in the "Dancing Men story".

256
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:29,787
The sun's already setting.

257
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,287
You're right.

258
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,388
We couldn't find any lime.

259
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:40,487
All we found was a code written on some finish line tape.

260
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:44,687
But the writing looks pretty fresh.

261
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:48,087
As though someone just wrote it.

262
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,387
Yeah.

263
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,987
Yeah, but we can't read it anyway.

264
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:53,587
Just throw it away.

265
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:54,888
You're right.

266
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:58,887
I'm so hungry!

267
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:03,687
Anyway, I'm excited for tonight's episode of "Kamen Yaiba"!

268
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:06,887
Yeah. The mysterious Lady Yaiba's going to be in it!

269
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:08,487
I'm so excited!

270
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:09,688
Right, Haibara?

271
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:31,587
Gosh.

272
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:34,087
I told you guys not to come.

273
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:35,387
Yeah, but...

274
00:15:35,388 --> 00:15:37,487
It's not fair for you to come alone!

275
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:40,187
We're all part of the Youth Detective Squad!

276
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,387
But the guys coming are...

277
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:46,888
But this is kind of fun, like a test of courage.

278
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:48,887
Yeah.

279
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:51,287
Even Ms. Wakasa came.

280
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:56,787
If it becomes necessary, I'll protect you.

281
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,187
Thank you.

282
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:00,387
I'm surprise the police sent anyone

283
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:03,987
on the basis of such uncertain information.

284
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:06,987
Well, actually...

285
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:11,988
I think your track record convinced them.

286
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:20,787
I only came because I thought Ms. Kobayashi would be here.

287
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:23,587
Well, Conan?

288
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:27,887
What did you write in code?

289
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,487
"I'll be waiting in the basement at midnight today."

290
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:35,187
"Let's meet for the first time in ten years", I think.

291
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:39,188
They'll think their boss is still alive when they read that.

292
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,387
Where are you, boss?

293
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,687
How could you?

294
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,787
We haven't heard from you in ten years.

295
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:01,988
We thought you ran off with the money.

296
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:04,988
Come to think of it,

297
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:08,288
the code said he'd be waiting in the basement.

298
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:12,287
Hey, answer me.

299
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:14,287
You're down there, aren't you?

300
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:16,187
A flashlight?

301
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:18,687
What's that doing there?

302
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,687
Hey, you down there?

303
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:22,187
Boss?

304
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:24,987
Quit hiding and come on out.

305
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:26,588
Hold it right there.

306
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:30,287
I'm Ninzaburo Shiratori

307
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:32,187
with the Metropolitan Police Department Section One.

308
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:35,087
You're coming down to the station with me

309
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,687
for a ten year old robbery and murder.

310
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:39,587
Then that code...

311
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,087
It was a trap?

312
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:42,487
That's right!

313
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:44,687
Conan wrote that code!

314
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,687
And you fell for it!

315
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:48,987
Wait!

316
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,687
There were four thieves, and their boss is dead!

317
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,287
That should leave three!

318
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:56,188
If there's only two in the basement, then...

319
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:09,488
Inspector Shiratori!

320
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,687
Brats.

321
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:18,088
How dare you underestimate me?

322
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:21,887
Did you find the money?

323
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:23,287
Yeah.

324
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:26,687
It's stuffed inside the line markers.

325
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,087
Let's see.

326
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,087
How's this?

327
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:32,587
You can't beat this!

328
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:36,687
It's too bad the boss died, though.

329
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:40,687
It just means there's more for us.

330
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,487
We should thank him.

331
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,087
You're right.

332
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,987
Okay, boys and girls.

333
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:49,588
Why don't you head down into the basement one by one?

334
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,187
The kids first.

335
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:55,488
Come on, hurry up.

336
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,787
What's wrong?

337
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:02,887
Take them out with your tranquilizer

338
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:05,887
or ball like you always do.

339
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:11,187
I'm not sure I can hit them with a dart in the dark.

340
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:15,387
And I should hold onto my ball launching belt,

341
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,388
for when we get trapped inside here.

342
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,687
Is Inspector Shiratori okay?

343
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:23,887
Yeah.

344
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:27,287
He just suffered a concussion and is unconscious.

345
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:31,887
Okay. You're last, teacher.

346
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,487
Okay.

347
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,788
Have fun teaching your last class in the basement.

348
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:46,387
Ms. Wakasa!

349
00:19:46,388 --> 00:19:48,187
It hurts!

350
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,987
Hey, what are you doing?

351
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,887
Ms. Wakasa!

352
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,688
It won't open!

353
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:57,788
Hey! Get up and...

354
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:01,887
He's unconscious.

355
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:03,188
What?

356
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:12,587
Are you ready?

357
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,088
What?

358
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:25,888
To move onto the next world.

359
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:51,287
Hey, Conan.

360
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:53,987
I don't hear anything anymore.

361
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,387
Gosh. Okay, let's open the door.

362
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:57,687
Okay.

363
00:21:57,688 --> 00:21:59,488
Ready, and...

364
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:08,187
No, stop!

365
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:09,487
Stay back!

366
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:10,987
-Ms. Wakasa! -No!

367
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:13,487
Ms. Wakasa!

368
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,387
Are you okay?

369
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:17,787
Yes.

370
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:19,787
Where are the thieves?

371
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,788
Huh? Come to think of it...

372
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:31,087
They've been knocked out.

373
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,888
Ms. Wakasa, you're amazing!

374
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:37,387
Did you beat all three of them yourself?

375
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:40,388
I was just wildly swinging the rake around.

376
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,488
Lucky me.

377
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:48,787
"The next day"

378
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:51,087
I heard the news, Ms. Wakasa!

379
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:52,687
You took a group of children

380
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:55,687
to catch some thieves in the middle of the night!

381
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,687
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:57,688 --> 00:23:01,387
But there was a police officer there.

383
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:03,487
I thought we'd be okay.

384
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:05,887
Then why?

385
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:07,087
Huh?

386
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:09,787
Why didn't you invite me?

387
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,088
I'm the adviser for the Youth Detective Squad!

388
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:18,387
You're upset about that?

389
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:20,587
You are?

390
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:24,487
And the police officer who came was Shiratori!

391
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:28,187
You should've told me.

392
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:30,987
Not that it matters it was Shiratori!

393
00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:34,387
Takagi or Chiba or Sato or anyone else would have...

394
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:37,287
Oh, that's not what I mean by anyone!

395
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:38,987
I mean...

396
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:41,488
In any case, I'm the adviser for the Youth Detective Squad!

397
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,388
"Next Episode"

398

the large fox at the Yuda Hot Springs Station.

400

You're the great detective Kogoro Mouri.

Haginyan!

I'm Washiyama of the Yamaguchikita Station.

I'm Tsurumi.

00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:03,487
What?

406
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:06,288
Why am I being arrested?
