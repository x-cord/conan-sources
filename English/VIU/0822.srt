1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:06,612
And? You mean you really haven't seen him before?

2
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:07,712
Seen what?

3
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:09,913
Superintendent Kuroda.

4
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:13,512
Nope.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:18,212
You were clinging onto me really tightly, though.

6
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:22,612
Seeing his horrifying face up close like that,

7
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:25,412
what makes you think I can stay calm?

8
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:26,712
Really?

9
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:29,212
So she was just really afraid of his face.

10
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:31,112
That's right!

11
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:33,812
His face was really dreadful.

12
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:35,312
No joke. I was super scared!

13
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:37,812
I almost felt like crying.

14
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:39,613
I... I see.

15
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,412
Well, I think all is fine.

16
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:48,112
Because if that man Kuroda is Rum, who you suspect him to be...

17
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:50,012
And he saw my face at such close range...

18
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:53,612
He would've realized that I'm Sherry,

19
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:56,812
the one who betrayed the Organization,

20
00:00:56,813 --> 00:01:01,012
would be at Doc's house by now.

21
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:05,212
But the mail I got from him was all about today's dinner.

22
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:07,212
Okay, that's great.

23
00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:09,713
It's better to be safe than sorry.

24
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:13,213
Hey, what's the matter?

25
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:19,713
Hey, Ai?

26
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,612
A canvas stained black with crime.

27
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:26,012
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

28
00:01:26,013 --> 00:01:28,012
Why is Ai shocked out of her wits?

29
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:30,212
The information signals the start of a new case.

30
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:31,812
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:33,712
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:36,013
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:19,736
"The Suspects are Passionate Lovers (Part 1)"

34
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,636
Don't tell me that...

35
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,336
Did something happen to Doc?

36
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:31,035
"Yoko Okino And Ryusuke Higo, Their Passionate Love Exposed!"

37
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:34,735
Oh, come on! It's just a gossip article.

38
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,035
You scared me out of my wits.

39
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,435
What? Is this for real?

40
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:41,235
-No joke? -They're a big couple!

41
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:45,235
They would probably give birth to a handsome J-Leaguer!

42
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:47,535
If it's a girl, she'd be an idol singer.

43
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:48,536
Yeah!

44
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:51,635
You think so too, don't you, Ai?

45
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:53,435
Ai?

46
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:55,935
You're white as a sheet.

47
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,236
Rather, I don't think she's breathing.

48
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,335
Wait a sec.

49
00:04:01,336 --> 00:04:05,135
If his partner is Yoko Okino, I'm sure he's...

50
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:06,835
Hey, Dad!

51
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:09,736
Get a hold of yourself, Dad!

52
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,636
I thought so.

53
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:17,435
Now, both their agencies

54
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:20,435
haven't gotten a hold of either of them yet today,

55
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:23,335
and say they have no comments to make.

56
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,435
According to Higo's teammates,

57
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:28,835
they seem to have graduated from the same high school

58
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,336
and kicked it off well from there.

59
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:38,235
Before you get so depressed,

60
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,435
why don't you check on it and see if it's true?

61
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:43,835
I mean, you do a lot of work on illicit relationships etc., don't you?

62
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:44,935
Idiot!

63
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:47,035
Detectives don't do things like investigating

64
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,035
just to satisfy their curiosity, you know!

65
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:51,135
That's my policy!

66
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:54,636
Then, will you investigate if I ask you to?

67
00:04:57,736 --> 00:04:59,635
Ai.

68
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:00,636
Hey, hey.

69
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,035
I'd like you to investigate

70
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,735
on the backgrounds of Ryusuke Higo and Yoko Okino!

71
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:06,935
What?

72
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,736
Of course, for free!

73
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:20,236
Okay! I'll do it!

74
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,036
What is this?

75
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:27,135
But, how're you going to find the two?

76
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:28,735
Unlike ordinary people,

77
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:30,635
you don't know their addresses either, right?

78
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:34,635
Even their agencies can't get a hold of them, you know.

79
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,135
Idiot!

80
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,835
At times like this, safe comments are usually made public,

81
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:41,735
but there are none,

82
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:43,635
so it's highly likely that they're seeing each other again today

83
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,535
without knowing that they're being rumored about!

84
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:51,035
But wouldn't somebody normally e-mail or call them?

85
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:55,635
Yoko's manager said that Yoko usually doesn't realize

86
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:57,635
that her phone is switched off.

87
00:05:57,636 --> 00:06:00,635
It seems that Mr. Higo usually has his phone switched off

88
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:02,635
during his days off.

89
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:04,735
If so, we'll search using the keywords "Yoko Okino",

90
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:10,135
"Ryusuke Higo", "date" and "today's date".

91
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,735
See? Here it is!

92
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:15,235
Someone posted on their blog

93
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:17,035
that the two were seen at a restaurant in Haidocho!

94
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:21,035
But all they did was buy a man's wristwatch together, right?

95
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:24,635
Maybe Yoko just asked Mr. Higo to help her pick out

96
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,535
a present for her younger brother,

97
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:29,936
and as a token of her appreciation, Yoko treated Mr. Higo to a meal.

98
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:33,135
Yoko doesn't have a kid brother.

99
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:36,935
Rather, why is she asking Mr. Higo to pick it out for her?

100
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:38,335
I don't get it!

101
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,935
I guess not.

102
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:43,236
Then, maybe those two are going with each other after all.

103
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:48,435
Sorry! Forget what I said. Forget it!

104
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:51,435
Why don't you go over to that restaurant then?

105
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:53,835
But the name of the restaurant's not written!

106
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:56,835
Come to think of it, I heard one of Mr. Higo's soccer club seniors

107
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:58,735
who retired from the J-League

108
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:01,935
opened an Italian restaurant in Haidocho.

109
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:03,735
Where's that shop?

110
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:06,936
But I don't know if they're really at that shop.

111
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,935
They're here. Both of them.

112
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:12,635
And more so...

113
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:14,635
From the way that these two are acting,

114
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:17,136
it's no wonder Ran didn't want to come along.

115
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:20,835
Hey, what're you taking notes of?

116
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:24,036
The number of times that idol smiled at Mr. Higo!

117
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:30,735
Hey. Didn't you like Yoko Okino's songs and listen to them repeatedly?

118
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:33,136
I deleted all of them just a while ago.

119
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:36,035
And?

120
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:39,335
Is he the senior of that soccer guy?

121
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,035
What?

122
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,035
Nope.

123
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:45,735
Mr. Higo's senior is Teiya Asuka,

124
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:47,835
who used to be a wing back for the Tokyo Spirits,

125
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:51,235
and was even chosen as a representative for Japan, too.

126
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:55,335
I think he's the sommelier for this restaurant.

127
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:59,535
I wonder what that guy intends to do after getting Yoko drunk?

128
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:00,836
What?

129
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:05,535
Where's Mr. Asuka?

130
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:07,035
The owner's out buying some wine...

131
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:11,036
"Akimichi Yamada (43), Sommelier" -and should be back soon.

132
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:14,935
Should I tell him to come to your table when he gets back?

133
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:16,835
Yes, please do that.

134
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:19,635
Please enjoy.

135
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,135
"Reiko Banba (27), waitress" -Excuse me.

136
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,436
Here's your dessert.

137
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:28,135
I'm so sorry!

138
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:30,835
What an amateur, that waitress.

139
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:33,736
Maybe she was distracted looking at Mr. Higo.

140
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,535
I goofed.

141
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,635
That guy Higo is the owner's friend, right?

142
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:46,635
If he was here, you would've really gotten it from the owner.

143
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,035
No problem.

144
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:51,835
He never gets angry at me.

145
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:55,435
Don't let it get to your head, just because you're going with him.

146
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:56,635
Talk for yourself.

147
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,136
Don't let it get to you just because you're my ex.

148
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:05,036
"Yasuto Konoe (28), waiter"

149
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,735
The owner sure is late, though.

150
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:11,235
It's about time he should be back already.

151
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:13,535
Shall we go look for him?

152
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,235
I guess so.

153
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,335
Mr. Konoe and I will go check the back room then.

154
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:19,536
Yes, sir.

155
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:24,735
Ms. Banba, please check the storeroom.

156
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,136
Okay!

157
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,535
He's not here.

158
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:34,035
He always takes short naps on this sofa, but...

159
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:36,936
He didn't seem to be getting enough sleep lately.

160
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:43,335
Come to think of it, weren't you arguing with the owner last night?

161
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,135
He complained that the wine I buy is too expensive.

162
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:49,435
Well, I guess it can't be helped because he owns this restaurant.

163
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:51,835
He isn't in the storeroom either.

164
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:54,435
Shall we wait for him a while longer then?

165
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,136
-Yes. -Okay.

166
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:00,535
They're asking for Mr. Asuka again.

167
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:03,335
They want to know if he came back.

168
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,035
What shall we do?

169
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,935
Shall we go look for him again?

170
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,835
Maybe we should check the bathroom just in case, too.

171
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:12,135
-Yes. -I'll go check the bathroom then!

172
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:13,836
Thanks.

173
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:21,635
He's not in the storeroom.

174
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:24,335
He's not in the bathroom, either.

175
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:25,935
I found the owner.

176
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:28,135
It seems he's taking a nap on the sofa.

177
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,136
No joke?

178
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:32,535
Yes. He has a blanket over his head.

179
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:35,435
He doesn't know that his friend is here?

180
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:39,136
Let's let him sleep another 10 minutes then wake him up.

181
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:45,835
It's almost 10 minutes.

182
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:50,335
I'll go to the back room and wake the owner up then.

183
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:51,936
Okay.

184
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:01,335
It's e-mail from the owner.

185
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:04,635
"Could you bring Higo and Yoko over to the storeroom

186
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:06,235
without anyone noticing?"

187
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:09,135
So he got up on his own?

188
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,935
I'll take the two over to the back room then.

189
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:13,036
Thanks.

190
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,635
What's going on?

191
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,836
It seems they're going somewhere.

192
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:29,335
Why does that girl idol have to stand so close to him?

193
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:32,935
That soccer guy walks too slow!

194
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:35,635
I guess I'll go take a puff in the restroom then.

195
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:39,136
Hey, it's no smoking in the restroom too, normally, isn't it?

196
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,035
But when I went to the restroom a while ago,

197
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,435
I smelled cigarettes.

198
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:45,935
What? Really?

199
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:47,036
Yeah.

200
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:51,436
That was Yoko's scream!

201
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,335
Where did they go?

202
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:56,735
To... to the basement storeroom.

203
00:11:56,736 --> 00:12:00,736
Don't tell me that the soccer guy did something terrible to Yoko.

204
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,036
Yoko!

205
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,135
Hey, Mr. Asuka?

206
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:13,035
Get a hold of yourself! Hey!

207
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,535
Mr. Asuka?

208
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:15,936
Mr. Asuka!

209
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:23,402
The victim is the owner of this restaurant,

210
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:25,802
Mr. Teiya Asuka, age 31.

211
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,402
The ETD is during the hour,

212
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:31,002
between a little after 19:00 to a little before 20:00.

213
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:34,102
The cause of death is blood loss due to a severed carotid artery.

214
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:38,102
The murder weapon is a cutter knife that was found near the corpse.

215
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:41,602
It seems that one of the cutter knives

216
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,902
that was in the back room is missing,

217
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,502
that most likely is it.

218
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:46,702
I see.

219
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:49,402
And? The first discoverers of the corpse,

220
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:52,102
are you who were here at this restaurant,

221
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,602
Mr. Ryusuke Higo, a J-Leaguer

222
00:12:54,603 --> 00:12:57,702
and idol Ms. Yoko Okino?

223
00:12:57,703 --> 00:12:58,703
-Yes. -Yes.

224
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:02,302
But, why did you come to the storeroom when you came as customers?

225
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:05,502
The waiter brought us here.

226
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:08,802
He said that he received e-mail from Mr. Asuka

227
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,102
telling him to bring us here.

228
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,402
Did you know the victim?

229
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:16,502
Yes. Mr. Asuka is an OB of the soccer club of our high school,

230
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:19,602
and I came to see him to ask him a favor.

231
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:23,302
I graduated from Konan High as well.

232
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:28,102
So, the victim didn't send the mail directly to you?

233
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:31,402
No. I don't know him that well.

234
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:34,502
I lost my cell phone somewhere.

235
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:37,502
I'm sure I brought it to this restaurant, though.

236
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:42,102
And I'd like to ask you one more thing.

237
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,302
Are you two going with each other?

238
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:47,002
What?

239
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,402
Just what kind of question is that?

240
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:51,002
Don't you know? It's the talk of the town

241
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,702
and causing a commotion on the gossip TV shows now.

242
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:54,602
See?

243
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,802
That the passionate love between Ms. Yoko Okino and Mr. Ryusuke Higo

244
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,803
has been disclosed!

245
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,502
Hey. So, what's the story?

246
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,303
-What's the story? -What?

247
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,302
Why are Mr. Mouri and the others here?

248
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,802
It seems they just happened to be here.

249
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:16,102
Why don't you try asking the other restaurant staff questions, too?

250
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,802
They seemed to be running around

251
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,203
even before the body was found, you know?

252
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,202
Running around?

253
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:27,102
Oh, right. The owner wasn't back for some time,

254
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:29,802
so we decided to split up and go look for him.

255
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,702
He sometimes comes back without saying anything

256
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,902
and takes short naps in the back room, you see.

257
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:36,902
And there were customers who wanted to see him too, so...

258
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:39,402
I think the first time was around 7:00 p.m.?

259
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:42,302
So, I went with him to check the back room.

260
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:46,302
And I had her go and check the storeroom.

261
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,602
The back room?

262
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:51,703
It's where the staff takes a break. It's this room.

263
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,702
And where was he taking a nap?

264
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:57,302
On this sofa.

265
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,202
But when we came here the first time,

266
00:14:59,203 --> 00:15:01,402
the only thing here was the blanket

267
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,103
and there was no one here.

268
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:07,902
When you searched the storeroom,

269
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:10,102
you didn't see the owner there?

270
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:11,103
No.

271
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:15,502
But the next time, I was told to search the back room

272
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:19,302
so I went back about 10 minutes later.

273
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:22,602
Then, I found the owner there.

274
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:24,402
-You found the owner? -Yes.

275
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:28,302
He was sleeping on the sofa with a blanket over his head.

276
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,102
His shoes were placed near the sofa too, so I'm sure!

277
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:35,703
But... But, why was the owner...

278
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,902
And, what after that?

279
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,802
After she told me this,

280
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:44,702
I went to wake him up about 10 minutes later.

281
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:47,202
Back then, he wasn't asleep on the sofa.

282
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:50,802
Just about that time, I got an e-mail from the owner

283
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:53,302
telling me if I could bring Mr. Higo and Yoko to the storeroom

284
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,703
without being noticed by anyone.

285
00:15:56,803 --> 00:15:58,802
About what time was it?

286
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:01,402
About 7:30 p.m.

287
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:05,502
That's why I brought those two to the storeroom, you see.

288
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:07,702
I called him just before going into the storeroom,

289
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,302
but there was no answer.

290
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,802
Since he didn't come out,

291
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,202
I thought he went back to the back room.

292
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:16,602
I left the two at the storeroom and went to the back room,

293
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,602
but only Mr. Yamada was there.

294
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:22,302
When all three of us were wondering where the owner went...

295
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:24,602
We heard Yoko scream.

296
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:26,802
And just as we were about to head over to the storeroom,

297
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:29,202
Detective Mouri came.

298
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:31,802
Spit it out! I'll bet you persistently asked Yoko

299
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:33,302
to come to this restaurant with you?

300
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:34,303
No.

301
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,902
I'll bet you're the one that asked him to come?

302
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,202
What?

303
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:41,102
Just what are they investigating anyway?

304
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:44,002
Which means you found the corpse while you were waiting at the storeroom?

305
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,102
Yes. Since they didn't come back for a while,

306
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,502
we were looking around the storeroom and...

307
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:52,402
I think it was around 7:50 p.m.

308
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:56,102
7:50 p.m. is just barely within the estimated time of death.

309
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:58,902
Yeah, which makes these two suspects, too.

310
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:00,802
What?

311
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,302
Anyway, everyone...

312
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:04,603
I'll have to talk to all of you individually.

313
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:07,402
Like I said a while ago,

314
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,602
I couldn't have committed the crime.

315
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:11,602
When I first came to search for the owner,

316
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:13,802
I was in this back room with Mr. Yamada,

317
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:15,502
and next I was checking the men's room.

318
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:18,502
Then, finally, I took those two to the storeroom,

319
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,902
but I just called out from outside the storeroom

320
00:17:20,903 --> 00:17:22,802
and didn't go inside.

321
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:27,602
That's why, while Ms. Banba was serving food and wine,

322
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:28,902
you could've pretended to go to the restroom

323
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:30,502
and snuck off to the storeroom.

324
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:34,302
No way! The storeroom's always locked.

325
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,502
And the key is always hung on the wall at the entrance of the corridor

326
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:40,202
so that the staff can always keep an eye on it.

327
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:42,902
Why is it put where the staff can keep an eye on it?

328
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:45,202
In the past, there were staff who would come to the storeroom

329
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:48,302
and this back room to smoke.

330
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:50,502
The owner did it to prevent this from happening again.

331
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,002
And besides, he hated cigarettes.

332
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:55,602
Which means this room is always locked, too?

333
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:57,802
Yes, and the back door, too.

334
00:17:57,803 --> 00:18:01,102
Only the owner had the spare key!

335
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:04,002
Did the victim have the spare keys on him?

336
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:06,702
Yes, inside the pocket of his slacks.

337
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:10,202
But the cell phone of the victim wasn't found,

338
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:13,702
so the forensics are looking for it now in the storeroom.

339
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:15,602
I see.

340
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:18,402
At any rate, I didn't do it.

341
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:21,502
I've got nothing against the owner besides.

342
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:24,802
I hear you're the one that's been smoking in this room.

343
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,702
-What? -The waitress told me a while ago.

344
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:30,202
That the owner was bawling you out.

345
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:31,602
Was that your motive?

346
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:34,102
No. That's...

347
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:37,202
If you're the perp, will you please hurry up and confess?

348
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,602
What?

349
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:39,603
If you're talking about motive,

350
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,502
I think the other two have more motive than I do.

351
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:44,202
What?

352
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,002
The sommelier Mr. Yamada

353
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:49,002
had an argument with the owner over wine last night.

354
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:52,902
And the waitress Reiko Banba is the owner's girlfriend, you know?

355
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:54,203
Girlfriend?

356
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:59,003
Maybe she killed him over a messy break up something?

357
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:01,802
Yes, that's right.

358
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:04,402
I was going with the owner,

359
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:06,402
but there was no talk about a break up!

360
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:09,002
But the waiter Mr. Konoe mentioned that

361
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:12,702
the owner hadn't been going home with you lately.

362
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:15,402
That's because he was sleeping over here,

363
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:19,202
so that he could think of ways to make business more profitable!

364
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:20,802
He was sleeping over here.

365
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:24,602
Right. That's why the owner's locker at the very left

366
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:26,503
is full of a change of clothes, isn't it?

367
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,602
True.

368
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,902
There's even a change of shoes here.

369
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:36,402
I'll bet Mr. Konoe is saying things like that

370
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:40,402
because he used to be my ex-boyfriend and is jealous.

371
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:42,802
Your ex-boyfriend?

372
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:45,702
But if he had the blanket over his head

373
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,702
when he was sleeping on the sofa,

374
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,502
you didn't see his face, right?

375
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,102
No, I guess not.

376
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:55,102
Then maybe you could put something under the blanket

377
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:57,702
to make it look as if he were sleeping there, couldn't you?

378
00:19:57,703 --> 00:20:01,902
What? What good is it for me to do something like that?

379
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:04,402
When you first went to look for the owner in the storeroom,

380
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,802
you could've actually killed him.

381
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:09,002
Then after that, to make it look as if he were still alive,

382
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:10,802
you faked the scene, didn't you?

383
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:13,202
When I came to search this room,

384
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:16,902
Mr. Yamada the sommelier was at the storeroom, you know?

385
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:19,402
If Mr. Yamada found the owner's body,

386
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:22,102
everything would be in vain, right?

387
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:26,202
This room is really tidy.

388
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:27,802
Of course.

389
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:30,602
Because the owner would stay back after work

390
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,402
and clean the room all by himself.

391
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:34,902
The owner was a tidy person, wasn't he?

392
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:38,102
Yes. Because even after I cleaned the place thoroughly,

393
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,202
I could hear the sound of the vacuum cleaner.

394
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:43,903
I think he was vacuuming really small dust that couldn't be noticed.

395
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:48,802
What? You mean when I went to look for him in the storeroom?

396
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:51,502
The owner wasn't there,

397
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:53,402
but I did the same thing as Mr. Konoe

398
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:56,302
and just called him from the entrance.

399
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:58,602
Which means he may have already been killed

400
00:20:58,603 --> 00:21:01,702
inside the storeroom at that time?

401
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,602
Yes, I guess so.

402
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:07,902
By the way, it seems that you had an argument with the owner last night.

403
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:11,702
Yes. The restaurant hasn't been doing well lately,

404
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,302
so the owner said he wanted to stock inexpensive wine

405
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:15,202
in place of the expensive ones.

406
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:18,402
I only expressed my concern over that because this restaurant

407
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,302
was supposed to be an authentic, very Italian restaurant.

408
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:24,002
-That's why you killed him? -What?

409
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:27,002
You mean you did it to so you could buy expensive wine of your taste.

410
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,402
With the owner dead,

411
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:31,002
I wouldn't be able to buy them if I wanted to!

412
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:33,102
Inspector!

413
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:38,002
A lot of cigarette butts were found in the trash box of the restroom.

414
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:40,302
I thought the restroom was no smoking, too?

415
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:43,502
Yes, I think it's Mr. Konoe.

416
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,902
He used to smoke in this room before,

417
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:47,902
but after being scolded by the owner,

418
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:50,902
I think he hid in the restroom and smoked.

419
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:54,902
If in the restroom, he could say that a customer smoked.

420
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:57,602
That's why the restroom smelled of cigarettes.

421
00:21:57,603 --> 00:21:58,902
Come to think of it,

422
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:02,902
he said from himself that he'd search the restroom,

423
00:22:02,903 --> 00:22:06,303
so maybe he didn't want anyone noticing the smell of cigarettes.

424
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:11,902
Although there are 5 suspects,

425
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:13,903
the suspicious ones are those three.

426
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:20,803
How on earth did the perp commit the crime?

427
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:44,002
"Next Episode" -There's a tiny hole.

428
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:47,002
Hey, is that blood?

429
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:50,902
Only Mr. Higo or Yoko who were waiting in the storeroom

430
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:53,702
could've committed the crime.

431
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:58,002
-What? -Wait... wait a minute, Inspector!

432
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,402
They wanted a third party

433
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:03,702
to confirm that the owner wasn't in the room

434
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,603
So, give yourself up!

435
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,902
