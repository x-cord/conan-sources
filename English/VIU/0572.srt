1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:02,975
The haunted storeroom.

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:06,475
We, the detective squad set off to check on a rumour

3
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:10,675
saying that everything that is placed storeroom disappears in an instant.

4
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:14,375
Why are Genta and the others so excited about this case?

5
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:17,475
After checking the inside of the storeroom,

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,075
we find traces of footprints left here and there on the floor.

7
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:23,475
We also find a large abacus embedded in the wall beyond,

8
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:26,575
but there is nothing else there. The storeroom is completely empty.

9
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:32,075
But, when you look in through the window,

10
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,475
there is a heap of treasure that covers the entire floor.

11
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:39,675
It can't be! It was empty just a while ago!

12
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:42,575
However, when the door is opened again,

13
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,175
the treasure that was there is gone,

14
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,775
and the storeroom is empty as before.

15
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:50,275
I figured that either the ceiling or floor moved,

16
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:52,975
thereby making the treasure appear and disappear.

17
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:54,775
But that possibility was denied after looking at the pictures

18
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:56,675
taken by Mitsuhiko and the others

19
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,575
and the mark that was put on the floor.

20
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:02,475
Regardless, I'm sure there's something.

21
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:04,675
Something like magic,

22
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:07,375
in which the treasure can be put in and out.

23
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:12,075
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

24
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,275
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

25
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,075
The Detective Squad is really on their toes.

26
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,275
They solve the mystery of the rigged mansion.

27
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:20,075
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,075
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:24,175
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:09,464
"Treasure Battle in the Haunted Storeroom (Part 2)"

31
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:12,565
First, the thing that stands out is,

32
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:15,265
that queer Shinto altar that is set up

33
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,465
right above the entrance of the door.

34
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,065
Setting something right above a inward opening door

35
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,465
is dangerous, isn't it?

36
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,065
If someone happens to come in

37
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:25,065
when you're making an offering to the altar.

38
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,965
That's true.

39
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:29,565
And the thing that bothers me

40
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,665
even more than that altar is...

41
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,965
that abacus that's embedded in the wall

42
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,365
right opposite the Shinto altar.

43
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:39,665
I wonder what it is?

44
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:42,865
Maybe it's there to count the number of treasure that is brought here.

45
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:45,665
If so, it should be lying sideways.

46
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,865
If placing it vertically, no matter how much you calculate

47
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,565
and move the balls on the abacus,

48
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:51,165
they'll just all come falling down.

49
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,765
No, there's a stick sticking out from behind the balls

50
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:57,365
and it's set into the space behind.

51
00:03:58,365 --> 00:03:59,865
Genta, lend me your back!

52
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,265
Okay!

53
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:06,465
It's most likely that if you move one of the balls...

54
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:13,065
Did you hear that sound?

55
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:16,465
Conan, try moving more!

56
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,665
Yeah.

57
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:22,565
I'll move the ball that is right below the one I just moved, up.

58
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:26,065
It fell down.

59
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:30,065
It seems that the abacus is working as a switch for something,

60
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:33,165
and if the wrong ball is moved, it resets.

61
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:39,165
Judging from the amount of dust that is accumulated on the ball,

62
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:41,565
only the balls of the upper second level to the extreme right edge

63
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:44,465
seem to have been moved,

64
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:45,965
As for the five rows below,

65
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:47,365
only the balls of the 3rd row from the right

66
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:49,365
and the balls in the 6th row

67
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:52,265
and the 4th row with no balls

68
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:55,365
and the 8th row where the balls are all clumped together

69
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,265
show traces of having been moved.

70
00:04:57,265 --> 00:05:01,265
The 3rd row from the right...

71
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:02,565
And what row was it?

72
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:05,365
4th, 6th and 8th rows!

73
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:08,265
Huh? Are you keying in mail?

74
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:11,965
I'm taking notes, so I don't forget.

75
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:15,465
Okay, I'll go look through that window once more,

76
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:16,965
so wait for me inside!

77
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:18,365
Okay.

78
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:23,165
Hey, you haven't finished checking the storeroom yet?

79
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,065
No.

80
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:29,065
There's a strange slit in the door.

81
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:31,465
Besides, theses stairs...

82
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,365
Hey, hurry up and go look!

83
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:37,665
"Investigations should be done speedily" is basic!

84
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,165
Okay.

85
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,365
Darn! Is it Ms. Kobayashi...

86
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:47,565
the one who is giving them ideas?

87
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,965
Huh? You said I call the children?

88
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,765
I don't have such time.

89
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,965
I'm in the middle of a teacher's meeting, you know.

90
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:57,565
Rather, you're at the storeroom in question, aren't you?

91
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,165
Tell me where it is? I'll go on over later!

92
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,965
So, she isn't the one.

93
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:05,565
Which means...

94
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,665
Yeah, I did get a phone call from Ai.

95
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:10,265
Hey, quit playing dumb with me!

96
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,465
You called Mitsuhiko and the others, didn't you?

97
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:16,465
No, I didn't! Since Ai said she's going to be late today,

98
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:20,265
I'm making beef stew that takes time to make, you see!

99
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:24,265
Beef stew? I didn't know you could cook something like that, Doc.

100
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,665
The onions are starting to look good, Doc!

101
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:28,365
Oh, I see!

102
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:31,365
Hey, is Subaru there, too?

103
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:35,465
Yeah, I had him come over to make it while Ai's away!

104
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:39,365
He's a pretty good cook, you see!

105
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,465
Subaru's not text mailing while pan frying the onions, is he?

106
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:44,965
Of course not!

107
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:47,865
We can't take our eyes off the pan, because it'll get burnt if we do.

108
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:52,565
Then, who in the world is it that's giving them clues?

109
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,265
Oh, my God.

110
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:58,165
Is Conan Edogawa on the phone?

111
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:01,165
Yeah, it seems that he's gone with the children

112
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:04,265
to check up on a haunted storeroom.

113
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:05,865
A haunted storeroom?

114
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:08,765
According to the call I received from Ai a while ago,

115
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:12,165
it's a strange storeroom in which the things that are put inside it

116
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,165
disappear in no time at all.

117
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:18,165
That sure sounds interesting.

118
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,365
Conan!

119
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:28,765
How are things inside the storeroom as compared to a while ago?

120
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:31,165
Not any different.

121
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:35,065
The only difference is whether the treasure is there or not.

122
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:40,565
It seems that the floor is a bit farther than before.

123
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:42,565
Far?

124
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:46,865
It can't be, because the storeroom couldn't possibly be growing.

125
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:51,165
Maybe it ate up the treasure that Conan saw a while ago,

126
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:53,465
so the storeroom got big.

127
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:54,465
That can't be.

128
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:56,365
But...

129
00:07:57,665 --> 00:07:58,965
Something fell!

130
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:02,065
It seems to have been by the wall.

131
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:06,465
The detective squad badge!

132
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,865
It's Mitsuhiko's badge!

133
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:13,265
Where in the world did it come from?

134
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:17,465
It's here after all. Something's here after all!

135
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:19,865
There's a monster in the ceiling!

136
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:24,765
It picked up Mitsuhiko's badge, and threw it just now!

137
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,365
No way!

138
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:30,165
A monster in the ceiling? That can't be.

139
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,965
Could... could it be...

140
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:43,165
Uh, let's get out of this storeroom already.

141
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:45,865
Yeah, it's creepy.

142
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:47,765
But...

143
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:51,465
Telephone.

144
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,865
Maybe...

145
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,965
"I figured it out!"

146
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,965
Hey, it's about time you come out of the storeroom

147
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,365
or the sun will set soon!

148
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,465
Mister.

149
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,865
You said that this storeroom was built

150
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,965
around the end of the Tokugawa shogunate regimne, right?

151
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:08,665
Yeah.

152
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,965
Could the person who built it

153
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:13,365
have been Kichiemon Samizu, a puppeteer?

154
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:15,065
That's right.

155
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:17,865
Then, I think you should make a call.

156
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,765
Call the police officer from Investigations 3rd division.

157
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:33,065
Oh, it's you people who called us, the police.

158
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:35,465
We haven't seen you since the Girl's Day Festival doll case,

159
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:36,765
have we, Inspector Momose?

160
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,965
And, is it true that

161
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:42,465
you maybe have found the culprit who's on the run?

162
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:43,865
Yep, the fact is...

163
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,765
A thief!

164
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:48,165
The culprit who's been going around

165
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:51,465
breaking in to the jewelry and antique shops in this vicinity!

166
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,765
That guy is here. Inside this storeroom!

167
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:58,465
He's accumulated a lot of treasure here!

168
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,665
Inside this storeroom...

169
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:04,765
But, there's not one person here,

170
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:07,365
much less no sign of treasure at all.

171
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:09,065
This storeroom is rigged,

172
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:11,065
rigged to hide the treasure!

173
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:12,165
Rigged?

174
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:13,965
First, take note of this stairs

175
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:16,665
by the entrance!

176
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:18,565
It has four steps, correct?

177
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:19,565
Yeah...

178
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:24,865
But the stairs inside has five steps.

179
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,465
True...

180
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:30,165
Besides, don't you think that

181
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,065
every step on this side

182
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,165
is much higher than those at the entrance?

183
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:37,865
Now that you mentioned it.

184
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:42,165
I see. That's why when you first came inside this storeroom...

185
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:46,165
Be careful! Watch your step because it's dark.

186
00:10:47,665 --> 00:10:49,565
You tripped.

187
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,365
Yeah, because I thought there were four steps

188
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,165
like the one at the entrance.

189
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:57,165
But, so what?

190
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:58,965
Can't you tell?

191
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,865
Compared to the stairs outside,

192
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:02,565
there are more number of steps

193
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:05,265
and moreover, if the steps are higher,

194
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,665
it means, the inside is much deeper than is the ground.

195
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:09,865
It's only deeper.

196
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:12,065
There's no place a person can hide

197
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:14,465
or any place treasure can be hidden, is there?

198
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,765
Don't tell me that the floor opens up or something.

199
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,465
What's this?

200
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:25,365
It's the badge that we marked when we first came in here.

201
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:28,365
Back then, the storeroom was empty

202
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:32,765
but we left once and Conan looked inside again

203
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:36,065
there was a lot of treasure inside!

204
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:41,065
But, that window is about 2 meters from the ceiling.

205
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:43,265
The window that I looked at from outside a while ago,

206
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:45,565
is about 2 meters from the roof.

207
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:48,165
There seems to be nothing by the ceiling either.

208
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:52,165
Your badges don't seem to have moved either,

209
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:53,965
which means, there are no tricks on the floor.

210
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:57,265
To make it look that way, is where the trick of this storeroom is!

211
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:58,465
Trick?

212
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,465
Genta, are you ready?

213
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,965
Okay, I'll open it now!

214
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:07,065
What?

215
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:12,707
There's... there's a window on top of a window?

216
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:16,942
Hey! Are you really opening the window that's on the outside?

217
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,642
Yeah! I climbed the tree and opened it!

218
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:21,542
But, isn't it strange?

219
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:22,742
Just a while ago

220
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,342
the light seeped in from the space between the window below.

221
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:28,942
Huh? No light is seeping in now.

222
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:30,342
That's probably because

223
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:33,442
the a portion of the wooden board under the window is cut

224
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:36,242
in order to let light into the storeroom.

225
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:39,642
Then, a window matching the cut wood is also attached on the inside

226
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:42,742
made to look like a real window.

227
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:45,142
No light is seeping in right now because

228
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:46,542
when the window was opened,

229
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:49,542
something inside the wall like the wooden board slid

230
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:53,342
and it's rigged so that the space in the wall is blocked!

231
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:58,042
But if just like now, light is shone on it and the window is opened,

232
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,842
anybody could see through the trick.

233
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:04,142
It's true that if this storeroom was built in modern times,

234
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:06,342
it's an old-fashioned trick.

235
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,842
But it was built at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate regime

236
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,242
when there was no flashlight

237
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:14,142
that could conveniently shine light at a distance,

238
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,842
don't you think this is a quite high leveled trick?

239
00:13:16,842 --> 00:13:20,442
Above the entrance where the ceiling is,

240
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,342
it is hidden out of view.

241
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:23,742
Hidden out of view?

242
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:25,442
That Shinto altar!

243
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,242
It's attached right above the entrance

244
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:30,142
so that you can't look up at the ceiling.

245
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,542
If before entering, the person realizes

246
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,442
that compared to the height of the roof,

247
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:38,442
the ceiling after entering is obviously lower,

248
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,142
the trick would lose it's meaning.

249
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:44,642
Which means that the floor is constructed deeper than the ground,

250
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:47,542
to give off the illusion that the ceiling is not low.

251
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,742
Right! In other words,

252
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:52,242
this storeroom looks completely empty

253
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:55,342
but in fact, a mysterious space

254
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:58,142
exists in the ceiling!

255
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:01,342
True, it would turn out that way but...

256
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:04,042
How do you get up to the attic?

257
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,742
You don't climb up!

258
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,642
We mentioned that when we first came here,

259
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:12,542
we placed marked badges on the floor, didn't we?

260
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,442
When we came in here,

261
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:18,142
Ayumi and Genta's badges were not moved

262
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:22,042
but my badge alone that I left standing against the wall was gone.

263
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,342
Gone?

264
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:26,942
Yep! A little while later it came falling from above!

265
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:29,442
It's most likely that right above the badge that I left standing

266
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:32,142
poked into the wooden board of the ceiling,

267
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:34,342
hung suspended in the air for a while,

268
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:36,742
then naturally fell off.

269
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:41,142
If the badge poked into the wooden board of the ceiling...

270
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,242
Don't tell me that...

271
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:46,142
Yes, when Conan looked through the window,

272
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:49,842
and we consider the fact that then...

273
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:53,042
the floor was filled with treasure.

274
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,342
There's no doubt that the ceiling moves up and down!

275
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:56,542
I see.

276
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,942
If the storeroom was rigged to move during an age

277
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:02,242
when remote controllers didn't exist to move things from a distance,

278
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:04,342
someone had to be here!

279
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:06,942
However, if there is no sight of such a person around,

280
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,042
nor any trace of anyone having left the storeroom,

281
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,142
then the only conclusion is

282
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,942
that the person must still be in the attic.

283
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:15,642
Yeah! And that guy's somebody who has to hide

284
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,642
in the attic of a place like this.

285
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:19,642
And he's surrounded by treasure...

286
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:21,742
It's very likely that he's the thief

287
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:25,342
who's been breaking into places recently!

288
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,042
What do you think? Are we correct, Conan?

289
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:33,742
Yeah, exactly! You guys are super.

290
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:35,742
We did it...

291
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:39,742
Then, have you figured out how to move the ceiling, too?

292
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,642
That's probably done moving the balls on that abacus.

293
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,542
Move the balls, how?

294
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:48,642
Well, that's...

295
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:53,242
I've got to look at it with my own eyes to figure it out.

296
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:54,942
What?

297
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:02,142
I see... You have to look at it with your own eyes to figure it out.

298
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:04,242
Oh, well...

299
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:07,542
Inspector, the police officer you brought along is here, isn't he?

300
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,642
Yes.

301
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:13,242
Then, can you make him outside the storeroom.

302
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:15,542
Genta, keep your head inside the window!

303
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,242
Okay.

304
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,342
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko and Ai go out the storeroom

305
00:16:20,342 --> 00:16:23,642
and hide behind the police officer that will be coming!

306
00:16:23,642 --> 00:16:25,842
Okay.

307
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:29,042
I called two officers.

308
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:32,242
Then, all that needs to be done now is to lower the ceiling

309
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,742
by moving the balls of this abacus.

310
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,442
But, which balls and how do you move them.

311
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,142
The place that draws attention most

312
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:42,042
is the row right in the middle where the balls are clumped together.

313
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,842
Although they look as if they can't moved, they aren't movable,

314
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,342
we need to divide it right in the middle

315
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:50,042
and indicate something to the right and left, right?

316
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,642
Something like what?

317
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:54,742
Something like hiragana, katakana.

318
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:57,542
Or kanji characters.

319
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,342
Kanji characters?

320
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:00,742
You can figure out the character

321
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:02,742
to the left side of the abacus, can't you?

322
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:06,342
Raise the ball that is at the very bottom from the first seven row

323
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:09,242
from left just one space up.

324
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:17,242
That's right.

325
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:20,542
Then move the ball in the 3rd, 4th and 5th rows

326
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:24,542
that is 3rd from the bottom up.

327
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:32,742
The place with no balls look to be the kanji character "3".

328
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,542
Then, the right side.

329
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:37,742
Since there is a row with no balls whatsoever,

330
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:40,842
it stands for a kanji character with a vertical line in the middle.

331
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,542
Taking that into consideration

332
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:46,042
and move each ball one up.

333
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:49,942
The 2nd ball from the row to the extreme right

334
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:53,642
and 3rd ball from the bottom of the 2nd row,

335
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:57,642
Move the ball at the very bottom in the 5th row from the right.

336
00:17:57,642 --> 00:18:01,342
Then move the ball 2nd from the bottom in the 7th row from the right.

337
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:07,142
This is the character to the right is...

338
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:09,342
water (Mizu)?

339
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:12,942
Three (san) and water (mizu).

340
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,342
It's Kichiemon Samizu!

341
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:21,242
Kichiemon Samizu?

342
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:24,942
The puppeteer who was famous in the last days of the Tokugawa regime.

343
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:28,142
But, nothing moved!

344
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:31,442
Because the character hasn't been completed yet.

345
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:35,042
Try raising the ball in the top row at the right edge up!

346
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:37,142
Because the only ball that show traces of having been moved

347
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:39,242
in the top row is that.

348
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,742
Now the character has been completed,

349
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,342
The... the ceiling

350
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,342
is gradually closing in.

351
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,142
What's going on?

352
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,142
Conan.

353
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:11,042
Don't worry! It's built so that a space is made

354
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:14,042
in keeping with the angle of the roof.

355
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:20,242
Then, would you like to see the heap of treasure?

356
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:28,842
These are...

357
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:33,042
They're all items that were reported stolen!

358
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,442
Just as would be expected of the great Kichiemon Samizu,

359
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:39,242
a great trick indeed.

360
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,942
They are items I've never seen before too.

361
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:44,742
Maybe they're things that were in this storeroom to begin with?

362
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:46,442
I think they are valuables

363
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,042
that the owner who had asked Samizu

364
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:52,242
to make this storeroom hid here.

365
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:55,242
And the one who took advantage of this rigged storeroom

366
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:59,442
and hid the things that he stole inside and accumulated them is...

367
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:03,842
this thief over here.

368
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,342
I see.

369
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,442
After the children left this storeroom,

370
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:10,142
he tried to lower the ceiling and get out of here

371
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,542
but since you looked inside from the window,

372
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:15,042
he hastily moved the ceiling again

373
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:18,242
and returned it to the original position.

374
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:23,742
Seriously, this sure is some illusionary trick device.

375
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:28,042
Hey, sonny, be careful. He may have accomplices here with him.

376
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:32,942
There aren't any. Because there was only one type of footprints.

377
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:36,442
But, how do you plan to get out of here?

378
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:40,842
Because the ceiling was lowered, the door is half blocked.

379
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:44,142
See, between the floor that came down

380
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,542
and the door there is a stream of light, isn't there?

381
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:51,542
If you touch a place on the door...

382
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:56,442
Conan!

383
00:20:57,442 --> 00:21:00,142
You're the gardener that was hired to work here before!

384
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:03,742
So, that's when you found out about the secret of this storeroom!

385
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:07,142
I'm sorry!

386
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:32,942
And? How was it?

387
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:34,642
Our deduction!

388
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:36,842
Did we knock you out?

389
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:40,142
Great job.

390
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:42,842
Considering it was Heiji.

391
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:46,342
Sorry, sorry.

392
00:22:46,342 --> 00:22:50,942
I went to the detective agency to do some business.

393
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:52,242
And heard these kids saying

394
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:56,242
that they wanted to surprise the hell out of you.

395
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,742
So, I dropped them a few hints.

396
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:03,342
No, Conan, you shouldn't call your teacher by his first name.

397
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:05,242
Huh? Teacher?

398
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:09,842
Right, Mr. Hattori is your teacher, isn't he, Conan?

399
00:23:09,842 --> 00:23:11,542
Just what do you mean?

400
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,442
I showed them this picture.

401
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:18,242
So, I'm your teacher at being a detective.

402
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:23,542
Hey, isn't this the picture you took for fun some time ago.

403
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:26,742
Hey, Kudo! Something's on the ground.

404
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:31,042
Hattori, how dare you.

405
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:35,142
But, we didn't get to see Conan surprised out of his wits.

406
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:36,542
You can say that again.

407
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,242
It's too bad.

408
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:40,742
You shouldn't rely on someone else.

409
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:42,742
Right...

410
00:23:42,742 --> 00:23:45,942
If you want to realize your dreams,

411
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:49,442
you've got to exert effort on your own!

412
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:52,542
That's not for you to say, Hattori.

413
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:56,042
"Next Episode" -Homicide?

414
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,142
This Jr. student of Teitan University

415
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:00,842
called Teruaki Kunimatsu!

416
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:05,442
That lucky charm is the one that Kazuha valued?

417
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:07,242
What seems to be the matter?

418
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:10,142
A man with his hand in a cast was found punched up in the restroom.

419
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:13,742
Which means that the culprit is still inside.

420
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:17,542
Maybe we'll nail the culprit in a cinch.

421
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,442
Next Conan,

422
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:24,942
"Whereabouts of the Embarrassing Lucky Charm (Part 1)"
