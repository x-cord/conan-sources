1
00:00:02,156 --> 00:00:06,756
After watching the BIG Osaka versus Tokyo Spirits game,

2
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,056
we returned to Beika City by train.

3
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:12,356
Haibara the Higo super-fan was in a great mood

4
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:14,156
because she got a phone strap of him.

5
00:00:15,156 --> 00:00:17,756
But when she learned she lost the strap,

6
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,956
she became extremely disheartened.

7
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:24,956
Mitsuhiko's phone that was coincidentally recording a video captured

8
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:27,156
a man with his son who were riding on the same train

9
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:29,756
picking up her strap.

10
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,356
Amuro, who was parked in front of Dr. Agasa's house, became involved,

11
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:36,956
and together we set out to search for the strap, but...

12
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:40,056
"Toto Metro Lost and Found" -Thanks for waiting, kids.

13
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,656
Here. This is the strap, right?

14
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:45,956
What? That's not it!

15
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:48,156
That's Sanada.

16
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:51,156
We lost a Higo strap!

17
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:53,756
What? This isn't it?

18
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:58,056
Was this the man who turned that in?

19
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:02,756
No, it was a younger man.

20
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:07,056
Maybe...

21
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:08,556
Maybe?

22
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:10,956
They could be digging for clams.

23
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:14,456
You go digging for clams in spring.

24
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:16,256
We're on summer break.

25
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:20,156
Actually, you can do it all year round.

26
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:22,956
What? Really?

27
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:24,356
Yes.

28
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:27,856
And low tide at Chiyari Beach

29
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,456
is at 5:59 today.

30
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:31,556
When digging for clams,

31
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:36,156
it's best to arrive an hour or two before low tide,

32
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:39,156
so it makes sense that they took that train.

33
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:40,756
Really?

34
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:43,456
-Then... -If we go to that beach...

35
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:46,756
We'll be able to retrieve Haibara's strap.

36
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:51,856
Once that boy realizes the strap his dad picked up isn't his,

37
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:53,656
I'm sure he'll hand it over.

38
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,856
Yeah. And once we get it,

39
00:01:55,856 --> 00:02:01,456
we won't let anyone else take it until we return it to Ai!

40
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:03,556
No matter what!

41
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,956
Yeah!

42
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:07,556
Yes! Haibara will be so happy!

43
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:11,156
I'll go settle the bill.

44
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:14,356
You kids head to the car.

45
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,156
Sure.

46
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:18,856
Thanks, Amuro.

47
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,956
Thanks for the food...

48
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,056
Kazami.

49
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:41,756
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

50
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:43,656
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

51
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:45,556
It holds the key to my school trip!

52
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:48,056
Find Haibara's phone strap!

53
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:49,656
He sees through the one and only truth.

54
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:51,356
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

55
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,656
His name is Detective Conan.

56
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:40,262
"The Heartfelt Strap (Part 2)"

57
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,530
It's raining.

58
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,030
Seriously?

59
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,130
Looks like it's showering.

60
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,930
Let's hurry up and get inside Amuro's car.

61
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,730
-Okay. -Okay.

62
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,530
Gosh.

63
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,630
The rain's gonna soak me to the core.

64
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,148
What?

65
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:06,348
Hey, Genta!

66
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,348
Hurry up, hurry up!

67
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:10,948
You'll catch a cold!

68
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:12,248
Yes.

69
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,548
Give me a minute...

70
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:20,348
I see.

71
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:23,148
She's in that state

72
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:26,248
because she lost the Higo strap

73
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:29,748
that he himself touched?

74
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:30,948
Yeah.

75
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:32,948
Seeing her like that

76
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:35,848
reminds me that even though she normally acts so cool,

77
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:40,448
she's actually an 18 year-old girl on the inside.

78
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:46,348
It's easier for us if she remains a young girl.

79
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:48,648
Yes, you're right.

80
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:53,148
I received a message saying the situation is complicated.

81
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,748
I wonder if they'll find it.

82
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:57,548
Don't be silly, Dr. Agasa.

83
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:58,948
Silly?

84
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:02,648
It's less likely that it won't be found.

85
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:08,048
Japan's top two inspectors are on the case.

86
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:15,148
There are so many people!

87
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:17,448
It's not even clam hunting season.

88
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:20,548
We have to find them among all these people?

89
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:23,348
If only we knew their names...

90
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:28,948
-Are you in? -Yes.

91
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:31,248
I've boarded the Shonan Shinjuku rapid train

92
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:35,248
that departed Takasaki at 13:14.

93
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:37,948
Third car from the front.

94
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:41,948
It's the center door on the left side facing the direction of travel.

95
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:43,148
Got it.

96
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,548
"Yuya Kazami (30)" -I've arrived.

97
00:06:57,548 --> 00:07:01,148
I'm in front of the center left door of car three.

98
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:04,548
Crouch in front of the door and breathe on it.

99
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:05,748
What?

100
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:07,248
Hurry up!

101
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:08,548
Okay.

102
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,248
What does it say?

103
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:16,048
It's in hiragana.

104
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:19,248
It says "Yuto Yoshida".

105
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:21,648
Yuto Yoshida, right?

106
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:24,948
I'm glad you happened to be in Kanagawa.

107
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:27,048
Hey, Furuya.

108
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,248
What exactly are you investigating?

109
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,348
Thanks.

110
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,048
Hey, wait. Furuya...

111
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:35,548
"Beach House" -I've got it.

112
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:39,048
His name is Yuto Yoshiya.

113
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:40,648
Yuto Yoshida?

114
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:43,648
That's the boy's name?

115
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:44,848
Yes.

116
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:49,248
My friend happened to be on that train.

117
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:52,048
I had him breathe on the window

118
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:55,448
and check what that boy wrote.

119
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:57,148
Really?

120
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:59,248
Nice one, Amuro.

121
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,548
Now that we know that,

122
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:06,748
I'll set my bow tie-shaped voice-changer to loudspeaker mode, and...

123
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,648
Yuto Yoshida from Tokyo,

124
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:13,648
your friends have arrived.

125
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:17,048
Please come to the beach house immediately.

126
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:18,448
Once again.

127
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:21,548
Yuto Yoshida from Tokyo,

128
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:24,848
please come to the beach house immediately.

129
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,248
Hold on, Conan.

130
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:31,648
How do you know that boy's from Tokyo?

131
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:33,848
-Why wouldn't I? -What?

132
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,948
That train gets crowded at Shinjuku Station near the Toto Stadium,

133
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:40,948
the Tokyo Spirits' home stadium.

134
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:43,748
In other words, the station where we got on.

135
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:46,848
But that father and son weren't sitting,

136
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:49,748
which means they either got on

137
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:53,248
when we did or after that.

138
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:56,348
They could only be from Tokyo.

139
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:57,948
I see.

140
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,748
Excuse me.

141
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:08,948
Yuto Yoshida is my son.

142
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,748
Are you looking for someone else by the same name?

143
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:15,648
It's them!

144
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:18,248
Mister.

145
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:22,048
You picked up a soccer player strap on the train, right?

146
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:25,148
Yeah. I thought it was my son's.

147
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,248
But it was of a different player.

148
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:31,448
That's my friend's!

149
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:35,348
Your son's strap was at Chiyari Station!

150
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:36,948
Give it back!

151
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:40,648
Sure. I'm glad you came.

152
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,448
Here.

153
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:46,748
Sorry about that, kids.

154
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:48,348
No problem.

155
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:51,148
What?

156
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:56,448
What?

157
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:57,548
No way!

158
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,348
It was stolen!

159
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,548
Who is that?

160
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:03,948
-No! -Conan!

161
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,348
Darn!

162
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,948
Wait, why?

163
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,448
It's just a phone strap!

164
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:16,548
Come to think of it, I recognize that man.

165
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:17,948
What?

166
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:21,748
He was standing near the Chiyari Station lost and found

167
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:23,748
when we went there,

168
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,948
and I think he was sitting behind Ayumi

169
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:29,148
at the family restaurant we just visited.

170
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:32,648
Then maybe he's been following us this whole time

171
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:35,848
so he could swipe it!

172
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:37,148
Seriously?

173
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:38,748
That's awful!

174
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:41,048
Yeah, but why?

175
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:44,148
It's just a Higo phone strap!

176
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:45,848
It's not just a strap!

177
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:48,548
It was really important to Haibara!

178
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:52,348
There's only one strap like it in the whole world!

179
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:56,248
That doesn't answer the question.

180
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:59,048
Maybe...

181
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:02,648
it's because of what was inside the strap.

182
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,448
What?

183
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:07,948
Yuto, there was something inside it, right?

184
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:09,048
Yeah.

185
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,848
It was hard when I squeezed it.

186
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:15,148
There was something hard inside?

187
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:17,148
That something...

188
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:22,848
must be a flash drive with top secret data on it.

189
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,048
What?

190
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:26,048
That's impossible.

191
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:29,248
We bought it at the stadium store.

192
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:32,948
Actually, the straps were sold out,

193
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:38,448
and Haibara asked the clerk to sell her the display product.

194
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,148
Really?

195
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:45,448
Then that's not an impossible scenario.

196
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:48,248
One person picks up the display product

197
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:50,348
and puts something inside it while pretending to look at it.

198
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:52,548
Once that product sells out,

199
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:56,648
another person asks to purchase the display product.

200
00:11:56,648 --> 00:12:00,148
It's a way to secretly make a deal.

201
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,248
"Player Phone Straps"

202
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:05,048
But your friend bought the display product first.

203
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,848
While following her in order to get it back...

204
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:14,248
your friend dropped the strap when the train shook.

205
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:16,148
He took advantage of the opportunity to pick up the strap,

206
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:18,648
but it was the wrong one.

207
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:23,748
When he went to the station's lost and found to turn in the strap,

208
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:25,448
you kids appeared.

209
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:28,248
Since it seemed like you'd find the strap he wanted for himself,

210
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,948
he resumed following you

211
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,948
and waited for an opportunity to steal it.

212
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:37,848
Then once the deal is done...

213
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:40,148
That strap...

214
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:42,048
Will be thrown away.

215
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:44,748
We'll have to split up

216
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:47,548
and find that man!

217
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:48,848
Yeah...

218
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:52,948
Amuro, watch the exits.

219
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:57,748
He wasn't dressed like someone digging for clams.

220
00:12:57,748 --> 00:13:00,548
But, Conan,

221
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:03,548
there's still a lot of people.

222
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:08,548
People might help us if we were the police.

223
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:12,548
They'd probably get mad at us if we interrupted their digging.

224
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,048
Don't worry.

225
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,648
We're kids.

226
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:18,248
They'll overlook a minor inconvenience.

227
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:19,648
Since we're small,

228
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:22,448
we can slip through the crowds to look for him.

229
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,548
In this case, we might actually be more effective

230
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:27,548
than your average police officer.

231
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:30,548
Okay!

232
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,348
Let's do it!

233
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:33,748
Yeah!

234
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:36,448
In any case, loudly describe that man's appearance

235
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,848
so the people around you can hear you.

236
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:41,648
Once you find him, don't do anything.

237
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:44,448
Use your Detective Badge to notify me.

238
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,848
Yeah...

239
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:55,348
It's like you're using the Baker Street Irregulars

240
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:57,748
to gather information for you,

241
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:00,348
just like Sherlock Holmes.

242
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:02,348
I'm surprised, though.

243
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:05,448
I didn't think you'd be so desperate

244
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:08,648
to find the phone strap your friend lost.

245
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,848
Yeah.

246
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,848
There's a reason for that.

247
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:21,695
Excuse me!

248
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,795
Has anyone seen a tall man wearing a flat cap?

249
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:30,695
A man wearing a suit jacket and pants!

250
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,995
Anyone seen him?

251
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:36,595
Where's the warmly dressed man?

252
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:38,195
Excuse me!

253
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:43,395
Have you seen a man wearing a flat cap?

254
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:47,095
A man wearing a suit jacket and pants!

255
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,295
Our friend is watching the exits,

256
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:51,295
so you can't escape!

257
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:52,595
Darn!

258
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:57,795
A man wearing a suit! Where are you?

259
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:02,495
Have you seen a tall man wearing a suit?

260
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:04,495
A man wearing a suit jacket and pants!

261
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:05,895
Give yourself up!

262
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:07,795
You can't escape!

263
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:09,595
"Changing Room and Coin Lockers"

264
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:12,695
Ayumi here.

265
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:15,895
I haven't found any sign of that man.

266
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:20,095
Maybe he took off his clothes and hat.

267
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:22,295
The sun's starting to set.

268
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:25,395
Maybe he's planning to blend in with the people leaving.

269
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:28,095
Or maybe he's already escaped.

270
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,695
He hasn't left. Don't worry.

271
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:33,595
As long as you guys keep shouting,

272
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,095
eventually...

273
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,595
I've been waiting for you, mister.

274
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:54,095
Who... who are you, kid?

275
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:57,595
Don't play dumb.

276
00:15:57,595 --> 00:16:00,295
You could immediately remove your hat and jacket,

277
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:03,795
swap them out for something you bought here,

278
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:07,795
and stuff them into one of the bags sold at the store,

279
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:11,495
but you can't change your pants without visiting the changing room.

280
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:12,795
What?

281
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:14,295
Am I wrong?

282
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:18,195
Listen, I just came to change into shorts

283
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:20,195
so I could go digging for clams.

284
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:23,295
But look.

285
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,795
It's late in the afternoon.

286
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:28,195
Everyone's getting ready to leave.

287
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:31,795
You're going to start now?

288
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:34,795
I can do what I want!

289
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,895
And there's a price tag on your hat.

290
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:38,895
What?

291
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,395
No way.

292
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:44,895
That proves you hastily put it on as soon as you bought it.

293
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:46,495
And besides,

294
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:49,795
I can see the head of the strap poking out.

295
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,095
What?

296
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,995
You idiot. It's hidden right...

297
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:01,395
So you are the man

298
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,895
who stole the Higo strap from us.

299
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:08,895
Darn it!

300
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,895
Idiot.

301
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:13,195
You're not getting away!

302
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:19,595
My school trip!

303
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:22,595
This ends now!

304
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:37,495
Wait!

305
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:39,895
Darn it!

306
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,395
Conan!

307
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,395
Conan!

308
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:03,995
I managed to keep it from getting wet.

309
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,995
All right!

310
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,395
I see.

311
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:09,995
So those are his Power-Enhancing Shoes.

312
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:12,595
-Impressive, Conan! -Yeah!

313
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:15,395
You're amazing!

314
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,095
"Beach House" -What?

315
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:19,195
An engagement ring?

316
00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:22,895
That's what you put inside the strap?

317
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:27,295
Yeah. My girlfriend's a huge Higo fan.

318
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:29,995
I was going to surprise her tonight.

319
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,895
It really was inside.

320
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:36,395
It's so pretty.

321
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,595
It looks expensive.

322
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:41,195
Yeah. I splurged on it,

323
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:44,395
so I was worried if it was actually still inside there.

324
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:47,195
While checking it on the train,

325
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:49,595
I dropped it when the train shook.

326
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,495
I went to pick it up right away, but it was a different strap.

327
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:57,895
I saw the father and son standing nearby pick it up.

328
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:01,195
I thought I'd explain the situation when they got off

329
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:02,995
and exchange straps,

330
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:06,495
but Chiyari Station was full of people there to dig for clams.

331
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,795
I lost sight of them,

332
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:12,095
so I thought if I turned in their strap

333
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:13,895
to the lost and found and waited there,

334
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:16,795
they might show up.

335
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,495
That's when these kids arrived.

336
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:21,895
They seemed to be looking for the same strap for some reason,

337
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,395
so I followed them.

338
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:27,295
Then you should've said so sooner.

339
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,095
If we'd known, we would've helped you look for it.

340
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:32,695
But that girl...

341
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:33,795
And once we get it,

342
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:38,595
we won't let anyone else take it until we return it to Ai!

343
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,495
No matter what!

344
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,495
I heard her say that, so...

345
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:47,195
In other words, three people dropped their straps

346
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:49,095
when the train shook.

347
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:53,895
The father and son picked up his Higo strap,

348
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:59,095
and he picked up the son's Sanada strap.

349
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:02,095
Then where's Ai's strap?

350
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:03,795
It's a mystery.

351
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:07,195
I found my Detective Badge, though.

352
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:10,295
Genta, where did you find it?

353
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:12,995
What? In the parking lot of the family restaurant.

354
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:17,195
I put on my hood when it started to rain,

355
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,195
and it fell out.

356
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:23,995
It must have gotten in there when you tripped on the train.

357
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:25,895
Oh, right.

358
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,995
Hey, what are you doing?

359
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,395
If it's not in here,

360
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,195
then Haibara's strap...

361
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,395
is in the family restaurant parking lot!

362
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,995
Which means...

363
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:41,095
Haibara's strap

364
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:44,895
was also inside Genta's hood?

365
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:47,095
Yeah, probably.

366
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,695
It must've fallen with his badge

367
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:52,095
when Genta put on his hood.

368
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,795
So it should be around here where Genta put on his hood.

369
00:20:58,295 --> 00:20:59,695
I found it!

370
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:01,595
We did it!

371
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,595
-Finally! -Ai will be so happy!

372
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:05,795
Yeah!

373
00:22:33,195 --> 00:22:36,495
You found Ai's strap?

374
00:22:36,495 --> 00:22:38,395
Yeah, somehow.

375
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:41,295
Where's the driver of the RX-7?

376
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,295
Oh, Amuro?

377
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,695
He said he had something to do and left.

378
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:47,095
I see.

379
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:52,595
Ai!

380
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,995
We found your Higo strap!

381
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:57,095
Really?

382
00:22:57,095 --> 00:22:59,995
Yeah. It wasn't easy,

383
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,895
but we found it.

384
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:03,195
Yeah...

385
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:04,895
Thank you!

386
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:08,295
Here. It's your long-awaited Higo strap.

387
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:13,095
A car ran over it.

388
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:15,195
It was really dirty.

389
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:17,595
So we washed it clean with water.

390
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:21,295
The left eye had come off,

391
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:23,295
so we drew it on with a magic marker.

392
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:26,395
Good work, kids.

393
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,995
I'll get you something cold to drink.

394
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:30,595
Hooray!

395
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,095
That's not why we did it,

396
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:37,595
but if you don't mind,

397
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:39,795
the medicine to restore my body...

398
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,895
Absolutely not!

399
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:44,995
"Next Episode" -No...

400
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:46,795
Give me a break!

401
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:52,195
Come on. I'll take a romantic photo of you two.

402
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:54,495
What? Oh, yeah.

403
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:56,695
Didn't we meet on the beach when we were kids?

404
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:58,595
It's been 10 years, right?

405
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:00,195
10 years?

406
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,895
"Shinichi, hurry! Come to Nishiki's room!"

407
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:10,295
Next Conan special,

408
