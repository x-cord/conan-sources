1
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,387
Today's case is a very odd one.

2
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:24,387
Identical twins are killed at the same time in different towns.

3
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:25,987
Such a thing is just not possible!

4
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:27,587
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:29,487
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,788
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:57,736
"Beika Sports Center."

8
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:21,636
"Shoichiro Hitomi, (45)" -I beg you, give me a few more days.

9
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,661
Just a while longer!

10
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:29,835
I've waited and waited all this time.

11
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:31,636
I can't wait any longer.

12
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,836
Why don't you ask your younger brother for help?

13
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:41,536
If only I could do so...

14
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:48,536
"A Case of Synchronicity (Part 1)"

15
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:55,936
What shall I do? What can I do?

16
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,636
Men's room.

17
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:27,835
-Hello? -Oh, Dad.

18
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:29,235
Oh, Ran.

19
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:31,135
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Dad, what about lunch?

20
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,635
Do you think that you'll be coming home?

21
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,435
I'm still working.

22
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:37,235
Okay, then I'm going with Ran

23
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:40,135
to the "Super Cheap All-You-Can Eat Buffet"

24
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,836
so keep up your good work, Pops.

25
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:47,736
The Super Cheap All-You-Can Eat place?

26
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:57,736
But he really takes a long time.

27
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,936
Wait, could it be that he noticed me?

28
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,535
What the...

29
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:14,236
He seems like a totally different person from a while ago.

30
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:21,336
Oh, well.

31
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:35,236
"Beika Hotel."

32
00:04:48,436 --> 00:04:49,835
Dad.

33
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:52,935
You two... what brings you both here?

34
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,135
I mentioned it over the phone, didn't I?

35
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:56,235
Over there.

36
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:58,035
"Adult 980 yen, Child 600 yen" -Look.

37
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,136
"Restaurant Chuka Cuisine Buffet."

38
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:02,536
So this is where you two were talking about.

39
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,736
Oh, I mean this is no time for something like this.

40
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:11,936
Excuse me!

41
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:16,235
I'm Minamizato of room 1050,

42
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:17,835
"Kaoru Minamizato, (25)" -Uh...

43
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:21,236
Do you have something for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

44
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:25,635
No, ma'am.

45
00:05:25,636 --> 00:05:28,135
It can't be because I got a call a while ago

46
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:30,335
saying that the package was delivered here.

47
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,036
Please check carefully once more.

48
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,536
Oops...

49
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:45,936
We don't seem to have anything for you after all.

50
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:49,036
I see.

51
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,235
It's good.

52
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:00,335
I feel bad for dad, though.

53
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:03,036
It can't be helped because he's working.

54
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,135
What happened?

55
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,635
-A man fell. -What is it?

56
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:14,035
Conan!

57
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:16,935
It was the man we saw just a while ago!

58
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:18,435
Which means that...

59
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:19,536
Pops!

60
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,035
How can something like this happen?

61
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,436
While I was tailing him...

62
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:43,935
Shoichiro Hitomi, age 45.

63
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,035
I've been tailing him since this morning.

64
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:49,335
However, please do not ask me who asked me to do so.

65
00:06:49,336 --> 00:06:52,935
What on earth happened?

66
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:54,736
Let me explain.

67
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:46,335
I didn't want him to know that I was tailing him but...

68
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:49,035
No! Don't!

69
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,935
What's wrong?

70
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,436
Is anything the matter?

71
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,436
Don't tell me that...

72
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:05,336
Are you okay?

73
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,536
You're...

74
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,635
Sorry, I don't know what's come over me.

75
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,235
Just what are you talking about?

76
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:22,936
Never mind that, hurry and get down from there!

77
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:29,236
No, please overlook this.

78
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:46,635
Ms. Minamizato,

79
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:50,335
what is your connection with Mr. Shoichiro Hitomi?

80
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:51,735
I don't know.

81
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:52,736
Huh?

82
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:54,935
I'd like to ask you that question myself.

83
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:59,335
Who on earth is this Mr. Hitomi?

84
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:02,735
He tried to attack you, you know.

85
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,635
What do you mean you don't know?

86
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:06,635
It can't be the case.

87
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:10,235
It's true! I really don't know who he is!

88
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:11,536
But...

89
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:14,935
-Ms. Kaoru Minamizato. -Yes, sir?

90
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:17,935
That's the name you registered on the guest list,

91
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:21,536
but isn't your real name Kanako Hitomi?

92
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,935
And, who's that supposed to be?

93
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:29,035
The wife of Shoichiro's younger brother, Takehiko.

94
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:33,735
No, inspector, I've seen Kanako in a picture but...

95
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:36,435
Why did you think so?

96
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:39,435
When I checked the history of incoming calls on Shoichiro's cell phone,

97
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:44,835
the last person he had called to was Kanako Hitomi.

98
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:48,135
Calls? What time was it?

99
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:49,835
11.20am.

100
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,835
Oh, if so...

101
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:54,435
He went in at 11.10am

102
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:57,735
and came out at 11.30am.

103
00:09:57,736 --> 00:10:02,535
I guess, Shoichiro...

104
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:06,136
He called his brother's wife from inside the toilet during this time.

105
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:12,536
May I be excused, now?

106
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:16,436
I'm sorry, I'd like to be left alone.

107
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:21,336
The name was Anzai, wasn't it?

108
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:27,335
You know, the name you mentioned at the front desk a while ago.

109
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,836
Is there anything for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

110
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:34,935
I know Mr. Anzai.

111
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:36,835
Is anything wrong with that?

112
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,136
No.

113
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:49,735
Gosh. What an outright lie to say she doesn't know Shoichiro.

114
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,735
Maybe she really doesn't know him.

115
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:53,935
No darn way!

116
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:55,435
Huh?

117
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:56,635
What happened?

118
00:10:56,636 --> 00:11:00,135
Pops, don't you think this is strange?

119
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:01,535
What's strange?

120
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:05,235
Because Shoichiro had a cell phone, didn't he?

121
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:08,735
Then why did he use the public phone?

122
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:11,135
Maybe his phone was out of the service area.

123
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:13,235
It doesn't seem to be so.

124
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:14,835
Look.

125
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:16,335
True.

126
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:18,335
Mouri! Bad news!

127
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:19,935
What's the matter?

128
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:22,935
Look at that TV over there.

129
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:25,935
This is the site of the crime, Haido Condo.

130
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,836
The man who was killed is...

131
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:30,635
"Takehiko Hitomi, (45)" -It's Takehiko,

132
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:32,936
Mr. Shoichiro's younger brother.

133
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:35,735
The same age...

134
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,435
You mean...

135
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,035
they're twins!

136
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,535
The estimated time of death

137
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:43,735
is around 12.15pm in the afternoon today.

138
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,936
No way. 12.15pm is when Shoichiro...

139
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:51,135
It happened at the same time?

140
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:54,536
No way. Is something like that possible?

141
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:03,302
What?

142
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:06,302
The one that asked you to investigate on Shoichiro

143
00:12:06,303 --> 00:12:10,002
was his younger brother, Takehiko who was killed at Haido-cho?

144
00:12:10,003 --> 00:12:11,103
Yes.

145
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:16,702
And, what did Takehiko want you to do?

146
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,602
To check on his behavior.

147
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:22,302
According to Takehiko, Shoichiro, because of the fact that

148
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:24,902
they were identical twins who looked exactly alike,

149
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:30,702
may have been posing to be him and doing fraudulent business.

150
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:32,502
Oh, and what did you come up with?

151
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,602
Nothing definite yet.

152
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:37,702
But he really did have a large amount of debt,

153
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,002
and he was being pressured by the loan-sharks

154
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,703
to return the money this morning.

155
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:43,902
Which means...

156
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,902
that Shoichiro came to Beika Hotel

157
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:50,503
because he came up with some good idea to pay the money back?

158
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:54,802
Synchronicity!

159
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:57,402
What's with you, shouting out of the blue?

160
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,202
To think that the older and younger brother who were twins

161
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:01,602
died at the same time,

162
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:04,102
seems to be a coincidence...

163
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:05,602
However, maybe that's not all there is to it.

164
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:09,402
Maybe there was something more fateful involved there.

165
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:11,502
You mean that's synchro...

166
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:13,602
Synchronicity.

167
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:16,903
That's the theory that Psychologist Jung came up with.

168
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:25,602
You know, maybe it's the same as how we ran into you at this hotel, dad.

169
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:29,202
I see, I guess you could say so.

170
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:31,802
There is a possibility of it being a coincidence,

171
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:33,602
but I wonder...

172
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:36,702
Right, everything fits in too well.

173
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:40,103
We've got to scrutinize that two cases more closely.

174
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:43,102
The door was locked.

175
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:46,003
There are no signs of the door being forced opened either.

176
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:50,302
What an odd looking key hole.

177
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:53,303
It wouldn't be easy to make a spare key.

178
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,403
Was he killed here?

179
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:14,102
As you can see, the window is cracked from the outside.

180
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,103
It seems to have been a robbery.

181
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:22,902
If Takehiko was really killed by someone who broke in to rob him,

182
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:26,602
it would have nothing to do with the case in Beika-cho.

183
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:29,203
Could it actually be a mere coincidence?

184
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:36,402
"Kanako Hitomi, (36)" -You returned home around 2pm,

185
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:41,602
saw your husband dead, and called the police?

186
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:42,603
Yes, sir.

187
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:45,202
And, where did you return home from?

188
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:47,102
Beika-cho.

189
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:50,602
-Beika-cho? -Beika...

190
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:54,902
Is anything wrong?

191
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:57,802
Is this supposed to be synchronicity too?

192
00:14:57,803 --> 00:15:02,303
We were at Beika-cho just before coming here.

193
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,702
I see.

194
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,802
Shoichiro fell to his death from Beika Hotel.

195
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:11,603
Shoichiro did...

196
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:15,002
Oh no, is that true?

197
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:16,402
It's true.

198
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:19,302
Could it be that you went to Beika-cho

199
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:22,702
to meet Shoichiro there?

200
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:25,002
The thing is, we found after checking the outgoing calls

201
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:28,003
that he made on his cell phone, that he had called you.

202
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,302
Yes.

203
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:35,502
Please tell us what he wanted to talk to you about.

204
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,602
Shoichiro mentioned that

205
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,402
he wanted to make up with my husband

206
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,902
and asked me to act as their go-between.

207
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:45,902
Oh, make up.

208
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,202
Yes.

209
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:49,102
The thing is...

210
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,402
Shoichiro and Takehiko

211
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:55,102
had been working at father's company for quite some time

212
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:58,502
and there were times when the subject of

213
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:01,102
who will be succeeding father came up.

214
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:04,303
However, just about then, father suddenly passed away.

215
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,402
Why is it you?

216
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,802
Why are you, my kid brother, the president?

217
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,702
Don't ask me, it was in father's will!

218
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,402
Well, it is not hard to understand why dad picked me.

219
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:17,502
What?

220
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:20,302
I hear your wife went back to her home country.

221
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:24,202
Didn't you realize that she was only after your money?

222
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,102
That's what father based his decision on.

223
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:27,603
Shut up!

224
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:33,702
You're fired. Get out of here, this minute!

225
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:39,102
"Hitomi's Trade Company" -Shoichiro then started a company of his own

226
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:41,902
but, it didn't work out either and went bankrupt

227
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:44,403
leaving him deeply in debt.

228
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:48,503
Then, several nights ago...

229
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:54,803
I apologize. Please, I was wrong.

230
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:57,503
So, please...

231
00:16:58,503 --> 00:17:00,102
No, I beg you.

232
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,103
I... I need money...

233
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:12,903
I don't owe you anything.

234
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,202
If only...

235
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:22,003
If only you weren't here...

236
00:17:24,403 --> 00:17:25,802
I wanted them to make up

237
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:28,502
and become the two brothers that I had know before.

238
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,102
Therefore,

239
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:32,902
without letting my husband know,

240
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:35,702
I secretly gave Shoichiro my cell phone number,

241
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:38,103
as well as the spare key to the house.

242
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:43,802
On the other hand, Takehiko thinking that Shoichiro

243
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:46,002
being as cornered as he was,

244
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:49,402
may scheme up something using his name,

245
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,903
asked me to keep an eye on him.

246
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:55,902
To think that both of them would die at the same time...

247
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:57,702
Is this a coincidence...

248
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,503
or rather, some work of fate?

249
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:05,202
What did Shoichiro want when he called Kanako?

250
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:08,902
Didn't you hear? He wanted to make up with his brother.

251
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:11,302
Rather, please, I'd like to know too.

252
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:13,702
Could you tell us more in detail what the call was about?

253
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:15,003
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,703
-Hello? -Is Takehiko there?

255
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,102
Yes, he is. Would you like me to get him?

256
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:29,402
No, never mind.

257
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:30,502
I see.

258
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:35,902
Rather, I'd like to discuss something with you, Kanako.

259
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,102
I'd like to make up with Takehiko,

260
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:41,402
but I wonder if you could act as go-between for us.

261
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,002
Really? That's great.

262
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:46,302
Yes, of course, I'd be happy to!

263
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:49,202
Will you please come meet me at Beika-cho then?

264
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:50,702
Where in Beika-cho?

265
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:54,802
Beika Station at 12.30pm in front of the wicket.

266
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:56,002
Bye.

267
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:59,003
"Beika Station."

268
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:03,002
But, although I waited for quite some time,

269
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:05,503
Shoichiro never showed up.

270
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:13,603
I had no idea that things would turn out this way.

271
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:26,902
I wonder if he was planning to see her

272
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:30,602
after he finished what he had to do at Beika Hotel.

273
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,002
I guess so.

274
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:35,802
Only, that's if we believe Kanako's story.

275
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:38,603
I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.

276
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:43,202
For instance, for her to sneak into Takehiko's house

277
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:44,802
using that tree over there,

278
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:46,102
no matter how you look at it,

279
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,402
it's impossible for her to do so.

280
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:52,402
I guess so, which means that it is a robbery case after all.

281
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:54,302
If so...

282
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:58,502
The two cases are not related to each other in any way.

283
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:02,002
It can only be explained as a case of "synchronicity".

284
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:06,002
But, just to be on the safe side, let's check on Kanako's alibi too.

285
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:07,303
Alibi?

286
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:11,302
If Shoichiro didn't die...

287
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:14,402
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako" -He would've met with Kanako

288
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:16,802
and they would both have a perfect alibi.

289
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:19,102
This would exclude them from

290
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:21,402
the suspect list of Takehiko's homicide case.

291
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:22,502
But...

292
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:25,602
Shoichiro fell to his death in Beika.

293
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:29,302
And, another character, Kaoru Minamizato comes into the picture.

294
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:31,002
Although this case involved a simple relationship

295
00:20:31,003 --> 00:20:32,202
between two brothers and the wife,

296
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:34,202
"Shoichiro, Minamizato" -the appearance of Kaoru

297
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:36,803
makes the structure of the case even more complex.

298
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,002
Kaoru Minamizato.

299
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:42,003
Who on earth is she anyway?

300
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:46,302
But I really don't know who he is!

301
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:48,602
How can you say you don't know him?

302
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:51,602
He attacked you, didn't he, Shoichiro?

303
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:55,802
He must've hand a grudge on you or jealous of you or something.

304
00:20:55,803 --> 00:20:57,602
You don't know him.

305
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:00,602
That's something that is totally unbelievable.

306
00:21:00,603 --> 00:21:02,802
Just what do I have to do to get you to believe me?

307
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,102
Please tell us the truth!

308
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:08,102
It's true, I'm not lying!

309
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:09,602
Why would I lie to you after going through

310
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,702
something frightening like that?

311
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,502
God, you tell me...

312
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,902
Why... why is it like this?

313
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:19,002
Why?

314
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:22,303
Why is this all happening to me?

315
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:33,702
The incident in Haido-cho is a homicide

316
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:35,602
so investigation will continue

317
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:38,202
but this incident can probably be closed as an accident.

318
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:40,602
Is this a mere accident?

319
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,102
Well, it's true that the fact that Shoichiro falling to his death

320
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,702
was an accident,

321
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,702
but what about the fact that he attacked Kaoru?

322
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:49,002
Assault and battery.

323
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:50,902
Maybe it's a case of attempted homicide.

324
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:53,402
Even so, the case is closed through the death of the suspect

325
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:55,702
and when the necessary papers are turned in.

326
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:57,802
How can it be?

327
00:21:57,803 --> 00:22:00,602
I'm sure she's hiding something, though.

328
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:03,202
I wonder if she's trying to protect someone.

329
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,902
I'm sure the press will pursue this case though as an odd case,

330
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:07,702
in which twin brothers died at the same time

331
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:10,902
in two separate places.

332
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:13,302
Maybe it's "synchronicity" after all.

333
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:15,902
"Shoichiro, Takehiko" -Wrong, that's not it.

334
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:18,603
"Kanako, Kaoru Minamizato" -This is not a case of synchronicity.

335
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:22,102
The line that connects Kaoru with the others.

336
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:24,702
If I can figure out what that is, the mystery would be solved.

337
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:28,402
Why did Shoichiro attack,

338
00:22:28,403 --> 00:22:31,202
rather, try to kill Kaoru?

339
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:33,003
For what reason?

340
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:05,102
"Next Episode."

341
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:07,002
Dad, nab him.

342
00:24:07,003 --> 00:24:08,103
Okay!

343
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:12,902
I'm so sorry!

344
00:24:12,903 --> 00:24:15,802
It's the answer to solving both cases.

345
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:20,402
In other words, a frightening perfect crime was being schemed.

346
00:24:20,403 --> 00:24:22,902
Perfect crime?

347
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:24,602
Next Conan,

348
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:28,603
"A Case of Synchronicity (Part 2)"

349
00:24:44,203 --> 00:24:46,502
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:48,702
"Detective Kogoro's investigation."

351
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,602
In the next episode, Pop's investigation comes in really handy.

352
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:53,003
-How unusual. -Really?
