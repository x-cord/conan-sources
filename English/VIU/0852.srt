1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,888
Ran and I asked to accompany Pops Kogoro

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:06,788
have come to Beppu Hot Springs in Oita.

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,788
However, Pop's real purpose was

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:11,988
to search for the daughter of the president of a company,

5
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:14,689
Manami Nakadai, who had disappeared.

6
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:19,288
We were lucky enough to find Manami,

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,488
but when her father Mr. Nakadai,

8
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:26,188
his secretary Mr. Hosogai and her fiance Mr. Ehara come to get her,

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,389
an unexpected incident occurs.

10
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:30,988
Hello?

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,388
You're President Nakadai, correct?

12
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:33,888
Who's asking?

13
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:35,788
I have your daughter, Manami.

14
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:36,888
What?

15
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:39,088
If you want her back safely,

16
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,189
get 100 million yen ready.

17
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:47,789
Gosh!

18
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,988
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

19
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:12,188
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

20
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,488
A robbery and kidnapping case both happen at a hot spring.

21
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,788
Where is Conan's deduction headed towards?

22
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,388
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:20,488
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,989
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:57,087
"The Descent into the Hell Tour of Love (Oita Edition)"

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,100
This way!

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,199
Conan!

28
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,699
Are you all right?

29
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,600
Yep.

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,399
Ouch.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,499
Mr. Mouri, what's this about a kidnapping?

32
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,599
The daughter of Nakadai Electronics Manami was kidnapped.

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,699
What?

34
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,099
The car that was attacked by the armed robbery case

35
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,399
also belonged to Nakadai Electronics!

36
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
What?

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
The incident occurred three weeks ago.

38
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,499
It seems that the perp knew that the cash was in that car.

39
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,899
But the car distorted from the impact of the crash

40
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,599
and the hatch wouldn't open

41
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
so fortunately, the 100 million yen was left untouched.

42
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,299
The ransom asked for this time is 100 million yen, too.

43
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,399
The target was the same Nakadai Electronics.

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,399
This can't be a coincidence.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,800
It's probably the same perp.

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,099
Hello?

47
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,299
Officer Takagi, where are you now?

48
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,299
Bad news!

49
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,299
A kidnapping case took place over here, too!

50
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,699
Kidnap?

51
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,499
The daughter of the president of Nakadai Electronics was kidnapped

52
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,499
and the perp just demanded ransom.

53
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,399
-Hold it! -What?

54
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,099
The perp's appeared.

55
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,200
The perp's appeared?

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,499
Officer Sato, don't move until I get there!

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,800
Officer Sato?

58
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,899
Don't move!

59
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,599
I'm Officer Sato of MPD.

60
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm arresting you on charges of armed robbery!

61
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Hold still!

62
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,000
You hold still.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
What?

64
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,499
This is...

65
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,700
Could this be...

66
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,499
Gosh!

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,900
My beloved Officer Sato... What are you going to do to her?

68
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,299
There!

69
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,300
After them!

70
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,299
Are you also involved in a kidnapping case?

71
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,900
Shut up and drive!

72
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,500
Gosh. I won't ever let you get away!

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,299
Hey, where's the perp's car?

74
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,000
No good, I can't see a thing!

75
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,099
North Northwest!

76
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,299
Conan.

77
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,799
Pops make a left at the signal up ahead!

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,799
How come you're telling me what to do?

79
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,300
Actually back then, I...

80
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,700
Gosh!

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,800
Stuck a transmitter at the bottom of the bag.

82
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,400
It's Officer Takagi's rental car!

83
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Officer Sato, I'll be right over!

84
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,199
Where are you headed for?

85
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,399
To hell.

86
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
What?

87
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:06,999
To Ocean Hell.

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,999
I'm supposed to share the 100 million,

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,100
50 each with Hiroyuki over there.

90
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,499
Hiroyuki?

91
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,599
Who is Hiroyuki?

92
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,299
How should I know? I've never met him.

93
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,399
What?

94
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,699
I was invited to join him at a dark site.

95
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,699
It seems he has a grudge against Nakadai Electronics.

96
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,899
A grudge?

97
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,699
Since a drone was introduced to do transporting and security,

98
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,599
he seems to have been laid off.

99
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,799
So, the same happened to you too?

100
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,599
You used to work for Nakadai Electronics, correct?

101
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Shut up! Turn right over there!

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,099
Just as would be expected of you, Officer Sato.

103
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,200
What fantastic driving technique.

104
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,899
Come on, the perp will get away!

105
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,300
I won't let you get away!

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,100
Over to that shrine gate.

107
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,399
Come on, hurry, walk!

108
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Stop dilly-dallying!

109
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Is it you, Hiroyuki?

110
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,999
Conan?

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,699
Stay out of the way, brat!

112
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,299
Your plan's all over, mister.

113
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,799
You'd better give yourself up already!

114
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
What?

115
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,699
Officer Sato!

116
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,699
Officer Takagi, stay back!

117
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,199
-Oh, no! -Darn it, why you!

118
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,299
I'll send you all to hell!

119
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,100
Bad news! Look this way!

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
I can't see up ahead!

121
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Officer Sato, hurry go!

122
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,899
Officer Takagi, get him!

123
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,200
Yes, madam!

124
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,699
The perp is Ryuji Ogikubo.

125
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,099
It seems he used to work for Nakadai Electronics.

126
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,399
Hey, where's Manami?

127
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,699
Where is she?

128
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,299
I don't know! Why don't you go ask Hiroyuki?

129
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,200
Hiroyuki?

130
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,700
Hiroyuki...

131
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,399
Is something wrong?

132
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,799
No, we've got to find the bag with the ransom in it.

133
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
These two cases...

134
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,900
Maybe are...

135
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,500
I found it!

136
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,999
Not inside! The ransom is gone!

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
What?

138
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,400
I see.

139
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,100
So, that's the story.

140
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,969
What's going on?

141
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,469
Where did Manami as well as the ransom go?

142
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,969
I don't know.

143
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,969
I think Manami is with the person called Hiroyuki.

144
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,669
With Hiroyuki?

145
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,669
When Manami came to Beppu,

146
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,569
she left a note behind, didn't she?

147
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,969
Which means she left a note behind at the inn too, no?

148
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,469
Left a note behind?

149
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,169
Just what are you talking about?

150
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,969
How could she have left a note behind when she was kidnapped?

151
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,069
Maybe Hiroyuki told the man

152
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,669
to get rid of the note if he found one.

153
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,869
Yeah, that's right.

154
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,969
I found the daughter's note

155
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,270
so I crumpled it up and put it in my left pocket.

156
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,069
What?

157
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,670
Is this pocket?

158
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,669
True!

159
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,269
In other words, Manami wasn't kidnapped.

160
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,170
-What? -Not kidnapped?

161
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,269
Hiroyuki.

162
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,269
May I take off the blindfold already?

163
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,770
Go ahead.

164
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,669
Did you make this, Hiroyuki?

165
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,469
Right.

166
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,170
The title's Manami.

167
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,369
Why didn't you tell me about it?

168
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,969
The picture I sent you was an invitation.

169
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,769
This was also supposed to be part of the performance, you see.

170
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,169
I saw on TV that you got engaged

171
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,169
and figured I'd have to go this far to make you come.

172
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,969
I was waiting for you.

173
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,269
You're the one who left me alone all this time!

174
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,569
I wrote to you several times, but got no answer.

175
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,169
Letters? I didn't get any.

176
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,169
Just as I thought.

177
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,669
Hiroyuki.

178
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,169
Of course, I'm the one to blame.

179
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,369
I was so absorbed in this piece of art

180
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,870
that six months had passed in no time at all.

181
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,469
But I was intent on finishing it by today, our anniversary.

182
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,769
Anniversary?

183
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,170
We met a year ago today.

184
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,369
So, you remembered.

185
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,570
Yeah.

186
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,969
Okay, I'll take Ogikubo to the Oita Prefectural Police Department, then!

187
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,970
Thank you for your cooperation.

188
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,269
Hello?

189
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,570
Manami?

190
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,470
"Oita Prefectural Art Museum"

191
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,069
Dad!

192
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,669
Manami!

193
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,669
I'm glad you're okay.

194
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,969
I thought you were kidnapped, you see.

195
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,669
Kidnapped?

196
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,069
Just what do you mean, Dad?

197
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,970
Mr. Mouri, will you explain?

198
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,469
Sure.

199
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,469
The perp of this case to begin with three weeks ago

200
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,170
also tried to robbed an armored vehicle of 100 million yen.

201
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,869
But couldn't steal the money because of an accident.

202
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,269
Isn't that right, Mr. Hosogai?

203
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,269
Yes, sir.

204
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,969
The perp used Hiroyuki's name

205
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,569
and lured Ryuji Ogikubo to become an accomplice.

206
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,669
First, he was asked to rob an armored truck but failed.

207
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,469
Next, he made up Manami's kidnap case

208
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,969
and tried to get hold of ransom.

209
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,669
Doing good, Pops.

210
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,569
You're deduction's right on the ball for a change.

211
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,469
By the way, Mr. Hosogai,

212
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:09,769
I'll bet Manami asked you for advice in place of her busy father?

213
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,969
About Hiroyuki, too.

214
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,569
Yes, it's true that she asked me for advice.

215
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,569
I'll bet you actually wanted to marry Manami

216
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,369
and become a successor to the president?

217
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,669
Hey, what're you talking about, Pops?

218
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,469
That's why you made up that kidnapping case using Hiroyuki's name

219
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,269
as well as try to break up the engagement she had with Mr. Ehara

220
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,370
and furthermore, try to break her relation with Hiroyuki, too.

221
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,669
So now, let's cut out the joke.

222
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,869
The perps who executed the case this time

223
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,870
were Ogikubo and Hiroyuki his accomplice, these two men.

224
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,669
Hiroyuki knew to begin with where Manami was going to be staying.

225
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,670
So, he sent Ogikubo there.

226
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,969
He made Ogikubo watch Manami's room

227
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,469
and made him send information on it.

228
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,269
Please understand, Hiroyuki.

229
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,469
I don't want to get Father worried.

230
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,869
What? Was my room being peeked into?

231
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,669
Right, by using a drone.

232
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,969
Drone?

233
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,369
A surveillance camera and sound collector

234
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,169
were also equipped on the drone that was used.

235
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,169
Then, maybe what I saw in my room last night was...

236
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,269
You saw two red lamps

237
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,569
and the reflection looked to be the horns of an ogre.

238
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,569
The sound of the waterfall is pretty loud there

239
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,369
so the sound of the drone is erased.

240
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,769
The silhouette of the branches of the pine trees overlapping each other

241
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,369
did indeed look like an ogre.

242
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,669
That's correct, isn't it, Conan?

243
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,469
Yep. That's why there were no footsteps left outside the window.

244
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,069
There were scratches on the trunk of the tree

245
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,770
that were left behind by the drone.

246
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,569
Ogikubo who was staying at the same inn as Manami,

247
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,869
got instructions from his accomplice Hiroyuki.

248
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,669
He took Manami's note away

249
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,569
and he also messed up the room

250
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,469
to make it look as if Manami had really been kidnapped.

251
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,769
If she were taken away by force,

252
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,869
she wouldn't open her brand new shoes, would she?

253
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,269
However, in that room,

254
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,069
an empty box of new shoes was left behind.

255
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,669
Isn't it because she was expecting her fiance Mr. Ehara to come?

256
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,169
I'm sure Manami didn't know that Mr. Ehara was coming.

257
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,069
You opened your brand new shoes

258
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,469
to meet with the real Hiroyuki, didn't you?

259
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,669
Yes!

260
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,569
Manami, you have a fiance called Mr. Ehara, you know!

261
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,069
We got engaged because you got in the way of Hiroyuki and me!

262
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,369
I'm sure you knew that I liked Hiroyuki all the while

263
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,369
because I talked to you about him and asked you for advice, too!

264
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,169
Is that true, Hosogai?

265
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,869
What? I just...

266
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,369
Right. In this case,

267
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,669
you used Ogikubo to execute the crime by using Hiroyuki'name

268
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,369
and was manipulating everything from behind the steam.

269
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,569
Since you knew the relationship that Manami had with Hiroyuki very well

270
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,069
so you were able to predict Manami actions,

271
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,769
and you were able to know the transport route

272
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,669
of the 100 million yen of three weeks ago.

273
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,169
Right. It was...

274
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,970
none other than Nakadai Electronics secretary to president...

275
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,569
Mr. Yozo Hosogai!

276
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,269
Don't... don't be ridiculous!

277
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,869
Why should I want 100 million yen?

278
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,569
It's 50 million because you were planning to split it

279
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,669
with Ogikubo, correct?

280
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,169
What were you planning to use the enormous sum of 50 million for?

281
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,869
Could it have been to make up for the money

282
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,869
that you embezzled from the company?

283
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,670
Hosogai, is it true?

284
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,669
I...

285
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,669
I'm sorry!

286
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,969
I don't know what got into me!

287
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,169
Where did you put the ransom of 100 million yen?

288
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,069
I don't know about it!

289
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,269
I really don't!

290
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,969
Mr. Hosogai isn't the one who stole the 100 million yen.

291
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,869
There was a guy who took advantage of this case

292
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,069
and tried to snatch and run with the cash.

293
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,769
What?

294
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,069
That's...

295
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,669
Mr. Ehara.

296
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,269
Don't be ridiculous!

297
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,569
Why should I, who's making 20 billion annually,

298
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,369
want to steal a measly 100 million?

299
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,469
Mr. Ehara.

300
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,470
I hear business isn't going too good at your company, is it?

301
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,769
I hear that you rushed getting married to Manami

302
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,470
because you had your eyes on Mr. Nakadai's assets, no?

303
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,269
How rude of you.

304
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,569
On what grounds are you saying that?

305
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,769
For example, a fashionable person like you,

306
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,569
despite going to meet your fiance.

307
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,669
it's strange that you would wear an outfit

308
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,169
that you once wore in a gravure.

309
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,669
Besides, you don't seem to be wearing your wristwatch

310
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,469
that's worth one million yen today either.

311
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,169
I'll bet you sold it off for want of cash?

312
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,769
Don't get funny!

313
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,169
You're not making a criminal out of me

314
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,269
just because of my clothes and watch!

315
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,669
That's not all.

316
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,169
When you were waiting with the ransom in the waiting room,

317
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,670
Officer Takagi burst in and...

318
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,670
-Hold it! -There was a bit of a racket, wasn't there?

319
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,370
Over here.

320
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,469
Back then, you switched the 100 million yen bills with magazines.

321
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,369
You're the only one who could've done that!

322
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,569
If we search under the shelf of the resting room,

323
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,869
I'm sure that we'll find the 100 million yen.

324
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,369
Where do you have proof that I did it?

325
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,969
If you have proof, show it to me!

326
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,570
That's the proof.

327
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,569
Conan, you wrote on the bills using a fluorescent marker, didn't you?

328
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,669
Yep!

329
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,869
If somebody touches that money,

330
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,170
fluorescent paint should be on that person's hands.

331
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,769
Hiroyuki.

332
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,069
Yes.

333
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,469
This is a splendid art object.

334
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,369
If we use the new bulb that we invented at our company,

335
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,769
I'm sure it would stand out even more.

336
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,569
Won't you let me use it?

337
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,269
Thank you.

338
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,969
Dad!

339
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,169
I'm glad.

340
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,569
That's great.

341
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,170
Yep.

342
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,170
What?

343
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,170
What?

344
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,770
"Steam Hell Kannawa Studio"

345
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,669
Is it ready yet?

346
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,770
Put them in here.

347
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,469
This is fantastic! This Oita steamed basket with food galore.

348
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,269
Dad, don't drink too much.

349
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,969
What a surprise

350
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,969
that Officer Takagi and Sato were here on an secret date.

351
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,869
Please don't tell Inspector Megure about this.

352
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,969
Well, you arrested the perp too,

353
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,169
so I guess Inspector Megure will overlook it this time.

354
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,769
He may overlook it, but I won't.

355
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,470
I can't ignore the fact that he played hooky on the job!

356
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,169
This is what you call the real hell of steam.

357
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,070
Funny!

358
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,769
Beer after having solved a case sure is delicious!

359
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,269
Agree?

360
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,269
"No drinking"

361
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,169
I'm the one who solved the case, you know.

362
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,370
Agreed?

363
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,269
"Next Episode" -Come to think of it,

364
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,270
I thought something dropped when I took the shoe horn.

365
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,669
I think it'll do if you paste it back on with glue or something.

366
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,669
I guess we'll just have to ask the nursery school teacher

367
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,969
to get you a new one.

368
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,669
I finished making it!

369
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,370
Make one for me, too.

370
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,869
That's cherry blossom, right?

371
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:12,070
