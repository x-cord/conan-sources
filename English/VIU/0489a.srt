1
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:02,703
It says here that on the day the incident occurred,

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,503
after work, you stopped over

3
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:07,203
at a pub on Suehiro Avenue called Espa,

4
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:09,903
and drank beer along with 180 cc of sake,

5
00:00:09,903 --> 00:00:12,903
then left the pub at around 20:00.

6
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:14,603
Is this correct?

7
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:15,703
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:17,703
At the Toriyacho intersection,

9
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:20,403
a little after 23:00, you hit the victim,

10
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:22,403
who was on his way home with your car.

11
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:26,003
Where and what were you doing during this time?

12
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,803
I figured I should cool off a bit before going home,

13
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:32,203
so I took a rest in the car, and fell asleep.

14
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:35,103
Is there anyone who can testify this for you?

15
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:36,403
No.

16
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,103
Why did you flee from the scene of the accident

17
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:41,603
instead of helping the victim right away?

18
00:00:41,603 --> 00:00:43,503
I got so upset...

19
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:46,303
that I...

20
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:48,403
Is that really the only reason?

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,103
Ten days have already gone by

22
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,003
since you've been detained,

23
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:01,003
but is the prosecutor asking you every day?

24
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,903
Ms. Kujo, the prosecutor in charge is an able woman.

25
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:10,603
She would never detain anyone for 10 days without reason.

26
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:15,403
I'm on your side.

27
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:16,903
So, even if it is something disadvantageous to you,

28
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:18,703
please be honest with me.

29
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:31,903
Ms. Kisaki.

30
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:34,603
Have you come to talk to the suspect?

31
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,403
Yes, sort of...

32
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:38,503
Great timing, Ms. Kujo.

33
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:40,303
I'd like to talk to you.

34
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:42,103
What is it?

35
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,103
It's been a while since Mr. Takeuchi's detained,

36
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:48,403
so I'd like to ask you to release him. Isn't it about time?

37
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:50,203
He turned himself in,

38
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:53,003
and since he's already admitted to committing the crime,

39
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:56,103
is there any further reason you should keep him detained?

40
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:58,003
I hate to put it this way,

41
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:03,603
but I'd like that judgment to be left up to me.

42
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:05,403
Then, I'll submit a request for you

43
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:08,003
to make public the reason for his detention.

44
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,303
Please go ahead and do what you must.

45
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:12,303
If you will excuse me, goodbye.

46
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,603
What are you after, Prosecutor Kujo?

47
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:22,403
Only to bring the truth to light.

48
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:25,303
It's so unlike you, Ms. Kujo.

49
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:27,003
I'll see you in court.

50
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:39,103
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

51
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:41,303
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

52
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:43,003
Two sizzling hot rivals.

53
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:44,903
Attorney At Law, Kisaki,

54
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:46,203
confronts a competent prosecutor in court.

55
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:47,903
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:49,303
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,203
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

58
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,557
"Confrontation in Court III".

59
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:39,657
"Prosecutor is Witness".

60
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:46,357
Really, why do I have to do something like this?

61
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:49,957
But this job is what you asked mom to do, isn't it?

62
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,257
I only asked her because the woman owner of a shop that I frequent

63
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:55,557
asked me if I knew a good lawyer.

64
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:57,257
I hear that prosecutor Kujo was hiding

65
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:59,457
the fact that she was in charge of the case.

66
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:02,457
It's a simple case, in which all that's left to do now

67
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:06,157
is to lighten the sentence as much as possible

68
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:07,957
after pleading extenuating circumstances.

69
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,457
It doesn't matter who the prosecutor is!

70
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,157
Just as Pops says

71
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:15,457
there should be no room for a confrontation in court.

72
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:18,357
I wonder what Prosecutor Kujo is after.

73
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:21,557
"Toriya Police Station"

74
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:25,557
Thank you for coming from so far away.

75
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:28,157
This is the car that had the accident.

76
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:30,957
If I remember correctly, the victim was on a bicycle.

77
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:33,357
Yes, sir. According to an eye-witness,

78
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:34,457
the car ran the red light

79
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:37,457
and hit the bicycle upon entering the intersection.

80
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:38,957
From the traces left behind,

81
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:40,557
it is thought that the driver was going

82
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,657
at a speed of almost 60 kilometers.

83
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:44,657
How terrible.

84
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:45,957
Hey, Kid.

85
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:47,857
Don't go touching the evidence.

86
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:49,057
Pops.

87
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,257
How tall was the man called Takeuchi?

88
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:54,157
How tall?

89
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:57,957
I think he was a bit taller than me.

90
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,957
Then, I wonder if someone else drove the car after the accident?

91
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:03,357
Don't be silly.

92
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:05,257
There's no way that anyone could've driven the car

93
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,157
after such an accident.

94
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:09,357
But look at this seat.

95
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:14,857
See, the seat is pushed a lot to the front, right?

96
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:18,657
I think it would even be hard for you to drive this way, Pops.

97
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:21,957
True. Maybe it's just about right for me.

98
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:24,257
When you confiscated this car,

99
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:26,657
did a women officer drive it?

100
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:27,957
No way!

101
00:06:27,957 --> 00:06:31,057
We would never drive a vehicle that serves as evidence.

102
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,957
We brought this car here from the condo of the suspect

103
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:35,357
using a tow truck.

104
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:38,157
Then, maybe the forensic officers moved the seat forward

105
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:40,157
when they inspected it.

106
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:43,857
No, the forensic officer didn't move the seat either.

107
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:47,357
I'm sure because Prosecutor Kujo was very careful

108
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,157
about confirming that point too.

109
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:50,457
Madonna was?

110
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,057
Yes, that's right.

111
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:54,357
I mean she was so very persistent.

112
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:03,057
Just as the bicycle was about to cross the intersection

113
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,257
the car rammed into the bicycle.

114
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,857
And, where were you at that time?

115
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:09,257
I was stopped at the traffic signal at this corner here

116
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,257
waiting for the light to change.

117
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:24,457
Oh, no.

118
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,657
Since the driver screeched to a stop,

119
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:28,857
I thought he was going to come out of the car to help the victim,

120
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:31,057
but he just hit and ran.

121
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:33,057
And, did you see the driver's face?

122
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:35,057
No, because it was dark,

123
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:37,257
and he didn't come out of the car.

124
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,657
I see.

125
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,757
Sir?

126
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:42,757
Wasn't the driver

127
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:45,057
a very small person?

128
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:47,257
Sonny, how did you know...

129
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:48,257
Well?

130
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:51,457
Yes, the prosecutor asked me the same question too.

131
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,057
However, since the driver didn't come out of the car,

132
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,257
I couldn't tell how tall the driver was, or if it was a man or a woman.

133
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:57,357
Hey, wait up!

134
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,157
What do you mean it was a woman?

135
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:01,257
The one who turned himself in is a man!

136
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:04,357
I know because I read the papers.

137
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:06,657
I thought that was a queer question to ask me.

138
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,857
And, what did you answer, Sir?

139
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:11,057
So, like I said, I didn't see the driver,

140
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,457
so I couldn't answer.

141
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:13,957
I guess not.

142
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:16,857
And, was there anything else you noticed?

143
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:20,657
Well, something I noticed...

144
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,857
That's right, when the culprit fled

145
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:32,157
something glistened around here.

146
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:33,757
Not glasses?

147
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:37,357
No, it had more glitter.

148
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:39,257
Accessory?

149
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:47,757
-We're home! -We're home!

150
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:50,757
You're back, Ran and Conan.

151
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:52,157
Either way, we'll just have to

152
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,557
wait and see what the prosecutor has to say.

153
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:58,357
I'll pay you a good sum,

154
00:08:58,357 --> 00:08:59,957
so please just see to it that everything turns out okay.

155
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,357
Your husband seems to be exhausted too,

156
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:08,257
so please go see him as much as you can.

157
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,057
I'm busy with work, you see.

158
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:12,357
Goodbye.

159
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:22,257
You say that the driver of the car that got into the accident

160
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,457
may have been a woman?

161
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:25,457
It seems that Prosecutor Kujo was

162
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:28,357
asking the taxi driver whether the driver of the car was a woman.

163
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:31,557
Is she saying that my client is lying?

164
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:34,457
Maybe he's a scapegoat.

165
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,857
A hit-and run is a serious crime.

166
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,357
It's not possible that someone would act as a scapegoat.

167
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:41,057
Don't tell me he's doing it for his wife?

168
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:45,157
The seat of the car would be a perfect fit for his wife's height.

169
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:47,957
Maybe Prosecutor Kujo is not releasing him

170
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:50,057
because that's what she's after?

171
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:55,357
Ms. Kuriyama.

172
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:58,257
Mrs. Takeuchi said that she was busy with work,

173
00:09:58,257 --> 00:09:59,957
but what does she do?

174
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:04,357
Something about she succeeded her father who passed away last year,

175
00:10:04,357 --> 00:10:07,157
and is now the president of her father's company.

176
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:09,357
His wife is of a higher rank than he is.

177
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:10,957
Yes, but I don't think

178
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,357
he'll act as a scapegoat in a hit-and-run case

179
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:14,157
unless he has a good reason.

180
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:15,257
Ms. Kuriyama.

181
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,457
Yes.

182
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:17,857
Will you call the investigation company

183
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:19,857
and gather the staff immediately?

184
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:22,457
We need to redo the investigation.

185
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:23,757
Okay!

186
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:30,557
This case doesn't seem to be a mere hit-and-run incident.

187
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:57,386
Ms. Kujo?

188
00:10:58,486 --> 00:10:59,886
May I have a moment with you?

189
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:03,686
Please wait ten minutes

190
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,786
because I have two more kilometers to go.

191
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:09,086
Okay, I'll be at the lounge downstairs.

192
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,886
All right.

193
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:17,886
I'm sorry to intrude on you during your lunch break.

194
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,586
No problem.

195
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:22,986
So, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?

196
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,586
Well, you see.

197
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:26,986
Let me get straight to the point, then.

198
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,786
Please release Mr. Takeuchi right now!

199
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:33,886
You're not after Mr. Takeuchi,

200
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:36,386
but rather his wife, aren't you?

201
00:11:36,386 --> 00:11:38,786
Just what are you doing?

202
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:42,786
Doing something similar to arresting someone on a holding charge.

203
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,486
Or do you have something else in mind?

204
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:49,186
Okay.

205
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,086
I'll approve his release.

206
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,286
Huh?

207
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:54,086
Bye, then, I have a case to attend to.

208
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:56,286
Hey, Ms. Kujo!

209
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:57,586
Ms. Kujo?

210
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:06,986
-Huh? -He was released?

211
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,186
Yes, just a while ago.

212
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,186
He's talking to Ms. Kisaki now.

213
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:17,186
At least now you've been released.

214
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,786
But the tough part has just begun.

215
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:22,786
If you really need my help,

216
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:25,286
please tell me the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

217
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,086
I've told you the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

218
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:29,386
Ms. Kisaki.

219
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,186
Well,

220
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,186
I guess I'll go get myself a good drink, since it's been a while.

221
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:39,186
-Mr. Takeuchi. -Huh?

222
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:42,786
Didn't you turn yourself in as a scapegoat for your wife?

223
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:46,386
Why'd you do such a stupid thing?

224
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:48,786
No, I did it.

225
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:51,086
Don't lie to me!

226
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,386
Do you have proof or something?

227
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,786
The prosecution is investigating on that line too.

228
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:59,486
If they have evidence, she should've been arrested long ago.

229
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,886
Do you think something like that would work for Prosecutor Kujo?

230
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:05,986
If it's about that woman prosecutor,

231
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,786
I know her very well.

232
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,286
Just what do you mean?

233
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:12,686
At any rate, I'm counting on you.

234
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:13,686
Wait!

235
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:14,786
Shoots!

236
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:24,786
Not too good, Kid.

237
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:27,286
Eavesdropping is a crime.

238
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,186
Bye, then.

239
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:33,186
He knew about Prosecutor Kujo to begin with?

240
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,486
What?

241
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:00,186
You have a phone call from suspect Takeuchi,

242
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:01,186
what would you like to do?

243
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:04,986
Okay, I'll take it.

244
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:06,186
Number 3.

245
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:10,086
Hello. This is Kujo.

246
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,886
"Mouri Detective Agency"

247
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:24,186
"Takeuchi Construction Company Subject of Construction Scandal"

248
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:26,186
I found it, here it is!

249
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:27,986
What're you looking at, Conan?

250
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:30,086
Mr. Takeuchi's company

251
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:34,386
was scandalized for shoddy construction five years ago, wasn't it?

252
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:36,386
I wonder is that really true.

253
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:38,086
Yeah.

254
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,486
It was supposed to have evolved into

255
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:42,586
a case involving the political world too,

256
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,686
but the department head of the subsidiary design company

257
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:46,786
committed suicide and all vanished into smoke.

258
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:47,886
As a result, it seems that the senior prosecutor

259
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,586
was flown over to a remote district.

260
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:52,486
What about it?

261
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:55,786
Maybe it has nothing to do with what's happening now,

262
00:14:55,786 --> 00:15:00,186
but I was just wondering around when Mr. Takeuchi got to know Ms. Kujo.

263
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:04,286
What? Takeuchi and Madonna knew each other from before?

264
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:07,486
Yes, he said so, at Ms. Kisaki's place.

265
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,486
He says he knows a lot about Prosecutor Kujo.

266
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:14,186
I haven't heard he's been arrested before, though.

267
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:15,886
Hey, Pops.

268
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:19,286
I watch a lot of news like these on TV

269
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,786
but doesn't the special investigation department handle cases like these?

270
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:22,786
I see!

271
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:25,886
If Madonna was in that special investigation department

272
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:30,686
and if Takeuchi was involved in the case...

273
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:33,886
Maybe there's something behind all this.

274
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:40,686
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

275
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:43,686
Oh, Ms. Kuriyama.

276
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:45,186
Yes, he's here.

277
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,586
Dad, it's from Ms. Kuriyama.

278
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:48,986
She says it's an emergency.

279
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:52,886
What's up?

280
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,386
What? Takeuchi died?

281
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:57,186
Just what do you mean?

282
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:59,686
How'd he die?

283
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:14,386
Ms. Kisaki, Mr. Mouri is...

284
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:15,786
Dear.

285
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:18,086
Hey, what's going on?

286
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,086
Is it true that Takeuchi died?

287
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:21,186
Yes.

288
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:25,786
He jumped off the veranda of his room on the sixth floor of this condo.

289
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,886
He seems to have died instantly.

290
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,386
He jumped?

291
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:30,486
You mean he committed suicide?

292
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:31,686
It seems to be so.

293
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:32,786
Absurd!

294
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:34,886
He was finally released and yet!

295
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:36,786
I realized that too!

296
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:39,086
I'm confused myself.

297
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,286
Isn't there a possibility that it was an accident?

298
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:42,686
No, there isn't.

299
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:44,886
They even found a will.

300
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:47,786
Moreover, there's an eye-witness.

301
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:49,386
An eye-witness?

302
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:56,486

He said that he'd tell me the truth so to come over.

333
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:06,076
You mean the truth about his wife?

334
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:07,976
Or was he referring to the incident five years ago?

335
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:11,376
You knew about it?

336
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:14,676
You seem to have been a member of the special investigation team, right?

337
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:15,676
Yes.

338
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:20,676
It started off as the construction fraud of Takeuchi Construction Company.

339
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:21,776
But there seemed to be

340
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:26,076
a bribery case involving politicians behind the scene too,

341
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,176
so I was asked to help out.

342
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:29,876
If I remember correctly, the department head of the construction company

343
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,076
that was said to be the key to solving this case committed suicide,

344
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:33,876
and everything was thrown into ambiguity.

345
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,276
Yes.

346
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:39,676
One of the persons working under that department head was Takeuchi.

347
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:42,776
I see, so that's the story.

348
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:45,076
His testimony was supposed to have served as a breakthrough

349
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:47,476
to solving the entire case,

350
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:49,576
but he suddenly changed his story,

351
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:52,176
so we had no choice but to drop charges.

352
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:53,476
Then, he got married

353
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,676
and became the son-in-law of Takeuchi Construction Company

354
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:57,876
and became an executive.

355
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:00,276
And now, five years later,

356
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:02,676
that man appeared before you

357
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:05,976
as a suspect of a hit-and-run case.

358
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:10,276
I immediately suspected that he may have acted as a scapegoat for his wife.

359
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:14,176
I didn't want to overlook this opportunity!

360
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:17,876
That's why you pursued him on another case.

361
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:19,276
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:23,176
But if he called you to tell you the truth,

363
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:25,876
why did he commit suicide by jumping off the veranda?

364
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:28,676
I don't know either.

365
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:31,076
It sure is strange.

366
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:35,676
Will you tell me of how things were when he committed suicide?

367
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:42,176
That day, at 20:00, the appointed time,

368
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,176
I arrived at his condominium.

369
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:48,276
Hold on!

370
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:51,376
Thank you, you're a lifesaver.

371
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,976
Oh, prosecutor!

372
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:54,176
Are you going to see my husband?

373
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:55,876
Yes, sort of.

374
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:58,076
Are you headed home now, Mrs. Takeuchi?

375
00:20:58,076 --> 00:21:00,576
The thing is, I got a strange mail from my husband,

376
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:02,476
so I rushed back.

377
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:04,476
Strange mail?

378
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:07,376
Thank you for everything you did for me so far.

379
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:10,276
Please forget about me and find happiness.

380
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:14,276
It sure is a strange mail.

381
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,976
Dear? Where are you?

382
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,276
Dear?

383
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:23,576
Dear? What're you doing there?

384
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,276
Please, don't!

385
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:27,276
Prosecutor, please stop my husband!

386
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:28,676
Excuse me!

387
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:33,276
My husband is out on the veranda!

388
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:40,676
Mr. Takeuchi! Just what do you think you're doing?

389
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,676
Mr. Takeuchi!

390
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,976
Oh, no.

391
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:54,476
Dear!

392
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:05,876
It's strange

393
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:07,576
for him to commit suicide after calling the prosecutor

394
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,376
that's investigating him to come and see him.

395
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,176
Something's not right.

396
00:22:43,376 --> 00:22:44,376
"The deceased, Takeshi Nezu"

397
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,376
"Third anniversary of my husband's death will be held on November 27th."

398
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:47,376
"Please drop in on me if you come around. - Kayoko Nezu"

399
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:54,376
"Take care of yourself. I hope you'll do a good job."

400
00:22:54,376 --> 00:22:55,976
"Your former boss, Takeshi Nezu."

401
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:03,076
"Espa"

402
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:05,076
But really,

403
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:08,776
I still can't believe that Mr. Takeuchi committed suicide.

404
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:10,876
He jumped from the veranda right

405
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:14,076
in front of the eyes of his wife and the prosecutor,

406
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,676
so there's no doubt.

407
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:17,276
But,

408
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,976
he came here the night before he died

409
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:22,676
and was drinking in a very good mood.

410
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:24,376
In a very good mood?

411
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:25,376
Yes.

412
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:27,876
He was saying that he'd be a free man soon,

413
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:30,476
so maybe he'd take a trip abroad.

414
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,076
I mean he was just out on bail,

415
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:34,676
and his trial was still to come.

416
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:36,176
I said the same thing to him,

417
00:23:36,176 --> 00:23:38,876
but he said the trial was no problem.

418
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,376
He was more concerned about getting a divorce and starting over again.

419
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:44,176
Unthinkable.

420
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:45,876
He supposedly loved her so much

421
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:48,476
that he turned himself in to the police as her scapegoat.

422
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:53,076
But he seems to have had arrangements for a divorce ready.

423
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:55,376
What's going on?

424
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:01,276
Something's fishy after all.

425
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:04,076
Why is Mr. Takeuchi dressed like this?

426
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,676
Besides, what is this...

427
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:08,876
Hey, Glasses Kid!

428
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:12,376
How dare you read somebody else's stuff again without permission?

429
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:16,976
I wonder why Mr. Takeuchi was dressed like this when he died?

430
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:21,176
Because why would a person who is planning to die

431
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:24,976
wear a suit as if he were going to go out?

432
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:27,176
He was planning to take a death dive journey,

433
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,076
so maybe that's why he wore a suit top.

434
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,476
But, his pants are jeans.

435
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:36,176
Maybe he was delirious before taking his death dive.

436
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:40,176
Besides, by the stomach part and both knee parts of his clothes,

437
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:43,076
there is a mark that looks to be like something scraped against it.

438
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:45,076
I wonder what it is.

439
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,376
What do you think it is?

440
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,976
Something's strange about Mr. Takeuchi's suicide.

441
00:24:56,976 --> 00:24:58,076
Who cares!

442
00:24:58,076 --> 00:24:59,876
Keep your nose out of the business of adults!

443
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:00,876
Ouch!

444
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:05,976
But you borrowed the autopsy report

445
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:08,576
because you had your doubts too, right, Pops?

446
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:10,676
Shut up!

447
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,076
Dad, where are you going?

448
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,176
Pachinko!

449
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:14,476
Hey, Dad!

450
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:16,876
What about the investigation?

451
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:27,076
Bricks are nowhere in sight.

452
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:28,976
Hey, Kid.

453
00:25:28,976 --> 00:25:31,476
Remember? It was on the autopsy report.

454
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:32,976
There is a trace of a bruise on the back of his head

455
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:34,476
that seems to have been caused by hitting a brick.

456
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:36,276
I tell you, take a good look, will you?

457
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:38,776
By the mark of the body near his head,

458
00:25:38,776 --> 00:25:42,076
there are plants surrounded by bricks.

459
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:44,476
But, if he hit the brick there,

460
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,076
wouldn't the plant be broken off too?

461
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:48,576
And the brick would be shattered too, wouldn't it?

462
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:50,576
He came falling from the sixth floor...

463
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:55,776
What on earth...

464
00:25:56,776 --> 00:25:58,676
She says that she cannot bear living in the room

465
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,076
that she was living together with her husband in,

466
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:02,476
and has gone back to her parent's home.

467
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:04,076
It seems that she's going to be putting it out for sale.

468
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:05,376
Hey, Kid!

469
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:07,676
Okay, Mr. Mouri,

470
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:10,676
please return the key to the manager's office on your way home.

471
00:26:10,676 --> 00:26:11,976
All right.

472
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,676
It's here, after all.

473
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,176
I wonder why this antenna is faced downward.

474
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:22,376
So, this is the veranda in question.

475
00:26:22,376 --> 00:26:24,276
He jumped from here?

476
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:25,776
Where's the brick?

477
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:34,376
Soil.

478
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:37,176
I get it! It was probably switched

479
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:40,076
with the bricks where the plants were.

480
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:45,076
All that's left to figure out is how he was made to dive to his death

481
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:47,576
in front of Prosecutor Kujo's very eyes.

482
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:51,676
I get it!

483
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:55,476
Where? Where is it?

484
00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:57,476
Was it already gotten rid of?

485
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:59,076
Darn.

486
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:03,176
I found it.

487
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:06,276
I've figured out

488
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:09,676
why the corpse was wearing the top of a suit,

489
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:13,876
why there were scrape marks by the stomach part and both knee parts,

490
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:16,476
as well as why the antenna was faced downwards

491
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:19,276
and why the metal was stretched out.

492
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:22,276
This is a murder case!
