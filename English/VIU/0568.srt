1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,047
Let's call it a day!

2
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:10,247
This case was closed faster than expected, wasn't it?

3
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:14,247
Yeah, thanks to Officer Takagi staking out stubbornly, I guess.

4
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,347
I would prefer you using the adjective persistent.

5
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:19,147
-Here. -Hot!

6
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:23,747
-Reward! -Thanks.

7
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:25,147
Here.

8
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:27,947
Officer Shiratori, good work, too.

9
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:36,847
Huh? You don't like canned coffee?

10
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:38,447
It's not that.

11
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:40,947
-Here you go. -Thank you.

12
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:44,347
Okay, then the three of us we go out to dinner?

13
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:45,847
Sounds great!

14
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:47,947
I'm sorry,

15
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,547
but count me out.

16
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:51,747
Why?

17
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:53,247
It's my day off tomorrow,

18
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:55,347
so I've got a lot of things to do.

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,647
I see.

20
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:58,847
Come to think of it,

21
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:01,947
I found a delicious noodle shop!

22
00:01:01,947 --> 00:01:04,447
Great work, police sergeant!

23
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:07,347
The pan fried minced pork and vegetable dumpling is really delicious!

24
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:10,047
I look forward to it.

25
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,947
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:17,047
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:18,547
What is Inspector Shiratori's memory of first love

28
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:21,147
that involves Cherry Blossoms?

29
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,947
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:24,847
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:26,847
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,411
"Inspector Shiratori's Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 1)".

33
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,211
"White Cliff."

34
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,111
Well, all I was planning to do was

35
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:23,611
to go watch a movie alone, though.

36
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,511
Inspector Shiratori?

37
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,411
What a coincidence to run into you here!

38
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:41,411
But, how unexpected.

39
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,611
You like this too, don't you, Inspector Shiratori?

40
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:45,711
Huh? Like, what?

41
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:48,111
What else, but Gomera!

42
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,411
Gomera?

43
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:52,111
No, I'm watching "White Cliff"...

44
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:54,811
But, the ticket that came out is...

45
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:55,811
Huh?

46
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,911
"Great Monster Battle."

47
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,511
I guess I chose the category in the wrong row

48
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:03,611
when I reserved it on the Internet.

49
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,911
Let's go get something at the stand

50
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,011
before going to our seats!

51
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,111
-Yeah! -Let's go!

52
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:11,411
Well, it's my day off that I don't get that often.

53
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:15,011
I guess it's not that bad going back to feeling like a child, is it?

54
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:17,711
-His face seems to be saying that. -Huh?

55
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,511
I'll bet it's just something shocking

56
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,811
that involves Officer Sato again, but...

57
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,011
I think it's best to forget about it, no?

58
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,811
Because after all, Officer Sato and Officer Takagi were sort of...

59
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,711
You know, what in the hospital room...

60
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:37,111
I won't give up that easily.

61
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:41,111
After all, she's the person who changed my life, my destiny.

62
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:42,911
Your destiny?

63
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,011
Right.

64
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:47,011
It was back when I was in elementary school

65
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:50,411
when I was choosing a reference book at a book store.

66
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:54,111
Hold it!

67
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:58,311
I saw you do it!

68
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:01,811
I saw you put the comics under your clothes!

69
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:05,611
-You brat... -Hey.

70
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,111
Let her be. Let's go.

71
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,011
I guess so.

72
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,311
Hold it!

73
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,711
Thief!

74
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,011
Shut up!

75
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,811
You darn brat!

76
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:20,611
I saw what you did too.

77
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,811
I saw you both stealing.

78
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,511
What're you talking about?

79
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:28,711
Code of law 235.

80
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:31,311
Those who take the property of others

81
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,711
shall be accused of stealing

82
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:36,411
and be sentenced to less than 10 years in prison.

83
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:38,611
Sentenced?

84
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:39,911
Hey.

85
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:44,811
Excuse me. Is anything the matter?

86
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,011
No.

87
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:50,111
We were just having a brawl over a book with that brat.

88
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,411
Because this comic is pretty popular.

89
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,511
Sir.

90
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:02,311
Is anything wrong?

91
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:04,411
Not really.

92
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:06,111
It's nothing.

93
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:09,511
Are you looking for someone?

94
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:10,711
No.

95
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:24,211
If you wanted a reference book,

96
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,811
you should've told me

97
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:27,611
so that I could've bought it for you.

98
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,111
No. I need to see it for myself

99
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,911
and train myself to choose the best book I can find on my own

100
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:36,811
in order to become an efficient lawyer.

101
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:38,611
Absolutely.

102
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:47,811
Here, this is for you for helping me out.

103
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,311
I bought coke at that fast food shop over there

104
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:53,011
and made it using the wrapper of the straw as fast as I could,

105
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,211
so it's not all that nice, but...

106
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,911
Cherry blossoms.

107
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:58,511
Yep, that's right.

108
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:00,211
It's a symbol of courage!

109
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:05,411
I don't think that's what Cherry blossoms stood for.

110
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:08,311
But the cherry blossom mark

111
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,511
is what all police officers have on them!

112
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:13,211
It's a symbol of strength, kindness, coolness,

113
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:15,211
a flower of justice!

114
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,811
I see.

115
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:28,111
That's why you became a police officer.

116
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:29,511
Yeah.

117
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:33,311
That's why when I saw her again at the First Investigation Division,

118
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:36,611
I was convinced that I was destined to marry her.

119
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:39,811
That is, until Officer Takagi appeared.

120
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:43,711
But, was that girl really Officer Sato?

121
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:47,611
Yeah, her facial features are unmistakably.

122
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:50,411
But, I wonder if that tomboy Officer Sato

123
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,911
would do something like that.

124
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,411
That's the only thing that's bothering me.

125
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:56,811
Hey!

126
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,011
It's almost time, so let's go inside!

127
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,811
Conan and Ai, if you're going to buy drinks, please hurry!

128
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:04,811
I bought popcorn for all of us already!

129
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:06,911
Thank you for waiting.

130
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,911
-Here you go. -Thanks.

131
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:15,711
Well, you should go confirm it with Officer Sato.

132
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:19,811
You could be super surprised at how wrong you may be.

133
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:22,011
Next person, please.

134
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,311
What would you like to order?

135
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,811
Well...

136
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:26,111
I guess...

137
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,711
I'll have a coke.

138
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,711
Thank you for waiting.

139
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,311
How wrong I may be?

140
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:40,411
Hey, will you give me the wrapper of your straw?

141
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,911
Okay.

142
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:44,811
What're you going to do?

143
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:47,111
It's a secret.

144
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,211
Here! These are our seats!

145
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:59,311
Wow! It's right in front of the screen!

146
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,311
We've need to be grateful to Doc

147
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:04,011
who got us the tickets through the internet.

148
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:07,011
It was forecast that this movie would be crowded.

149
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,411
It would've been nice if Doc could've come too.

150
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:14,111
It can't be helped because he had urgent business to attend to.

151
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,411
Over here.

152
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:21,211
My seat is right in front of the children's seats.

153
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:28,011
I... I'm sorry!

154
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:30,411
I was looking for my seat, so I...

155
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:32,811
-Was it coke? -Yes.

156
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:35,911
I'll go get you a new drink right away!

157
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:45,511
So much for good memories, I guess.

158
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,611
I'm sorry about it.

159
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,911
Here you go!

160
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,211
Flowers...

161
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:02,211
"Nami Kasakura (27)" -It's just a habit of mine since I was a child.

162
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:06,011
I just can't help making it when I get hold of straw wrappers.

163
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,611
It's just a token of my apology,

164
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:11,411
but if you don't like it, please take it off.

165
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,811
No.

166
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:14,611
It's the lady we saw a while ago!

167
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,611
We're over here!

168
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,811
Those children let me know

169
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:22,511
that I had forgotten my wallet

170
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:25,011
on the ticket vending machine a while ago.

171
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:26,611
I see.

172
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:30,611
But, I didn't think that I would be sitting next to you.

173
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:32,111
Yeah.

174
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:34,411
I feel that it is some work of fate, don't you?

175
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:37,911
Fate?

176
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:40,611
I guess I exaggerated a bit here.

177
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:43,411
No. I was a bit surprised, though.

178
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,811
Huh? Those two...

179
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,711
They look good together.

180
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:50,411
This popcorn is good too!

181
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:52,411
A new love.

182
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,511
Right?

183
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:01,711
"Gomera."

184
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,411
"Great Monster Battle."

185
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,611
Gomera. Gomera.

186
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:17,211
Please, Gomera.

187
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:21,411
Please let out all the power you have left in you for us.

188
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:24,811
This movie really keeps going at it despite saying this is the last series.

189
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:28,011
Yeah, the one previous to this was "Farewell Gomera"

190
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:31,311
and the one before that was "Gomera Forever".

191
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:34,111
Well, if the children all like it,

192
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,811
that's all that counts, right?

193
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:44,411
Cell phone?

194
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:50,411
Oh, no.

195
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,211
Gomera's internal organs...

196
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,911
This CG is pretty good, really.

197
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:00,111
Hey, Ai. That's CG...

198
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:09,811
Gomera final really was something, wasn't it?

199
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:12,311
Yes. I was really touched!

200
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:15,111
Are you all right?

201
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:18,211
Yes. I just lack a little sleep.

202
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,611
It can't be helped!

203
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:21,711
Because police officers usually don't get to sleep much

204
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:24,111
when they're working.

205
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,111
Are you an officer?

206
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:30,411
Yes, although today is my day off.

207
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,711
Is anything wrong?

208
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:38,311
Well, I was planning to go talk to the police about something.

209
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:39,911
Will you hear me out?

210
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,211
So, it's about a stalker?

211
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:51,311
Yes, I happen to sense something like that since the other day.

212
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:55,311
Didn't you tell your friends or acquaintances about this?

213
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:57,811
I did tell my boyfriend about it.

214
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,511
And he's staying in my room at my condo right now.

215
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:03,511
Your boyfriend, you say?

216
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:05,511
Too bad.

217
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:09,511
Hey, can you scoot over that side a bit there?

218
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:10,811
Can't do.

219
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,511
Genta, you're taking up too much space.

220
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:15,111
This car's too small.

221
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,611
You guys.

222
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:19,411
If you don't quiet down a bit, I'm going to let you down.

223
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:22,311
I see.

224
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:24,011
Someone is following you,

225
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,111
or rummaging through your trash

226
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,911
or crank calling you.

227
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:31,911
Well, it could all just be my imagination too.

228
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:35,511
I'm back.

229
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:37,611
I met this police officer today and I...

230
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:56,595
At the movie theater...

231
00:13:56,595 --> 00:13:58,495
Then, Inspector Shiratori,

232
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:01,295
you're saying that you coincidentally happened to

233
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:03,995
sit next to Ms. Sasakura in the theater.

234
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:04,995
Yes.

235
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,495
When she found out that I was from the police,

236
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:11,895
she told me that she was being troubled by a stalker.

237
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:14,895
So, I came to her room in this condo

238
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:19,195
and found the body of this man that had been murdered.

239
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:22,895
The name of the victim is Mr. Yoshiro Kamei, age 30.

240
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,895
He works for a stock exchange company nearby.

241
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:32,695
And, he's the man you've been going with, is that right?

242
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:34,095
Yes.

243
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:37,395
I also told him that I was being troubled by a stalker,

244
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:40,795
and had him come here from about two or three days ago.

245
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,995
According to the coroner's report,

246
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:46,395
the estimated time of death is around 14:00 today.

247
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:48,895
He was beaten to death.

248
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:52,395
He seems to have been struck with a hard rod like object.

249
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:55,195
Was the door locked when you came back?

250
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,095
It was opened,

251
00:14:57,095 --> 00:15:01,195
but the spare key that he usual has attached to his hips is gone,

252
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:02,695
so maybe...

253
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,295
It could be that the culprit made away

254
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:08,695
after locking the door with the spare key then.

255
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:11,995
In order to delay the discovery of the victim as much as possible.

256
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:18,695
If that stalker had abnormal feelings of love for you,

257
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:25,695
it's no wonder if he had bitter feelings against your boyfriend

258
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,195
who was sleeping over at your place.

259
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,595
No... no way.

260
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,295
Or...

261
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:35,495
you made it look that way after you killed him.

262
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:43,095
Please wait a minute, Inspector Megure.

263
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:45,295
If it was about 14:00, she was at the theatre

264
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:49,195
sitting next to me and watching the movie.

265
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:51,395
She couldn't have done it.

266
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:55,295
But, it only takes about five minutes from here to the theater.

267
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,895
She could've slipped out of the theater

268
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:58,495
saying she was going to the restroom,

269
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:02,595
take the cab, commit the murder then come back with the cab again.

270
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:06,995
Well, if you can testify that she was beside you all the while,

271
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:09,195
then there would be no problem.

272
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:13,195
No, I can't because I dozed off part way.

273
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:15,895
Inspector Megure.

274
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:19,495
It seems that the victim did make a call to someone at around 14:00,

275
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,995
the time the murder was committed.

276
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:23,395
What?

277
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:26,095
That could be me.

278
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,995
I got a call while I was watching the movie,

279
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:31,195
so I rushed to hang up.

280
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:34,095
I forgot to turn off my cell phone before the movie started, you see.

281
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:36,995
Do you remember this?

282
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:42,395
No. I seem to have been sleeping just then.

283
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:45,095
I saw!

284
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:46,595
Just what do you mean?

285
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:49,695
While I was watching the movie, light suddenly flashed.

286
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:52,495
I saw the hat of that lady!

287
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,995
I think that the light leaked

288
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:58,295
when I opened the cell phone to switch it off.

289
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:02,595
If that call was from her boyfriend who was killed,

290
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:04,895
it would serve as a perfect alibi, wouldn't it?

291
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:08,095
That... that's true, but...

292
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,695
How come you're all here?

293
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:15,395
Because that lady said that she'd treat us to something to eat.

294
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:16,595
Something to eat?

295
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:19,395
Yes, as a reward for us telling her

296
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:22,495
that she had forgotten her wallet

297
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:25,795
on the ticket vending machine.

298
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,895
But, we were even more surprised

299
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:30,795
after her cell phone flashed light, right?

300
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:33,395
Yeah, I was really scared!

301
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:36,495
Huh? What happened?

302
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:39,695
That's probably the scene when Gomera was beat up

303
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:42,095
and its internal organs were in view.

304
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,895
That scene was really grotesque, so...

305
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:47,995
You... you mean the monster Gomera?

306
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,295
Yes.

307
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:51,395
That's the kind of movie you were watching?

308
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:54,395
I like special effects. Is there anything wrong with that?

309
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:57,495
Well, that scene was grotesque too, but...

310
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:59,895
What was really surprising was...

311
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:01,995
The scene after that when...

312
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:05,695
The scene when Gomera bit the other monster's neck,

313
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,495
shattered it!

314
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:10,395
The amount of blood that splattered was unreal.

315
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:14,195
Were you watching the same movie too, Inspector Shiratori?

316
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,195
Yes, well...

317
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,095
And? There's no mistake that

318
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:21,895
you were watching the movie from 13:00 to 15:00?

319
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:24,395
Yes. To put it accurately,

320
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,695
from 13:05...

321
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:32,995
This is... If I remember correctly,

322
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,195
this is what was attached to the cup of coke

323
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:38,295
that Ms. Sasakura bought for Inspector Shiratori.

324
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:42,095
It started from 13:05 to 14:50

325
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,995
for an hour and 45 minutes.

326
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,695
Well, just to be sure,

327
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,295
let's have Officer Takagi go confirm at the theater

328
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:56,995
whether she really didn't go outside while the movie was being shown.

329
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:59,495
Because there is a little something that is bothering me too.

330
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,695
Then, Officer Takagi, I'm counting on you.

331
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:03,495
Yes, sir!

332
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:04,795
And...

333
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:09,095
in the meantime, we would like to check inside the room.

334
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:12,395
-Is it all right? -Yes.

335
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:14,895
If you were being followed by a stalker,

336
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:17,295
there's a chance of a wiretap being set up somewhere in the room

337
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:20,095
as well as a hidden camera, isn't there?

338
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,195
Right.

339
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,095
I'm counting on you then.

340
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:44,595
Conan.

341
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:46,995
You don't have to help investigate.

342
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:50,295
Will you stay still in the corner of the room?

343
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:51,795
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:56,295
Inspector Shiratori, did you find anything?

345
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,895
No, not really.

346
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:02,295
Did you see anything in this room that you don't know about?

347
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:04,695
Not really.

348
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,995
Hey, Ayumi.

349
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,195
What're you doing from a while ago?

350
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:17,595
Flowers!

351
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:18,795
-Flowers? -Flowers?

352
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:20,095
Right!

353
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,295
First, you tear the proliferated part of the wrapper of the straw carefully

354
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:26,295
into a narrow strip.

355
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:34,595
Then you fold it one on top of the other,

356
00:20:34,595 --> 00:20:36,295
like this.

357
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:39,195
Then you put the folded paper together

358
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,595
and tear it in this shape.

359
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,295
-If you tear it? -If you tear it?

360
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:49,295
Here you go! A strip of flowers!

361
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:52,395
-Fantastic! -Very pretty!

362
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:55,295
What're they doing at the murder site?

363
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,395
And?

364
00:20:57,395 --> 00:21:02,695
So what? Is the culprit Ms. Sasakura after all?

365
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:06,695
You were shooting her that kind of look just a while ago, weren't you?

366
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:07,995
Yeah.

367
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:11,095
She said she was a fan of special effects,

368
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:14,295
but I was thinking that she didn't have any monster figurines

369
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:16,795
or books on the subject.

370
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:18,795
That's not all, is it?

371
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:21,595
The reason why you're suspecting her.

372
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:24,295
Besides, we're her witnesses.

373
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:26,095
The seats of the theater.

374
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:27,195
Seats?

375
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:28,995
Didn't you think it was strange?

376
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:31,595
Seats, if I remember correctly...

377
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:35,095
All five of us were in the middle front row seats.

378
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,295
The seats of Inspector Shiratori and Nami

379
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:40,895
were right in front of ours with the corridor in between, right?

380
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:43,095
What's strange about that?

381
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:46,695
We went to see the Sunday afternoon show.

382
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:50,595
It was naturally packed with parents and children,

383
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:52,295
but for some reason the seats on both sides of Inspector Shiratori and Nami

384
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:54,895
were empty.

385
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:56,895
Maybe it was just a coincidence?

386
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:58,495
Besides,

387
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:01,495
it also bothers me that we are witnesses who are proving her alibi

388
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:04,895
when we just happened to run into her today.

389
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:07,495
But, you saw her too, didn't you?

390
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:10,495
That she was in the theater at the time the murder was committed.

391
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,495
Yeah, I saw her.

392
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:14,795
Hat, that is.

393
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:17,495
Hey, don't tell me that...

394
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:19,695
Well, I'm pretty sure it'll be okay.

395
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:23,395
Probably, Inspector Shiratori seems to have realized that too,

396
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:27,295
and sent Officer Takagi over to the theater.

397
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:31,295
With the proof hidden in his pocket.

398
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:57,995
"Next Episode" -Personal emotions are to be left out when investigating,

399
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:01,495
right, Inspector Shiratori?

400
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:03,195
I've figured out

401
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:07,195
the reason why Inspector Shiratori hesitated.

402
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:11,595
It's a symbol of strength, kindness, coolness,

403
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:13,595
a flower of justice!

404
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:18,995
Are you talking about this flower?

405
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:20,395
Next Conan,

406
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:24,395
"Officer Shiratori Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 2)".
