1
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,833
Hey, old man!

2
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,133
-Hurry up, will you! -That's interesting, right?

3
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,233
Come on and get going!

4
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,433
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,433
What a rough guy.

6
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,033
Purse snatcher! Somebody!

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,533
Catch him!

8
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,833
He's the guy we saw a while ago.

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,133
You mean he was a purse snatcher?

10
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,533
Stop!

11
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:42,633
Move it!

12
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,833
Watch out, boy!

13
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,933
Oh, no!

14
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,733
It hurts!

15
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:02,933
Sir?

16
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,933
I would like to ask you some questions over there.

17
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,133
You too, sir...

18
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,233
Wait, please!

19
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:18,733
What?

20
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,433
This...

21
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:29,733
After a while, we were released from police interrogation

22
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:33,733
and boarded the Tohto Loop Line again.

23
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:36,133
Look. I wonder if something's wrong?

24
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,633
At Sugame Station, three stations away,

25
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,133
an incident was already taking place.

26
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,933
Brooding over passing seasons

27
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,833
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

28
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,733
The true identity of a friend of justice

29
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,533
was an elderly man who tells picture stories?

30
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,233
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,033
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,333
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:46,042
"A Friend of Justice"

34
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:53,942
He's Kanemura, a wanted criminal.

35
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,242
He's member of the fraud group, right?

36
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,342
Yes.

37
00:03:57,342 --> 00:04:00,742
By gaining the favor and trust of aged people living alone,

38
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,042
he introduces them to non-existent investment deals

39
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,442
and cheat large sums of cash from them.

40
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:09,342
Many of them committed suicide or running into bankruptcy.

41
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:10,542
Cause of death is?

42
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,342
A deadly blow on the forehead.

43
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:15,742
That's the only wound found on him.

44
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:18,842
-The culprit is really something. -What?

45
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,842
Because there seems to be no trace of any struggle.

46
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,342
Just to think that the culprit finished

47
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,242
this strong looking man in one blow.

48
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:27,342
What brings you both here?

49
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:29,542
We saw you from the train.

50
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,542
Come, Conan, we don't want to get in the way.

51
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,642
Come over here...

52
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:35,842
You're...

53
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,342
"Tokuma Norizuki (75)" -I saw you a while ago.

54
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:42,342
Do you know each other?

55
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:43,942
Yes, just a little bit.

56
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:46,742
But, what brings you here, sir?

57
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:49,642
He's an eye-witness to this crime.

58
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:54,342
-What? -Yeah, after I ran into you,

59
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:55,742
from inside the train,

60
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:59,642
I saw that man strike somebody with a stick.

61
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:02,442
So, I got off at Beika Station and went to the police box.

62
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:04,442
He's the leader of the fraud group,

63
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:06,042
Teruhiko Kiriya.

64
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,942
Could there have been a fall out?

65
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:10,142
"Teruhiko Kiriya (35)" -I've got nothing to do with this!

66
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,642
I was just taking a walk around here!

67
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:15,842
He witnessed it from inside the train?

68
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:17,442
But...

69
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,342
Sir, where's your cane?

70
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:25,142
I don't really need to use it, so I left it behind.

71
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:27,542
If I have it, everybody treats me like an elderly

72
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:32,342
and people are kind to me, so it's convenient, though.

73
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:36,042
The victim dies from one blow on the forehead.

74
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,342
This elderly man who says he witnessed it

75
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:40,642
from inside the train.

76
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:43,042
Maybe...

77
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,142
How many times do I have to tell you?

78
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:47,142
I'm not the one who did it!

79
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:50,942
Then, why were you near the scene of the crime?

80
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:53,242
I got a call.

81
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:55,742
From a guy who said he was an acquaintance of Kanemura.

82
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:57,842
I was told to come because Kanemura is waiting.

83
00:05:57,842 --> 00:06:00,942
An acquaintance of the victim? Who is it?

84
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:04,242
Beats me. I've never heard his voice before.

85
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:06,942
Your story's hard to believe.

86
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:09,442
It's true! I...

87
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,842
I've been framed!

88
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,342
"Killing Between Comrades?"

89
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,042
A picture storyteller?

90
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,542
You mean, that elderly man?

91
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:22,842
Yeah. I heard when I was at the local police investigating another case.

92
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:24,442
It seems he's picture storytelling

93
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:27,142
to well-behaved children at Sazanka Park.

94
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:28,342
I see...

95
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:31,142
Well, the case seems to be coming to a close.

96
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,042
I guess there's nothing for a renowned detective to do at this point.

97
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:37,242
I hope it goes that way.

98
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:38,842
"The police of jurisdiction" -Yeah.

99
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:42,642
I did see Mr. Mouri here yesterday.

100
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:45,842
But I didn't know he was interested in this case.

101
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:50,342
At any rate, he says to please check on what I just told you.

102
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,642
Okay, I got it.

103
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,642
I'll directly take care of the rest.

104
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:00,642
Now, earth is mine!

105
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,042
No way, King of Darkness!

106
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:05,942
That voice, don't tell me it's...

107
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,842
Friend of Justice is here!

108
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:09,942
King of Darkness!

109
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:12,742
Time to face the punishment of justice!

110
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:15,842
Ran?

111
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:20,142
Take this!

112
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:25,142
Then, black light is emitted from the King of Darkness' cane!

113
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:30,242
Watch out! Friend of Justice!

114
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,542
Move it!

115
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,542
Show me too! Move it!

116
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,642
Hey! What's with you?

117
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:38,242
Anybody who comes late line up in the back!

118
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,042
Hey! Apologize before you cry!

119
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,842
It doesn't matter if you're a child or an adult.

120
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:55,442
You need to follow the correct path of a man!

121
00:07:57,742 --> 00:07:59,842
I'm... I'm sorry.

122
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:01,042
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,542
Okay, good boy.

124
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,842
Everybody, is it okay for him to watch the show with you?

125
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:08,542
Okay!

126
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:11,042
Then, let him be in the middle.

127
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,342
Thank you!

128
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,342
-Bye bye. -Bye bye.

129
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:16,942
-Thank you! -See you!

130
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,242
Take care of yourself!

131
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:22,242
It doesn't matter if you're a child or an adult.

132
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:24,042
You scold them when you must.

133
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:28,942
But you need to have the kindness to forgive them too, don't you?

134
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,042
It's you, miss.

135
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,342
I forgot to thank you

136
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:35,942
despite you helping us when we were in danger yesterday.

137
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,642
Thank you very much.

138
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,842
I also didn't get to give this to you either.

139
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:42,542
Thank you!

140
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,242
Is Mitsu, your wife?

141
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:47,842
There was a time when I used to dream she was.

142
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:51,542
She passed away just the other day, because of an illness.

143
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:54,642
I'm sorry! I had no idea.

144
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:57,742
No... Did you come just to bring this to me?

145
00:08:57,742 --> 00:09:00,142
No. I was just wondering why you left

146
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:03,742
without giving your name despite having caught a purse snatcher.

147
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:07,442
I didn't think that I needed to give my name

148
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,542
for just doing something like that.

149
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:13,842
But, you came up during the incident that happened later, right?

150
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:15,442
Why?

151
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:16,742
Conan!

152
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:18,742
Because it was a murder.

153
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:22,442
I just couldn't pretend not seeing what I did, son.

154
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:25,242
Then, why didn't you report it right away?

155
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:27,242
Why did you get off at Beika Station?

156
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:29,142
I don't have a cell phone,

157
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:32,142
and besides the station master was nowhere nearby.

158
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:35,242
You didn't get off part way, did you?

159
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,642
Yeah...

160
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,942
It didn't even cross my mind to.

161
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:41,842
Are you satisfied, son?

162
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:44,442
I'll be on my way then.

163
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,642
Thank you, miss.

164
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:55,942
Conan!

165
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,642
Good timing.

166
00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:01,042
I found out about what Mr. Mouri wanted to check on.

167
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:03,442
About the victims of that fraud group,

168
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:07,742
some of them were friends of Mr. Norizuki.

169
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:08,742
-What? -What?

170
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,442
And, he seems to have 5-dan in kendo.

171
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:13,942
Please wait.

172
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:16,942
Does dad suspect that old man?

173
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:19,842
No. I wonder about that.

174
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:22,142
The culprit's been arrested already, right?

175
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:25,742
Yes but he's still denying that he did it.

176
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:28,042
I'll talk to dad!

177
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,842
Ran!

178
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:34,142
No! I've got to hurry and find out the truth.

179
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:39,242
Hey, there's one more thing Pops wants you to check on.

180
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:40,342
Again?

181
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,542
The scene of the crime is in between

182
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:48,542
this Natsuhabara Station and Beika Station.

183
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,442
It's near Sugame Station.

184
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,342
The surveillance camera?

185
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,742
Maybe I'll have Officer Takagi check on that too.

186
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:08,442
"Sugame Station"

187
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:16,542
This... This is?

188
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:28,242
Not there yet!

189
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:29,842
I see!

190
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,942
So, that's the story!

191
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:32,942
"The Mouri Detective Agency"

192
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,642
Come on, Dad, get up!

193
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:38,342
Wasn't the case coming to a close?

194
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:40,942
Why are you suspecting that old man?

195
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,642
I have no doubt!

196
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:44,842
What? Then, why...

197
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:48,142
I have no doubt that this beer is delicious.

198
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:51,742
Goodness!

199
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:54,642
I'm sure that the heaven's punished him!

200
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:58,442
"Witness A" -He brought a lot of suffering to many elderly people!

201
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:01,542
It was just mere punishment from the Friend of Justice!

202
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,142
Sir?

203
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:04,542
That's it for now.

204
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,542
Let's take it back to the studio.

205
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,942
No way...

206
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:10,642
Really?

207
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:17,055
"The police of jurisdiction" -Conan?

208
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:20,894
No, about that... It's probably going to take a while longer.

209
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,594
But, good timing.

210
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:25,394
We've just discovered a new fact,

211
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:27,694
so could you tell Mr. Mouri about it?

212
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:29,294
A new fact?

213
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:38,794
"Norizuki"

214
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:40,594
Excuse me.

215
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:49,794
Sir? Are you in?

216
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:51,394
Sir?

217
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:56,394
A diary?

218
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:59,994
What? There was another man who was a member of the fraud group?

219
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:03,894
Right. Takashi Motegi, 25 years old.

220
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:07,294
It seems that he cheated a large sum of money from a woman

221
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:10,394
who Mr. Norizuki was very close with.

222
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,594
We're trying to find out his whereabouts right now

223
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:14,294
but can't seem to find him.

224
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,594
Officer Takagi.

225
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,694
Can you give me the old man's address?

226
00:13:25,894 --> 00:13:26,994
Ran?

227
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:42,894
"Takashi Motegi (25)"

228
00:13:57,894 --> 00:13:59,994
Don't!

229
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:02,194
Stop already!

230
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:05,394
-Sir! -Miss...

231
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:12,594
I just couldn't believe what was going on.

232
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:16,994
So, I went to your house wanting to talk to you directly.

233
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:20,394
I'm sorry, I took the liberty to read it.

234
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:23,294
This is Mitsu's diary, isn't it?

235
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:26,594
And, I found what you wrote in it too, sir.

236
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:30,494
What the heck is this?

237
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,294
You're Takashi Motegi, aren't you?

238
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,494
Police!

239
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:34,794
We're taking protective custody of you.

240
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:35,994
What?

241
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:38,894
Police? Protective custody?

242
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:43,694
Since that elderly man over there is going after your life.

243
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:46,494
-Dad? -What?

244
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:50,094
That's right, isn't it, Inspector?

245
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:54,094
I heard you told Takagi to put him into protective custody.

246
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,094
What?

247
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,194
I don't remember saying something like that to Takagi...

248
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:07,894
Mr. Norizuki.

249
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:11,494
You can't deceive the eyes of this famed detective Kogoro Mouri.

250
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,594
You're the one who killed Mr. Kanemura yesterday, right?

251
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,294
Kogoro Mouri?

252
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:19,194
Just what do you think you're saying?

253
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:22,094
I'm the witness to that crime, you know?

254
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:26,194
I had my doubts about that from the beginning.

255
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:31,094
You said that you witnessed the crime from the train, however...

256
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,994
That overpass is a straight line,

257
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:36,794
so it's impossible to see the scene of the crime right below it!

258
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:39,994
Certainly.

259
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:42,494
-Takagi! -Yes, sir!

260
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:44,194
You mean this, right?

261
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,994
I had the contents of this IC ticket that I borrowed,

262
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:51,594
checked by the data management center of the Tohto Loop Line.

263
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:54,294
I had no reason to refuse lending it to you.

264
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,994
And, did you find anything?

265
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:59,494
Before and after the time of the crime yesterday,

266
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:03,294
entry to Natsuhabara Station was made at 1:35 pm.

267
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:04,694
Then, the record shows that at 2:15 pm,

268
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:08,094
this ticket was used to exit Beika Station.

269
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:11,094
It figures. Exactly.

270
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:14,394
-No, that's the strange part. -What?

271
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:16,694
There's nothing wrong about the entry.

272
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:19,794
The problem is the exit time.

273
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:21,694
Conan and Ran got off at Hatabata Station

274
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,694
because of the purse snatcher racket.

275
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:25,994
But you didn't get off.

276
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:31,194
Takagi, what time does that train arrive at Beika Station?

277
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:32,894
At 2:00 pm.

278
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:34,294
That's strange.

279
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,394
It's 15 minutes earlier than the record indicates.

280
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,194
Which means...

281
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:43,794
Right, he got off at Sugame Station and carried out his scheme!

282
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,794
Then he got on the next train.

283
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:49,494
So, that makes for the lost 15 minutes!

284
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:51,694
That's a very interesting story.

285
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:55,794
But if it's true, there should be a record of it, right?

286
00:16:55,794 --> 00:17:00,494
No, there is no record of entry or exit at Sugame Station.

287
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:03,294
Then, why the 15 minutes discrepancy?

288
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:04,994
I'm embarrassed to say,

289
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:07,694
that being my age, I have to frequent the men's room.

290
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,594
So, I got off at Beika Station and ran to the men's room.

291
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:13,694
Therefore, it took me a while to exit Beika Station.

292
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:15,694
That's the truth.

293
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:19,594
The truth can be viewed on the camera of the station.

294
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,694
Are you talking about the surveillance camera?

295
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:24,494
I thought Sugame Station was under renovation

296
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:26,594
and there was no camera there.

297
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:28,794
So, you knew about it after all.

298
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:33,294
Isn't that the reason you decided to commit the crime there?

299
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:34,694
Another reason is that

300
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:36,994
there are many aged passengers that use that station,

301
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:39,594
so you wouldn't look that conspicuous there.

302
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:42,194
In other words, you called the victim out beforehand

303
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,894
to come under the overpass near Sugame Station

304
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:49,094
and got off the train without being taken by the camera.

305
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,894
You then attacked Kanemura.

306
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:53,394
And, boarded the train once more.

307
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,694
Then, you called Kiriya out to a place near the area,

308
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:58,294
so that he wouldn't have an alibi.

309
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:02,294
Then, how could I have got on and off the train

310
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:05,294
at Sugame Station without being recorded?

311
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,994
I had Officer Takagi check the images on the surveillance camera

312
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,794
of Natsuhabara Station.

313
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:13,094
The camera at Natsuhabara Station?

314
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:18,894
There was an image of Mr. Norizuki acting strange on the camera.

315
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:23,394
Back then, you entered the wicket with your IC pass,

316
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,494
but you backed out once and re-entered.

317
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:28,594
Why did you re-insert your pass?

318
00:18:28,594 --> 00:18:33,994
I wasn't sure if I used the IC ticket correctly.

319
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:36,394
As you know, aged people aren't good with machines.

320
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:40,594
Isn't that exactly what you would like us to think?

321
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:42,194
Just what're you talking about?

322
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:45,594
Back then, along with your IC pass,

323
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:47,694
you had a ticket on you too!

324
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,794
A ticket?

325
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:55,194
He first scanned the IC ticket on the wicket machine,

326
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:57,494
and pretended to do it once more,

327
00:18:57,494 --> 00:18:59,894
then he inserted the ticket

328
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:03,394
that he had hidden behind his IC pass.

329
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:06,794
When pushed by the purse snatcher, his hand touched the wicket.

330
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:10,094
He then retrieved the ticket that came out of the machine.

331
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:11,694
Then, he boarded the train,

332
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:14,894
and got off at Sugame Station to commit the crime!

333
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,694
Then he buys a ticket again and boards the train again.

334
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:19,194
At Beika Station,

335
00:19:19,194 --> 00:19:23,794
he used the IC pass that he used at Natsuhabara Station and got off.

336
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:25,994
The ticket that you bought at Natsuhabara Station

337
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:29,494
was collected at Sugame Station, where you got off part way.

338
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:33,194
Your fingerprints should still be left on it.

339
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:38,794
You're really something, Mr. Detective.

340
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:41,494
But, I haven't done anything wrong.

341
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,094
He got what he asked for!

342
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:44,894
Punishment from justice!

343
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:46,194
No way!

344
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:49,194
Ran?

345
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,494
You scold when you have to scold,

346
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:02,094
but you had the kindness to forgive, sir.

347
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:04,894
Then, why?

348
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:06,494
Despite it all,

349
00:20:06,494 --> 00:20:10,194
there are things that can't be forgiven.

350
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:11,594
Is it because Mitsu

351
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:14,594
passed away from the shock of being swindled?

352
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:17,594
Right. Exactly!

353
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:20,194
I found out that she'd been cheated

354
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:22,394
for the first time when I read her diary.

355
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:24,094
I couldn't forgive them!

356
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:29,294
So I took it upon myself to punish them for the sake of justice!

357
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,394
I understand how you feel.

358
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,894
But, it's not right!

359
00:20:34,894 --> 00:20:37,894
If you read Mitsu's last words,

360
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:40,494
I'm sure you'd have realized!

361
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:42,594
Last words?

362
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,294
This is...

363
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:52,994
Mr. Friend of Justice taught me how to forgive people.

364
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:57,994
That' why I will forgive the man who deceived me.

365
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:00,294
He was really nice to me,

366
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:03,894
who was living alone.

367
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:05,794
The smiles back then...

368
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:10,694
I can't believe that they were all untrue.

369
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:14,194
So, I'm going to believe that he will change his ways someday.

370
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:17,594
I can't bear to die holding a grudge against someone.

371
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:21,294
Thank you, Mr. Friend of Justice.

372
00:21:21,294 --> 00:21:23,494
I didn't know.

373
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:27,194
I was so enraged when I found out about Motegi and his gang.

374
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:30,694
I was completely blinded by hate!

375
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:32,994
Such a Friend of Justice, I am.

376
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:36,594
My eyes were clouded by the hate inside of me.

377
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:40,594
So I failed to realize how Mitsu really felt!

378
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:47,994
You mean, she forgave me?

379
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:49,794
And believed me?

380
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:56,994
Just as Ran said, no matter what the reason,

381
00:21:56,994 --> 00:21:59,494
there are things that shouldn't be done.

382
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:01,994
Not as a friend of justice...

383
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:04,794
Yes, as humans.

384
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:28,194
"Total confession" -Motegi confessed everything.

385
00:23:28,194 --> 00:23:30,094
"Fraud group demolished" -Kiriya as a suspect of fraud

386
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:31,894
was arrested once again.

387
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:37,594
Please step back once and touch the scanner again.

388
00:23:37,594 --> 00:23:39,394
What's the matter, dad?

389
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:41,494
I'll bet it's broken.

390
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:45,094
That's why "I see" nothing in ICs!

391
00:23:45,094 --> 00:23:49,194
Hey, isn't that a rental video card?

392
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,094
What?

393
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:53,394
You're right.

394
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:56,694
Maybe you're the one who can't see most, Pops?

395
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:00,394
Mika Tatezato.

396
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:04,994
I mean, is that person trying to meet with you, dad,

397
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:07,294
while that person is still on the run as a murderer?

398
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:09,894
What? What's that noise?

399
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:19,894
Then... Then, this case has something to do

400
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:22,794
with the water sprite after all?

401
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,294
Next Conan,

402
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:28,294
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 1)"

403
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:46,494
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:46,494 --> 00:24:48,394
"Shoes"

405
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:49,994
Pops, you've got a job request from a water sprite.

406
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:51,994
A snatcher? Understood!

407
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,394
It's drunkard.
