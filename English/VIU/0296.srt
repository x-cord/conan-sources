1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:02,737
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:04,537
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,237
Fishing, fireworks, and a house boat.

4
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:07,238
An accident or a case

5
00:00:07,238 --> 00:00:08,238
depending on the skill of deduction.

6
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:09,737
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:11,737
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:13,838
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:07,772
"Sayori Unabara (22), in charge of cooking and customer relation."

10
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:14,872
"Fukuo Unabara (50), Captain of 'Unabara Maru'."

11
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,372
"Kazuyuki Kawai (65), President of a building company."

12
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:29,771
Oh! There it is!

13
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:32,372
Unabara Maru. That's the one! That's it!

14
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:38,172
Welcome! The entrance is this way.

15
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:45,171
Well, Mr. Kawai, thank you for inviting us over tonight.

16
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:46,571
Same here.

17
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:49,771
You've been so much help to me in so many ways that it's no big deal.

18
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:53,171
Getting to watch the fireworks on a houseboat is so fantastic!

19
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:57,071
It sure is rare that they're having fireworks at this time of season.

20
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:58,271
Hey, come on, Conan!

21
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:01,071
Hi there, sorry to keep you all waiting!

22
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:03,971
I had a big transaction to take care of.

23
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,271
Mr. Yamazaki,

24
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:07,471
I'm sorry that I suddenly asked you to come

25
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:09,771
despite your busy schedule.

26
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,371
I've got your fishing equipment ready too.

27
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,471
"Tsuneo Yamazaki (60), President of a finance company."

28
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:15,471
All you can eat, all you can drink,

29
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:17,071
and watching fireworks too.

30
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,071
To top things off I also get to go fishing.

31
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:21,071
I couldn't possibly refuse.

32
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:24,671
Captain, please sail the ship out because we're all here.

33
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,872
Yes, sir!

34
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:39,948
"Houseboat Fishing Shock."

35
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:44,242
This ship is so spacious,

36
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,042
and yet we're the only ones on board?

37
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:50,342
The fact is, I reserved this boat for our company's pleasure trip,

38
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:53,142
but urgent work came in...

39
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:55,942
I couldn't cancel the trip at this point, so...

40
00:03:55,943 --> 00:04:00,542
I asked Mr. Yamazaki and Mr. Mouri, whom I'm always being helped by

41
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:02,843
to come along.

42
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:07,542
Thank you for waiting!

43
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:09,242
Oh! Here's the food!

44
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:10,842
Finally, at last!

45
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:15,743
Go ahead everybody, help yourself to your heart's content!

46
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:31,543
Here, Mr. Kawai, have some too.

47
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:45,042
How do you like this fishing pole?

48
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:48,142
Oh, so that's the carbon type new model fishing pole

49
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,842
that is your pride and joy?

50
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:53,042
It's light as well as steady

51
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,742
so even a big catch is no big deal.

52
00:04:56,743 --> 00:05:00,442
Please use this tonight.

53
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:02,542
And? What about you, Mr. Kawai?

54
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:04,142
No need for worry.

55
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:07,542
I brought one of the same type with me.

56
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:09,343
Oh...

57
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,843
Would you like to come along with us too, Mr. Mouri?

58
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:16,842
Fishing, would you like to go fishing?

59
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:21,142
But, I don't have a pole for Mr. Mouri.

60
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:23,842
You may use the one we have here, if it's okay with you.

61
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:27,042
We have several fishing poles here just in case, for our customers.

62
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,842
You're really service minded, how thoughtful.

63
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:33,842
Mr. Mouri, are you interested in fishing?

64
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:36,042
Fishing...

65
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,842
No thanks.

66
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:41,043
I guess beer is better for me!

67
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:50,042
Hello, we're almost there!

68
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:51,542
The scenic point for watching fireworks

69
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:53,943
is also a great spot for fishing!

70
00:05:56,943 --> 00:06:01,443
Just the other day, a super large sea bream was caught here.

71
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:04,542
The tides are good today

72
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,142
so I'm sure you'll get a good catch.

73
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:10,143
It makes me so excited!

74
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:18,442
I wish you both the best of luck.

75
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:22,442
Yeah, I'll get a big one for sure!

76
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:25,143
The same here.

77
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,742
Wow!

78
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,342
It's so pretty.

79
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:37,542
Tamaya!

80
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:39,142
Are you enjoying yourselves?

81
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:43,842
Yes, watching fireworks in autumn is quite fascinating too.

82
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:45,042
Here, have some more.

83
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,043
Oh, thank you.

84
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,942
Sayori, will you please bring us more beer?

85
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:53,042
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:54,642
Bring some for Mr. Kawai and his guest too.

87
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:55,943
Yes, sir.

88
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,742
What was that?

89
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:37,143
What seems to be the matter?

90
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:39,343
That...

91
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:54,542
Mr. Kawai, please get a hold of yourself! Mr. Kawai!

92
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:57,343
Where's Mr. Yamazaki?

93
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,842
Are you okay, mister?

94
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:01,542
Don't touch!

95
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:02,943
Stay out of the way!

96
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,942
No good, he's already dead.

97
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:13,143
He's got burns on the palm of his hand.

98
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:15,843
This is...

99
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:21,342
The lights on the ship went out a while ago.

100
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:22,343
Yeah.

101
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:29,443
He said this fishing pole is made of carbon.

102
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:34,442
Just as I thought!

103
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:37,642
This part of the electrical lighting is exposed!

104
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,042
Which means...

105
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:40,142
Right.

106
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,842
Mr. Yamazaki was holding a carbon type fishing pole

107
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:46,142
that conducts electricity.

108
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:52,042
His feet is soaked with the seawater that was in the bucket.

109
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:57,142
Mr. Yamazaki's fishing pole probably accidentally touched

110
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:59,342
the part of the electrical wiring that was exposed

111
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:00,842
while he was fishing.

112
00:09:00,843 --> 00:09:03,442
Therefore, he was electrocuted.

113
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,642
That accounts for the burn on the palm of his hand.

114
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:12,142
Mr. Kawai probably collapsed when he tried to help Mr. Yamazaki.

115
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:15,742
Please call the ambulance and the police, Sayori.

116
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:17,042
Yes, sir!

117
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:19,942
Captain, please take the boat back to the harbour.

118
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:21,243
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,442
And, what is the cause of his death?

120
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:39,242
We can't really say until the coroner finishes the autopsy, but...

121
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:41,542
According to the paramedics,

122
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:47,342
the victim's heart seems to have stopped instantaneously

123
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:52,342
due to intense electrical shock.

124
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,243
Just as I thought.

125
00:09:55,343 --> 00:10:00,943
But why did Mr. Yamazaki's fishing pole touch the electrical wiring?

126
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:04,842
There were practically no waves today and it was quiet,

127
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:07,342
so the boat didn't sway as much either, did it?

128
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,842
That's true.

129
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,542
Mr. Kawai, can you tell us what happened?

130
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:13,642
Yes.

131
00:10:13,643 --> 00:10:18,543
Well, the thing is... I happened to get a big bite on my pole.

132
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:24,742
It was so big that I couldn't handle it alone, so...

133
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:27,443
I asked Mr. Yamazaki to help me.

134
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:32,943
We were pulling the pole together when suddenly...

135
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:36,642
The line cut

136
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:40,542
and we fell backwards holding the fishing pole.

137
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:44,443
Then, everything went black...

138
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:49,342
It's as if I had murdered Mr. Yamazaki.

139
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:52,842
If only I didn't ask Mr. Yamazaki to help me,

140
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:55,142
this wouldn't have happened!

141
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:57,642
Please calm down.

142
00:10:57,643 --> 00:11:00,142
It was an accident.

143
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,442
It's not your fault, Mr. Kawai.

144
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:07,842
About Mr. Kawai's testimony just now, when this case took place...

145
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:10,742
-Accident! -Oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:17,043
The captain of a boat that was sailing nearby also witnessed the scene.

147
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,242
Yes, I saw it.

148
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:23,942
It looked as if they were both trying to pull up a fish.

149
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:26,842
I think it was just when they were about to pull the fish up.

150
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,842
It seems the fishing line was so close to the rim of the boat

151
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:31,742
that it was virtually rubbing against it.

152
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:36,343
Then, the fishing line suddenly broke off and they both fell.

153
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:40,542
We sailed pass them right after that,

154
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:43,843
so I don't know what happened later.

155
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:46,742
This was what he saw.

156
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:49,542
See! So, it was an accident after all.

157
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,043
You even got a witness.

158
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:57,142
But both of them got electrocuted,

159
00:11:57,143 --> 00:12:00,242
and why was only Mr. Kawai okay?

160
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:03,342
Mr. Yamazaki had a weak heart to begin with

161
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:06,442
so he was going to the hospital on a regular basis.

162
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:09,142
Come to think of it, he was also taking medication.

163
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:13,143
I was just lucky.

164
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:17,042
By the way, Mr. Unabara,

165
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:20,242
was that electric wiring always exposed like that?

166
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:23,942
I always check the entire boat before sailing off,

167
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,542
but I didn't notice any abnormalities at that time.

168
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:30,243
I also checked, so there's no mistake about it.

169
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:33,342
A part of the vinyl covering of the electrical wiring

170
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:36,042
was probably deteriorated

171
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:38,142
and when the fishing pole touched it,

172
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:40,943
it completely peeled off.

173
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:45,042
So it was an accident after all.

174
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,142
But, if so,

175
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:49,542
the responsibility of this accident will fall upon.

176
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:52,742
Captain Unabara, who left the electrical wiring

177
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:55,442
in such a dangerous condition.

178
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:56,743
Oh, no!

179
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,742
Oh, I'm sorry.

180
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:03,243
I was just mentioning a possibility.

181
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:11,442
I'm sorry. Will you all please explain things in a little more detail?

182
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:12,842
Of course.

183
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:14,842
-Sure. -Thank you.

184
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,743
Shall we start then?

185
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:36,143
This is...

186
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:03,942
What's this?

187
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,443
The vinyl is melted as if it's been burnt.

188
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:11,743
Strange...

189
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:15,342
Drops of the melted vinyl should be somewhere.

190
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:18,542
Yet, there's none...

191
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:19,842
I get it.

192
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,742
That's why he...

193
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:23,342
I've figured it out.

194
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:26,342
This is not an accident...

195
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,343
but homicide!

196
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:37,621
All right then, Mr. Unabara, Mr. Kawai.

197
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:41,221
I'd like to submit a formal report of the accident,

198
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:42,421
so although I know it's inconvenient for you,

199
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:44,421
please come with me to the station.

200
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:45,821
Yes, sir.

201
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:50,621
As to the rest of you here, you may go for tonight.

202
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:53,521
Conan's not here.

203
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:56,521
I tell you, going here, there and everywhere all the time.

204
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:59,121
I'm here.

205
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:01,221
Just what were you doing?

206
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:02,321
We're going home.

207
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:05,722
Wait, I got to go to the restroom.

208
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,022
Oh boy...

209
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:20,422
Please wait, everyone!

210
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,821
This is no accident that happened coincidentally.

211
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:30,721
But, Mr. Mouri, you just mentioned a while ago that it was an accident.

212
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,821
Yes, but there is something that's bothering me.

213
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:38,121
Mr. Unabara, can you show everyone

214
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:40,721
the tip of the fish line that is cut, that Mr. Kawai was using?

215
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:41,722
Yes.

216
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:47,221
Mr. Unabara, what do you think, seeing that cut line?

217
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:49,521
What do I think?

218
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:53,821
Huh? Strange, this doesn't look to have been pulled apart.

219
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:56,721
It looks as if it's been cut by a knife or something.

220
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,421
Really?

221
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,821
-Officer. -Yes?

222
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:04,221
Please check the brim of the left shipboard.

223
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:07,721
The blade of a cutter knife is embedded.

224
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:12,521
And, a fish hook is hooked on the body of the ship underneath it.

225
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,721
Okay.

226
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,322
I'll go along too.

227
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:25,322
There it is! It's the blade of a cutter!

228
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:28,221
Officer!

229
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,821
See, over there!

230
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,122
A fish line.

231
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:36,521
Mr. Mouri! It's exactly as you said.

232
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:39,221
The blade of the cutter and fish hook are still here.

233
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:43,921
When I cleaned the ship before departing, they weren't there.

234
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:46,321
Sure they weren't,

235
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:49,521
because Mr. Kawai set it up after sailing out to the sea,

236
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:52,922
in order to kill Mr. Yamazaki.

237
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:56,321
What a thing to say, Mr. Mouri?

238
00:16:56,322 --> 00:17:00,622
When just Mr. Yamazaki and you were the only ones on deck,

239
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:03,621
you embedded the blade of the cutter into the brim of the ship,

240
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,921
when Mr. Yamazaki's eyes weren't on you.

241
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:09,821
As well as, hook your fish hook onto the body of the ship.

242
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:12,221
Then, you pretended to have caught a big one,

243
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:15,221
and urged Mr. Yamazaki to help you.

244
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:18,121
When Mr. Yamazaki grabs your fishing pole,

245
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:20,922
the blade inserted in the brim of the ship cuts the line.

246
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:25,421
Finally, you pushed Mr. Yamazaki down

247
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:28,121
so that the fishing pole would touch the electrical wiring.

248
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:30,821
Don't be ridiculous!

249
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:33,321
I was electrocuted too, you know!

250
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:37,221
I was almost killed myself too!

251
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,021
Yes,

252
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:44,521
if you were bare-handed and bare-footed like Mr. Yamazaki.

253
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,021
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

254
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:52,021
Mr. Kawai, will you show me what's in your pocket?

255
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:54,121
I really don't have anything inside.

256
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:56,621
Mr. Kawai, will you please show us what's inside?

257
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:58,021
What is it?

258
00:17:58,022 --> 00:17:59,321
I...

259
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,222
Please!

260
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:05,222
Mr. Kawai...

261
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,521
A flesh coloured rubber glove?

262
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,221
Mr. Kawai.

263
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:16,521
That's a pretty odd glove to be using for fishing, isn't it?

264
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:19,921
It's up to me what kind of a glove I want to use, isn't it?

265
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:24,121
Besides, this just so happened to be in my pocket.

266
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:27,621
I was bare-handed when that accident occurred.

267
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:33,121
Or is it that somebody saw me wearing gloves?

268
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:35,321
The same goes for the blade of the cutter.

269
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,421
I'll bet you don't have proof that I did it!!

270
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:41,921
It was just a mere coincidental accident that Yamazaki died!

271
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:45,621
No, it wasn't an accident.

272
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:48,821
I'm sure you had an intention to kill him!

273
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,421
What?

274
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,921
Think about it.

275
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:57,121
When you pull a fish line that almost rubs against the brim of the ship,

276
00:18:57,122 --> 00:19:01,521
you'd have to pull it vertically against the brim.

277
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,921
If the fish line was suddenly cut,

278
00:19:03,922 --> 00:19:07,621
they would've fallen perpendicular to the brim of the ship.

279
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:11,121
But in order for the fishing pole to touch the electrical wiring,

280
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:14,721
they would have to fall horizontally to the brim of the ship.

281
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:17,921
In other words, the moment the fish line was cut,

282
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:22,722
you pushed Mr. Yamazaki horizontally against the brim of the ship.

283
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:25,521
You did so to make the fishing pole

284
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:28,821
touch the exposed electrical wiring

285
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:30,621
with the intention to kill him.

286
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:32,321
Don't be ridiculous!

287
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:35,321
You're only letting your imagination run wild!

288
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:39,921
How can you be so sure that I pushed Mr. Yamazaki down?

289
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:41,921
How rude can you get?

290
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:45,921
Please present more undeniable evidence!

291
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:48,222
I have evidence.

292
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:53,422
Will somebody light Mr. Kawai's lighter?

293
00:19:57,522 --> 00:20:00,021
No good. It doesn't work.

294
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:01,221
Mr. Kawai,

295
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:05,422
you lit your cigarette with that lighter before we departed, didn't you?

296
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:14,621
Why won't it light now?

297
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:17,221
There seems to be

298
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:20,421
what looks to be the burnt remains on the wick of the lighter.

299
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:26,421
That adhered when he burnt the coating of the electrical wiring.

300
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:30,621
Mr. Kawai used the lighter to melt the coating of the electrical wiring

301
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:34,021
in order to expose the electrical wiring on the inside.

302
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:36,321
He then, probably wore the robber boots

303
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,121
that were lying around on the floor of the deck,

304
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:40,321
and after wearing the flesh coloured rubber gloves on his hands

305
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,122
and insulating himself...

306
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:47,322
He electrocuted Mr. Yamazki and killed him.

307
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:51,421
He then removed the boots,

308
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:54,221
lying down,

309
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:56,421
and hid the rubber gloves in his pocket,

310
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,621
and pretended to be passed out.

311
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:04,322
How about it, Mr. Kawai, am I wrong somewhere?

312
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,321
Yamazaki...

313
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,521
Yamazaki tried to take over my company

314
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:19,321
by lending money at an unreasonably high amount of interest.

315
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:23,521
Not only that. As collateral for the money he lent me,

316
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:26,421
he insisted that I get myself an expensive life insurance policy

317
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:29,822
with him as the beneficiary.

318
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:37,021
If I didn't kill him, he would've killed me one day anyway.

319
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:38,622
Someday...

320
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,021
Mr. Mouri.

321
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:15,521
Thank you so much the other day.

322
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:18,621
If that incident was closed as an accidental case,

323
00:23:18,622 --> 00:23:20,721
I would've had to take responsibility for negligence of duty

324
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:23,421
and close down my business.

325
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:26,321
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Mouri.

326
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,321
If the investigation was carried out only on the surface,

327
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:30,421
the case couldn't have been genuinely solved at all.

328
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:33,921
Just as expected of the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

329
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:39,322
Absolutely! There is no case that I cannot solve!

330
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:45,121
Come on, Dad. You were probably just in good shape.

331
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:46,921
Yeah, as for being in good shape,

332
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:49,322
you're sure doing just as good as those fireworks up there.

333
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:57,722
Tamaya!

334
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:03,321
Eri is to blame for taking on a case like this.

335
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:06,221
The defendant has a motive for killing the victim,

336
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:09,021
and moreover, his fingerprints were detected super clearly

337
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,421
on the dial of the safe.

338
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:13,921
How the heck does she expect to defend somebody like that?

339
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:16,121
Just as I thought!

340
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:21,521
I can't see Pops from here at all because the partition is in the way!

341
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:22,822
What?

342
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:24,621
Next Conan,

343
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:28,922
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 1)"
