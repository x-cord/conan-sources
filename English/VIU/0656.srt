1
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:12,294
This pot is my pride and joy!

2
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:16,094
Will some appraise it for me?

3
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:18,694
So, he's Doctor Agasa.

4
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,094
If all cases were men,

5
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:04,994
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

6
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,594
Doc's house is the target?

7
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:08,294
Ayumi's disappearance and shadows of the Organization.

8
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:09,894
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,794
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:14,494
His name is Detective Conan.

11
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:43,993
"Doc's Video Site (Part 1)"

12
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:50,093
The curry looks delicious!

13
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,993
Yep. With this much,

14
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:54,793
it won't matter how many helpings Genta comes back for.

15
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:56,593
True.

16
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,793
All we have left to do now is to put the lid on

17
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,493
and keep it simmering for a while.

18
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:03,793
Let's see, I guess I'll try tasting it before that.

19
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:05,493
Ouch.

20
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:09,493
Nobody that brings rice on his plate is going to get to taste this.

21
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:10,893
Stingy...

22
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:13,193
Wait just a little while more, okay, Doc?

23
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,893
I guess I have no choice.

24
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:17,993
By the way, did you figure it out, Conan,

25
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:20,093
the value of that pot?

26
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:23,593
No. I only know that it seems to be really old,

27
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:24,793
but I haven't figured out what era it's from

28
00:03:24,793 --> 00:03:27,093
or who made it yet.

29
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:30,293
Well, I'll find out by the time Genta

30
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,593
and Mitsuhiko get back.

31
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:34,393
"We're having curry today"

32
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:36,393
"Curry from afternoon"

33
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:39,293
"We'll have curry in the evening too while we're at it"

34
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:40,793
Genta.

35
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,893
-Huh? -I know it's Doc's wallet,

36
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:45,793
but don't you think you bought too much?

37
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,393
All he asked us to get were drinks.

38
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,393
Who cares! It's good to have a lot of Yaiba chocolates

39
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:52,593
and Yaiba snacks, right?

40
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:55,693
Conan asked me to get him a soccer magazine too, besides.

41
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,193
I bought yogurt, your favorite for you too, Mitsuhiko.

42
00:03:58,193 --> 00:03:59,393
Thank you.

43
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:01,093
Oh, it's you guys!

44
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:03,693
Are you acquainted

45
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,993
with Doctor Agasa who lives here?

46
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:07,793
Yes.

47
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:10,893
You were with Ran the other day.

48
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:13,393
So, you're a girl after all.

49
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:16,393
Yeah. My name's Masumi Sera.

50
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,693
But, you don't have boobs, so it's kind of...

51
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,693
True.

52
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:25,493
They're supposed to be popping out anytime soon.

53
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:29,793
That's right, thank you last time.

54
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:34,493
You two helped during that hole up case, right?

55
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:37,293
I was one of the hostages too, you see.

56
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:38,593
Is that right?

57
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:40,593
Well, it's thanks to us, Youth Detective Squad

58
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:42,893
investigating and all I guess!

59
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:45,793
And Shinichi Kudo too!

60
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:49,993
Yeah. Doc said, that a high school detective

61
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,093
that happened to be his acquaintance

62
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:54,193
coincidentally came along and solved the case!

63
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:59,193
But we were told by Haibara to keep this a secret.

64
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:00,693
Haibara?

65
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:03,693
Are you talking about the quiet looking girl

66
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:06,193
with short hair that's living with Doc?

67
00:05:06,193 --> 00:05:08,493
Yeah... She's not that quiet, though.

68
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:10,193
Have you ever met her?

69
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:12,493
No. I just got a glimpse of her

70
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:16,293
on the video website together with Doc.

71
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:18,293
He was boasting that when he cleaned out his storeroom,

72
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:21,493
he found an expensive looking pot!

73
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,893
He wants somebody to appraise it.

74
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:28,393
But, why do you have to keep the thing about Kudo a secret?

75
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:31,293
The house next door is his house, isn't it?

76
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:32,393
Beats me.

77
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:34,393
That house is always vacant,

78
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:36,993
but that day it seems he went back to pick up something he forgot,

79
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:39,593
and while he was at it, he stopped over at Doc's place.

80
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:42,293
Maybe somebody's still there?

81
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,593
I saw the curtains flutter just a while ago.

82
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:45,993
Oh, that's probably...

83
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:47,593
Subaru!

84
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:49,193
Subaru?

85
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:51,193
His apartment was burned in a fire,

86
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:53,593
so it seems he's living there now.

87
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:58,693
I thought that somebody was living there without permission.

88
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:01,293
But, I guess I was just worrying for nothing.

89
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,393
It smells good!

90
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:15,093
Can we start eating already?

91
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:17,793
-Not yet. -Wait about another half an hour.

92
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:20,893
What? You mean we have to wait 30 more minutes?

93
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:23,393
Is it really going to take that long.

94
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:27,993
But, there's a little that we can taste before, the whole works.

95
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:30,893
Hors d'oeuvre? You mean appetizer?

96
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:33,093
Right, right! So, we get to eat curry

97
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,293
as an hors d'oeuvre and also a big serving as the main dish?

98
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:37,993
No way!

99
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:40,893
Genta, you and Doc are too gluttonous!

100
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:46,193
I can't stand it anymore, unless I keep myself busy!

101
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:49,393
What're you doing, Conan?

102
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:53,593
I'm checking the pot that Doc got out of the store room,

103
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:56,993
but I think it's best to have it appraised by an appraiser.

104
00:06:56,993 --> 00:06:58,993
Oh, you mean the stuff

105
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:00,393
that Doc was boasting about on his video site?

106
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:03,293
Hey, Doc! You really don't remember?

107
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:05,593
Who you bought the pot from?

108
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:10,293
No. I remember I bought it at a flea market some years ago, though.

109
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:13,793
Together with that carpet that you're sitting on right now.

110
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:15,593
You mean with this old worn out carpet?

111
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:17,993
Yeah, I laid it out because it came out

112
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:19,793
together from the storeroom with the pot.

113
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,593
Hey, Genta!

114
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:26,193
Don't go kicking the soccer ball in the room!

115
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:27,993
I can't help it, can I? I'm so hungry.

116
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,993
I feel like I'm going to die.

117
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:53,593
Yes. I'm sorry.

118
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:55,493
One more time, from the bottom of your heart!

119
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:59,093
Yes. I'm seriously very sorry.

120
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:01,493
Well... it's okay already.

121
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:04,093
It's not okay! We've got to go

122
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:07,293
buy the ingredients for remaking the curry, you know!

123
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:09,893
So, I already told you that we'd go out to buy the groceries,

124
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:13,093
so you stay back home.

125
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,593
I can't afford to let you guys go

126
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:17,293
because you'll buy unnecessary stuff again!

127
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:18,593
Yes...

128
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:20,593
Okay then, I'll go get the meat at the shop

129
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:22,093
where they're having a sale!

130
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:24,893
Let's meet later at the supermarket then!

131
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:28,293
Haibara.

132
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:30,893
I think it's about time you forgive him.

133
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,693
You're scarier than my mom.

134
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:34,793
Listen...

135
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,393
You're not getting a second helping of curry, Genta.

136
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,993
What? No way.

137
00:08:39,993 --> 00:08:41,793
Come on, pretty please...

138
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:44,593
-No. -Miser.

139
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,893
Ayumi, I put your clothes in the basket!

140
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,393
Thank you!

141
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:27,293
It's Ai's clothes!

142
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:29,293
It smells of Ai.

143
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:33,993
Doc! I finished taking a bath!

144
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:40,693
What?

145
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:44,193
Haibara was shown on the video site?

146
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:45,793
Are you serious?

147
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,893
Yes. Haibara appeared on the video site

148
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:51,093
that Doc was boasting his pot about a while ago.

149
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:53,493
Masumi said so.

150
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:56,293
Masumi?

151
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:58,193
Where'd you see her?

152
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,093
In front of Doc's house.

153
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:02,793
When we came back after buying the drinks.

154
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:04,393
But, it's strange.

155
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:07,493
I wasn't supposed to be on the video site.

156
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:10,293
Then, confirm that with Doc.

157
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:14,593
-I'm doing so now. -But, what it is?

158
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,893
It's not connecting.

159
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:19,193
Hey, Conan!

160
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:22,093
Don't tell me that...

161
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,293
Don't tell me that...

162
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:42,893
Doc!

163
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,493
Ayumi!

164
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:45,793
Are you all right?

165
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:51,993
Hey, Doc.

166
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:53,993
Hey? Get a hold of yourself!

167
00:10:56,593 --> 00:11:00,193
Doc! Are you all right? What happened?

168
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,993
The doorbell rang, so I went to answer it

169
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:06,493
and I was suddenly shot with a stun gun.

170
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:07,993
A stun gun?

171
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:10,193
Maybe they came after

172
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,693
the pot Doc were boasting about?

173
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:17,493
No, the pot is right here.

174
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:24,693
The coffee that is spilled on the floor.

175
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:27,693
Moreover, there's a trace of something having been here.

176
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:30,193
Hey...

177
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:32,293
Ayumi's nowhere!

178
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:34,193
What?

179
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,193
The old carpet's gone too.

180
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:39,093
Since coffee was also spilled

181
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:42,293
on the floor where it was laid out.

182
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:45,293
It means that when Ayumi was attacked,

183
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:47,193
she was pushed down to the floor where the spilt coffee was

184
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:49,093
and rendered immobile.

185
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:50,193
Then it is most likely

186
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:53,393
that she was wrapped in the carpet and carried away.

187
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,793
Why in the carpet?

188
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:56,693
Because instead of putting her in a big bag,

189
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:59,293
it would look like some movers or renovators

190
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:03,393
have come to carry the carpet away,

191
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,593
thus avoiding needless suspicion.

192
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:07,093
Then, was she kidnapped?

193
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,293
But, why would they take Ayumi?

194
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:12,293
I mean she only happened to be here, after all.

195
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,793
Hey, Doc! You can get the video

196
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,293
that you uploaded on the site right away, can't you?

197
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:18,993
Yeah.

198
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:21,493
This pot is my pride and joy!

199
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:23,993
I'd like someone to appraise it for me!

200
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,293
Only Doc is on.

201
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:27,693
No, wait.

202
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:29,893
Something's on your glasses, Doc.

203
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,493
Maybe they were

204
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:45,293
after you, Haibara.

205
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,892
Then, is this the story?

206
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:58,092
The culprit mistakenly thought

207
00:12:58,092 --> 00:12:59,992
that Ayumi was Ai and kidnapped her?

208
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,792
Yeah. It's very likely.

209
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,692
It's more natural to think that the culprit saw the video

210
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:08,192
that was aired on the video site

211
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:11,392
and learned that I was here in this house and took her away.

212
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:12,492
They probably came here

213
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,692
after seeing that we left to go shopping,

214
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,792
shocked you with the stun gun,

215
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:22,092
wrapped Ayumi who was here in the carpet and took her away.

216
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,992
Then, you mean the culprit was watching this house?

217
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:27,792
-Yeah. -But, if they were watching us,

218
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:31,492
they should've seen Haibara go out with us, right?

219
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,692
Haibara was wearing a cap back then

220
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:35,692
and her hair was rolled inside it, right?

221
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:38,292
It's not surprising that the culprit overlooked her.

222
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:42,292
Besides, the change that I put out for Ayumi

223
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:46,492
were the same clothes that Ai was wearing in the video.

224
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,192
If she had her head covered with the hood,

225
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:51,092
they would think that she was Haibara.

226
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,392
It... it's my fault.

227
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,492
If I didn't play soccer in the room,

228
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,992
we wouldn't have had to go shopping.

229
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:00,492
It's not your fault.

230
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:02,392
I'm to blame.

231
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:05,592
This is what my abominable circumstances

232
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:07,592
brought about...

233
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:12,992
No, wrong.

234
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:14,992
It's not your fault.

235
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:18,592
If it were those guys, they wouldn't mistake Ayumi for you.

236
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:19,592
But...

237
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,792
Besides, think about it... this situation.

238
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:27,292
I'm checking your image using Doc's PC now.

239
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,692
If this is the doing of the men in black,

240
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:34,292
they would've killed Doc and ambushed you.

241
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,992
The data in this PC would've been deleted first thing,

242
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,692
the house would've been burned down

243
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:41,692
and all traces of you having been would've been totally erased.

244
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,292
But, what if this is a trap?

245
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,392
Since I, their target wasn't here,

246
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:49,092
they pretended being kidnappers, took Ayumi away

247
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:52,892
and are trying to lure a flustered me out, then what?

248
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,592
Maybe they kidnapped her to find out

249
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:58,792
how much she knows about me.

250
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,192
If that's what they wanted to do,

251
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,792
they would've kidnapped Doc.

252
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:06,092
They would never go through the risk of kidnapping somebody.

253
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:08,192
They would investigate secretly,

254
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,292
scheme a plan and before you know

255
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,292
it everything is erased. That's how they do things, right?

256
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:16,092
Hey, you guys! What're you guys whispering about anyway?

257
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:17,092
It's nothing.

258
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,692
Can't we pursue the whereabouts of Ayumi

259
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,392
using your glasses, Conan?

260
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:25,292
Because Ayumi always carries her transmitter detective badge with her.

261
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,192
No. I checked on that a while ago,

262
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:30,492
but the badge is in this house.

263
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,592
She probably left it in the clothes

264
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:34,892
that she was wearing before she changed clothes.

265
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,092
At any rate, let's call the police.

266
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:41,492
What's that sound?

267
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,592
The ringtone of a cell phone?

268
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,692
It's coming from that pot!

269
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:51,692
It's Ayumi's cell phone!

270
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:54,892
"Read the mail and follow orders!"

271
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,492
One mail's come in.

272
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,192
It's Doc's address.

273
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,492
Don't tell me that...

274
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,892
My cell phone was stolen.

275
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:08,292
What orders are they talking about?

276
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:11,892
Find this cat. It should be around there.

277
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:14,392
Mail this cell phone when you find it.

278
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:17,092
We'll release the girl in exchange for the cat.

279
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:20,892
Of course if you contact the police, the girl dies.

280
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:21,992
What does it mean?

281
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:25,892
Was Ayumi kidnapped because of that gray cat?

282
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:27,192
I guess so.

283
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:30,092
At any rate, we've got to find that cat fast

284
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:32,992
or else I guess it's certain that Ayumi is in danger.

285
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,692
Okay! I'll forward the image of this cat to all of you,

286
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:37,792
so let's split up and search for it!

287
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,492
Aye...

288
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:43,892
Darn, it's nowhere!

289
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:45,792
Any call from the culprits?

290
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,392
Not yet.

291
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:50,892
We can't judge the size of the cat from this image,

292
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:53,792
so I mailed them several times to ask them.

293
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,892
I wonder why they're not answering.

294
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:58,592
Don't tell me that they gave up looking for the cat

295
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:00,092
and already took Ayumi's...

296
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:02,592
Idiot! What makes you think that guys who would kidnap a child

297
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:06,692
in order to look for their cat, give up that easily?

298
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:10,192
It's your mail address, Doc.

299
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:13,092
-It's from the culprits. -What does it say?

300
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:17,692
No joke! Is that for real?

301
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:19,392
Yeah! You guys are searching

302
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:21,792
near the apartment complex on 3 chome, right?

303
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,392
Yes.

304
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:26,092
This is what's written in the culprit's mail.

305
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,592
The cat's been found. We will release the girl

306
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:32,392
in the trash dump at the apartment complex on 3 chome.

307
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:42,092
Ayumi...

308
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:44,492
She's nowhere.

309
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:45,692
Don't tell me that...

310
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:58,792
-Ayumi! -Ayumi...

311
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,692
You're fine now.

312
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:18,692
But, I'm sure glad

313
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,492
that Ayumi came back safely.

314
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,392
She doesn't seem to be hurt anywhere too.

315
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:24,892
I'm fine!

316
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:29,292
My cell phone was wrapped in the carpet together with Ayumi,

317
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:32,392
and although the back of the carpet got a bit dirty,

318
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:34,592
it came back with no stains too.

319
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:36,592
But, how ruthless.

320
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,492
Yes. They ask us to search for their cat,

321
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:39,792
but after they find it,

322
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:44,092
they dispose of Ayumi together with the trash.

323
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:46,892
They said it was an important cat or something.

324
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:49,192
Huh? Did you hear the culprit's voice?

325
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:51,592
Yep. It was a high pitched, nauseating,

326
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:53,192
strange voice, though.

327
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,292
They used helium gas to change their voices, right?

328
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:59,392
And? Did the culprits say something else?

329
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:02,092
Well, they seemed really rushed.

330
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:04,392
They were saying that it was their master's cat

331
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:06,492
so they would be in trouble if they didn't find it.

332
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:09,492
Could it have been the cat of some super rich person?

333
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,292
Beats me.

334
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,892
It seems that the cat got away near here,

335
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:15,092
and they mistakenly thought that Doc had picked it up

336
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,092
and was feeding it.

337
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,292
He was shouting saying that if Doc had the cat,

338
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,892
the cat toilet, the water and feeding bowls

339
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:23,492
should be somewhere so to find it.

340
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:26,492
You mean the culprit wasn't alone?

341
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,592
Yeah. There seems to have been two.

342
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,192
They both had strange voices

343
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:33,592
and were wearing a cap with holes for their eyes and mouth.

344
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:35,992
You mean a twosome wearing mask caps?

345
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,792
Super bad guys!

346
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:40,892
But, they let me out of the carpet once,

347
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:42,792
and let me drink water.

348
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,992
Even after they wrapped me back into the carpet,

349
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:47,992
they asked me if I could breathe okay.

350
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:50,292
Moreover, they said they wrapped me in the carpet

351
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:54,592
because all they had on them was a cat carry bag.

352
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:58,992
In other words, the cat keeper of some rich person,

353
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,492
carelessly makes the cat get away and panics.

354
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,292
Then, wanting to get the cat back,

355
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:06,192
he commits a kidnapping case.

356
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,892
But, it ends up being a stupid story

357
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,692
where the keeper eventually finds the cat on his own.

358
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:12,192
But... If so, they should've honestly said,

359
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,492
"It's our master's cat, so if you picked it up,

360
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:16,492
please give it back to us".

361
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,692
I wonder about that.

362
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:20,192
If the owner of the cat is found to be rich,

363
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,192
an exorbitant reward may be demanded,

364
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:24,192
and this way, the fact that they let the cat flee would be

365
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:25,292
revealed to their master, right?

366
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:28,892
No, I don't think it's such a simple case.

367
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:31,492
No matter if they saw us leave to go shopping,

368
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:32,792
unless they already knew that Doc

369
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,492
and Ayumi were the only ones in the house,

370
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:37,692
I don't think they could do something like break into a house

371
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:39,592
with just a stun gun.

372
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:42,392
Besides, it didn't even take us 30 minutes to go

373
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,492
and come back from shopping.

374
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:46,192
If it was a house that they broke into for the first time,

375
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:49,292
do you think they could've passed Doc out with the stun gun,

376
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:52,092
confirm that the cat was nowhere inside,

377
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:56,892
then wrap Ayumi in the carpet and carry her out?

378
00:21:56,892 --> 00:22:00,592
Moreover, they even found Doc's and Ayumi's cell phone too.

379
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:02,792
Then, don't tell me that the culprits...

380
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,492
Yeah. They knew

381
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:09,392
that you and Doc live in this house, just the two of you.

382
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:13,092
That all four of us come over here to play,

383
00:22:13,092 --> 00:22:16,592
and that all of us own cell phones too.

384
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:18,992
But how did they get that information?

385
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:22,592
Has anybody you don't know come over to this house recently?

386
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,492
Come to think of it, yes.

387
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:27,592
-About three pairs. -Three pairs?

388
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:33,492
See, the ones who saw the video site that you just saw came.

389
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:34,792
The culprit is probably among

390
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,492
the three pairs of people who came.

391
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:40,092
I'll find them for sure.

392
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:02,992
"Next Episode" -Russian Blue?

393
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:07,292
I'm sure that Ran's mother's cat was also a Russian Blue.

394
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,992
If it's a pot and cat, we should look at the pot-cat video site.

395
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:13,392
It's really cute how the cat goes into the pot.

396
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:14,392
What?

397
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:18,492
Am I not supposed to take a bath until the culprit is caught?

398
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:21,692
Well, it'll only take a short while.

399
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:25,692
Because we're going to raid the culprit's place from now.

400
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:27,092
Next Conan,

401
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:31,292
"Doc's Video Site (Part 2)"

402
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:49,892
Next Conan's Hint:

403
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:51,392
"Ear"

404
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:54,592
Make sure to tune in next time too.

405
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:56,092
You don't have get all hung up on ear, Doc.
