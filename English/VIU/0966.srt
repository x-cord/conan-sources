1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,202
Invited to the Nichiuri TV Building Completion

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,129
Commemorative Movie Announcement Event,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,160
we headed out to Osaka.

4
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:10,401
But during the event,

5
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:14,611
the brutally murdered body of the movie's producer was discovered.

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:21,571
Hattori Heiji and I joined the investigation and identified the culprits,

7
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:25,691
but they fled using a car parked in the basement parking lot.

8
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:27,661
But in the next moment...

9
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:48,600
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

10
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,280
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

11
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,040
People keep dying at the grand event!

12
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,880
What will happen to the film's production?

13
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,590
Always determining the one truth

14
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,580
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

15
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:00,111
his name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:42,551
"Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba, Interlude!"

17
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:45,699
Osaka Police HQ

18
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:48,044
I see.

19
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:50,525
I more or less understand the situation.

20
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,775
And no one else was injured in the explosion?

21
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:56,224
No.

22
00:02:56,225 --> 00:03:01,285
I guess you could call it the silver lining, thanks to Inspector Ayanokoji.

23
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:07,415
Wasn't it Mori-san's daughter who was nearly hit while protecting Kazuha?

24
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:12,295
We had her examined at the hospital, and there was nothing wrong with her.

25
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:16,045
I see. I'm glad she's all right.

26
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:19,305
Naniwa Police Hospital

27
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:22,754
You didn't need to stay with me the whole time.

28
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:24,174
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:27,185
You were nearly hit by a car!

30
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:31,444
Well, I'm glad nothing happened.

31
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,964
What are the kids doing?

32
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,154
Kazuha-chan's with them.

33
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:39,325
I think I'll head back to the investigation headquarters.

34
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,864
You can't. We have a film shoot today.

35
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:43,575
What?

36
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:44,885
Film shoot?

37
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:54,755
Have you determined why Yonekura-san's car exploded?

38
00:03:55,025 --> 00:04:00,204
We believe it was an explosive made from an acetone peroxide mixture.

39
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:03,385
It was in the trunk.

40
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:06,654
You haven't found the detonator?

41
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:12,145
Not yet. But the explosive was unstable.

42
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:14,855
His reckless driving probably bumped it.

43
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:20,174
And Kouchi died instantly.

44
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,245
I'm truly sorry.

45
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,844
Apologize later.

46
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:28,624
More importantly, isn't it about time you explained

47
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:33,625
what a Kyoto police inspector was doing at the same crime scene?

48
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:40,914
Two days ago, there was an accident on a road near Takaragaike in Kyoto.

49
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:44,635
The male driver of the car died.

50
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,395
The deceased was a scriptwriter named Onda Takashi-san.

51
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,895
Never heard of him.

52
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,984
He was a scriptwriter in name only.

53
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:58,324
In reality, he was a profligate son who burned through his parents' wealth.

54
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:01,984
He had a mansion in Iwakura and two cars.

55
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,125
Apparently he had a comfortable life.

56
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:09,165
So what were the circumstances of his death?

57
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:15,515
He and his car were found at the bottom of a cliff off a mountain road near his home.

58
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:21,255
The local authorities determined that he failed to make a turn and that it was an accident.

59
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,234
Was it definitely Onda-san who was driving?

60
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:28,015
Wasn't the body pretty messed up?

61
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:32,364
Using his fingerprints that escaped injury and his dental records,

62
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,044
we were able to confirm it was him.

63
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:38,814
Yeah, but it doesn't look like that sharp a turn,

64
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:41,934
and wouldn't the road have been familiar to the victim?

65
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:43,785
How did he get in an accident?

66
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:47,684
Apparently Onda-san was drunk when he fell.

67
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:50,744
I see. So the accident was the result of drunk driving.

68
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:53,795
But you have a different opinion?

69
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:54,915
Yes.

70
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:59,774
He may have been drunk, but there were hardly any skid marks.

71
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:02,805
It's hard to believe this was just an accident.

72
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:06,664
You think someone messed with his brakes?

73
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,054
It's possible.

74
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:12,305
But didn't Onda-san have two cars?

75
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:17,054
That's right. He had a red and a blue sports car.

76
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:20,695
Apparently he drove the red one on even dates and the blue one on odd ones.

77
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,025
What about the day of the accident?

78
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,905
He drove the red one.

79
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:27,955
What? But it was an odd date two days ago.

80
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:31,904
The blue car was having mechanical trouble.

81
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:35,335
That's why he drove the red car two days ago.

82
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,724
Naturally, the blue car really did have mechanical issues.

83
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:43,755
But we didn't find any signs of tampering with the brakes.

84
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:50,494
If someone tampered with his car, why did they only tamper with the red car?

85
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:54,825
If they wanted to kill him as soon as possible, wouldn't they have done it to both?

86
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:56,895
You're right.

87
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,114
We get that you have doubts about the Takaragaike case.

88
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:06,155
But what's that got to do with you coming all the way out to Osaka?

89
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:10,084
The truth is, while investigating Onda-san,

90
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:13,415
I learned he associated with Yonekura-san in the past.

91
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:18,124
I came to ask Yonekura-san about it,

92
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,295
but I arrived after Nichiuri TV had been locked down.

93
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:24,424
I could've approached directly,

94
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:28,925
but I didn't want to make unnecessary waves, so I restrained myself.

95
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:33,734
So you were quietly watching us work?

96
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:35,185
That's not very nice of you.

97
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,304
Forgive me.

98
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:41,074
I haven't found anything concrete yet.

99
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:41,945
Hey.

100
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:45,945
How were Onda-san and Yonekura-san connected?

101
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:47,195
Right.

102
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:51,864
Onda-san and Yonekura-san were once part of the same group

103
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:54,875
sponsored independent film screening society.

104
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:57,204
Did you know about this?

105
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:58,455
N-No.

106
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,864
Inspector Ayanokoji.

107
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:06,094
I didn't find Yonekura-san's name in Onda-san's phone either.

108
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,465
Then why?

109
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:12,725
Yonekura-san was seen near Onda-san's home.

110
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:17,944
And while investigating that, you discovered their past connection.

111
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:20,475
Things are getting complicated.

112
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:26,834
Onda-san's case aside, we can't ignore the bomb that was in the car.

113
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:32,804
Maybe someone other than those two was trying to kill Yonekura-san.

114
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:36,625
There's something I've been wondering.

115
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,624
What is it, kid?

116
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:44,264
Remember the small scratch on the top shelf at Yonekura-san's murder scene?

117
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,374
Yeah.

118
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:50,425
Mihara probably accidentally dropped the knife while cutting the rope.

119
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:54,504
Then it must've made a noise, right?

120
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:58,015
Why didn't Yonekura-san notice that?

121
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:00,044
Why?

122
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:03,525
If he noticed the person on top of the scaffold,

123
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:07,275
he could've dodged the falling kaiju.

124
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,655
Otaki, go confirm that immediately.

125
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:11,925
Yes, sir!

126
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,845
What? The knife?

127
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:22,835
Yeah, I dropped it.

128
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:26,634
It made a surprisingly loud sound.

129
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:29,785
I thought he'd notice, and that I was screwed.

130
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:33,414
Yonekura-san didn't notice?

131
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:34,654
Nope.

132
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:38,845
I don't know why, but he was glued to his phone screen.

133
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:46,604
He kept saying "damn that Onda" in a real tense voice.

134
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:50,165
Is that true? Did he really say Onda?

135
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:51,685
Yeah.

136
00:09:56,895 --> 00:10:01,745
Tell me. Is Kouchi really dead?

137
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,174
Yeah.

138
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:04,704
I can't believe it.

139
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:09,834
Was it really a coincidence that you tried to steal Yonekura-san's car?

140
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:16,765
Of course! Besides, Kouchi said he knew where the spare key to his car was hidden.

141
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:18,685
I see.

142
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:21,744
I heard the car was rigged with a bomb.

143
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:25,934
Was someone else trying to kill Yonekura?

144
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,525
That's currently under investigation.

145
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,515
Seriously?

146
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,905
Then what was the point of what we did?

147
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:40,354
Yonekura-san was probably looking at an online news site.

148
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:45,915
Everyone was covering the car that went up in flames in Kyoto.

149
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:49,614
But it could be a coincidence.

150
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:53,925
Maybe he was just shocked to see an article about the death of an old acquaintance.

151
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:58,754
Inspector Otaki, where were Yonekura-san's belongings?

152
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:03,434
They were left in the staff room on the sixth floor.

153
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:05,964
Could we look at those now?

154
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,954
I've got a list of the items.

155
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:13,445
His plane ticket to Bangkok, his passport, and...

156
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,944
What is it?

157
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:19,194
He had six newspapers, including sports papers.

158
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:21,704
They're all from the day of the incident.

159
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,404
Smells fishy.

160
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:28,574
It's possible he wanted to know more about Onda's case and bought everything he could find.

161
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:31,715
Sounds like we'll have to re-investigate our case.

162
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:34,635
We'd appreciate your help.

163
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:37,215
Understood.

164
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:41,624
I'll ask my forensics team to reexamine Onda-san's car.

165
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,935
Thank you.

166
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:45,854
Hello?

167
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:48,974
Conan-kun, what are you doing? Heiji, what are you doing?

168
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,445
The film shoot has started!

169
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:53,775
Crap! I forgot!

170
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,195
Okay, everyone!

171
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,824
We'll now begin the rehearsal.

172
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:03,204
Please imagine a kaiju's head at the end of that pole.

173
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:06,184
What face should I make when I run?

174
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:09,344
Don't ask me.

175
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:12,634
I don't think you need to think about it that hard.

176
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:16,715
You're right. After all, no one's actually been chased by a kaiju before.

177
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:19,214
You'll be running that way.

178
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:22,164
How you want to act while fleeing is up to you.

179
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:28,754
But please don't smile or behave strangely in an attempt to stand out.

180
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:31,235
Good grief. This is a lot of work.

181
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:34,355
Let's start with the rehearsal.

182
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:45,365
Suemura Ryohei (51) Daiho Films Employee

183
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,267
Gomera

184
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,805
It's a kaiju!

185
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,555
Help!

186
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,305
Ayumi-chan! This way!

187
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:13,604
I-It's a kaiju! Heiji, I'm scared!

188
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:17,444
I-It's okay! Come with me!

189
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:20,325
I can't believe he's this bad at acting...

190
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:21,535
Conan-kun!

191
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,265
Wait a minute. Isn't this...?

192
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:32,554
How was my fleeing?

193
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,654
It was a brilliant performance.

194
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:36,304
What about me?

195
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:38,414
You guys did great.

196
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,094
Do exactly that when we film.

197
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:41,215
All right!

198
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:45,194
You were good, but your movements were a little stiff.

199
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,805
Try to relax a little more.

200
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:52,975
You were great, too, especially how you carried the child.

201
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,234
Oh, and I'm sorry.

202
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:55,915
Huh?

203
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,864
Could you try a little harder?

204
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:00,115
Sure...

205
00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:04,325
Gomera

206
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,535
Okay, we're ready to film.

207
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:19,405
Hei-chan, we've got another case.

208
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,727
This is crazy.

209
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:42,977
I can't believe there was only one victim in an explosion this large.

210
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:47,576
The company that owned this warehouse went bankrupt a year ago.

211
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:51,237
They haven't found a buyer since then, so it's been abandoned.

212
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:55,047
So who got caught in the explosion?

213
00:14:56,127 --> 00:15:00,497
Suemura Ryohei-san of the Daiho film production department.

214
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,246
What? Daiho Films?

215
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:08,796
Suemura-san was looking for a warehouse to use in the filming of "Gomera VS Yaiba."

216
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:12,507
He came to take pictures to study the place.

217
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:15,426
Have you determined what the explosive was?

218
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,596
We're not certain yet,

219
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:22,517
but according to forensics, they most likely used acetone peroxide.

220
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:26,576
In other words, just like the bomb that blew up Kouchi.

221
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,527
We believe it was the same substance.

222
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:30,196
I see.

223
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:33,766
So the two bombings are connected.

224
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,437
Which means...

225
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:41,997
My, my. How could you exclude me?

226
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,127
You caught me.

227
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:47,546
Did the Kyoto police figure anything out?

228
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,566
Yes.

229
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:52,186
The results of our re-investigation have increased the probability

230
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:55,887
that Onda-san's death was a murder by bombing.

231
00:15:56,417 --> 00:16:01,706
In other words, a bomb was rigged in his car, just like Yonekura-san's.

232
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:06,137
Which means these are three serial bombing cases.

233
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:11,146
Then the Osaka and Kyoto Police will have

234
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:12,917
to form a joint investigation headquarters.

235
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,327
We'd be happy to have the help.

236
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:20,706
I see.

237
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:25,067
Then Dad won't be back for a while.

238
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:31,416
He'll probably be stationed at the joint investigation headquarters.

239
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,666
Anyway...

240
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,917
Kamen Yaiba Café

241
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,417
Kamen Yaiba

242
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:41,096
What are we doing here?

243
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:44,057
Kazuha-chan insisted on coming.

244
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,927
Good grief. But...

245
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:49,776
I guess it's fine since that's so interesting.

246
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:53,676
Heiji, what are you doing? Come over here.

247
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:55,607
What? You want me to stand with you?

248
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,647
Of course!

249
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:00,086
It's Kamen Yaiba!

250
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,367
Yeah? So, what?

251
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:05,516
Strike a pose. I'm taking the picture.

252
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:08,906
Does Kazuha-neechan seem different to you?

253
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,707
It's love.

254
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:16,912
He's so cool! So cool!

255
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:19,876
Hey, you're freaking out Yaiba-san.

256
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:22,517
Ran-chan, take some with me.

257
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:25,457
I'll be back.

258
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:30,047
Haibara, there's something I want you to look into.

259
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:36,777
Lately I feel like I've been demoted from your partner to your errand girl.

260
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:42,777
Okuda-san, we heard you once sponsored an independent film screening society.

261
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:45,156
Yeah, I did.

262
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:50,846
It went well for a while, but things have been terrible for the last few years.

263
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,506
I quit about three years ago.

264
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:56,247
Do you recognize these three men?

265
00:17:57,237 --> 00:18:00,946
I remember them well.

266
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:04,026
They were involved about twenty years ago.

267
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:05,536
They called themselves Team Yonekura.

268
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,757
They had interesting ideas.

269
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:12,597
Yonekura was the idea man and came up with all kinds of plans.

270
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:18,147
Onda was the aspiring scriptwriter, and Suemura was the aspiring director.

271
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:24,287
Could you tell us more about that?

272
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:27,447
Kyoto-Osaka Serial Bombing Investigation HQ

273
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:36,587
According to Okuda-san, there was another man who worked with Yonekura-san and the others.

274
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:40,337
Ishizawa Katsuji-san, an engineering graduate.

275
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:46,086
Engineering. In other words, he has the scientific knowledge to build a bomb.

276
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:51,676
Apparently he was dexterous and came up with all kinds of ideas for props to use in movies.

277
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,347
Where is he now?

278
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:55,406
His whereabouts are unknown.

279
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:59,117
He changes jobs and residences all the time.

280
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,107
Excuse me. Hello?

281
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:09,446
But isn't it a bit much to treat him as a suspect just for being an engineering graduate?

282
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:14,747
According to Okuda-san, Ishizawa-san was bullied by the other three.

283
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:20,176
They threatened him into building props and performing odd jobs.

284
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:23,876
Ultimately, he gave up on finding a job in the movie industry.

285
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:26,757
I see. That would be a motive.

286
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:29,626
We've found Ishizawa.

287
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:33,766
He's got an uncle in Sakai, and he ended up at his house.

288
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:34,986
What about his uncle?

289
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:36,767
He died last year.

290
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:39,476
So he's living alone.

291
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:43,107
According to the neighbors, he doesn't have a steady job.

292
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:44,527
Inspector!

293
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,246
What's all the fuss?

294
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:47,487
We found fingerprints.

295
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:51,576
We found Ishizawa's fingerprints on the bomb at Suemura's murder scene.

296
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:52,367
What?

297
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:55,546
Shall we head there immediately?

298
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,846
We should be cautious.

299
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,157
There may still be bombs in his house.

300
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:05,116
If too many of us go, he might find out and cause a commotion.

301
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,376
We'll have to go as a small group.

302
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:10,387
The question is, who will lead it?

303
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:13,627
I'll let you handle that.

304
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:22,147
We'd better get back the investigation headquarters.

305
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,027
Y-Yeah...

306
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,646
Ran-chan, look at this.

307
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:28,946
Where'd you get that?

308
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:31,997
Heiji bought it for me.

309
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:34,877
How nice.

310
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:39,327
I know, right? Isn't it nice?

311
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:41,457
It looks great.

312
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,966
Good for you.

313
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,957
Y-Yeah...

314
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,967
We watched him all night, and we didn't see any movement.

315
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,706
Is he really in there?

316
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:03,727
The outdoor AC unit is working, and the directional mics picked up sounds.

317
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:06,737
There's definitely someone there.

318
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:11,937
Ishizawa-san.

319
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,446
Let's check the back door.

320
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:16,427
Yeah.

321
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,736
Hey, are you all right?

322
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:32,177
Hang in there! Who did this?

323
00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:35,757
This man...

324
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,096
It's Ishizawa!

325
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:41,127
What's going on?

326
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:47,647
What's Iwazawa's condition?

327
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,857
He has bruises all over his body.

328
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:53,107
He'll need total bed rest for a while.

329
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:58,487
Shouldn't we check out Iwazawa-san's house one more time before returning to the hotel?

330
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:02,327
Fine, fine.
