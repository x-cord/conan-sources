1
00:00:01,344 --> 00:00:04,444
Pops Kogoro, Ran and I

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:07,844
went to visit a Noh museum located in the suburbs.

3
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:11,844
The Mouri Detective Agency receives a letter warning

4
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:16,744
that a scheme to kill the owner of the museum is underway.

5
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:18,544
At the museum that was closed that day,

6
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:21,544
besides the owner of the museum, Mr. Jisaburo Izumi,

7
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:24,944
his private nurse, Ms. Hatsuho Toba,

8
00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:28,344
all employees at the museum, Mr. Tatsuro Seikanji,

9
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:32,444
Ms. Moyono Mibu, and Mr. Seinosuke Nagata,

10
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:36,944
and Mr. Naruya Akaza, who came to visit the owner.

11
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:41,544
While the owner was showing us through the building,

12
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:43,044
we encountered several dangerous situations

13
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,744
that could've taken our lives,

14
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:49,544
and eventually, Mr. Akaza ended up being killed.

15
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:53,644
Ran and I who suspected Moyono, snuck into the office

16
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:56,144
in order to contact the police. However...

17
00:00:57,544 --> 00:01:00,244
I've got to call the police right away.

18
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:03,944
Huh? I'm sure that Ms. Mibu made the call already.

19
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:06,844
She was just acting it out.

20
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,544
Ran, run away!

21
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:16,844
Don't you move either, Miss.

22
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:23,344
I'll bet it never dawned on you that

23
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:24,944
all three of us were accomplices.

24
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:28,444
You stay put right there until we finish off the director.

25
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:30,944
So, you mean that person called Nagata is also one of them?

26
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,144
Darn!

27
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,844
Director Izumi's life is in danger!

28
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:40,744
Aim for a 100% solution.

29
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:43,144
Clear all mysteries and codes.

30
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,944
There are three eerie accomplices!

31
00:01:44,944 --> 00:01:47,044
Solve the mystery of the premeditated homicide!

32
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:48,644
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:50,544
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,344
His name is Detective Conan!

35
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:38,169
"The Ogre Dances in the Noh Mask Mansion (Part 2)"

36
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,769
And so I fell asleep at a time like that.

37
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:01,869
What's this?

38
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:03,569
Hey, Miss.

39
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:06,569
It can't be.

40
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,169
Did they get away?

41
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,469
Those brats!

42
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,269
Awesome.

43
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,369
Mr. Mouri. To tell the truth.

44
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:32,769
This woman is the daughter of Kodo, the mask maker.

45
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,869
Although her surname has changed to Mibu

46
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:36,869
after her mother's divorce.

47
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:37,969
Director!

48
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:41,369
No problem, is there? He'll eventually find out anyway.

49
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,369
When Kodo was healthy,

50
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,669
he used to carve Noh masks over there.

51
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,369
That area was where you used to play, wasn't it?

52
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,969
She was angry at Akaza for selling

53
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:02,569
her father's works for a cheap price.

54
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,969
Which means she had a motive for killing him.

55
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:11,069
Don't take him seriously, Mr. famed detective.

56
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,069
If you will excuse me, I'll go get you another cup of tea.

57
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,469
Oh, thank you.

58
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,469
Inspector sure is late, isn't he?

59
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:29,169
I'll go and check the entrance, then.

60
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,369
She's very diligent.

61
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:39,469
She helps me out a lot.

62
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,069
Not enough heavy weight.

63
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,369
So, it's you.

64
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:57,069
We almost did it but... too bad.

65
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,569
What's this? This is the mask of Ayakashi?

66
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,869
Mr. Nagata.

67
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,069
Why?

68
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:34,369
Fire!

69
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,469
Let's go inside using that small entrance over there!

70
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,269
Darn! It won't open!

71
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,069
A saru seems to be inserted.

72
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,069
Saru?

73
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:48,369
It's a small lock used to lock rain shutters.

74
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:58,669
Those brats!

75
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:03,169
Director!

76
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:04,169
Don't worry.

77
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:06,469
Dad! Open this door!

78
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:09,769
Dad!

79
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,169
Coming!

80
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,369
Take the director outside!

81
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:13,369
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,269
I'll open it now!

83
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,169
Okay.

84
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,269
Where's the director?

85
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:23,469
Ms. Toba took him outside just now.

86
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:24,869
Where's Moyono?

87
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:28,069
She left saying that she'd serve us a new cup of tea a while ago.

88
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,069
Fire?

89
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,169
Darn! My God!

90
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,769
Let's get out of here too!

91
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:38,569
What? It won't open!

92
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,369
Let's go out to the yard from the small entrance.

93
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:44,369
The exit's?

94
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,369
Over there! There's a door!

95
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:55,869
Oh, what good timing! Help me, will you?

96
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:57,169
It'll take at least 20 minutes

97
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:59,069
before the firefighters get here.

98
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:17,969
Saved.

99
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:19,269
This is...

100
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,269
The place where the Noh stage is.

101
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,469
There's an exit!

102
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,769
The fire's already gotten around!

103
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:34,269
Dad, look over there!

104
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,369
The mask of Kijo?

105
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:39,969
It's that woman. Hey, come down here!

106
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,469
Don't you flee!

107
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,169
More than that, how're we going to get out of here?

108
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:48,469
It's a ladder! If we climb up there,

109
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:51,569
we can probably go outside through the skylight, no?

110
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:54,169
The skylight.

111
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,269
Keep your eyes closed and you'll be fine!

112
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:02,569
Dad. Hang in there.

113
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:09,169
This looks bad, Ran.

114
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:11,269
We're quite a distance apart from the next building.

115
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,469
What now?

116
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,169
We'll use the ladder as a bridge now!

117
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,769
Bridge?

118
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,469
Quick, Dad.

119
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:26,069
Stop slave driving me.

120
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,369
Ready, get set!

121
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:33,569
We did!

122
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:36,669
If we cross the ladder, we can go over to the window.

123
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:45,769
I'll close my eyes.

124
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:48,569
Keep my eyes closed.

125
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,569
Just a bit more, Dad!

126
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:53,369
Keep...

127
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:57,169
It's suddenly turned modern.

128
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,769
They probably added on this annex later.

129
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,569
Let's get going. That woman was there.

130
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,569
They're should be a way out.

131
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,769
An extension phone? Where's it coming from?

132
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:11,969
Hello.

133
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:14,369
Oh, Ms. Toba, so you're okay.

134
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:17,669
Yes, I'm in the kitchen with the director.

135
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:20,169
The fire hasn't gotten around here yet.

136
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,469
Be careful!

137
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:24,269
Beware of the chief manager and the woman called Mibu.

138
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,069
Stay in hiding for a while.

139
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:28,369
We've already contacted the police.

140
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,069
Just hold it out a bit longer.

141
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,669
-No, don't, Sis. No! -What's the matter?

142
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,469
Sis?

143
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:42,469
Sis? You mean Hatsuho is Moyono's younger sister?

144
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:43,869
At any rate, we've got to hurry,

145
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:45,869
or the life of the director is in danger!

146
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:51,069
Somebody's lying on the ground.

147
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:52,369
No, it can't be.

148
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:59,169
It's the chief manager.

149
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,069
He's the third one.

150
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:03,769
Where are the director and Hatsuho?

151
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,769
In the kitchen. Let's go.

152
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,269
Darn. Too late.

153
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,169
Hatsuho?

154
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:35,669
Get a hold of yourself, Hatsuho.

155
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:49,669
I knew about my sister and her accomplices' plan and yet...

156
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,869
Yet in the end I had no choice but to kill her.

157
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:54,469
I stabbed my own sister,

158
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:57,769
so I'm a terrible sister.

159
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,069
You couldn't help it.

160
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:04,169
You could've been killed by her too, you know.

161
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:11,369
Director. And I warned you.

162
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:14,669
What's that?

163
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,069
An iron skewer and something is afloat.

164
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,769
What's this?

165
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,969
Inspector Megure.

166
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:31,869
These four people, Mr. Naruya Akaza. Mr. Tatsuro Seikanji.

167
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:33,869
Mr. Seinosuke Nagata and Ms. Moyono Mibu

168
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:36,069
have been confirmed dead, but...

169
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:39,269
Director Izumi has made it through.

170
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,769
Thank God.

171
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:44,169
We can't talk to him yet, though.

172
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:47,469
His stab wound matched the chisel

173
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,769
that Ms. Mibu was holding,

174
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,669
so there's probably no doubt that she's the one

175
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,369
who attacked him.

176
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:54,569
Okay.

177
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,769
Chisel?

178
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:04,469
No, don't, Sis!

179
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:06,969
I see.

180
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,969
I get it.

181
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:11,282
I tried but couldn't stop her.

182
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:14,882
My older sister had a grudge against the director.

183
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:16,082
Because he used Akaza

184
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:19,882
to sell off our father's works abroad.

185
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,382
How did you feel about the director?

186
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:27,582
My mother is not the same as my sister's

187
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:29,682
and we were brought up apart from each other for a long time.

188
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:33,182
Besides, the director treated me very well.

189
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:35,882
That's why when you heard of the murder plan,

190
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,282
you wanted to prevent it.

191
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:41,782
Yes. That's why I sent Mr. Mouri the letter.

192
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:44,082
But I couldn't stop my older sister from going on with the plan.

193
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:48,382
Was she the one who killed the chief manager and manager too?

194
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:49,982
I think it was her.

195
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:52,082
Because she used to say if those two die,

196
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:56,082
all the cash would be hers.

197
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,682
I see.

198
00:13:57,682 --> 00:13:58,982
Inspector.

199
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,282
Although I did it on the spur of the moment,

200
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:04,082
I'm the one who stabbed my sister.

201
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:07,782
You took the iron skewer out from the kitchen, didn't you?

202
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:10,982
I was trying to protect the director, you see.

203
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,082
Please...

204
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:17,582
It's true that you stabbed Ms. Mibu,

205
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,082
but in your case,

206
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:22,982
I guess it'll be concluded as killing in self defense.

207
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:26,682
I'll hear the rest of you out at the station.

208
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:27,882
Yes, sir.

209
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:30,382
Mr. Mouri. Come along with us too.

210
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:31,382
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:37,182
Hey. The case has already been...

212
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:40,982
Solved.

213
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:43,382
Far from it, Inspector.

214
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,682
The culprit is right in front of your eyes.

215
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:51,282
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

216
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:54,782
Dad, Hatsuho is a victim, isn't she?

217
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,582
First of all, I couldn't understand

218
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:01,382
how Mr. Akaza was killed.

219
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:04,882
How did the culprit lace the poison onto what the victim took?

220
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,682
Hatsuho licked the cheese

221
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:09,882
and Mr. Akaza who ate that same cheese

222
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:11,382
dies right after that.

223
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:17,382
So, was poison laced onto the butter knife that Mr. Akaza used?

224
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:20,582
But, everyone was free to sit wherever he wanted to back then

225
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:22,482
so, it would've been impossible to place an aim on,

226
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:24,682
and kill the target.

227
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:28,082
However, there is just one way that it could've been done.

228
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:30,882
By using the spoon that first used by the taster.

229
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:35,482
If the poison was laced only onto the back of the spoon.

230
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,582
Even if the cheese that was scooped was not poisoned,

231
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:38,782
at this instant,

232
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:42,382
the poison was laced onto the remaining cheese.

233
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:47,282
When Mr. Akaza died, the spoon that fell to the floor

234
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:50,582
was switched to a clean spoon before we knew it.

235
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:54,182
Because if the spoon were to be left as is,

236
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:57,382
the trick would be exposed.

237
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,082
The only one who was capable of

238
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:03,782
doing something like that back then was you, Hatsuho

239
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:07,782
who wiped off the cheese from the director.

240
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:10,882
The real reason you sent me the forewarning of murder

241
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,882
was to set me up as a witness.

242
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:17,282
To make me testify that the three villains died

243
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:22,382
and you survived through legitimate self-defence.

244
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,082
After keeping me in check by the fire,

245
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,682
you went out and killed everyone during that time.

246
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:29,382
But, you couldn't afford having me burn to death.

247
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:31,082
You probably stuck your face out of that window

248
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:32,682
because of this.

249
00:16:32,682 --> 00:16:37,182
Then, the person wearing the mask of Kijo wasn't Moyono?

250
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,882
No. And, the highlight of your act,

251
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:43,582
was your scream on the extension phone.

252
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:46,082
Back then, you had already stabbed the director

253
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:47,982
and killed your older sister.

254
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:51,082
But she screamed 'No, don't, Sis'.

255
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:53,182
She acted it out alone.

256
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,882
I couldn't have don't something like that.

257
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,382
The director was stabbed with the chisel by my older sister.

258
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:04,482
But, I didn't have time to take a weapon like that out with me!

259
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,982
I see.

260
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,782
It's true that Moyono could've done that.

261
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:11,782
You probably seduced her to do so, either way,

262
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,182
by telling her to use the tools

263
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,882
that your father use to use to kill the director.

264
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:18,882
But, you took the iron skewers.

265
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:22,682
It would never serve as a substitute for the chisel!

266
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:25,582
You stabbed your sister with the iron skewer.

267
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:27,782
Moyono Mibu may have been a terrible woman,

268
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:30,582
but I guess she trusted her younger sister?

269
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,582
No, I don't think that's it.

270
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:34,682
I'm sure she assumed that the one who sent me the letter

271
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:36,282
was her younger sister.

272
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:39,182
That's why I'm sure she figured that she couldn't trust you.

273
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:40,882
Then, you took the initiative

274
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:43,182
and stabbed the director before her eyes.

275
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:47,182
Then, after Moyono started to trust you,

276
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:50,282
you stabbed her from the front using the iron skewer.

277
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:52,882
But the director's wound

278
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:55,482
was one that was made using a chisel, wasn't it?

279
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:59,582
Right. That was your final stronghold,

280
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:04,282
but unfortunately, you left behind a crucial evidence.

281
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,782
The culprit was very busy.

282
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:10,582
You were unlucky that you had no time to erase the evidence.

283
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:12,782
Conan, bring it over here, will you?

284
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,782
Okay.

285
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:16,382
Here it is!

286
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:18,482
What is it?

287
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,782
It just looks like a plain piece of wood.

288
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:25,382
According to Pops, he thinks it's handmade by that lady.

289
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:28,782
There's a V-shaped slit made on it.

290
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:32,582
It looks sort of like the teeth of a chisel.

291
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:34,782
A chisel?

292
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,082
I get it!

293
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:41,382
Yep! That lady brought two skewers out of the kitchen.

294
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:43,182
She assembled the two skewers

295
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:46,582
so that the flat sides would form a V-shape

296
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:51,482
and inserted them into the slits of the two wooden pieces.

297
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:55,582
She stabbed the director with her handmade weapon.

298
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,882
Isn't that right, Miss?

299
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:08,882
You got me there! You really got me!

300
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,782
I give up, sonny.

301
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:18,982
Absolutely, that Hatsuho Toba's exclusive weapon making device.

302
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:21,682
At first, I made it look like a chisel,

303
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:25,082
the second time I used just one skewer.

304
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:28,682
Which means you did it, after all.

305
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:32,282
Yes, I'm the culprit.

306
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:36,782
Why'd you go as far as to kill your own sister?

307
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:38,382
Why wouldn't I?

308
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:41,882
That woman was the director's lover, you get?

309
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:45,782
She lead a rich comfortable life with the director's money

310
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:49,182
while my Mother and I were barely making a living.

311
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:51,982
She dares holding a grudge against her father at this point?

312
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,882
That's nonsense.

313
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:56,782
That jerk Akaza was selling off valuable Noh masks

314
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:59,082
as instructed by the director!

315
00:19:59,082 --> 00:20:00,782
On top of that, he had the nerve to copy that director

316
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,382
and give me the eye.

317
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,782
Talk about giving me the creeps.

318
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:08,682
A museum so superficial should just burn down to ashes.

319
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:10,582
It would do everyone and the world more good

320
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:13,582
to turn this place into a park as soon as possible!

321
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:17,182
Inspector! I'm sorry to have kept waiting!

322
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,982
I'm done with my speech!

323
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:22,682
Go on and arrest me or do what you have to do!

324
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:24,182
Hey, Takagi!

325
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,982
Yes, sir!

326
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:31,882
Hello.

327
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:35,882
Oh, yes. I got it.

328
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:38,682
It seems that Director Izumi regained consciousness.

329
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:39,882
I see.

330
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,682
Just as I thought.

331
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:44,982
I thought it had a dull feel.

332
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:48,382
When I stabbed him, the wheelchair moved into the fountain

333
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:50,182
so I couldn't strike the final blow.

334
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,982
I'm still haphazard.

335
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:55,682
Oh, that's right.

336
00:20:55,682 --> 00:21:00,182
The director seems to have said to tell the boy thank you.

337
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:02,682
What did he mean, Conan?

338
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:05,082
I guess it was of some help to him then.

339
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:08,182
Hey, Director,

340
00:21:08,182 --> 00:21:11,382
if you wrap a strong braided rope like this around yourself,

341
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,182
if something comes up, I'm sure it'll at least

342
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:14,882
be able to protect you a bit.

343
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:17,082
I see.

344
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:19,382
Okay, in fact the accessory of the armor

345
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:20,582
would probably protect me

346
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:22,682
even if I were to be attacked with a knife.

347
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:25,882
Thank God.

348
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:52,782
The ones who schemed the killing of the director,

349
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:57,182
ended up getting killed and so this ended ironically.

350
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:02,182
What's up, Pops?

351
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:05,482
This case sort of had a bad taste to it, didn't it?

352
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:08,682
To think that all those involved were bad people.

353
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:11,082
But in any case, it's like this!

354
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:13,082
Since it's a murder case,

355
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:15,182
it's not something that you can just say sorry and forget about.

356
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:18,482
But if you think you did something bad, you should apologise.

357
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,682
To the Noh masks.

358
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:26,082
Even if there's Noh excuse!

359
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:28,082
Get it?

360
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:31,882
Too funny!

361
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:35,982
I thought he was in deep thought and this is what comes out.

362
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:45,482
Hey. I wonder why these chocolate bars was thrown away?

363
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:47,582
Why do such a thing deliberately?

364
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:51,582
I wonder if they're all really suspicious of that person.

365
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:56,282
"And the victor who survives alone laughs out loud."

366
00:23:56,282 --> 00:23:58,382
As Ms. Chiga Kaido puts it,

367
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:01,282
"An ironic circuit is circling".

368
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:07,282
Next Conan, "The Devil's Circuit"
