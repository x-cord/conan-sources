1
00:00:00,922 --> 00:00:02,561
On the way home from school,

2
00:00:02,562 --> 00:00:06,102
Miyamoto Yumi-san forced me to accompany her as she tailed Haneda Shukichi Meijin,

3
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:08,772
who she suspected of infidelity.

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:14,741
However, Haneda Meijin was simply meeting some young shogi players

5
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:17,402
at an apartment for a shogi study session.

6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,822
When we went to the apartment where the study sessions were held...

7
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:26,752
It's unlocked.

8
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:31,382
Come on, man. At least lock the door.

9
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:33,652
Genda-san?

10
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:36,422
G-Genda-san!

11
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:38,422
Hishinuma-san?

12
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:43,552
Genda-san, are you all right?! Genda-san!

13
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:46,022
What's wrong, Hishinuma-san? No way!

14
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:47,162
Genda-san?

15
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:50,022
You're kidding, right?

16
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:51,761
Something's really wrong with Genda-san.

17
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:53,571
He's not moving.

18
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:55,461
How is he, Hishinuma-san?

19
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:57,032
He's not breathing.

20
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:58,881
N-No...

21
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:00,782
He's not dead, is he?

22
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:14,191
Genda-san, wake up!

23
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:16,842
Open your eyes, Genda-san!

24
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:19,772
Hey, Genda-san!

25
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:28,041
It comes to visit after falling asleep!

26
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:29,932
Fall in love with logical deduction and the pleasure of solving mysteries!

27
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:32,521
What is Taiko Meijin's next move?

28
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:34,191
Always determining the one truth

29
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:36,041
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

30
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,552
his name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:25,272
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board, Brilliant Move!"

32
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:34,222
Is it true that you all left Genda-san in this room to go shopping

33
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:39,061
before Haneda Meijin, Yumi, and Conan-kun arrived?

34
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:40,721
Y-Yes.

35
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:44,232
He said he'd put together some snacks.

36
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:45,992
It's what we always did.

37
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:48,412
What kind of snacks?

38
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:53,102
Like cheese and prosciutto on crackers.

39
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:57,162
You can eat them while playing without getting your hands dirty.

40
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:03,592
This must've happened when someone came here during the ten minutes we were out shopping.

41
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,291
The front door was unlocked.

42
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:11,352
He probably unlocked the door because he thought we'd returned.

43
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:15,701
But isn't it possible that one of you

44
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:18,741
pretended to leave but actually returned to the room to kill him?

45
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:20,982
Th-That's not what happened!

46
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:26,502
I bought enough hot coffee for all of us at the nearby coffee shop.

47
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:30,991
They were kind of lukewarm, but I really did buy them, right?

48
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,641
Y-Yeah.

49
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,801
We heard the coffee's flavor had gotten worse,

50
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:37,622
so we drank some at the entrance downstairs.

51
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:41,291
But couldn't you use instant coffee and water

52
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:44,591
from a hot water heater to make lukewarm coffee?

53
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:48,951
Actually, the water heater's broken right now.

54
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:50,762
It only dispenses cold water.

55
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,642
We'd been talking about how we needed to call a repairman.

56
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:57,261
Then how about an electric kettle?

57
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:00,551
I broke that the other day, too.

58
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:02,402
What about that stove?

59
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:05,402
Couldn't you use that to boil water?

60
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:07,692
Well, yeah, but...

61
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:11,381
But when we found Genda-san,

62
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:16,412
Hishinuma-san and Mina put the bags they were holding on top of the stove.

63
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:19,092
Why don't you check the bottoms of the bags?

64
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:27,431
There's nothing unusual about them.

65
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:30,422
Then nobody used that stove.

66
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:34,182
We were out shopping for about ten minutes.

67
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:39,021
If someone used the stove to boil water, it would stay hot for about 15 minutes.

68
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,551
The bags should be burnt or melted.

69
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:42,991
I see.

70
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:45,521
Then who bought this bread?

71
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:47,072
I-I did.

72
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:50,491
I'm really into that bakery's bread.

73
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:53,572
The store's nearby, and I always bought some.

74
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:57,121
But you could buy bread beforehand, couldn't you?

75
00:05:57,122 --> 00:06:00,031
I bought hot freshly baked bread.

76
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:03,042
They really were warm and tasty looking.

77
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:07,791
It's too bad they didn't have any freshly fried curry bread, though.

78
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,742
It's their most popular item, so it was sold out.

79
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:14,432
Well, there doesn't seem to be a microwave here.

80
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:17,002
It would be impossible to reheat bread.

81
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:21,041
Uryu-san, what did you buy?

82
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,312
Right.

83
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,181
I bought ice cream.

84
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:26,821
They're from a shop that opened around here recently.

85
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:30,232
Everyone said they loved them after I bought some once.

86
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:34,572
That must be the melted ice cream inside the box.

87
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:38,832
Yes. Putting them in the freezer wasn't a priority at the time.

88
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:42,601
They were freezing cold when I bought them, right?

89
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,862
Y-Yeah.

90
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:49,132
But if you hid the ice cream in the freezer...

91
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:54,121
Before we went shopping, we all checked to see if we were out of anything.

92
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,512
There wasn't any ice cream then.

93
00:06:56,772 --> 00:07:02,581
And today we met at the shogi hall before heading here together.

94
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:07,611
Nobody could've put something in the room beforehand.

95
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:10,652
Hishinuma-san came empty-handed,

96
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:14,892
and Mina and I only brought small handbags.

97
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:22,442
Which means this murder might be the work of an outsider.

98
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:27,292
Not only that, but it's likely that these are serial murders.

99
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:29,592
S-Serial murders?!

100
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:35,722
It was publicly announced this afternoon that when missing shogi player Nishikido Kimiharu,

101
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:39,091
who was suspected of match fixing, was found,

102
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:43,472
one of the legs of the shogi board next to the body had been cut off.

103
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:49,862
And two legs have been removed from the shogi board next to Genda's body.

104
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:53,861
It's only been a couple hours since the announcement,

105
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,621
so it's unlikely that this was a copycat.

106
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:59,872
Did any of you know Nishikido?

107
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,862
The three of us didn't,

108
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:09,042
but apparently the late Genda-san and Nishikido-san were friends.

109
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:14,322
These study sessions were originally run by Nishikido-san.

110
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:17,601
The four original members were Nishikido-san, Genda-san,

111
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:22,472
Kishimoto Yuhei-san, who recently became depressed,

112
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:27,482
and Uryu Kinji, who went pro around the same time I did.

113
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:29,482
Uryu?

114
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:34,152
Uryu is Shoko-san's older brother.

115
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:38,882
I've heard rumors about those four, too.

116
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:43,582
They say there's a foursome that's been rapidly improving their skills recently.

117
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:49,032
But why did Nishikido stop attending the study sessions?

118
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:55,382
It could be because only Nishikido-kun was winning a bunch of games and had ranked up.

119
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:59,931
Everyone wants to play stronger opponents when they advance in rank.

120
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:04,812
By the way, why did Kishimoto become depressed?

121
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:06,862
B-Because...

122
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:13,192
I think it's because my brother Kinji killed himself.

123
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,111
He killed himself?

124
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:16,192
Why?

125
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:19,051
I don't know.

126
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:24,072
Not only that, but Kinji-san was doing great at the time and winning a bunch of games.

127
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:29,181
We were so certain he'd rank up that we even celebrated beforehand.

128
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:32,332
Mina was dating my brother.

129
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:35,381
So you don't know why he did it?

130
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:36,811
N-No.

131
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:41,842
Just before he died, he said someone from the Shogi League asked to meet him.

132
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:48,041
Kishimoto-san became depressed after Kinji killed himself.

133
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:51,732
He really looked up to Kinji.

134
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:57,231
After that, I was invited to join the study sessions

135
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,862
because they didn't have enough members, and I invited the girls.

136
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:05,021
These two were totally disheartened after Kinji's death,

137
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,742
so I also invited them to cheer them up.

138
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:12,802
In any case, it sounds like we'll have to talk to Kishimoto.

139
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:17,002
He may know why Uryu killed himself.

140
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:21,791
And his suicide may be connected to the murders of those two shogi players.

141
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,532
Those two may not be the only ones.

142
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:28,342
There are two legs left on the shogi board.

143
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:32,121
Y-You mean there's going to be more murders?

144
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:32,762
No way.

145
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:34,272
You're kidding, right?

146
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,152
Hey!

147
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:39,161
What are you scaring them for?

148
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:42,992
But I bet that's what Shinichi-niichan would say.

149
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:46,841
Do you know Kishimoto's address?

150
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:52,372
Not his exact address, but I think he lives in a detached house next to the public bath.

151
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:53,741
The public bath?

152
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:55,502
It's quicker to show you.

153
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,211
Next to the black chimney you can see from here is...

154
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:01,962
Wait, I see smoke.

155
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:05,592
Isn't that around Kishimoto's house?

156
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:07,961
C-Could it be?

157
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:10,181
Is Kishimoto-san their next target?

158
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:11,521
But why?

159
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:14,141
In any case, let's head there.

160
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:16,812
Return to your homes and wait there.

161
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:19,692
Don't do anything without speaking to us first.

162
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:23,442
And don't forget that your lives could be in danger, too.

163
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:28,782
Inspector Yuminaga.

164
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,541
What's the situation?

165
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:35,622
We avoided a total loss, but the resident who was inside was burnt to a crisp.

166
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,151
Since no vital signs were detected in the body,

167
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:42,172
he seems to have died before the fire started.

168
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:45,691
Forensics said it's possible he was alive until shortly before the fire started

169
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:51,352
because his rectal temperature hadn't fallen much.

170
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:53,481
Shortly before?

171
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:56,852
You mean he died after that shogi player was murdered at the Beika City apartment?

172
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:02,731
I heard from Megure that a shogi board was found at the crime scene.

173
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:06,022
We actually found one here, too.

174
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:10,622
A shogi board missing three legs.

175
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:13,361
So they really are serial murders.

176
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,622
Right after Genda's murder.

177
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:20,881
But now we can't ask him about the suicide.

178
00:12:20,882 --> 00:12:22,961
Let's check out other people who may have known him.

179
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:23,842
Hey.

180
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:27,841
More importantly, what's Conan-kun doing here?

181
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:32,852
Oh, uh, he snuck into the patrol car at some point.

182
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,962
I'm sorry for dropping by suddenly.

183
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,182
So this is where you moved to.

184
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:46,502
What's this?

185
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:50,572
You look like you don't know why I turned up here.

186
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:54,712
The truth is, I came to encourage you to turn yourself in.

187
00:12:55,752 --> 00:13:01,672
You're the one who killed Genda-san at the apartment in Beika City, aren't you?

188
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:11,202
These serial murders are targeting professional shogi players.

189
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:17,312
What these murders have in common is the shogi board left at every crime scene.

190
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:24,181
Next to the missing shogi player Nishikido suspected of match fixing

191
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:27,322
who was found bludgeoned to death was a shogi board missing one leg.

192
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:34,131
Near the head of Genda, who was found strangled to death in a Beika City apartment,

193
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:36,932
was a shogi board missing two legs.

194
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:44,861
And immediately after that, Kishimoto was found dead after his house caught fire,

195
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:48,472
and a shogi board missing three legs was discovered at the scene.

196
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:52,801
The potential suspects are the three people who left Genda

197
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:56,962
at the second crime scene to go shopping.

198
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:03,102
Hishinuma Kosuke bought enough hot coffee for everyone at a coffee shop,

199
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:07,002
Katsumata Mina bought freshly baked bread,

200
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:13,512
and Uryu Shoko bought ice cream.

201
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:19,801
They all drank Hishinuma-san's coffee at the apartment building entrance

202
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,602
and commented that the flavor had declined in quality and the coffee was cold.

203
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:28,442
He could've used lukewarm water and instant coffee to make that,

204
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:32,882
but the hot water heater and electric kettle were both broken and wouldn't give hot water,

205
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,671
and the stove wasn't warm.

206
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:38,142
There were no signs that anyone had boiled water on it.

207
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:42,462
The same can be said of the hot bread Mina-san bought.

208
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:47,922
In that room without a microwave, it would've been impossible to heat up that bread.

209
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:53,402
The ice cream Shoko-san bought seemed to be cold,

210
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:59,412
but with a cooler, she could've kept ice cream purchased beforehand cold.

211
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:03,841
But when we arrived at the room, all three were dressed lightly.

212
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:06,922
It's hard to believe they were carrying anything like that.

213
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:11,881
Not only that, but only Genda-san and Mina-san had keys to the room.

214
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:16,932
Shoko-san couldn't have arrived early and left a cooler in the room.

215
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:21,932
Naturally, Hishinuma-san couldn't have left a thermos in there either.

216
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:26,582
Could any of them have killed Kishimoto in the first place?

217
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:33,381
Together we discovered Genda-san's body in the Beika City apartment.

218
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:36,952
After an investigation by the police who arrived at the scene,

219
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:41,272
we began discussing the location of Kishimoto's home.

220
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:44,571
By the time we looked out the window to confirm the location

221
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:49,502
and noticed Kishimoto's house was on fire, three hours had elapsed.

222
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:54,712
Those three were with us the whole time.

223
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:59,841
Kishimoto's body discovered at the scene of the fire showed no vital signs,

224
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,282
which means he died before the fire started.

225
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:08,792
But since Inspector Yuminaga said the body's rectal temperature hadn't fallen completely yet,

226
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:13,682
it's likely he was still alive until shortly before the fire started.

227
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:18,151
That would make it impossible for those three to have killed Kishimoto.

228
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:20,742
This is impossible. Aw, man.

229
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:23,242
What's impossible, Genta-kun?

230
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,861
It's this Yaiba capsule toys.

231
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:29,411
I got a #1 the day before yesterday and a #2 yesterday,

232
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:32,632
so I was sure I'd get a #3 today,

233
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:35,631
but I got another #1.

234
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:39,821
I bet these capsules are rigged not to give you a #3.

235
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:44,142
Genta-kun, things don't always happen so conveniently in order.

236
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:46,961
Maybe I'd get one if I mixed them up.

237
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,951
You'll get in trouble.

238
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:49,688
It'll be fine.

239
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,031
Please don't get worked up over capsule toys.

240
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:56,541
What? Are you interested in capsule toys, too?

241
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,632
No, it's not that.

242
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,162
You're going to break it.

243
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:05,182
I feel like I just received an incredible hint.

244
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:08,832
Huh? Someone's calling.

245
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,162
It's Yumi-san.

246
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:15,221
Hello, Yumi-san? What is it?

247
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:16,381
Don't do that.

248
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:17,322
What?

249
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,012
Taiko Meijin hasn't come home?

250
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:22,771
Not since last night?

251
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:28,811
Yeah, late last night he said he'd be out late since he was meeting a friend and headed out.

252
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:31,772
I went to sleep without waiting for him to return,

253
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:33,702
but he wasn't there when I woke up.

254
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,301
I thought he must've come home and left again early in the morning,

255
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:41,032
but I've asked around and nobody's seen him.

256
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:44,041
Did you call those three shogi players?

257
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:45,381
Yeah.

258
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:49,371
I tried calling, but none of them said they knew.

259
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:53,042
I thought you might know, so I called you.

260
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:56,441
Come to think of it, Taiko Meijin had an odd expression

261
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,562
on his face after we discovered the body and before the police arrived.

262
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,552
Is it possible that he noticed something?

263
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:10,361
Was Taiko Meijin acting strange when you left the apartment where the murder occurred?

264
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:14,312
I wouldn't call it strange exactly.

265
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:18,101
When we left the apartment with the three shogi players,

266
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:23,622
Chukichi suddenly said he forgot something and borrowed the key and headed back inside.

267
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:29,832
I asked him what he forget when he came back, but he said it was a mistake on his part.

268
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,251
What is it? What did the Meijin see?

269
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:36,402
Well, whatever. I'll try calling someone else.

270
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:37,682
Hey, wait!

271
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:41,941
Maybe he's shocked you suspected him of cheating.

272
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,722
It sounds like he wasn't cheating after all.

273
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:48,731
I just tailed him a little. Could you guys not make a huge fuss over this?

274
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:50,621
"Just tailed him a little?"

275
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:52,482
You're not a detective.

276
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:55,841
You guys are lucky you get along so well.

277
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:56,602
Uh...

278
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,691
Actually...

279
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:00,891
Naeko-chan and I just got into a huge argument last night

280
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,661
because of a difference in opinion.

281
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:08,371
Because you laughed and called me an idiot because I served cream stew over rice.

282
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:11,771
Nobody does that. It's not curry.

283
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:16,151
It's all the same once it's in your stomach, and that way you only have to wash one dish.

284
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:18,922
It's annoying how in love they are.

285
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,322
Where am I?

286
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:31,212
Last night I went to see them, and then...

287
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:35,262
The truth is, I came to encourage you to turn yourself in.

288
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:39,022
Why don't we talk about this inside?

289
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:48,992
They knocked me out with a stun gun, and then I ended up like this.

290
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:54,832
My hands are tied behind my back, but my phone is still in my back pocket.

291
00:19:55,742 --> 00:20:00,512
I can get it out, but I doubt I'll be able to call anyone.

292
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,082
They look pretty irritated.

293
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:08,632
They seem to be waiting for the police announcement.

294
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:12,992
But I've crushed that path to victory.

295
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:40,601
How unusual for you to call me, kid.

296
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:42,421
Shin-chan's calling?

297
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:43,292
What?

298
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:47,862
Shukichi's missing after getting involved in a murder?

299
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:48,962
Yeah.

300
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:53,462
Taiko Meijin might've identified the culprit and gone to see them.

301
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:56,801
All three suspects are shogi players like him,

302
00:21:56,802 --> 00:21:58,992
so he probably wanted to convince them to turn themselves in.

303
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:02,851
Tell me more about the case.

304
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:08,561
Could you put your phone on speaker so I can listen, too?

305
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:10,291
I've got nothing better to do.

306
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:15,392
The world's leading mystery enthusiast is currently at your disposal.

307
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:17,481
I see.

308
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:22,392
So as the number of victims increases, the number of legs on the shogi board decreases.

309
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:27,481
But you already know the number of legs is a feint, right?

310
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:32,402
Yeah, but like I said earlier, all three of them have alibis.

311
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:37,412
You said Akai-kun's brother seemed to have noticed something.

312
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:39,722
What made you think that?

313
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:43,711
When the Meijin moved around the people in front of him to get a look at the body,

314
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,292
he touched the kitchen counter.

315
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:50,712
He held his hand as though he'd touched something.

316
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:56,571
I don't know if it was hot or cold, but his expression changed then.

317
00:22:56,572 --> 00:22:59,761
What was on top of the kitchen counter then?

318
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:01,812
Nothing significant.

319
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:07,162
Just two ice trays, a mixer, and a toaster, I think.

320
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:17,572
Sounds like there was a magic tool one of them could've used to fabricate an alibi.

321
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:20,082
What? Which one of those sounds like—

322
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:23,802
Oh, right.

323
00:23:24,262 --> 00:23:27,531
In any case, sounds like we need to hurry.

324
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:32,432
Meet up with Akai-kun and make sure his brother is safe.

325
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:36,592
We're counting on you, Edogawa Conan-kun.

326
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,692
Yeah, I know.

327
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:48,562
It's been a while, kid.

328
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:52,751
Like a certain high school detective,

329
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:56,492
officially I don't exist.

330
00:23:57,932 --> 00:24:04,082
Would you like to play a game of blind shogi with this Meijin?

331
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:09,082
He might be using the game record of that blind shogi game to tell us where he's being held.

332
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:11,061
The next episode of Conan is

333
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:14,292
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board, Checkmate!"
