1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:02,194
Disguise!

2
00:00:02,194 --> 00:00:04,194
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,194 --> 00:00:05,594
The mystery of the mysterious locked room.

4
00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:07,094
The truth behind the fourth painting!

5
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:09,194
What will become of the confrontation with Thief Kid?

6
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:10,494
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:12,094
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:13,994
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:57,072
"Blue Storm", the fourth of a set of paintings

10
00:01:57,072 --> 00:01:59,672
drawn by a famous painter named Mr. Takeyori Oikawa

11
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:01,572
is sought after by Thief Kid.

12
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:05,072
We are invited to the Oikawa residence,

13
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:07,972
but the painting that is in the atelier

14
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:11,272
where the surveillance camera is set up disappeared just like that.

15
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:14,472
And Mr. Oikawa's father-in-law,

16
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:17,772
a famed landscape painter named Mr. Haruhito Kanbara,

17
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:20,272
is found dead in that room.

18
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:27,372
"Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 2)"

19
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:34,772
It's certain that Thief Kid is the one who killed Mr. Kanbara, right?

20
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,872
We still can't come to any conclusion,

21
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:39,272
but he's certainly a prime suspect.

22
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:41,872
Mr. Oikawa, are you going to paint it again?

23
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:44,672
The last of the flower, bird, wind, moon, the "Blue Storm".

24
00:02:46,372 --> 00:02:47,872
Well, of course...

25
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:49,372
I'm not going to paint another one.

26
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:50,972
Forever.

27
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:55,072
So I'd like to plead with Thief Kid.

28
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,172
Give me back the "Blue Storm" that you stole tonight,

29
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,472
along with my father-in-law's life.

30
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:03,772
Hey.

31
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:05,872
When the Inspector Megure and the others arrived here,

32
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:08,072
did you notice anything strange?

33
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,072
Something strange?

34
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:11,172
Come to think of it,

35
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:15,372
one of the staff fell ill and was carried away from the crowd.

36
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:17,672
I'm sure it was somebody from Nichiuri TV.

37
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:18,872
I see.

38
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:22,672
That's where he switched with one of the four.

39
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:25,372
Then, did you see any suspicious looking bags?

40
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,572
Something big enough to fit a person into.

41
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,772
No, I didn't.

42
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:33,172
If you do find anything, will you secretly call my cell phone?

43
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,972
Yeah, but why do you want me to contact you?

44
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:39,872
Because Mr. Mouri said that Thief Kid may be disguised

45
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:41,672
as a member of the police.

46
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:42,872
Are you serious?

47
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:46,672
If my cell phone rings and I whisper it to Mr. Mouri,

48
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:48,272
Thief Kid won't suspect anything, will he?

49
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:49,372
I see.

50
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:53,872
Mr. Kanbara's condition before he went into the atelier?

51
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:55,872
Detective Mouri wants to know about it?

52
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:58,872
Yes, he wants to know if Mr. Kanbara really went into the atelier

53
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,172
to protect the painting himself.

54
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:05,172
No. While Mr. Oikawa was checking the painting,

55
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:06,972
Mr. Kanbara was standing in front of us all the while.

56
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:10,772
He went in after Mr. Oikawa finished checking and opened the door.

57
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:15,272
After that, they were both in the atelier for 1 to 2 minutes.

58
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,672
He said that he was going to protect the painting at that time.

59
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:21,172
Of course, we stopped Mr. Kanbara from going into the atelier,

60
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:23,372
but Mr. Oikawa said that it would only take a short while.

61
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:28,172
We had no idea Mr. Kanbara was going to confine himself to the atelier.

62
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:30,172
However, after the blackout,

63
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:32,472
we really didn't expect the culprit to be hiding in the attic,

64
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,072
ready to steal the painting and kill Mr. Kanbara.

65
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:37,872
Did you notice anything different about Mr. Oikawa

66
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:39,572
who came out leaving Mr. Kanbara inside?

67
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,572
For example, blood on his clothes or something?

68
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:46,772
No, Mr. Oikawa didn't have blood anywhere on him.

69
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:50,672
But he could've committed the murder wearing his clothes inside out.

70
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:52,272
That's not possible either.

71
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:56,172
Inspector Nakamori checked Mr. Oikawa's clothes right away, too.

72
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:59,472
Blood was found on the outside of his jacket

73
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:04,072
and there was no blood on the back of his jacket or below it.

74
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,572
Besides, the blood that was found on his shirt got on him

75
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:10,072
when he went inside in the dark along with the inspector and the others.

76
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:13,372
He groped for Mr. Kanbara and coincidentally found him.

77
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:15,572
He then carried Mr. Kanbara up.

78
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:20,372
But I wonder if it was really a coincidence?

79
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:23,272
You came in with the inspector, didn't you?

80
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:26,872
There's no way he would found Mr. Kanbara in the dark

81
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:29,572
without using light and stab him in the neck.

82
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:32,672
He couldn't have done all that in such a short time.

83
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:38,672
By the way,

84
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,972
the door that Mr. Oikawa was pounding on during the blackout

85
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,772
is the door on that side, right?

86
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:47,872
Leaving Mr. Kanbara behind, he came out of this door

87
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:50,672
and yet why did he pound on the other door?

88
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:56,072
He was probably on his way to get the inspector

89
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:59,772
to help get Mr. Kanbara out when the blackout occurred.

90
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:03,172
The inspector was in the room over that side.

91
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,372
Come to think of it,

92
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:07,072
while Mr. Oikawa was checking his painting,

93
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:09,672
the inspector was talking to him through the door over that side.

94
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:13,372
Yeah, they were talking.

95
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,172
He opened the door slightly and asked me to go check

96
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:18,272
if the police really turned the surveillance camera off.

97
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:22,672
He told me to knock once if it was still on.

98
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:26,072
I knocked twice, the signal for it being off.

99
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:30,572
Signal? I wonder why he didn't ask you to directly come tell him about it?

100
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:34,272
Probably because he didn't want me to see the painting

101
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:35,872
that was still incomplete through the opening of the door.

102
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,572
Did the forensic officers say anything?

103
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:42,372
Yeah, they said that there were two things that bothered them.

104
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:46,572
There was a strange trace of blood found on Mr. Kanbara's sweater,

105
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,472
and an oval shaped mark was found at the base of his left thumb.

106
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:53,372
As for the blood,

107
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,972
it probably got on because his left arm was bent in front of his chest

108
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:57,872
when he was stabbed in the neck.

109
00:06:57,872 --> 00:07:01,572
But as for the oval shaped trace, they don't know what it is.

110
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,972
Maybe that's...

111
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:06,272
Conan, quit going here and there!

112
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:07,472
We're going home.

113
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,872
But Thief Kid isn't caught yet!

114
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:12,772
That's a job for the police.

115
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,472
It's already bed time for children, isn't it?

116
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,572
That's enough.

117
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,572
If the culprit is Thief Kid,

118
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,672
he would've escaped using a hand glider,

119
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:25,772
so there's no way we can cordon off the area.

120
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:26,872
That's right.

121
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:29,372
The most we can do is figure out his escape route.

122
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:31,672
But don't you think it's funny?

123
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:34,372
The Riot Task Force officers have this place surrounded

124
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:37,172
and yet no one has seen anybody flee.

125
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:40,572
That's because they didn't put any spotlight at the windows.

126
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:41,672
Yes, but...

127
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:44,472
But Thief Kid's hand glider is white.

128
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:46,172
It couldn't have disappeared by a spell or something,

129
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:48,072
so it's strange that no one saw it.

130
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:50,472
He's right. Thief Kid is a magician.

131
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:54,772
Unlike a witches' spell, magic has to be set up beforehand, right, Conan?

132
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:58,272
-That's why... -Wait! Please don't get him involved, okay?

133
00:07:58,272 --> 00:07:59,272
Okay.

134
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:04,872
If he did disappear by magic, we don't know what trick he used.

135
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:09,172
As to that, I've figured out something that might be a hint.

136
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,072
May I try an experiment?

137
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:14,772
It requires a newspaper and an empty glass cup.

138
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:19,672
I put the newspaper over this cup.

139
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,372
Then I lift it up carefully.

140
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:31,272
I put it on the middle of the desk.

141
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:33,072
And...

142
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:36,372
The cup disappears and is gone.

143
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:41,672
But that's just plain magic.

144
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:44,972
You probably just dropped the cup on your lap after holding it,

145
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:48,072
and just crushed the newspaper that was shaped like the cup.

146
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:49,472
I did this magic in my younger days

147
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:52,572
at a year-end party of the 1st section.

148
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,372
Father told me about it.

149
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,772
He said it was a wet blanket.

150
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,972
Oh, is that so?

151
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,072
That's not the issue here!

152
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,272
What does that magic have to do with what happened here?

153
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:04,872
So you see,

154
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:07,472
what I mean is, I think this is how Thief Kid disappeared.

155
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:10,872
I'm sorry!

156
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:12,572
Don't worry about it.

157
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:15,972
It's cheap stuff that I got as a wedding gift 40 years ago.

158
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:18,772
I had no idea...

159
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,172
Don't touch them so carelessly!

160
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:23,772
Cracked pieces like these may look like they're not there but actually are.

161
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,972
Okay.

162
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:27,072
Excuse me. Where is your wife?

163
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:29,372
She passed away five years ago.

164
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:31,772
It was right after I had finished drawing the third painting

165
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:35,172
of the flower, bird, wind and the moon, "Pure White".

166
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:38,572
My wife was badly wounded by a tornado

167
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:39,972
when she travelled abroad 15 years ago.

168
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:43,272
She had been bedridden with a coma since.

169
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:46,372
15 years ago, you also announced the first of the set

170
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:49,772
of flower, bird, wind and moon, the "Red Lotus".

171
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:54,372
Yes. It was a year after my wife's accident.

172
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:59,672
I painted that piece with all my might to make money for hospital bills.

173
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:02,372
It was highly evaluated and I became a full-fledged painter.

174
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:06,172
Until then, I was making a living teaching art class.

175
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,472
Excuse me.

176
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:13,072
I'm sorry, it's a call from my younger brother.

177
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,872
Go ahead.

178
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:16,572
Keep looking, there should be more.

179
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:19,672
-I don't see any more... -Would you like to use some light?

180
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:21,972
It'll be easier to find the pieces since they will glitter.

181
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,372
What?

182
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:32,572
Detective Mouri?

183
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:35,472
Yes. He was asking if there was anything else

184
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:37,472
that came falling from the window of the atelier.

185
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:40,672
All we found were two paint brush stands

186
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,972
and a whole lot of paint brushes.

187
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:44,972
Come to think of it,

188
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,472
I did find this fishing line.

189
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:50,072
There's a lake where you can fish near here,

190
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,272
so I'm sure that someone who came fishing dropped it.

191
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:56,672
It's approximately seven meters in length.

192
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,372
There is a loop on one end

193
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,872
and on the other end, there is a fish hook that's bent out of shape.

194
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:06,272
No doubt about it, the culprit used this.

195
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:10,272
If so, I'm sure that it should be somewhere here.

196
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:15,372
There it is!

197
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:18,972
It's this stone with a hole on it.

198
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:25,172
It's you, sonny.

199
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:28,072
The big suspicious bag that you were talking about was found.

200
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:29,172
Really?

201
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:32,572
Yes. It was found near the broadcast van of Nichiuri TV.

202
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:34,972
Officer Chiba is fast asleep inside.

203
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:36,772
Officer Chiba won't get up?

204
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:39,772
No, we're trying to get him out of the bag right now,

205
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:42,672
but the zipper is broken and won't come down below his neck.

206
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:45,572
I got it! I'll relay the message to Mr. Mouri.

207
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,072
Conan, Ran was looking for you.

208
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:49,572
Officer Takagi.

209
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:52,172
Officer Chiba who's at the villa is Thief Kid.

210
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:53,172
What?

211
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,772
They just found the real Officer Chiba.

212
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:56,872
I have to tell everyone!

213
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:58,172
Wait. Before that...

214
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,272
Huh?

215
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:02,472
Will you please look for the stolen painting

216
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,972
that is still somewhere in this villa, Officer Takagi?

217
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:06,572
The "Blue Storm".

218
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,267
"Blue Storm" is still here in this villa?

219
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,767
But wasn't the painting stolen by Thief Kid?

220
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,267
It hasn't been stolen, that's why I want you to look for it.

221
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,767
I know that you can find it, Officer Takagi.

222
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:23,667
Yeah.

223
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,467
Pops, this way. Over here!

224
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,667
Gosh.

225
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,767
Hey, we're going home.

226
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,467
Thief Kid already escaped.

227
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,667
Wait.

228
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:48,967
Conan, let's leave the rest up to the police.

229
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,067
No, there's no need to leave it up to them

230
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,367
-because I've already figured it out. -Huh?

231
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,667
Ran, please call for Inspector Megure.

232
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:00,767
Take a good look.

233
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,767
This is the true identity of the "Blue Storm".

234
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,067
A fishing line.

235
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:13,667
This is just a cloth covering the fishing line.

236
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,267
It's the same magic as the one Officer Takagi performed.

237
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,467
If you see a cup-shaped newspaper,

238
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,267
you'd most naturally think that a cup is there.

239
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:25,667
Likewise, if you cover the easel with a cloth that is pulled taut,

240
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,767
it's natural to think that a painting is underneath the cloth.

241
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:31,167
This is a simple trick used to fool spectators.

242
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,967
First, a loop is made at one end of the fishing line.

243
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:37,367
Then you pull the line over to the door.

244
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:41,367
You lock the door after hooking the line onto the bolt of the door.

245
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,567
The fishing line is pulled right above the easel

246
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:48,067
and set to pass between the brush stands and the paint brushes.

247
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:50,267
The paint stands were used to make up for the difference in height,

248
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,967
so that the line would become horizontal.

249
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:57,467
And then, on the fish hook that is put on the other end of the line,

250
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:02,867
a stone with a hole in it is hooked onto it and left to hang outside.

251
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:06,267
After the fishing line is pulled taut, a cloth is placed over the easel

252
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,967
and the "Blue Storm" before it is publicly announced is ready.

253
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,967
All there's left to do is to break down the door during the blackout.

254
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,067
Go ahead and try it.

255
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,067
Yes, sir.

256
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,267
One, two, three!

257
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,667
When the door opens,

258
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,867
the line will be pulled by the weight of the stone that is hooked onto it.

259
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:27,267
If the edge of the cloth hooks onto the place where the loop is tied,

260
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,767
the cloth will flip over making it cover one side of the easel.

261
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,367
The loop will then flip over

262
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,767
and the brush stands that are stacked together will push the window open.

263
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:36,167
The brush stands and paint brushes

264
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,267
would go falling out the window together with the fishing line and stone,

265
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:43,167
and fall to the feet of the people on guard right below.

266
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,667
If the brush stands and the paint brushes are toppled near the window

267
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,767
as soon as people come in after breaking the door down,

268
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,667
it'll look as if someone had dropped the paint brushes and scattered them,

269
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,067
then stole the painting and fled.

270
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,867
But when and who could've rigged something like this up?

271
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,967
It was all done when Mr. Oikawa went to check his painting

272
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:01,367
and asked to have the surveillance camera turned off.

273
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,367
What?

274
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,467
Then, don't tell me that...

275
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,567
That's right.

276
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,967
The one who deceived everyone into thinking that the painting was stolen

277
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:11,667
and the one who killed Mr. Kanbara

278
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:15,567
is you, Mr. Oikawa.

279
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,867
As proof of this,

280
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:21,167
you opened the door slightly when you went in to check your painting

281
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,367
and talked to one of the Riot Task Force officers.

282
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:27,067
You went out of your way to ask him not to look inside the room,

283
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:31,367
because you wouldn't have been able to hook the line around the bolt.

284
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,167
Mr. Mouri, just what're you talking about?

285
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,567
I said that because I didn't want anyone to see my painting

286
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:40,067
until it is completed.

287
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:44,067
Besides, my father-in-law came into the atelier on his own.

288
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,167
Why would I kill my father-in-law

289
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,467
who said he'd guard the painting himself?

290
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:51,267
No, you just made that story up.

291
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:55,367
You kept avoiding Mr. Kanbara who insisted to talk to you.

292
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,967
You worked it out so that he would come to the atelier on his own

293
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:01,167
by saying that you two could talk there.

294
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,867
When Mr. Kanbara came to the atelier,

295
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,567
you passed him out with a stun gun.

296
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,167
You waited for the timer to go off causing the blackout.

297
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,867
You were waiting for the time for the lights to go out

298
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:16,367
just as you went to call Inspector Nakamori.

299
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:20,067
You entered the room from behind Inspector Nakamori

300
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,767
and ran swiftly up to Mr. Kanbara who was passed out.

301
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,967
Then you stabbed him in the neck with a knife.

302
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:26,667
This is what actually happened.

303
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,767
Too bad, that's impossible.

304
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:35,767
I can't see in the dark and I had no light with me.

305
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,367
Yes, you can.

306
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,267
Even without light.

307
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,967
So long as you have a cell phone with you.

308
00:16:56,567 --> 00:17:00,367
You put the phone on top of Mr. Kanbara and ring the phone in the dark.

309
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:05,267
It would flash so you can verify where he is immediately.

310
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:07,167
If you had the sound turned off,

311
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,467
Inspector Nakamori and the others who broke the door down

312
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:13,267
would be distracted by the paint brush stands above everything.

313
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:14,767
Mr. Oikawa.

314
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,467
If I remember correctly, you had two cell phones, didn't you?

315
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:22,067
The white one for private use and the black one for work.

316
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,367
The white one is apparently for private use

317
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:28,867
because you said the blood got on when you tried to call a family member.

318
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,267
Despite this,

319
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:35,167
you answered the black phone when you got a call from your younger brother.

320
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:39,767
Is the white cell phone with blood on it really yours?

321
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,367
I'm sure that you've already deleted all the data in it,

322
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,967
but the police can still check on it, you know.

323
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,067
They can find out who the cell phone belonged to

324
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,367
and who picked the call up during the blackout.

325
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,667
Just as you deduced, that's my father-in-law's cell phone.

326
00:17:55,667 --> 00:18:00,267
I used it to verify the location of that old ogre in the dark.

327
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,367
-Ogre? -He's indeed an ogre.

328
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,967
He tried to force me to draw a painting that relates to the wind

329
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:08,367
that had caused the death of my wife.

330
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,867
You did mention that your wife died because of a tornado.

331
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:13,667
Why did you decide to draw a four-part painting

332
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,367
of flower, bird, wind and the moon then?

333
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:16,567
Did you know?

334
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,467
There are other words such as snow, moon and flower

335
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,367
that describe the beauty of nature?

336
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,367
Right, the first painting was a red lotus lower,

337
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,767
the second was the golden moon,

338
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:30,367
and the third was of a Japanese crane standing on snowy ground.

339
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,967
I didn't mean to paint the pure white crane, but rather, I drew the snow.

340
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:36,967
Actually, the painting was finished then.

341
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,467
But father-in-law...

342
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:41,367
He told the rich man who bought "Red Lotus" and "Golden Moon"

343
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,567
that if he bought "Pure White" for a higher price,

344
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,467
he would sell him the next piece, "Blue Storm", too.

345
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:49,367
He lied saying that it was a set of four, the flower, bird, wind and moon.

346
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:52,467
Even though it was to make money for my wife's hospital bills,

347
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:55,267
it was just too much for me.

348
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,767
Do you think that I could paint "Blue Storm"

349
00:18:56,767 --> 00:19:00,967
after my wife died and I have lost my purpose?

350
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:04,667
After a lot of thinking, I finally thought up this trick.

351
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,267
But he said he would go through with his own plan if I did the trick.

352
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:10,667
-Plan? -He was going to disclose everything!

353
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,667
That the "Blue Storm" never existed

354
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:16,267
and that the warning from Thief Kid was also something I made up!

355
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:17,467
Not even considering the fact that if he did so,

356
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,667
my name as a painter would be soiled

357
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,567
and I would lose my entire career!

358
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,567
You're wrong.

359
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,267
I think when Mr. Kanbara said he had something in mind,

360
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,067
he meant this.

361
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,067
Officer Takagi.

362
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,567
That thing you're holding is...

363
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,167
Don't tell me that's...

364
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,267
"Blue Storm", the first wind of summer that blows across the green leaves.

365
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,767
Unlike the other three paintings,

366
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,867
this was drawn by the master of landscape painter,

367
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,067
Haruhito Kanbara.

368
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,167
No way!

369
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,267
His hand was hurt, so he couldn't have drawn it.

370
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:48,567
You didn't know, did you?

371
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:53,767
The trace of the palette that was found on Mr. Kanbara's left thumb.

372
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,967
A paint brush with teeth marks on it was also found

373
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:59,367
in the storeroom of Mr. Kanbara's room where the painting was stored.

374
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:01,867
I think that Mr. Kanbara was painting the picture

375
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,567
by holding the paint brush in his mouth.

376
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,467
He did so in order to match your way of painting.

377
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,967
Why didn't he tell me then?

378
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,567
He couldn't.

379
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,867
Even if he were able to draw it,

380
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,967
it was still only a copy of your style.

381
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:19,467
If anybody found out, it would indeed unmistakably soil your name.

382
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,467
No.

383
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:26,767
I...

384
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,167
Mr. Oikawa.

385
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:31,567
It's slightly roughly drawn since he used his mouth,

386
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,067
but as for me, I like that "Blue Storm", too.

387
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,767
Just like the other three paintings you drew,

388
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,967
the feeling of wanting to help somebody really shows.

389
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,767
Officer Takagi?

390
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,067
Yeah.

391
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:19,067
Are you thinking of spreading your wings and flying out of there?

392
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,667
Or am I just imagining things?

393
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,167
How did you find out?

394
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,067
By elimination.

395
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:28,567
You couldn't have known about the magic performance

396
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,667
that Inspector Megure put on at the year-end party.

397
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,967
Inspector Megure was there,

398
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:36,367
and Officer Sato learned about it from her father.

399
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:40,867
Officer Chiba who was found in the bag is also not Thief Kid.

400
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:43,867
It's unthinkable that you would leave the bag in such a conspicuous place.

401
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:48,467
The zipper didn't open from neck down in order to hide the physique.

402
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,767
In other words, they can see a sleeping Officer Chiba,

403
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:54,567
but it was actually Officer Takagi.

404
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:58,267
It was a trick to escape during the commotion when things came to light.

405
00:22:58,267 --> 00:22:59,867
But I appreciate what you did.

406
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,267
Thanks to your magic,

407
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:03,567
I was able to figure out the trick of this case.

408
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:07,967
Well, magic is my specialty after all.

409
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,967
But...

410
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:14,067
do me a favour and let me go this time.

411
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,367
I just came to clear my name.

412
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,267
After all, I'm completely white this time.

413
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:19,767
Just like the girl's underwear.

414
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:20,967
Conan?

415
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,667
Hey, it's about time we...

416
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:26,667
No...

417
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:30,467
Take this!

418
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:34,767
Why you...

419
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,067
Thief Kid!

420
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,367
Thief Kid was disguised as Officer Takagi.

421
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:42,767
Strange.

422
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,567
The ball that I kicked in the smoke,

423
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:45,767
it should've hit him.

424
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:47,367
What's this? What's this?

425
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:49,667
Dad, your pants are...

426
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:54,367
That hurts.

427
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:56,067
That brat...

428
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,867
"Next Episode"

429
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:00,967
The car...

430
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:03,067
Don't stop the car!

431
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,867
Keep going the way you are!

432
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:07,467
Ran, what about that side?

433
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:09,667
This side is no good either.

434
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:13,167
Oh, no! Inspector Megure!

435
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:14,767
Get away! Hurry!

436
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:17,967
Stop without stopping.

437
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:18,967
That's it!

438
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:27,767
Next Conan, "Rental Car Goes Out of Control"

439
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,367
Next Conan's Hint:

440
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:47,767
"Expressway information"

441
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,567
-In the next episode... -Dad's got to keep going!

442
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:50,967
Where's he going? To a hot spring or something?

443
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,667
-Wrong. -It's so obvious.
