1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,219
"Ki-Bi-Wa".

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,519
What's this supposed to mean?

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,119
I wonder what "Ki-Bi-Wa" means?

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,120
"Bi"?

5
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:15,119
What? I wonder why I read the kanji character as "Mi"?

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,619
"Ki-Bi-Wa".

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,919
Thursday. (Same kanji character as Thursday)

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,019
Beauty. (Same kanji character as beauty)

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,220
Japanese cuisine. (Same kanji character as Japanese cuisine)

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,819
What is it?

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,919
Ms. Rena.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,119
Haven't you done a TV program having key words like those?

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,419
No.

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,319
Rather, maybe it's somebody's name?

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Somebody's...

16
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:37,720
Somebody's name?

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,719
Yes, First Investigation Division.

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,519
Megure speaking...

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,819
Conan!

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,319
Yeah. I think he's here.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,819
Hold on a second.

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,919
Let's see, the hold button...

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,819
So, that's the story.

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,319
Takagi, your extension is ringing.

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,819
Yeah.

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,019
Yes! Takagi here.

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,020
Officer Takagi!

28
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,219
What?

29
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,819
Inspector, didn't I teach you already?

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,919
About extension number...

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,219
Well, no big deal!

32
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,119
Oh yeah. Never mind that. Officer Takagi, from Conan on number one.

33
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,719
What? From Conan?

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,719
I wonder what he wants.

35
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,419
From Conan?

36
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,319
Yes. This is Takagi.

37
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,319
Oh, Officer Takagi?

38
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,419
There's something I'd like to ask you.

39
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,019
Three nights ago,

40
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,820
didn't you go inside unit 305 of a condominium Haido-cho?

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,219
Yeah.

42
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,019
I did.

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,020
The reason?

44
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:40,319
So, this vehicle was under...

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,819
I can't really tell you why...

46
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,319
Were you by any chance, Officer Takagi,

47
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,219
on a stake out the house of the condominium the other side?

48
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,220
-What? -What?

49
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,419
What?

50
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,219
Is anything the matter?

51
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,519
No, not really. It's nothing.

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,720
I wonder what's going on.

53
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,019
To be honest with you, that's right.

54
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,419
I stake out in the condominium unit

55
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,219
where I can see the house across from the window.

56
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,219
The ex-fiancee of a crime suspect lives in that condominium

57
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,319
and since there is a possibility of that suspect making contact with her,

58
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,619
we got permission from the management company and were staking out.

59
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,019
Just as I thought.

60
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,120
Just as you thought?

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,719
In the end, the suspect was arrested in Toriya-cho.

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,519
The stake out was cancelled at around midnight.

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,019
But since we're still investigating on the case

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,019
so the management company was told not to say anything.

65
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,719
And yet, how did you know I was staking out?

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,319
Officer Takagi.

67
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,919
While you're staking out,

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,019
didn't you doodle on the glass door?

69
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,220
You wrote "Miwako Takagi".

70
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,219
What is it, Officer Takagi?

71
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,419
Officer Takagi.

72
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,619
What's with him?

73
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,819
-I'm sorry! -He sure is acting jittery.

74
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,419
Conan, please don't tell her about this.

75
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,619
Okay?

76
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,919
Okay. I understand.

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,420
But Ran and Pops are here too!

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,519
No way!

79
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,419
Takagi!

80
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,219
Which means that while Officer Takagi

81
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,719
were staking out the ex-fiance of the suspect,

82
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,719
he was reminded of Officer Sato.

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,419
And as he was fantasizing marrying her,

84
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,120
he wrote that name on the glass door.

85
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,919
Right after that, he got a call from Inspector Megure

86
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,019
telling him that the suspect was caught.

87
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,619
As he left in a hurry,

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,119
so he forgot to erase the name on the glass door.

89
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,319
I see!

90
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,019
So as three days went by, the first two words of his last name

91
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,419
and the last word of Officer Sato's first name disappeared.

92
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,119
Come on. What a nuisance!

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,619
I'm sorry!

94
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,319
But it's just like him and kind of nice.

95
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,119
Really. That's so much unlike an officer and sort of cute.

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,219
I know, right?

97
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,520
But now we're back to where we started.

98
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,219
Yes..

99
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,720
And tomorrow is already the Saturday in question.

100
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,120
The only thing we can do now is to arrest the culprit in the act.

101
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,819
Ms. Rena!

102
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,719
Yes?

103
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,719
Please let us spend the night here today!

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,020
I, Kogoro Mouri, will nab that lowly and dirty guy tomorrow!

105
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,419
Shall I help you clean up?

106
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,719
Don't worry about it.

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,919
Tomorrow is recyclable trash day.

108
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,219
So all I'm doing is getting together magazines and newspapers

109
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,419
and tying them together.

110
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm required read a lot of newspapers and magazines on the job so...

111
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,720
You're cleaning up?

112
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,819
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

113
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,519
It's Jekyll and Hyde!

114
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,019
How nostalgic.

115
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,420
I read it during my junior high school days and was really scared.

116
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,119
Conan, do you know this story?

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Yep...

118
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:22,319
Dr. Henry Jekyll, who has a peaceful personality,

119
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,819
drinks the drug that he invented

120
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,819
and becomes Mr. Edward Hyde, a man with an evil personality.

121
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,220
A story about dual personality, right?

122
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,019
You really know a lot.

123
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,819
You brat!

124
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,220
This brat knows a lot about weird things.

125
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,319
I'm really sorry.

126
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,420
Not at all.

127
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,619
Here.

128
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,519
Do you always leave it out here?

129
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,919
Yes.

130
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,419
If I leave it out here,

131
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,419
I can take them out as I go out in the morning.

132
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,419
I see.

133
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,819
Besides, this is a corner unit,

134
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,619
so it won't get in anyone's way if it's just for a night.

135
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,319
Is Tuesday also a trash day?

136
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,819
Yes. For combustible trash.

137
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,219
I leave the trash for Tuesday out here on the day before too.

138
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,719
I see.

139
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,919
So that's the story.

140
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,819
Hey. Even if we figure out who the culprit is,

141
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,319
will you promise not to get too angry?

142
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm sure he's a great fan of yours!

143
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,919
I'm sure he is!

144
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,520
After all, he's a stalker.

145
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,674
Wake up, Pops.

146
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:07,875
Pops!

147
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:15,575
Pops. It's almost time.

148
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:20,674
Here it comes?

149
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,774
Please stay where you are, Ms. Rena!

150
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,274
Just you wait!

151
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:25,774
You rat.

152
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,775
I'm going to nab you right now.

153
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:31,274
And teach you a lesson!

154
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:32,475
What?

155
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:36,374
Dad?

156
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,475
Nobody's here.

157
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:43,074
No way!

158
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:44,174
You gotta be kidding?

159
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:45,674
How can it be?

160
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,674
I don't believe it!

161
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,074
It can't be! How?

162
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:50,574
How's it possible, Dad?

163
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:52,475
How should I know?

164
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,574
Right here.

165
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,074
He's here.

166
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:00,474
You said he's there?

167
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:02,274
Those are magazines!

168
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:03,974
Conan...

169
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,974
I mean, behind here.

170
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:11,175
Idiot! How can an adult be hiding in a place like that?

171
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,375
A...

172
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:16,675
A child?

173
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,174
You brat!

174
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,175
Was it you?

175
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:22,475
So you're the one who's been pushing the doorbell and running away!

176
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:27,974
I see! He wasn't found because he was a child.

177
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:32,074
I didn't think that someone would be hiding in a place like that.

178
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,774
I see.

179
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:36,974
You didn't do anything the Saturday the week before last week

180
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,874
because there were no stacks of magazines in front of the door, right?

181
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,774
That week Ms. Rena was out on a business trip and wasn't home,

182
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,974
and probably didn't have that many magazines to recycle!

183
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,974
Hey, what were you doing?

184
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,474
Why did you do what you did for?

185
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:53,275
You're an elementary school student, aren't you?

186
00:08:57,675 --> 00:09:00,374
Well, if you don't want to tell us about it, it can't be helped.

187
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,174
Let's go to the police, your parents and all

188
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,274
and get a good teaching there.

189
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:07,475
I think he rung the doorbell to wake her up.

190
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:12,475
So that Rena would make it in time for "Morning Live Seven".

191
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,974
I'm sure he thought that Ms. Rena isn't on "Morning Live Seven"

192
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,474
because she can't get up in the morning.

193
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:26,274
That's why he used to ring the doorbell at 6:30 am on Saturdays!

194
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,374
Since there's no school on Saturdays,

195
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,174
if he rushes home right after he rings the doorbell,

196
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:34,874
he can also confirm whether she's on the program or not!

197
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,674
But somebody pushed the doorbell on just one Tuesday too, right?

198
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:42,374
Don't tell me that you skipped school and...

199
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,475
I think there was no school.

200
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:47,974
There are consecutive days off in October, that is, the second Monday

201
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,274
because it's sports day.

202
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:52,174
If field day is held on that Monday,

203
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,274
usually, there is no school for grade school kids

204
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,974
on the following Tuesday.

205
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,774
Which means that he placed the sleeping pills there,

206
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:03,474
so Rena could sleep well and get up early in the morning.

207
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:04,574
Yep.

208
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:07,974
Because mother used to drink it saying she could sleep very well.

209
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,275
I see.

210
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,474
But why?

211
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,475
Why do you do so much for me?

212
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:25,474
Because you look like her.

213
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,975
You look like my mother.

214
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:34,174
My mother died last year of a traffic accident.

215
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,275
What?

216
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,374
That's why...

217
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,475
Sonny.

218
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:47,674
I understand that you're lonely because your mother's gone.

219
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:50,274
But if you keep clinging onto to your mother,

220
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,574
you'll only worry your mother who is in the heaven.

221
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:55,074
You're a boy,

222
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:58,374
so you got to be strong and let your mother rest in peace.

223
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,374
So, you shouldn't come here anymore.

224
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,374
For your mother's sake.

225
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,975
For your own sake too.

226
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,874
Understand?

227
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,675
Yep.

228
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:14,675
Bye, miss!

229
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:18,675
Bye.

230
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,875
It just...

231
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:31,675
I had a little brother about his age too back then.

232
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,174
Rather than that,

233
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:40,474
I have to pay you for detective fees.

234
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:41,974
Oh, no need for that!

235
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:44,674
We had dinner here too.

236
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,074
But...

237
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,774
Let me pay you at least as a token of my appreciation.

238
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,874
Oh, really?

239
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,974
Then I'll mail my bank account number to you later.

240
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:56,475
So can you give me your email address?

241
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,275
Hey...

242
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:02,674
Geez...

243
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:04,874
What a stale case it was...

244
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,674
But I'm glad that it turned out well.

245
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,975
It wasn't a weird stalker or anything.

246
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,075
Rain.

247
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:38,875
This is bad. I didn't retrieve the transmitter!

248
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,374
What's wrong, Conan?

249
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:48,574
I seem to have forgot something in Ms. Rena's house earlier.

250
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:50,574
What? Seriously.

251
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:52,174
Dad, you can go on ahead.

252
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,174
I'll go with Conan.

253
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:55,874
I'll go get it right away.

254
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,474
What? Conan.

255
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,775
Then we'll be waiting for you in the parking lot then!

256
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:08,174
Footsteps? Which means that...

257
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:10,975
Ms. Mizunashi stepped on it.

258
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:16,475
The sound of a cell phone being switched on.

259
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,875
"Seven Kids"!

260
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,275
Don't tell me...

261
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:40,075
Don't tell me that she...

262
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,774
Yes.

263
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:47,274
Oh, I'm sorry.

264
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:51,174
I had a bit of a problem and had my cell phone switched off.

265
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:52,474
It's all right.

266
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,574
It was no big thing.

267
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:57,974
I reported it to the person concerned by e-mail just now.

268
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:00,874
Don't tell me...

269
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,474
Yes. No problem.

270
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,675
Let's meet as we were scheduled to at 10 am.

271
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,475
Gin.

272
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,475
What?

273
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,475
Why?
