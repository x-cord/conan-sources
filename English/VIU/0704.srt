1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:04,166
I participated in the Bell Tree Express event

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:05,766
with the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

3
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:07,866
Ran and the others.

4
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:12,766
Suspicious passengers are gathered in car number 8.

5
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:16,266
The deduction quiz that is held on the train,

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:20,166
in the wink of an eye turns into a locked room murder.

7
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:25,466
In the meantime, a black shadow closes in on Haibara.

8
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:29,966
Moreover, who is the man with the burn that kidnapped Sera?

9
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,966
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:39,166
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,166
The train is in panic because of their trap.

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,666
Haibara's fate hangs in the balance!

13
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,266
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,266
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult!

15
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,966
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:34,971
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Last Stop)"

17
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:38,163
But, Detective...

18
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:41,563
Don't you think that your deduction's a bit too far out?

19
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:45,963
It's not easy to increase a loop in the chain lock

20
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:48,763
and if the bulb of the lamp of my room wasn't burnt out,

21
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:51,363
I wouldn't be able to call the conductor to my room, would I?

22
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:53,563
The only reason why I called the conductor

23
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:55,463
was because the alarm of the wristwatch

24
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:57,763
that was forgotten in my room coincidentally went off.

25
00:02:57,763 --> 00:03:01,463
Conductor, you mentioned earlier

26
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:05,163
that one of your uniforms were missing, didn't you?

27
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:06,363
Yes.

28
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:10,763
Mr. Ando is probably the one who stole it.

29
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:12,263
If he wore the uniform and got himself mixed up

30
00:03:12,263 --> 00:03:14,663
in the examination of the train before boarding,

31
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:17,163
it would have been possible for him

32
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,163
to change the chain lock at the scene of the crime,

33
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:21,763
or change the burnt out lamp of Mr. Noto's room

34
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:25,363
or hide the wristwatch in Ms. Idenami's room.

35
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:27,763
Moreover, if Mr. Ando used a remote controller

36
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:29,463
to ring the alarm of the wristwatch again

37
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,463
while Ms. Idenami and the conductor

38
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,363
were arguing to distract them,

39
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,863
even if Mr. Ando who was hiding in room B

40
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,963
were to use the fishing line to open the door of room C

41
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,763
that he had covered the door with the mirrors with,

42
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,763
no one would've noticed.

43
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,063
After he chain locked room B,

44
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:46,563
hiding behind the door where he had placed the mirrors on,

45
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:48,663
if he closes the door and pretends to have

46
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:50,663
come out of his own room

47
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,463
and walk towards Ms. Idenami.

48
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:54,463
Despite the conductor

49
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:57,063
having been in the corridor right through,

50
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:58,763
a situation is created where no one

51
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:03,163
was seen going in or out of the crime scene.

52
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:04,563
Well, but unfortunately,

53
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,963
just before he was about to open the mirrored door,

54
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,463
Ms. Komino and her maid came along the corridor.

55
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:12,563
There was a chance that they would've notice the fishing line,

56
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:14,563
but in the darkness of the tunnel,

57
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:16,363
it probably slipped their notice.

58
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,763
Don't tell me that you deliberately didn't mention this

59
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:22,263
because you didn't want to become involved?

60
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:25,663
But, why would Mr. Ando kill Mr. Murobashi?

61
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:26,963
Weren't you supposed to be friends

62
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:29,663
that were rescued from the fire that occurred five years ago?

63
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:34,063
Yes. I thought so until two years ago,

64
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:35,663
until I saw that picture

65
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:39,563
that was supposed to have burned in the fire at an auction.

66
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:40,863
What?

67
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,463
I searched for the owner of the picture

68
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:48,363
and ended up seeing Murobashi's name.

69
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:50,063
I see.

70
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:52,663
Mr. Murobashi stole the picture from the house,

71
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:54,163
and in order to hide what he did,

72
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,463
he set fire to the house?

73
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,163
As a result many people fell victim.

74
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:02,063
Yes. If that guy,

75
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:03,763
like us, was boarding this train every year

76
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:06,463
to pray that the souls of the people

77
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:10,063
who died in the fire would rest at peace,

78
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:12,763
I would've urged him to turn himself in.

79
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:15,163
But while we were waiting to play

80
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:18,963
the fake roles of the deduction quiz,

81
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:20,363
he, the victim, me the culprit,

82
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,763
and the children the detective,

83
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,463
that guy said this.

84
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,463
This kind of thing is exciting after all!

85
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,263
I mean I really feel alive.

86
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,463
Don't you recall the fire that we barely

87
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,463
made out alive from?

88
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,563
That guy said so in sheer delight,

89
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:44,363
reddening his cheeks!

90
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,663
My wife was caught up in smoke

91
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:50,063
and died in that fire too, and yet...

92
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:54,663
Yukiko.

93
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:57,563
You seem to want to cast a smokescreen over us.

94
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:59,163
You people got no chance.

95
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:00,463
Oh, yes, we have!

96
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:03,963
Because Shinichi's got a hold of your weak point, Sharon.

97
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,163
Don't tell me that

98
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:08,263
you think my hands are tied because we're friends?

99
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:11,663
I don't think your friends know, Sharon?

100
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,463
That Shinichi and that girl have become children

101
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:16,663
because of the drug?

102
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:19,163
If you narrow down the search to elementary school children,

103
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:22,863
it'll be a matter of time before you find them.

104
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:25,263
Shinichi said that

105
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:28,563
you may have a reason for hiding the fact

106
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:31,963
that you know about this.

107
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,563
And what about...

108
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:37,763
Suguru Itakura?

109
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,563
You know him, don't you?

110
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:41,063
The computer graphics creator

111
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:43,763
who was working on special visual effect that we,

112
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:46,663
the actresses were all acquainted with.

113
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:48,863
I was surprised to hear from Shinichi

114
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:52,663
that you ordered some kind of system from him.

115
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,363
My fellow performers were saying that

116
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,563
both of you were clashed during a certain movie

117
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:59,263
and are on bad terms.

118
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,763
I'm sure that you changed your voice

119
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:02,363
when you called him to make your request,

120
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:05,063
as would be expected of you.

121
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:08,263
The system that you went out of your way to order from him.

122
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:09,763
Does it have something to do with

123
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,263
the fact that the two have changed into children?

124
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,863
Yukiko, that's enough.

125
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:18,463
Stay out of this!

126
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,863
Your stupid plan is all figured out already.

127
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:24,563
Plan? Just what are you talking about?

128
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:28,563
If she realizes that we're on board this train,

129
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:31,863
there's only one thing she would do.

130
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:33,763
She'd drink the antidote of that drug

131
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:36,163
and return to her previous self.

132
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:39,463
If she is killed as a child

133
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:42,263
and her body is found in the train,

134
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:45,663
those children will cry and make a big fuss.

135
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,863
On the other hand, if she returns to her true self,

136
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:51,263
even if her body were to be found,

137
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,163
for the children, the dead body

138
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:55,963
would be that of a woman they just met once.

139
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:58,363
The children would be more worried about Ai's disappearance

140
00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:00,163
that they would not dwell on the incident.

141
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:03,763
That would also distract the Organization from the matter.

142
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:05,563
Well, I don't think that

143
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:08,663
your son or Dr. Agasa would think that way though.

144
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,863
They would never be able to say that

145
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:16,063
the woman's body is Ai's previous body.

146
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,263
Right. I'm sure that

147
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:20,963
you would assume that she would act that way,

148
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:21,963
and so you would try to get a hold of her

149
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:23,563
before she drinks the drug.

150
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:24,763
Then, you'd disguise yourself

151
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:26,363
as what she previously looked to be,

152
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:28,663
pretend that you were killed by us

153
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:31,063
and deceive the eyes of the Organization this way.

154
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,663
Is that what you were planning to do?

155
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:36,563
If she's not hidden here in your room,

156
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:37,763
it seems that

157
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:40,363
you haven't been able to get a hold of her yet.

158
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:42,363
Just what are you talking about?

159
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:45,263
The trunk you threw out of the window a while ago.

160
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,063
You looked inside, didn't you?

161
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:49,763
Did you see any outfits for disguise in there?

162
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,963
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:54,463
I got rid of the contents before I threw the trunk out.

164
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:58,963
I also threw out the disguise outfits that were hidden

165
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:00,663
under this water basin too.

166
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:04,163
Even the bullet proof jacket with the blood trick on it!

167
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:07,063
But, if you haven't found her yet either,

168
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,763
aren't we still even?

169
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:12,063
No problem. Don't worry.

170
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:16,163
We're prepared to smoke her out already.

171
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:29,863
Mr. Ando, please finish up at the police.

172
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:33,563
Hey, what is it? That smoke?

173
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:34,563
Hey, don't tell me...

174
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:36,263
I'll go check.

175
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:40,463
Fire?

176
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,063
It's a fire!

177
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:45,963
Everybody, hurry and evacuate to the car in front!

178
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,763
Pops! Wake up!

179
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,163
Hurry up, grannies!

180
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:52,363
Yes.

181
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:53,663
Emergency!

182
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,263
A fire has broken out in car number 8 of this train!

183
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,363
Passengers in car number 7 and 6,

184
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:02,563
please evacuate to the car in front just in case!

185
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,563
This is car number 6, isn't it?

186
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,663
Yep.

187
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:07,363
We've got to get out of here then.

188
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:09,063
Please calm down everyone!

189
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:11,463
There's no need to hurry.

190
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:21,963
Just as I thought,

191
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:23,263
the passengers of car number 8

192
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:25,463
are all fire phobic.

193
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:28,463
Thanks to them, there's great panic.

194
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:29,963
Sure looks it.

195
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,863
Here's a question for you!

196
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:35,363
Where do you think she'd go in this situation?

197
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:39,263
Well, I'm sure she'll flee to the car in front.

198
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,563
No, just the opposite.

199
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:43,963
She'd probably...

200
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:10,263
Just as would be expected of Hell Angel's daughter.

201
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:12,263
You look alike.

202
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:17,763
How do you do?

203
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:24,563
Bourbon. This is my code name.

204
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,762
Oh, Mr. Mouri!

205
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,262
Dad! Where're Conan and Sera?

206
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:40,362
Huh?

207
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:42,962
I was with that glasses boy till a while ago but...

208
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:43,962
If you're talking about that tomboy,

209
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,662
she left to go over to your place quite some time ago!

210
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:49,262
-Huh? -She didn't come!

211
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:50,462
If so, maybe she went to the wrong car

212
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,162
-and is walking around. -Pops.

213
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,262
Where's Ai?

214
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:55,962
She went that way, right?

215
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,162
Isn't she with Conan?

216
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:00,262
Wasn't she with you guys?

217
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,362
Well, she never came back after going to the bathroom!

218
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:06,562
Then, maybe she fled to a car more in front?

219
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,062
I thought so too and looked for her

220
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:09,662
but couldn't find her.

221
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,162
I tell you, what a brat.

222
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:15,762
Right.

223
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:17,962
I'm sure that she would go over to car number 8

224
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:19,362
where the fire started

225
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,662
because she'd think that this fire commotion

226
00:12:21,662 --> 00:12:24,162
is a trap that we set up to smoke her out.

227
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:26,662
I see! If she flees to the front car,

228
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,462
you'd be waiting for her there

229
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:30,662
so she decided to do otherwise, eh?

230
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:32,862
You don't understand, do you?

231
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:37,262
Her friends will all evacuate to the front car, you know?

232
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:40,462
If she, who's being sought after, goes there,

233
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:42,862
she may get them all involved.

234
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,462
That's why she would deliberately

235
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,662
go to the place where the fire started.

236
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:51,262
Even if we were to be waiting there...

237
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:52,962
She'd figure that it would be better for her

238
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:54,862
to be killed alone.

239
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:00,862
The phone.

240
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:05,862
Shinichi.

241
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,262
Shinichi, what's up?

242
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:11,962
Mom, we're in trouble!

243
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:15,862
Haibara's nowhere in sight.

244
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,962
Isn't she with you, Mom?

245
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:20,362
She's not here either!

246
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:22,962
Maybe she evacuated to the front car?

247
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:24,462
It's easier for her to hide herself

248
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:26,362
by mingling in the crowd besides.

249
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,862
Okay, I'll check the front.

250
00:13:28,862 --> 00:13:31,062
Mom, you stick to the plan!

251
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:32,462
Okay!

252
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:37,662
So, your son will be going to the front car.

253
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:43,962
And this is mail from my comrade.

254
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:45,662
Oh, how disappointing.

255
00:13:45,662 --> 00:13:48,862
They seem to have found her in car number 8.

256
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,462
It looks like our win.

257
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:55,962
Bourbon.

258
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:59,862
This code name, doesn't it sound familiar?

259
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:03,062
I've met your family once.

260
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,862
Yes. I know.

261
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:08,262
You're a member of the Organization

262
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:11,562
that was a rival of Dai Moroboshi, my big sister's boyfriend.

263
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:13,062
According to what she said,

264
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,662
you both seemed to hate each other.

265
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:21,262
Just as I thought, that guy was a dog of the FBI.

266
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:22,762
After betraying the Organization,

267
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:26,462
I found it hard to believe that he was gotten rid of.

268
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:29,462
I disguised myself as him and stuck around

269
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:33,162
to watch the reactions of the people involved.

270
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:38,662
Thanks to that, I found out that the guy was really dead.

271
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,362
Well, the one who helped me disguise myself

272
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:45,462
was the man who disguised himself in my place, though.

273
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:48,562
The fact that you're here,

274
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:52,762
goes to show that it was effective in causing you fear.

275
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:59,462
Then, please raise your hands, and let's move on

276
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:01,362
to the cargo car that is behind

277
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:03,062
car number 8.

278
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:11,862
It's only an hour before the Bell Tree Express arrives!

279
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:15,162
All of you! Be on your guard, understand?

280
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:16,962
How stupid can they get.

281
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:18,962
Not knowing that as soon as the train arrives,

282
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:20,662
they'll all blow up due to the bomb

283
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:23,462
that is set up on the platform.

284
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:26,362
More than that, Vermouth and Bourbon,

285
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:28,962
how are they going to escape from the train?

286
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,062
They know about it, don't they,

287
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,362
about the explosion?

288
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:35,162
I wonder. That's none of my business.

289
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:38,862
But, Vermouth asked me to give her a bomb

290
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:40,162
if I had any extra.

291
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,462
What?

292
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,662
I asked her what she was going to use it for,

293
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:45,962
but she didn't tell me.

294
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:50,562
That woman. Don't tell me she's...

295
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,562
Go on. Open that door and go inside.

296
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:59,562
Don't worry.

297
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:03,562
I plan to take you back to the Organization alive.

298
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,562
I'm going to use this bomb

299
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,762
to damage the connecting part

300
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,962
and cut off only the cargo.

301
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:10,162
As soon as it stops,

302
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:14,062
my comrades are supposed to come and get you.

303
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:19,262
In the meantime, I'll need you to pass out for a while.

304
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,462
Well, everything will be fine.

305
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:25,162
I'll lay you down far from the door,

306
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:27,262
so you don't need to worry about being blown up.

307
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:29,962
I don't think so.

308
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:34,062
It seems that this cargo car is full of bombs.

309
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:38,962
There seems to have been some mistake in your plans, huh?

310
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,462
I see.

311
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:45,462
Vermouth is intent on killing her at all costs.

312
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,262
I've got no choice. I'll have you come with me.

313
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:51,462
I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

314
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:55,662
You're a bunch of trouble just as rumor has it.

315
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:59,062
I guess I'll have to get a bit rough with you.

316
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,562
Vermouth?

317
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,562
Sorry, but I'm taking her with me.

318
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,862
A hand grenade!

319
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:13,762
Who is it? Who are you?

320
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,962
Darn!

321
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,062
"Activation Device Launched, Comfirmed"

322
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:36,762
So, that's the end.

323
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:39,062
No joke, this isn't happening, is it?

324
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:42,062
Rest assured. Our members caused the explosion

325
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,462
after they confirmed that the connecting part was damaged.

326
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:48,162
This car will not go off track.

327
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:49,162
Ai.

328
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:55,962
Ai!

329
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:02,462
You got rid of Sherry?

330
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:04,962
Are you sure, Vermouth?

331
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:07,662
Yes. It seems that

332
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,062
Bourbon watched the cargo car blow up.

333
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:13,162
Thanks to that, the train is stopped at a nearby station.

334
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:14,562
It seems that all the passengers

335
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:16,562
will be interrogated, though.

336
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,862
How disappointing that

337
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:21,362
I won't get to see you in Nagoya where you're waiting.

338
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:23,462
That's why you wanted the bomb.

339
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:25,662
If an explosion occurs on board,

340
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:27,862
there's no choice but to stop the train.

341
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:29,462
Yes.

342
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:33,562
It's enough that only Sherry is blown to pieces, isn't it?

343
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,862
But, I was really surprised!

344
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:38,962
To find that Haibara was in room B of car 7.

345
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:40,662
It seems to have been opened

346
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,662
because it was the room where the man died.

347
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:43,662
It seems she felt faint

348
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:47,062
after going to the restroom and rested there!

349
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:50,962
Quiet. Because she seems to be tired and asleep.

350
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,562
Okay.

351
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:54,662
I see.

352
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:55,762
Thinking that if she were to flee anywhere,

353
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:59,962
it would be the only place, so Yukiko protected her.

354
00:18:59,962 --> 00:19:03,062
Then, that call that her son made back then was...

355
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:07,562
A fake call to keep me in that room.

356
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:08,762
But, wait.

357
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:10,462
If so, who is it?

358
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:14,062
The girl that exploded to death in front of Bourbon's eyes?

359
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:15,062
Don't tell me

360
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:17,762
they really have somebody else cooperating with them.

361
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:45,162
But, wait.

362
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,762
If so, who is it?

363
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:50,362
The girl that exploded to death in front of Bourbon's eyes?

364
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:51,362
Don't tell me

365
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:54,862
they really have somebody else cooperating with them.

366
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:59,062
I'm disappointed. So, Thief Kid can't come here anymore.

367
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:00,562
This train won't be usable for a while

368
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:02,762
until their done investigating it so...

369
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,962
-Don't tell me that... -Sorry.

370
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:08,162
It seems like things were looking really bad, huh.

371
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:10,862
Don't tell me that the one helping them out is...

372
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:14,462
Nobody told me about this!

373
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:16,962
What's this all about? Who were those dangerous guys?

374
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:19,662
If I didn't have my hand glider hidden in the cargo car,

375
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,562
I would've been burnt black by now!

376
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:24,862
Knowing you, I figured you'd have that ready.

377
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:27,562
Well, I guess we both owe each other nothing anymore.

378
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:29,162
Of course not!

379
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,962
Oh, that cell phone.

380
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:33,562
Send it back to the Detective Agency, will you?

381
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,962
Oh, hey?

382
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,262
That rotten brat.

383
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:43,262
You grannies are Thief Kid and his henchmen, right?

384
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:45,762
What kind of joke is that supposed to be?

385
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,862
The maid Ms. Sumitomo is Thief Kid,

386
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:49,262
and you granny, is his henchman!

387
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:53,162
It seems that the henchman cannot speak in Ms. Komino's voice.

388
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:57,262
You moved your lips along as Kid acted as the ventriloquist

389
00:21:57,262 --> 00:22:01,162
and you tried to block the vision using the veil of your hat.

390
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:05,462
I see. That's why you made me run along the corridor, eh?

391
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:06,862
Yeah!

392
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:08,762
I thought that if granny was left back alone,

393
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,162
she wouldn't be able to talk!

394
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:12,962
Besides, all the people

395
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:14,262
who were rescued from the fire in question,

396
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:16,062
were afraid of the flames,

397
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:20,362
but you didn't seem concerned and lighted your pipe.

398
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:22,562
Well, show me gratitude!

399
00:22:22,562 --> 00:22:24,362
Because I'm letting all of you guys

400
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:26,162
who don't want to get involved

401
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,662
and insist on having seen nothing go.

402
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:31,862
And? What do you want me to do for you?

403
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:33,662
I want you to disguise as her

404
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:37,662
and dodge their attack.

405
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:39,562
As to the contents that you'll be talking with them about,

406
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:43,362
she'll be using an earphone to tell you what to say.

407
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,862
What do you mean we're even?

408
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:49,762
You owe me one, famed detective.

409
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:54,662
I see.

410
00:22:54,662 --> 00:23:00,062
So it was top-notch casting, Yukiko.

411
00:23:02,962 --> 00:23:04,662
Sera!

412
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:06,062
I'm glad.

413
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:10,062
I picked a cap up in the corridor, it's yours, isn't it?

414
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:12,562
Oh, yep. Thank you.

415
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:16,562
Why was it in the corridor?

416
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,462
Everybody's over that way, so let's go!

417
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:20,362
Oh, okay.

418
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:25,762
Will you show me the detailed file of

419
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:27,562
just before Akai's death once again?

420
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:28,962
Yes.

421
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:31,362
It seems necessary

422
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:34,862
to start investigating again from scratch.

423
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:44,762
Don't open the door!

424
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:53,362
Oh, so Mr. Mouri are here too!

425
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:56,062
The corpse was lying on the ground blocking the door,

426
00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:58,862
and yet was is it a homicide?

427
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:01,762
That's what Conan said, and he was inside.

428
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,862
Moreover, this is an impossible crime.

429
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:07,662
Another locked room murder?

430
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:13,262
Next Conan, "Conan in a Locked Room"

431
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:30,762
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,162
"Special Coach"

433
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:34,562
Sonoko, are you going through special intensive training?

434
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:36,462
You've got to be strong in love and tennis too.

435
00:24:36,462 --> 00:24:37,962
Love's different.
