1
00:00:00,484 --> 00:00:03,784
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:06,384
What a slow day.

3
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:09,592
I wish an incident or something would occur

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,092
even from now.

5
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:13,892
Dad, what a thing to say, it's not nice.

6
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:16,792
Maybe I'll go get myself a drink.

7
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:19,692
But, it doesn't look like it's going to stop raining.

8
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:25,592
It's Officer Chiba.

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,092
It's come!

10
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,592
A case.

11
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,992
Mr. Mouri, please take over.

12
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:33,392
Welcome.

13
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:35,492
Please find her right away.

14
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:39,192
We've got to hurry or her life may be in danger!

15
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,792
If all cases were men,

16
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,592
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

17
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:05,392
There is a request from Officer Chiba to Pops.

18
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:07,492
A strange occurrence on a certain rainy night.

19
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:09,092
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:10,992
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:13,092
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:42,426
"Rainy Night Blackmailer"

23
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:44,126
The fact is,

24
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:48,126
I have a woman that I see a lot at the coffee shop I frequent.

25
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,326
I got a call from her just a while ago asking for advice.

26
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:54,226
She says she feels that her life is in danger.

27
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:57,826
"I'll go see you after I get out of prison".

28
00:02:57,826 --> 00:03:00,626
She says she receiving these types of letter several times a year.

29
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:01,826
Yes.

30
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:04,226
I'm so scared.

31
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,626
I changed my job and moved house too.

32
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:09,226
"Mio Ashida (23)" -But, recently I've been having this feeling

33
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:11,926
of being watched by someone.

34
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,626
I may just be imagining things but...

35
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,426
For the moment,

36
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:19,326
I told her to let me know immediately

37
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:23,926
if she sees the person or come up with any details.

38
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:25,026
But...

39
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:33,726
She left while I stood up to go the restroom.

40
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:39,626
She suddenly paid for the tab and left.

41
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:42,126
As if she were afraid of something.

42
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:43,126
Oh, no.

43
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:46,826
This is her umbrella.

44
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,626
She mistook hers for mine.

45
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:06,526
It felt more like intent to kill more than ill-doing.

46
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:10,226
Maybe the driver mistook me for her.

47
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,026
How careless of me.

48
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:15,826
I haven't asked her for her address yet.

49
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:18,326
I was thinking of talking this over with the Inspector too,

50
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,426
but I've got no concrete proof.

51
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,326
So I came here.

52
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:25,126
I don't really know if you can call this a case.

53
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,326
Besides, if you don't even know who she is,

54
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:29,226
how do you expect me to find her?

55
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:32,626
But, if you started seeing her a lot recently,

56
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:36,826
doesn't that mean she moved to somewhere near that coffee shop?

57
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:38,026
I see!

58
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,926
Then maybe it may be good to start looking for her,

59
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:43,126
expanding the range by first searching from where the coffee shop is.

60
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:44,626
I guess so.

61
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:48,826
Hey, hey. I don't have any intention of taking on this request...

62
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:57,226
Okay, I'll go, I'll go.

63
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:14,626
This criminal kind of pisses me off.

64
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,826
-Student who failed entrance exam... -Darn, the noise...

65
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,626
"Takuya Murakami" -The guys upstairs.

66
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:24,026
Don't! Somebody help me!

67
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,626
I was wondering if any incident happened?

68
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:30,726
What?

69
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,626
What seems to be the matter, Officer Chiba?

70
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,826
Yes, yes, I understand.

71
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,426
It seems that a young woman

72
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:40,726
became involved in a murder case in an apartment near here.

73
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:48,426
That car's from before.

74
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:49,426
What?

75
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:52,026
Too late?

76
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:54,026
Hey, wait, Chiba!

77
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:55,126
Move it!

78
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:59,926
-Chiba. -I thought it was your day off today.

79
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,426
She was killed, wasn't she?

80
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:09,526
Who is this man?

81
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:13,926
That cap and sunglasses.

82
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:17,926
From that time.

83
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:20,326
Mio?

84
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:26,126
She's not the victim?

85
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,726
She's the assaulter.

86
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,526
Inspector.

87
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:33,326
Mr. Mouri, what brings you here?

88
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,026
About that...

89
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:37,626
I see.

90
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,626
That's why you were looking for her?

91
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:41,626
Yes.

92
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:44,926
The car in the vacant lot was a stolen car after all.

93
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:46,026
I see.

94
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,426
What on earth happened?

95
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:52,426
Officer Takagi, explain the outline of the case for me, will you?

96
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:53,626
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:58,326
The incident occurred 40 minutes ago, at 9:30 pm.

98
00:06:58,326 --> 00:07:02,126
Mr. Takuya Murakami, a student living right below the room,

99
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:06,026
hears a noise and scream and comes to check out his room,

100
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:10,326
where he finds the dead body and Mio Ashida standing next to it.

101
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:13,326
He then contacts the police using his cell phone.

102
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:14,326
At the time of discovery,

103
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:18,226
it seems that the entrance door was not locked.

104
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:21,426
The victim is Mr. Yoshizumi Karashima, age 28.

105
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:26,026
I confirmed that he got out of the prison for traffic offenders.

106
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,826
Prison for traffic offenders?

107
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:30,326
Was he imprisoned for a traffic accident?

108
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:31,326
That's right.

109
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,126
A year ago, a car went out of control

110
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:34,626
because the driver drove under the influence of alcohol.

111
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:37,926
The car crashes right through the guardrail and fell into the lake.

112
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,026
Out of the two who were thrown out of the window,

113
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:44,726
one died and one suffered only slight injury.

114
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:46,726
The driver who was charged for negligent driving

115
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:48,226
resulting in injury and death

116
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:51,026
was not indicted on terms of death of suspect.

117
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,626
The person that was riding in the same vehicle was charged

118
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:55,526
under the road traffic law for aiding and abetting drunk driving,

119
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:58,026
and served a 1 year sentence in prison.

120
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:01,426
That happened to be the victim of this incident, Mr. Karashima.

121
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:02,626
That's a lie!

122
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:09,026
My big brother, after being arrested for drunk driving in the past,

123
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:11,126
promised never to drive again.

124
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:12,526
Big brother?

125
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:16,026
Karashima was the one who was driving.

126
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,026
Mio.

127
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:20,126
The person who was driving and died

128
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,326
happened to be her older brother,

129
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:25,026
Mr. Toshiaki Ashida, age 28 back then.

130
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:28,126
I submitted a formal objection to Karashima's testimony

131
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:30,926
that my older brother was at the wheels at that time,

132
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:32,726
not being able to believe him.

133
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:36,626
But it was dismissed. And, yet...

134
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,826
A year in prison?

135
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,626
You must be joking.

136
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:43,726
It's because you guys submitted a objection!

137
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,426
You'll pay for this!

138
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:47,126
I won't let you get away with this!

139
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:51,326
It's a total spiteful counterattack!

140
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:54,326
Because he was sure he'd be getting a suspended sentence.

141
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,226
Mio, please give me your letters.

142
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:57,926
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:57,926 --> 00:09:00,926
Are those letters that he wrote while he was in prison?

144
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:02,626
Each and every one of them mention

145
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,926
that he'll come to see her when he gets out.

146
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:07,726
Although it's not written all that clearly,

147
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,226
this is obviously blackmail.

148
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:11,026
It seems to be so.

149
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:14,026
It's true that it looks to be so, but...

150
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:17,526
"I'd like you to not forget me and wait for me..."

151
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:18,826
What could this mean?

152
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,426
Why is the date on this almost 6 months apart?

153
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:27,326
Maybe the rage that he once felt subsided for a while,

154
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:29,826
but with the coming of the end of his sentence,

155
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:31,026
his rage must've built up again?

156
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:34,726
Hey, keep out of this kid!

157
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,826
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,426
Mio, afraid that Karashima was soon coming out,

159
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:44,026
you changed jobs and moved to this apartment, right?

160
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:45,126
Yes.

161
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,326
I see.

162
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,326
You just moved, that's why you furniture

163
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,826
and electrical appliances are still new?

164
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:53,226
There are ones that you haven't used at all yet.

165
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,326
Come to think of it, that's true.

166
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,926
There are price tags on them too.

167
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:00,726
That's because all I did was come home and sleep.

168
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,526
At any rate, I was scared.

169
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,826
I would think so. I understand.

170
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:08,326
But, it doesn't look as if she's lived here at all.

171
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:13,526
The TV was being watched

172
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:16,626
although the remote controller didn't look to have been used.

173
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,726
I don't know how or where he found out,

174
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:23,526
but when you got home the lock was forced open.

175
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:24,826
When I came home,

176
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:27,626
the room light was on,

177
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,726
and they door was unlocked.

178
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:33,226
But, I didn't think I was being ambushed,

179
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:35,126
and when I opened the door, I was suddenly...

180
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:43,926
Ashida fought back with the umbrella she had.

181
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:46,526
They struggled and moved on to the living room.

182
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:56,726
The fatal wound was the blow to his head.

183
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,826
He also has a wound on his nose.

184
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:06,126
Maybe he hit it while struggling with her.

185
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,126
See.

186
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,926
The corner of the TV stand.

187
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:12,926
It seems definite that he bumped into this.

188
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:14,226
But...

189
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:17,726
It is very likely that this case is manslaughter in self-defense.

190
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,726
Not knowing that she had mistakenly taken my umbrella,

191
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:24,826
he could've also tried to hit-and-run me.

192
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:29,926
This is...

193
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,626
The victim's shoes.

194
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:38,126
Ran, what time did it start raining from?

195
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:39,126
I wonder...

196
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:42,526
It started at night, so maybe it was around 7:00 pm?

197
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:44,126
Which means...

198
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:51,026
Then, I guess we'll be on our way.

199
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:53,726
I'll get the details from you at the station.

200
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,026
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:56,326
Don't worry.

202
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:58,126
I'll back you up.

203
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:00,026
No need to worry.

204
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:02,626
Thank you very much.

205
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:04,926
Like I've been saying...

206
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:07,026
And like I told the detective too,

207
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,926
the sound of the TV was on all the while.

208
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:12,026
And, by the way, who are you?

209
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:15,326
I was asked by the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri,

210
00:12:15,326 --> 00:12:16,726
who's upstairs now.

211
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:20,526
And, since when did you hear the sound of the TV from?

212
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,626
From around 6:00 pm.

213
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:26,226
But, it switched off about 9:30 pm, and that's when I heard the scream.

214
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:28,326
Although this place looks pretty fancy on first glance,

215
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:30,126
but it's a cheap apartment,

216
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,126
so sound proofing is the pits.

217
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,826
Did you hear any other sound beside that of the TV?

218
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:37,526
Come to think of it...

219
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:39,226
Darn, the noise...

220
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,626
The guy upstairs.

221
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,726
Don't!

222
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,226
I see.

223
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:48,626
Which means...

224
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,026
Just as I thought.

225
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:02,726
Then, the truth of this case is...

226
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,310
Go ahead.

227
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:09,568
Okay, I guess I'll go home and drink some beer...

228
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:10,968
What's that?

229
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,568
It... it's come again, Mr. Mouri.

230
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:17,868
Dad?

231
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:20,768
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that...

232
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,168
Officer Takagi,

233
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,368
I want you to check on something immediately.

234
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,768
Yes.

235
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:27,168
Inspector.

236
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,268
We have reached a conclusion yet.

237
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,968
Yes. Yes.

238
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:38,368
About when was this?

239
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,568
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

240
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:45,068
Inspector, this is not manslaughter in self defense

241
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:47,568
but undoubtedly a schemed homicide.

242
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,168
Schemed homicide?

243
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,768
Oh, no. That's ridiculous.

244
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,968
Let me explain.

245
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:56,368
Please look at the umbrella stand at the front entrance.

246
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,468
There should be rain water inside it.

247
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:01,268
True.

248
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:03,268
The umbrellas that we brought,

249
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:06,768
are left outside in order to preserve the site.

250
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:10,568
If so, there should only be one umbrella in this room.

251
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:12,568
Yes, the umbrella that she had brought home

252
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,668
from the coffee shop by mistake.

253
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:16,668
Officer Chiba's umbrella.

254
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:19,568
It's true but if so then what?

255
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,868
That means, the umbrella in the umbrella stand

256
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:23,468
should also be that umbrella.

257
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:24,968
If so,

258
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:27,568
her testimony that she was suddenly attacked

259
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:29,468
by the victim who forced opened the door

260
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,968
and broke into her room is inconsistent.

261
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:33,468
True.

262
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:34,668
She wouldn't have had the time

263
00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:36,968
to put her umbrella into the umbrella stand.

264
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:39,568
There is still another inconsistency.

265
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:41,368
Despite the victim parking his car in the vacant lot

266
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,568
and coming over here,

267
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:46,168
his clothes are not wet at all.

268
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,268
It was because he used an umbrella.

269
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:50,968
But just a while ago, you said there were no other umbrellas.

270
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,068
In other words,

271
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:55,368
the victim came into this room

272
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:58,868
before it began to rain, which was about 7:00 pm.

273
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:00,168
Ridiculous.

274
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:03,768
I was almost hit-and-run only about 1 hour ago.

275
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:06,068
Right. The shoes.

276
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:08,768
Weren't the victim's shoes wet?

277
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:11,068
It's true that his shoes are wet.

278
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:12,568
However,

279
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:16,868
why aren't the socks and pants of the victim wet?

280
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:18,668
Well...

281
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,468
However, inside the possessions of the victim,

282
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:24,968
the cap and the sunglasses that the driver of the car was wearing were.

283
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:28,968
How can you conclusively say that they were the belongings of the victim?

284
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:32,568
There is another inconsistency.

285
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:35,868
The position of the seat of that car.

286
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,568
I had Conan confirm just a while ago,

287
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,368
that the position of the seat was a bit too close

288
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:41,968
to the steering wheel

289
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:44,868
for a big guy like the victim to be driving it.

290
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:48,068
Although everything till now is circumstantial evidence,

291
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:51,868
there is only one conclusion that we will arrive to...

292
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,268
That this case is not a case of self-defense,

293
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:57,668
but schemed homicide committed by Mio.

294
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:02,468
Mio.

295
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:07,668
Everything was schemed by Mio to begin with.

296
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,368
Let me explain it to you in order.

297
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:15,068
After placing a trace of the door having been picked,

298
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:17,568
Mio called Mr. Karashima by phone.

299
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:21,668
She tells him to wait for her inside because the door is unlocked.

300
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,368
Next she shows Officer Chiba

301
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,868
the letters she had received from Mr. Karashima.

302
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,468
And, shows him that she is afraid

303
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:29,568
because she is being threatened.

304
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:33,068
Then she deliberately takes Officer Chiba's umbrella and leaves the shop.

305
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:36,368
When Officer Chiba goes after her, she attacks him using her car,

306
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,968
in an attempt to leave an impression on him

307
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:40,268
that someone is coming after her life.

308
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:42,268
In the meantime,

309
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,368
Mr. Karashima who gets to her room before it begins to rain,

310
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:49,168
and waits for her return watches TV.

311
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:50,868
And since he couldn't use the remote controller,

312
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:52,868
he manually turned the TV on.

313
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:56,268
Mio returns home at 9:30 pm.

314
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:59,168
Mr. Karashima turns off the TV he had been watching.

315
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:02,268
He kneels down and manually turns off the TV.

316
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:05,368
He is attacked from behind with a vase,

317
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:08,468
lurches forward and hits his nose on the TV stand

318
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:14,468
Mr. Murakami who lives on the first floor heard this noise.

319
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,268
After that Mio,

320
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:19,768
made Mr. Karashima's hand grab the knife,

321
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:23,968
then left the cap and sunglasses she used when she attacked Officer Chiba,

322
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:26,068
back in the room.

323
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:28,568
What about the scream that Mr. Murakami heard?

324
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:31,868
Of course Mio acted it out on her own.

325
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,868
This terrible sound proofing

326
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:36,868
is probably the very reason why she moved into this apartment.

327
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,668
However, all the other sounds

328
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:40,768
while the murder was being committed were heard too.

329
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,368
All of what you're saying is based on assumption, Mr. Mouri.

330
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:47,868
But, it is a fact that the victim was threatening Mio.

331
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:50,468
The vicious remarks in court and letters are proof of this.

332
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:52,368
Is it really so?

333
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:56,468
It's true what happened in court.

334
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,668
But, how about the letters?

335
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:01,168
In the letters that stopped coming for a while

336
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:03,668
and then started to come again, especially, his remark,

337
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:07,168
"I'll go see you after I get out of prison", and...

338
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:11,168
"I want to tell you the truth, so I'd like to see you,"

339
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:13,568
keeps coming out repeatedly.

340
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:16,468
Maybe he was planning to confess

341
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:19,068
that during the accident that happened a year ago,

342
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:22,068
"I was the one who was actually driving".

343
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,868
It... it can't be.

344
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:26,168
It's not easy to believe.

345
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:31,168
Then, why didn't he confess that it was so to the police or in court?

346
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:34,268
Maybe he thought he didn't have time?

347
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:36,668
Officer Takagi, where were you?

348
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:39,768
I had him go to the traffic violations prison to check out

349
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:43,068
why his letters stopped coming for a while because that bothered me.

350
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,568
A while before his letters stopped,

351
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:48,368
Mr. Karashima was found to have a serious disease

352
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:51,268
after undergoing a medical examination within prison.

353
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:54,168
He was given six more months to live.

354
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,368
What?

355
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,368
However, he didn't show up at the hospital

356
00:18:57,368 --> 00:19:02,068
he was told to go to after getting out either.

357
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:05,868
I think that he was probably looking for you

358
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:08,668
who quit your job and moved, Mio.

359
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:11,768
Which means he really meant to confess what he did?

360
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:13,668
That's a lie! I can't believe that!

361
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:16,668
Even if it were to be so, I would never forgive him.

362
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:20,068
No matter who forgives him, I would never!

363
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:21,468
Mio.

364
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:23,468
My big brother died in that manner

365
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,968
and my engagement was cancelled.

366
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:28,568
My father had no choice but to quit his job,

367
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,168
got depressed, fell ill and died.

368
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:34,768
My mother died soon after as if to go after him.

369
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:37,568
Nobody helped us.

370
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:40,568
Nobody believed my big brother's innocence.

371
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:41,968
That's why...

372
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,168
You took revenge, didn't you?

373
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:46,468
Yes, exactly.

374
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,168
Don't tell me that you're going to admit to your crime.

375
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:52,468
Yes. I hate to go over your head, Mr. famous detective,

376
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:54,768
who could only gather circumstantial evidence till now,

377
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:57,968
but I have no regrets.

378
00:19:57,968 --> 00:20:00,368
No regrets what so ever!

379
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:01,768
Mio.

380
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,568
Then, I shall tell you not the circumstantial evidence

381
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:08,168
but the truth that I have come to...

382
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:11,868
If you learn of this truth,

383
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:15,468
you will realize that you have done is totally meaningless.

384
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:17,968
Rather, although there is no murder

385
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,168
that has any meaning in this world.

386
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,868
Just what do you mean?

387
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:25,068
Instead of me explaining it, let me re-enact it. Conan!

388
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:26,368
Yes.

389
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:28,968
You act as Mr. Karashima,

390
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:31,668
and you act out her, Officer Chiba.

391
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:34,068
Inspector Megure, will you turn on the TV?

392
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,968
Well Pitcher Maeda was fantastic today, wasn't he?

393
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,168
Then, Officer Chiba,

394
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:41,568
please fling up the murder weapon.

395
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:42,668
Like this?

396
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:46,368
Mio, please stay as you are, and turn off the TV.

397
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:52,368
This is...

398
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,168
Mr. Karashima saw you,

399
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:57,568
but he didn't try to avoid you.

400
00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:06,968
The only possible deduction

401
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:09,668
is that he knowingly fell into your vicious plans to kill him.

402
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:11,768
Right.

403
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:13,868
He was actually full of regret

404
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,968
from the bottom of his heart.

405
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:17,768
Even after hearing this,

406
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:20,568
do you still really not have any regrets?

407
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,068
There's no doubt that through this incident,

408
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:48,768
there will be a reconsideration of the accident that occur a year ago.

409
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:52,068
However, the life that was taken will not come back,

410
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:54,668
nor will the crime that was committed be erased.

411
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,168
I couldn't do anything after all.

412
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:02,568
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:04,568
Don't get conceited.

414
00:23:04,568 --> 00:23:08,268
I just took advantage of you

415
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:10,968
because the police doing nothing for me a year ago.

416
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:16,568
But, if I found you earlier and changed the umbrella,

417
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:17,968
it's highly likely

418
00:23:17,968 --> 00:23:20,868
that you wouldn't have committed the crime at least tonight.

419
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:26,568
Either way, I don't deserve protection under your umbrella.

420
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:27,568
Mio.

421
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:30,568
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:33,268
Thank you.

423
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:39,468
This time it's her turn to compensate.

424
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:42,968
But, I'm sure that Officer Chiba's feelings got through to her.

425
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,568
Yeah, I'm sure.
