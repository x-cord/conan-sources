1
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:08,867
Happy New Year, everybody!

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,619
Detective Conan enters the eighth year.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,319
And we have broadcast more than 3,000 times.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,119
We will do our best in...

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
TV's,

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
movies,

7
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,919
magazines and books.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,120
So, be sure to stay with us, folks!

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Evacuation of residents in a three-block radius has been completed.

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,420
Defusal at Location One is now in progress.

11
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,220
Defusal at Location One has been completed.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,519
The helmet is equipped with a duct for cooling

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,319
for respiration that alternates as the mist remover for the lens.

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,620
And we are heading to Location Two with Officer Matsuda with us.

15
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,119
To protect against the hot air of explosion,

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,419
the structure of the protective gear does not allow any openings.

17
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,919
The pockets all over the wear have metal protective plates in them.

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,620
The gear is so complex that you cannot put it on by yourself.

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,119
It weighs 40 kilogra m.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
In the protective gear, it's a sauna even in cold winter.

21
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,019
You can't keep wearing it for more than five minutes.

22
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,720
I'd say it's impossible.

23
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,119
All police units, all police units.

24
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,619
Disperse from area 1.

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,620
Proceed to secure area 2...

26
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,619
All units in city limits,

27
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,819
watch out for suspicious vehicles.

28
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,519
That is all.

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,919
DC unit 80, roger that.

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,820
AV unit, roger that.

31
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,719
Keep cool and collected.

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,919
No baggage, please. Evacuate quickly and quietly.

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,019
Please be careful not to push others.

34
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,220
There is no need to rush.

35
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,220
Evacuation of the residents of this building is completed.

36
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,819
Roger.

37
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,319
"Kenji Hagiwara" -Well, let's start...

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
working on it.

39
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,320
"Jimpei Matsuda, MPD Riot Squad Bomb Disposal Unit."

40
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,219
You've done a good job, Matsuda.

41
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,919
How's Hagiwara?

42
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,919
Well, analysis shows a photosensitive trigger.

43
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,519
A white cord from a mercury tilt switch.

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,619
From the LCD panel...

45
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,819
Matsuda. What's up?

46
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,619
Hagiwara! What's taking you so long?

47
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,719
Go, tear it apart fast.

48
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,619
You're too loud, man.

49
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,819
You're making my fingers shake.

50
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,519
Have you finished already?

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,819
Yeah.

52
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,219
I opened it and found out it's rather simple clockwork.

53
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,419
It's so simple.

54
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,520
Three minutes was long enough?

55
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,419
How about yours?

56
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,620
Takes more than 3 minutes for sure.

57
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,720
It looks simple, but there're so many traps around it.

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,119
I suppose this is the real one.

59
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,719
Right.

60
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,520
By the way, you're in protective gear, aren't you?

61
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,619
In that hot torturing thing? No way.

62
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,520
Moron! You want to get killed, man?

63
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,619
Well, you can get the guy for me.

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,119
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

65
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,219
Can't take a joke?

66
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,719
I'm not a klutz.

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,519
Anyway, finish ASAP and get on back here.

68
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,419
I'll buy you a drink tonight.

69
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,919
Lucky me!

70
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,519
You lured me into full throttle.

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
I'm gonna work at full speed.

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,419
What's that?

73
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,020
What's up, Hagiwara?

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,919
Run, everybody!

75
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,419
Get out of here!

76
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,920
The timer started counting again!

77
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,319
Hagiwara?

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,620
Hey! Hagiwara!

79
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,220
Hagiwara...

80
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,820
Hagiwara!

81
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,019
Why? How did you find out?

82
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,319
I asked that boy wearing glasses.

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,419
So, that's why.

84
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,219
By the way, Shinichi,

85
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,719
what're you going to do about the all-country sim-test?

86
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,020
All-country sim-test?

87
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,119
You can't make it, can you?

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,320
I'll bet you're going to say you're tied up with a new case or something.

89
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,719
Wait! What's this?

90
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,319
"I have stolen your sleeping face." -How did you do that?

91
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,819
Gotcha!

92
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,520
Gosh.

93
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,968
Dad, Conan!

94
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:33,167
Don't be late. Breakfast is ready!

95
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,767
Dad.

96
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:38,567
What's all the commotion about from so early in the morning?

97
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,367
It's noon already.

98
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:41,368
I'm going to prepare for tomorrow test.

99
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:44,467
Sonoko and I are going to work on it today.

100
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:46,567
Will you finish up quickly?

101
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,167
That's your problem, not mine.

102
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:54,067
You're taking your report to a client, aren't you?

103
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,767
And, Conan, you promised Ayumi and the others

104
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,668
that you'll go to Haido Shopping Mall with them.

105
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:01,467
Yeah.

106
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,867
Haido Shopping Mall?

107
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:07,567
Oh, the mall with that huge Ferris Wheel.

108
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:08,968
Yeah.

109
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:13,667
January 6th, Monday.

110
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,667
The Winter holidays were almost over.

111
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,567
That first day started very peacefully

112
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:20,768
but the following two days were turned out to be a nightmare.

113
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:28,068
"Unsettled Metropolitan Police Department, 12 million hostages."

114
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:39,868
Sato, what do you think of this disguise of mine?

115
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:42,168
It's cool, isn't it?

116
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:44,967
Sato?

117
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,668
What's the matter with you? Anything wrong?

118
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,968
Sato?

119
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:59,267
Miwako?

120
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:01,167
Hey, Miwako.

121
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,768
Miwako!

122
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:07,668
Yumi.

123
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:10,667
What's the matter with you? In a coma or something?

124
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:12,067
I'm all right.

125
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:13,868
Just a little tired, I guess.

126
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,767
I'm going out for a while.

127
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:21,567
I thought you said you were going to do paperwork all day today.

128
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:23,368
I just remembered something. I have to go out, and take a look.

129
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:27,967
Don't forget the karaoke tonight.

130
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:30,567
Oh, yeah. What time was it?

131
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,167
Nine o'clock.

132
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:34,867
I sent mail to your cell. You can look at it.

133
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,168
Huh?

134
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:40,067
Well...

135
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:42,167
Sorry. I've deleted it already.

136
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:45,067
Gosh. Stop deleting mails right after you finish reading them.

137
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:46,367
That's one of your bad habits.

138
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:51,567
If I don't delete them, I'll soon get a mailbox full of junk mails

139
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,767
and lose track of important mails.

140
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:58,167
So, you mean mine is not important.

141
00:10:58,168 --> 00:10:59,767
That's not what I meant.

142
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:00,967
You better not.

143
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,067
Okay. Nine o'clock.

144
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:04,467
Don't be late!

145
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:05,868
Roger and out.

146
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,268
Mail that you can't delete...

147
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:22,368
"Haido Shopping Mall."

148
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:25,168
It's so high!

149
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:29,167
Really. Great!

150
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:33,067
This Ferris Wheel is 125 meter high.

151
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,168
It's the highest in Japan.

152
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,967
It takes 18 minutes to make one round.

153
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:41,368
I could make six cups of ramen!

154
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,667
The diameter of the circle is 105 meters

155
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:47,667
and it takes 18 minutes to go once around.

156
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,467
That means the speed of this car

157
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:52,767
is about 30 centimeters per second.

158
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:57,267
Come on. Can't you think of anything else?

159
00:11:57,268 --> 00:12:02,568
Oh? Such as the power necessary to make one round?

160
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:05,068
Cut it out.

161
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,668
It's been three years now.

162
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:24,067
Everybody. Let me introduce...

163
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:26,267
Mr. Jimpei Matsuda.

164
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:29,667
He will start working with us as of today

165
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:31,967
in the Criminal Investigation Section.

166
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:35,567
He has been in the Security Department, Special Task Force,

167
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,467
and I'd say that he is a bit of a stranger here.

168
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:40,067
We can do without that kind of introduction, Inspector.

169
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:43,467
I'm not exactly a new kid from the country.

170
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:45,367
And I don't think this show and tell about me

171
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:47,767
would be of any use to anybody.

172
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,567
I was stationed where I don't want to be

173
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,468
and I'm upset about it.

174
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:58,167
Well then, Officer Sato!

175
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:00,567
You help him out and...

176
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:02,567
Me, sir?

177
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:04,767
Don't shy away!

178
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,567
He is here for certain reasons,

179
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:09,467
and they asked me in person to play along.

180
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,567
Will you take care of him?

181
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:12,968
Yes, sir.

182
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:23,367
Hey, what kind of questioning was that supposed to be?

183
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,567
Questioning people like a mobster like that,

184
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:27,867
nobody will answer you.

185
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:31,267
Gosh. You have been with us for 6 days now.

186
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,867
Why don't you listen to me and do as I say?

187
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,167
Oh, you got mail?

188
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:37,767
You're pretty fast.

189
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:39,267
Yeah.

190
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:42,467
I just happen to be clever with my fingers.

191
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:44,867
Are you mailing your girlfriend?

192
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:48,067
No. I'm sending my best friend mail,

193
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:51,867
though I know he's not going to write back to me

194
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:54,667
because he blew up 4 years ago.

195
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:55,968
What?

196
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:03,067
Pass? Pass what? Are you crazy?

197
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:06,967
I have to wait here today.

198
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,667
I'm sure you guys can bring the old suspect

199
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:12,167
from the local police up here without me.

200
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:13,767
Now, you listen to me.

201
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,567
I am.

202
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:19,167
You said you receive it on January 6th every year. Today is the day.

203
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:24,567
Yes. Every year for three years,

204
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:29,467
you mean the fax with just one large number on it, right?

205
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,167
Number 3 was written on it three years ago;

206
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,667
number 2, two years ago,

207
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,268
and number 1, a year ago.

208
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,667
I'm sure

209
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,367
it's the time bomb count down.

210
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:43,168
If the guy's making any moves, today is the day.

211
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:47,867
Inspector! We got one this year, too.

212
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:51,267
That fax with a number on it, you mean.

213
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:54,467
And? What is the number this time?

214
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:57,768
It's not a number this time.

215
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:01,167
"I am a knight of the round table.

216
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,367
Let the foolish, cunning police know that

217
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,367
today at noon, at the 14th hour,

218
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:07,667
we will bury the head our fellow knight,

219
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:10,567
and in his memory, we will set off fireworks.

220
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:13,167
If you want to stop it, come to us.

221
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:16,268
We prepared the 72nd seat for you and we are ready."

222
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:18,967
What does it mean?

223
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:20,168
I don't know.

224
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:26,267
Hey! Just where do you think you're going?

225
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:28,267
Where else?

226
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:33,467
The knight of the round table says there are 72 seats.

227
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:36,667
If it's round and has 72 seats,

228
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:39,867
it's the big Ferris Wheel...

229
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:42,267
in the Haido Shopping Mall.

230
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:43,968
Please, go ahead.

231
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:57,467
Gosh! We are too late.

232
00:15:57,468 --> 00:16:00,968
But it's 30 minutes to noon.

233
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:04,667
Police. What happened?

234
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:08,067
The control room of the Ferris Wheel suddenly blew up.

235
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,367
We can't stop the wheel.

236
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:12,667
We'd like to get the people out of cars, but...

237
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:15,967
Where is the 72nd car right now?

238
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:17,567
What?

239
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:20,168
It's coming down soon.

240
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,568
-Matsuda! -Stop right there!

241
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:31,167
The knight was not waiting for us,

242
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:34,568
but there's something beneath the seat.

243
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:37,467
You don't say... a bomb?

244
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:40,067
Wait, Matsuda!

245
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,067
I'm all right.

246
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,468
Let a pro handle work like this.

247
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:49,767
Wait a second, Matsuda!

248
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,467
What does he mean by pro?

249
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,967
He was at the explosives disposal team until last year,

250
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:57,867
in the Security Task Force.

251
00:16:57,868 --> 00:17:01,667
Then the pal he was talking about that he said had passed away...

252
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:06,467
That's probably his pal Hagiwara of the same team,

253
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:08,867
who was killed on duty while he was disposing a bomb,

254
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:12,268
four years ago, on January 6th.

255
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:36,305
In that case, there were two bombs in separate places.

256
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,905
Matsuda disposed of one bomb.

257
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:42,205
But Hagiwara didn't have enough time.

258
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:45,505
The bomber has not yet been identified.

259
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:49,105
Matsuda requested transfer to the special team

260
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:51,606
that is investigating on the bomber.

261
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:56,005
He kept requesting the transfer, but was turned down.

262
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,505
Since they thought he wanted to do things for his pal,

263
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:59,905
they chose to transfer him, so he could cool off,

264
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,205
and sent him to our section.

265
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,005
Inspector, what shall we do?

266
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:08,205
It's six minutes to noon.

267
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:12,206
It'll take the car 10 more minutes to make a round and return.

268
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:18,006
We have no choice but to leave it to Matsuda.

269
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:34,406
What's that?

270
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:38,806
It stopped.

271
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:41,106
Put out the fire quick!

272
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:45,506
We've got trouble.

273
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:53,505
Hello! Matsuda? Are you all right?

274
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:54,805
Yeah.

275
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:59,105
But with the shock just now, and odd switch was turned on.

276
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,205
What?

277
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,805
The mercury lever.

278
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,905
Mercury lever?

279
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:07,005
A slight shake can make the mercury-drop roll,

280
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:09,206
and if the drop touches the wire, that's it.

281
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:12,805
If you don't want to see me blow up,

282
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:16,605
keep the car still until I dispose of this bomb.

283
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:21,006
But we have less than five minutes until the blow-up.

284
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:25,906
Three minutes would be more than enough for this kind of device.

285
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:29,505
"To the brave police officer..."

286
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:32,005
"To the brave police officer.

287
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,605
In praise of your courage, we will give you a prize."

288
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,505
Wait, what are you talking about?

289
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:43,705
"A clue to another bigger firework will be displayed

290
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:46,005
at 3 seconds before the explosion.

291
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:47,506
With best wishes."

292
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:53,105
These are the words displayed on the LCD panel right now.

293
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:57,005
I suppose if we stop the bomb and turn off the power,

294
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:59,506
we will never be able to read the clue again.

295
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:04,505
That is, the guy intended to put someone into this car

296
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:07,505
and show these words to him.

297
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,005
Then, that blow-up was turned on

298
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:13,505
because the guy saw you enter the car.

299
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:16,106
In other words, the bomber is somewhere close by.

300
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:20,706
It's very difficult to identify him out of this crowd of people.

301
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:24,305
But I can guess where he set the other bomb.

302
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,805
You can?

303
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:29,805
The fax says, "the head of our fellow knight."

304
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:33,105
The knights of the round table were from medieval Europe.

305
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:37,305
And those medieval knights wore helmets designed with a cross in front.

306
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:39,005
It's obvious now, isn't it?

307
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,705
A diagram sign of a hospital?

308
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,105
You guessed right.

309
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:45,405
I'll tell you which hospital it is after I read the clue.

310
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:47,305
You'll tell me after you read it?

311
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:49,205
But the clue comes up just 3 seconds before.

312
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,205
Well, the battery is almost out.

313
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:53,406
Bye now.

314
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:57,306
Matsuda...

315
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:00,506
Matsuda...

316
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,606
Allow me for today, will you?

317
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:20,105
Hell, no. There's only one minute left.

318
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:22,105
Everybody! Get out of here!

319
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,406
What?

320
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:26,706
Matsuda!

321
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:29,205
Don't, Sato! It's too late!

322
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,106
But...

323
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:38,705
Too dangerous! Back off, please!

324
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,006
But he's still there!

325
00:21:42,706 --> 00:21:44,006
He's inside!

326
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,106
"Sending mail."

327
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,005
Sorry, Hagiwara.

328
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:52,106
I guess I couldn't keep my word.

329
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:08,806
What?

330
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:13,205
What are we going to do? The fax says there's another bomb.

331
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,905
I know there is!

332
00:22:15,906 --> 00:22:18,005
Beika Central Hospital.

333
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:19,205
What?

334
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:21,705
Beika Central Hospital.

335
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,805
The other bomb is there!

336
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,706
Dispatch the bomb disposal squad on the double!

337
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:35,606
He was like a puff of wind.

338
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,806
"Jimpei Matsuda: Beika Central Hospital."

339
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:45,706
"I kinda liked you."

340
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:48,905
He vanished in an instant.

341
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:51,106
All he left behind is the sad sound.

342
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,705
Officer Sato!

343
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:59,005
Hey.

344
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:03,205
I didn't know such a thing took place three years ago.

345
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:04,405
Yes.

346
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:08,305
If Sato still has lingering memories about the incident,

347
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:10,405
we don't have a chance.

348
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,605
I suppose so.

349
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:17,805
If you want to be like him, you can die on duty.

350
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:20,205
Hey! Don't say things like that.

351
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,105
Unlucky things may come true, you know.

352
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:24,305
Wait! It's Sato.

353
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:27,105
Takagi and Shiratori.

354
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,705
What's the matter?

355
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,205
Conan and the kids are here too.

356
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:32,805
I just happened to run into them.

357
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:35,205
Because I am grateful to them for helping out in the case,

358
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:38,105
I'm going to get them sweets or something.

359
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:40,305
-All the cake we can eat. -Yes.

360
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:42,005
And, what brings you here?

361
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:45,805
We sort of got a squeal.

362
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:48,705
We looked through inside this restaurant,

363
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:50,405
but nothing showed up.

364
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:53,405
It's very likely to be a false lead.

365
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:56,705
Okay, then, I am going to karaoke with Yumi this evening.

366
00:23:56,706 --> 00:23:57,905
Would you guys care to join us?

367
00:23:57,906 --> 00:24:00,605
What? Sure we do.

368
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,206
Well, then, you go ahead, Takagi.

369
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:07,005
I'm not in the mood for singing today.

370
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:09,505
And I guess I'd rather not.

371
00:24:09,506 --> 00:24:11,305
Hey, let's hurry up and go.

372
00:24:11,306 --> 00:24:12,306
-Yeah. -Yes.

373
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:15,305
What kind of squeal was it?

374
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:18,605
Yeah. It was a phone call, a warning,

375
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:20,606
that a bomb is set up in this restaurant.

376
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:27,205
Today is January 6th.

377
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:31,105
The same day as the bombing of 7 years ago and 3 years ago.

378
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:33,505
So, we came and checked.

379
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,905
A bomb threat warning, a false lead...

380
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,305
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter."

381
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:39,306
"Now, this is the beginning of an extended game."

382
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:42,406
Don't tell me...

383
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:50,206
Shiratori!
