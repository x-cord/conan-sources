1
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:22,596
Today's stage is an inn.

2
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:24,296
Is it a ghost or just the work of some human?

3
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:26,096
The outdoor bath is the key to this question.

4
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,696
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:29,496
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,397
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:43,281
"The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 1)"

8
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:48,080
My stiff shoulders are killing me these days.

9
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:51,681
Our hot spring is really good for stiff shoulders.

10
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:57,180
Excuse me, mister. Is this tonight's desert?

11
00:02:57,181 --> 00:03:00,980
I'm sorry. This is actually for the other guest.

12
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:06,480
She loves cake. I heard she is a famous writer or something.

13
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:07,780
I see.

14
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,780
You were going to eat it, weren't you?

15
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:11,281
What? No.

16
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:21,780
Welcome to Kotoya Hotel. We've been expecting you.

17
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:24,781
You must be cold. Now, please come in.

18
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:31,081
It's a beautiful kimono.

19
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,181
It's a big garden, too.

20
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:39,881
Hey! Isn't that Eri Akechi, the love romance writer?

21
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:44,781
-Dad. -That hurts!

22
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:51,280
Excuse me, sir. Are you the famous detective,

23
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:54,081
Kogoro Mouri?

24
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,280
Mouri?

25
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:57,480
You are Mr. Mouri, right?

26
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:00,280
Yes. That's me.

27
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,780
Oh, my goodness.

28
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,580
I never expected to see a famous person like you in a place like this.

29
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:11,480
My name is Kyoichi Bando. I'm a producer at Nichiuri TV.

30
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:12,780
All right.

31
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,481
Well, why don't we sit and talk?

32
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:22,080
Now tell me, what kind of meeting is this?

33
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:25,880
Actually, we are planning to make a TV series drama

34
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:28,480
together with Daigakukan Publishing and us Nichiuri TV.

35
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:33,780
So I have asked Ms. Eri Akechi over there to write the story.

36
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:39,680
The story is about three young women trying to make their dream come true.

37
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:44,580
So we've been interviewing women in different careers.

38
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,180
And this time,

39
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:50,180
I asked Yoriko to get some people from her university.

40
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:52,480
Now, here they are.

41
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:55,080
She's a famous model in Paris and the New York fashion scene.

42
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,880
Asuka Shibasaki.

43
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:57,881
Hello.

44
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,380
Beautiful!

45
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:06,480
And, she's an oil painter and the winner of the new face award, Ema Anzai.

46
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,780
Nice to meet you.

47
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,980
Charming!

48
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:13,180
And, this girl is now causing a bit of stir in the music industry.

49
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,580
The singer songwriter,

50
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,580
Ms. Harumi Fukatsu, right?

51
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:18,681
I'm a great fan of yours!

52
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,080
Thank you.

53
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:26,080
Somebody's getting pretty famous although she has only one hit song.

54
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,180
It's not going to last long.

55
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:30,881
You know, there are many one hit wonders out there.

56
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,480
Very interesting!

57
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,481
You've all got unique characteristics and are also beautiful!

58
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,681
This way, please.

59
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,781
There's a kimono here, too.

60
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,980
Can I ask you something?

61
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,880
I saw it everywhere in this hotel.

62
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,480
How come kimonos are hanging on the wall?

63
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:56,480
People worship the Spirit of Kimono as a guardian deity.

64
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,980
You can see those not only in this hotel,

65
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,980
but also in ordinary houses and homes.

66
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:01,480
It's custom.

67
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,881
I see. Spirit of Kimono.

68
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm so excited about your new stuff, Ms. Akechi.

69
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,480
Oh, no. Call me Eri, please.

70
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:15,780
Actually, my mom has the same name.

71
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:18,880
So it feels kind of weird calling you Eri.

72
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,080
The kanji is different though.

73
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:26,380
Well, but if you call me "Ms. Akechi", it sounds like I'm a detective.

74
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:28,081
It feels weird.

75
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:33,880
So I heard people here worship the Spirit of Kimono, am I right?

76
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:36,680
Yes. This Spirit of Kimono is a guardian deity

77
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:40,180
but also have a dark side of face. People call it Kimono Demon.

78
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:42,080
Kimono Demon?

79
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,680
It's an old folklore told in this village.

80
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:48,280
Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Ohana in this village.

81
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:51,280
She was a kind, hardworking woman.

82
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:55,780
One day, Ohana found a samurai, who broke his leg. She helped him.

83
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,680
As a token of gratitude for her help,

84
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:00,580
the samurai gave Ohana tons of beautiful kimonos and sashes.

85
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:02,480
Being envious of Ohana's fortune,

86
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,680
the village mayor's daughters made a false charge against her.

87
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:09,181
Ohana was arrested and the daughters took her kimonos.

88
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,180
That night, Ohana was executed.

89
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:17,580
The daughters enjoyed the beauty of the kimonos.

90
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:18,680
All of a sudden,

91
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,281
the lights went out and...

92
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:26,380
Hearing the scream, the householders came,

93
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:28,880
but what they found were the dead bodies

94
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,780
of the younger daughter lying on the kimonos

95
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:36,280
and the body of the older one tangled with many sashes in a pond.

96
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:38,180
Realizing the graveness of Ohana's grudge,

97
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,280
the villagers built a small shrine

98
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,380
and worshipped her as a guardian deity of the village.

99
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,580
Ever since then, people in this area

100
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:46,480
have worshipped Ohana as the Spirit of Kimono.

101
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:51,480
And that is the Great Shrine of the Kimono Spirit.

102
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,580
You must've studied this place a lot.

103
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:57,981
No, I just stay in this hotel a lot when I write. That's all.

104
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,880
Isn't that Harumi?

105
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,281
You're right. Harumi!

106
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:11,980
This tree is called Kimono Sakura. It's about 500 years old.

107
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:16,380
When spring comes, those branches will be covered with flowers.

108
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:20,080
It looks just like a beautiful kimono.

109
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,780
Harumi, do you know about this place a lot, too?

110
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:24,180
No.

111
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:27,780
My friend in university loved this cherry blossom.

112
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:31,380
She told me about this before.

113
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:34,081
It crossed my mind, so I came here to see it.

114
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:38,380
Ran.

115
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:40,081
What is that small shrine?

116
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,080
Hey, kid! Don't run around.

117
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:47,280
That's actually the shrine for Kimono Visit.

118
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,180
Kimono Visit?

119
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:52,380
The Spirit of Kimono is also a deity of vengeance.

120
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,480
Vengeance?

121
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:57,480
It's been said that if you wear a kimono

122
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,180
and visit this small shrine at midnight,

123
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:04,081
the Spirit of Kimono will take revenge for you.

124
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,480
And in dedication of the Kimono visit,

125
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,281
people leave a paper doll in this shrine.

126
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:14,480
Look! There are new ones!

127
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:15,780
There are a couple of them.

128
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,881
What?

129
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:22,880
So somebody came here recently for Kimono visit?

130
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:26,781
That means there're two people that this visitor wants to take revenge on.

131
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,380
Forget about it. It's just a prank.

132
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,681
Don't worry about it, Ran.

133
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:38,081
Hey. Isn't that a shrine, too?

134
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,680
Come on.

135
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,880
It's just a guest room.

136
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,980
Actually, it's a shrine of the Spirit of Kimono, too.

137
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:49,880
Don't tell me there are paper dolls in it, too.

138
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,581
No way, it can't be.

139
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:56,380
But something's bugging me.

140
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:59,980
Please, Dad. Go and check it.

141
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,181
Me?

142
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,880
I don't understand why she's so scared.

143
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:11,880
There're no paper dolls here.

144
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:13,780
Right, see?

145
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,380
Right.

146
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,080
Here's nothing!

147
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,581
Good! Thanks!

148
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:25,980
It's amazing!

149
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:28,581
It just looks like the one on the pamphlet, doesn't it?

150
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,880
This is paradise.

151
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:37,181
This is paradise.

152
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,780
It's beautiful!

153
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:44,080
Cheers...

154
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:48,480
Everyone, thank you so much

155
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,980
for your cooperation with our four day interview.

156
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:55,880
Eri, make my model character stand out in your drama, will you?

157
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:59,880
Well, I still don't know what kind of story it's going to be.

158
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:03,081
So I'm giving you ideas right now!

159
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:05,880
Mr. Bando,

160
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,980
how about if Harumi sings the opening theme of the drama?

161
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:09,981
What?

162
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:12,380
That's a good idea!

163
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,380
Harumi, could you do that?

164
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:17,581
Only if she's around until then though.

165
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,781
It's good, isn't it?

166
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:30,880
Oh, my! Is it empty before I even open it?

167
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:32,680
How could that be possible?

168
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:35,581
Ran? Another bottle?

169
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:41,380
All right! One last bottle, okay?

170
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:45,780
It'll be the last one, Ran.

171
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:47,281
No!

172
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:52,980
No! Conan, it's not fair!

173
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:55,380
Excuse me?

174
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,481
Yes, come in.

175
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:59,481
Hi, Harumi!

176
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,980
There's something I would like to discuss with Mr. Mouri.

177
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:06,280
Dad.

178
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,580
Yes?

179
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,280
Dad!

180
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,481
Discuss?

181
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:25,210
It was five years ago. I was in third year in college.

182
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,610
There was this illegal drug that a lot of students on campus were using.

183
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:32,510
Somehow, people started to suspect a female student as the drug dealer.

184
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:34,410
Although she denied the fact that she was the drug dealer,

185
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:38,410
the drugs were found in her locker.

186
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:43,010
She killed herself by jumping off the university building,

187
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,310
saying she was innocent.

188
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:48,410
That person's name is Sakurako Suzuka.

189
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,510
I told you about her under the cherry blossom tree.

190
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:53,910
She was a very kind person, who loved cherry blossoms.

191
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:59,710
There's no way that she was selling the drugs. It just can't be her.

192
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,610
So please, Mr. Mouri!

193
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:05,111
Could you reinvestigate this case again? Please?

194
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,910
This was five years ago though.

195
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:12,610
Actually there was a rumour that the drug dealers

196
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:14,510
were some other female students.

197
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:15,610
What?

198
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:20,510
But those students were from a family who had a lot of authority.

199
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,110
So no one could go against them.

200
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:26,410
Students?

201
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:29,810
They are Asuka Shibasaki and Ema Anzai.

202
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:33,310
Asuka is a daughter of a parliamentary deputy.

203
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,110
And Ema is a daughter of the major construction firm, Anzai Global.

204
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,810
Those two girls didn't get along with Sakurako

205
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:42,610
because of her strong sense of justice.

206
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:44,711
Mr. Mouri, please look into this!

207
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:50,810
Alright! I'll see what I can do, okay?

208
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:53,810
Thank you so much!

209
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:57,310
You must like her a lot.

210
00:13:57,311 --> 00:14:00,510
I lost my parents when I was young.

211
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:02,910
My uncle and aunt raised me.

212
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:06,910
Sakurako also lost her parents by fire,

213
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:09,311
and so she was very kind to me.

214
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:25,311
You guys are going to the bath now?

215
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:28,210
You're done already, Ms. Akechi?

216
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,610
Yes. I got a little cold.

217
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:33,610
Then, why don't we have some drink together?

218
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:37,511
I'm sorry. I got some work to do.

219
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,311
Okay, later!

220
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:44,210
Huh? It's reserved.

221
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:45,211
You're right.

222
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:50,510
It's locked.

223
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:53,610
Well, what can we do? It's only 30 more minutes.

224
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:55,910
Why don't we go upstairs and play some ping pong?

225
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,511
Alright.

226
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:05,110
Somebody's going pretty wild over there.

227
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:07,810
I wonder what Ran and the others are doing?

228
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,711
Here we go!

229
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,711
Yes!

230
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:18,410
You guys already got out?

231
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:21,110
No. Actually, we haven't even got in yet.

232
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,011
It was reserved.

233
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:27,910
Huh? You're wearing glasses.

234
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:30,110
I wear contact lenses usually.

235
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:31,711
I took them off for the outdoor bath just now.

236
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:43,410
It's past 11.30pm now.

237
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:45,710
The bath should be open by now.

238
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,011
Yes. Let's go.

239
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:53,310
Where are you guys going?

240
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:54,611
To the female bathroom!

241
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,510
What?

242
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:00,211
Still reserved.

243
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:03,111
It is locked.

244
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,810
What is this?

245
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,311
There was nothing when we came here last time.

246
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,911
It's weird. This thing is kind of cold.

247
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,710
What is this?

248
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,310
What's the matter?

249
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:21,711
Kimono Demon.

250
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,110
Pops, break down the door!

251
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:31,711
Okay! Let me do it!

252
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:42,511
Dad!

253
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,810
This just got me really sober.

254
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:48,910
Conan, is anybody there?

255
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:51,711
Yes, but in fact...

256
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,811
Asuka!

257
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:03,910
Asuka!

258
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:06,111
Asuka, are you alright?

259
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:10,510
She's stabbed in the chest.

260
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:12,810
The folklore of the Kimono Demon.

261
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:13,911
Oh, no.

262
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:17,410
Hey, Conan! Where are you going?

263
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,211
In the folklore, two sisters are killed.

264
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,210
Hey, what's going on?

265
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:28,510
Asuka is...

266
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:31,410
What's the matter?

267
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:32,810
In the outdoor bath, Asuka was found dead.

268
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:35,510
Actually, it was a murder.

269
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,010
What is it?

270
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,610
Oh, my God.

271
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:39,611
Where is Ema?

272
00:17:39,612 --> 00:17:43,211
I think she went over there about an hour ago.

273
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,911
Are those the footprints of Ema's boots?

274
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,210
Is she in there?

275
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,310
Please don't step on the footprints.

276
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:04,611
I know that! Did you forget that I'm a detective?

277
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:23,410
So it is the Kimono Demon.

278
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:26,610
She's stabbed in her chest, too.

279
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:30,610
Outside, only Ema's footprints and nothing else was found.

280
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:34,311
In other words, this is a locked room closed off by the snow.

281
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,310
Excuse me, sir!

282
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:40,610
I suppose you're Detective Mouri.

283
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:42,910
Yes, I am.

284
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:46,610
I am Ogura, the police officer of this village!

285
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:47,611
Did you contact the prefectural police department?

286
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:50,110
Yes, I did.

287
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:52,910
But the road condition is not good because of the snow.

288
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:55,110
So I suppose they won't be here until tomorrow morning.

289
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:56,910
Tomorrow morning.

290
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:58,310
No choice then.

291
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:01,810
I guess we have to do the on-site investigation on our own.

292
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:05,710
Miss? Could you bring me some bath towels, please?

293
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,511
Sure!

294
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:11,610
Please wait in the hall.

295
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:13,010
Yes...

296
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:15,410
Do it slowly, Mr. Ogura.

297
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:22,510
Yes, slowly. Cover those footprints.

298
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:26,811
This pass under the eaves leads to the back door.

299
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,511
Yet, there are no footprints whatsoever.

300
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,210
Wait a minute.

301
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:37,411
Something's wrong.

302
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,110
What is it? Something's wrong.

303
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:43,910
Hey, don't move it!

304
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:46,111
I don't want the footprints to be covered with snow!

305
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:51,010
There you are.

306
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:54,210
Sorry, we decided to sit rather than stand. It's was Eri's idea.

307
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:56,311
Did you find anything?

308
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:03,110
Yoriko, you said Ema passed this lobby around 10.30pm.

309
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:05,010
Yes, I did.

310
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:07,210
Did you see anybody else?

311
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:08,811
No, I didn't.

312
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,810
It's getting more complicated.

313
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,710
What do you mean by that?

314
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:19,610
First of all, around the shrine where Ema was murdered,

315
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:25,110
there were no footprints found other than hers.

316
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,310
So, did Ema killed herself?

317
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,810
I don't think so.

318
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,910
There were no weapons found in there.

319
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:33,510
No way.

320
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:37,210
Secondly, in order to go to the outdoor bath where Asuka was murdered,

321
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:41,510
you have to go through the recreation hall.

322
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:47,910
We were there after 10.30pm, but didn't see anybody passing through.

323
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:50,710
What about climbing the cliff and going to the outdoor bath?

324
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:51,910
I already checked it.

325
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,910
There were no suspicious traces found on the cliff.

326
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,610
Then, Asuka was murdered before 10.30pm?

327
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:04,010
We found a dagger and a stun gun in the bathtub.

328
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:08,010
The murderer most likely attacked Asuka with the stun gun first,

329
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:10,210
then killed her in the outdoor bath.

330
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:13,810
The dagger in fact had a nacre decoration in its hilt.

331
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,010
I asked the staffs about it.

332
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:19,510
She said it was the votive dagger dedicated to the shrine in the garden.

333
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,110
The votive dagger?

334
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,510
And one more thing.

335
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:26,110
Ema's bandana was also found in the outdoor bath.

336
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:28,710
There was blood on that bandana.

337
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,310
What does that mean?

338
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:32,710
That means...

339
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:37,410
Assuming that both victims were murdered with the same dagger,

340
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:41,910
it's plausible to think that Ema was killed before Asuka was.

341
00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:45,610
Furthermore, Ema was alive until 10.30pm.

342
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:49,210
So theoretically, Asuka was killed after 10.30pm.

343
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:52,410
How did the murderer get into the outdoor bath, though?

344
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:56,410
There were no traces in the shrine of the garden, right?

345
00:21:56,411 --> 00:22:00,410
Give me a break. You got to be a ghost or something to do that.

346
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:01,411
It's the curse.

347
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:04,710
It's the curse of the Kimono Demon.

348
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:07,010
What do you mean?

349
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:08,910
We saw it!

350
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:14,310
I saw a couple of new paper dolls dedicated to the shrine!

351
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:18,310
The Kimono Demon's curse killed Asuka and Ema.

352
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:20,810
No, it can't be.

353
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:24,011
A curse did not kill the girls. It's obvious.

354
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:29,311
But what was the trick that the murderer used?

355
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:59,110
"Next Episode" -It's the Kimono visit!

356
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:02,611
It was Sakurako who revenged herself on these girls with the Kimono Visit!

357
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:07,310
I see.

358
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:11,711
It must be. I know Sakurako wanted to...

359
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:17,310
Hey! Why are your socks all wet?

360
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:21,110
Wait. Hey, Ran! Wait.

361
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:27,011
Next Conan, "The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 2)"

362
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:45,410
Next Conan's Hint:

363
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:47,210
"Sash."

364
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,010
Hey, Ran! Do you have a sash?

365
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,210
A black one for karate though.

366
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:52,011
That's what I thought.
