1
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:05,288
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:07,088
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,788
When The Youth Detective Squad combines its strength,

4
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:10,488
they could solve the trick of teleportation.

5
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,388
Find the brooch and let Tagaki's love begin.

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:13,888
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,788
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,889
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,817
After school, on the way home,

10
00:01:56,818 --> 00:02:00,718
we saw Officer Takagi walking into a jewelry store.

11
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,917
We followed him and went inside the jewelry store out of curiosity.

12
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:07,218
Surprisingly, we bumped into a jewel robber inside the store!

13
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:13,617
Officer Takagi and we chased the robber.

14
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:16,218
But he jumped off the roof of a building and died!

15
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:20,917
Do you know him?

16
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:24,917
Yes. The robber fell on the moving truck,

17
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:30,417
which was carrying the stuff of Mr. Nekota, the man over there.

18
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:33,917
Have you met these officers before?

19
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:36,217
No. Why would I have?

20
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:39,218
I've never done anything bad before!

21
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,717
Below that office is his living space.

22
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:47,717
That office is four stories above which is the ninth floor.

23
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:49,318
So this house is on the fifth floor.

24
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:53,517
-What is this? -It's a strange helmet, isn't it?

25
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:54,518
Hey!

26
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,617
Is that for a sports bicycle?

27
00:02:56,618 --> 00:03:00,818
Yes, I was into triathlon when I was young.

28
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,418
Where is the bedroom?

29
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,018
I found it!

30
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:10,818
It's here!

31
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:14,617
If my deduction is correct...

32
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:15,718
Then, probably...

33
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:20,418
It's wet!

34
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:23,618
Just as I thought, it wasn't a suicide!

35
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:27,917
Mr. Atomura was murdered by Mr. Nekota,

36
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:30,818
who disguised the murder as a suicide.

37
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:37,918
With the time lag and the gap between the buildings.

38
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:45,218
"A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 2)"

39
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:48,017
Anyhow...

40
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:50,017
It's a concrete fact that Takagi bumped into this robber

41
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,117
in the jewelry store and chased him.

42
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:54,817
Chased him up to the roof of the building.

43
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,818
But Takagi just let him jump off the building

44
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,517
and die right in front of him.

45
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:01,017
It's a hard fact.

46
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:03,717
Right. It seems more than just a coincidence though.

47
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:06,417
The robber crashed onto a moving truck

48
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:09,517
which was helping the office transfer of the company

49
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:11,917
that he used to work for but was fired recently.

50
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,218
Yet, it seems there's no doubt about that suicide.

51
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:22,118
Then, I guess that's it for today.

52
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:24,517
Sorry, Mr. Nekota,

53
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:26,817
we need you to come down to the station later.

54
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:29,017
What? Why do I need to?

55
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,917
Well, we need to ask you some questions

56
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:33,817
because you were Mr. Atomura's former boss.

57
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:36,417
Things like what kind of person he was or whether he had financial problems

58
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:37,617
and all that.

59
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:41,617
"Sakanobu Nekota (51)" -Okay, I understand.

60
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:45,317
Down a little! Down...

61
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,918
Just a little more!

62
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,618
It's cold!

63
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:53,417
Guys, what are you doing?

64
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,818
Nothing!

65
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:59,217
By the way, I have questions.

66
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:00,218
Questions?

67
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:01,218
Right.

68
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,518
A couple of questions for Mr. Nekota.

69
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:08,218
For me?

70
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:25,317
I remember what you said to Officer Takagi

71
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:27,617
when you first came to the scene of the suicide.

72
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:32,217
You said, "Call your friends and do what you have to do. Just be quick!"

73
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:33,617
Right.

74
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:36,017
I'm wondering why you said that.

75
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:38,717
Well, you know, I got a schedule.

76
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:39,918
We're not talking about that!

77
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:43,017
We're asking, how did you know that this.

78
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:46,717
Mr. Ordinary with the boring polo-shirt,

79
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:49,317
was actually...

80
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:51,817
was actually a police officer?

81
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,318
That's what the question means!

82
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,517
Yeah, I mean, why not?

83
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:04,517
A person died, right?

84
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,517
Isn't it natural to think that the police are here?

85
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:09,817
Yeah, but remember what you actually said?

86
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:12,618
You asked, "What's going on?"

87
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:17,518
And you also said that you never met Officer Takagi before!

88
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:19,717
I see.

89
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:21,917
You didn't know about the situation,

90
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,517
and neither ever met Takagi before.

91
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:26,317
It's something that you knew that he is a police officer.

92
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:29,717
That was probably the atmosphere that made me think so!

93
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:32,117
You know, something bad happened,

94
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:35,717
so I just felt the police were here.

95
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:38,717
Fair enough, next question then!

96
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:42,417
It's been a while since we got here.

97
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:46,018
But why are you not getting mad at us?

98
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:53,817
We're kids, you know?

99
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:57,017
You might have thought that we're officers if we're adults.

100
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,917
But we're kid and you just let us in without saying anything to us.

101
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,017
A normal person would say,

102
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:06,217
"Who the heck are those kids?"

103
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,717
Oh, that...

104
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,217
You didn't say anything,

105
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:13,317
because you knew us, right?

106
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:18,518
You knew that we were important witnesses of the jewel robbery.

107
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:26,417
Is that true?

108
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:27,917
-No. -Wait a minute.

109
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:29,817
You knew that I was a police officer.

110
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:33,818
And you also knew that these kids were involved in the robbery.

111
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:37,118
It can't be!

112
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,817
"Put the jewels in this bag!" -The jewel robber!

113
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:42,017
It was you, wasn't it?

114
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:43,617
It's possible.

115
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:45,317
If that is true,

116
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:48,517
then it will answer Mitsuhiko's questions.

117
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:49,917
Oh, please!

118
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,017
Don't you remember?

119
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:55,717
The robber jumped off the building opposite here

120
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:58,317
and crashed onto the moving truck!

121
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:00,617
Let's say I was the robber.

122
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:04,817
Then where did I go, after jumping off the building?

123
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:09,518
Isn't it Atomura who fell on the truck?

124
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:13,817
Also, I'm already 51 years old.

125
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:16,117
Do you think I have the body to pull away from a police officer

126
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:18,918
and run up to the roof of a building?

127
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:22,817
Triathlon!

128
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:23,918
What?

129
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:29,317
If you're still into that iron man race,

130
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:31,118
then that's probably nothing to you, right?

131
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:35,717
Is that you, Conan?

132
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:38,618
I was wondering where you were.

133
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:41,517
Now, where are you, Conan?

134
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,517
I'm in the building opposite!

135
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:45,318
The robber jumped off, right?

136
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,717
Now I'm going up the stairs to the roof where the robber jumped off!

137
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:50,517
There's something I wanted to try.

138
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:53,217
So I told them to throw the questions until I'm ready!

139
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,518
What is it, then?

140
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:08,018
Can you see me from there?

141
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:15,517
Yeah, I can see you.

142
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:17,617
But what are you exactly trying to do?

143
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:19,517
Hey, don't you remember?

144
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:23,817
I mean, about what the lady living right above that house said.

145
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:24,818
She woke up in 2 am midnight

146
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:27,617
because she heard a noise from the window.

147
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:30,117
As she looked at the window,

148
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:35,717
there was a shadow of a thin long stick on the curtain.

149
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:37,617
I think I got the mystery behind it,

150
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,017
and now I'm going to show that to you all!

151
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:41,517
Conan?

152
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,017
Okay, that's enough!

153
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:45,617
I'm helping you guys because it's my former staff

154
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,817
who robbed and killed himself!

155
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:51,517
It looks like these kids really want me to be the robber.

156
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,517
But it's only kid's shallow cleverness after all.

157
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:56,218
I can't believe you're actually listening to them!

158
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:59,517
Again, like I said,

159
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:00,917
if I was the robber,

160
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:03,817
then how did I vanish after jumping off the building?

161
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:06,917
It's impossible! There's no way I could've done it!

162
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:08,417
Unless I have supernatural powers

163
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:11,718
to use teleportation or something!

164
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:14,218
Yes, you can.

165
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:15,218
What?

166
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:30,217
You can do it without supernatural power.

167
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:31,717
Just like that!

168
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,018
Conan?

169
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:36,617
How did you get here?

170
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:37,917
I just used this rope

171
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:39,818
that I borrowed from the people at moving company.

172
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:44,317
Rope?

173
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:45,817
First of all, you measure the length

174
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:47,917
between the balcony of old office in ninth floor

175
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:51,617
and the balcony of this house that four floor below it.

176
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,017
Next, you get a rope twice the lengths

177
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:56,917
and put it through the handrail of the balcony in the old office.

178
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:59,617
Then tie both ends to make a loop!

179
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,617
After that, you connect a little loop to the rope

180
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,617
so it can carry your body.

181
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:07,317
You throw the rope with the little loop from the balcony

182
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,617
to the roof of the building opposite,

183
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,317
then you're all set!

184
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:13,117
All you need to do is to rob the jewelry shop

185
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:18,117
and pretend that you are being chased up to the roof of the building.

186
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:20,217
There, you cover the rope with the long raincoat,

187
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:23,418
with the little loop around your waist and jump off the roof.

188
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:34,817
This brings you straight down to this balcony.

189
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:37,517
After which you can hid the rope away

190
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:39,618
by untying the knot.

191
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,817
I see.

192
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:47,017
I'm actually surprised that you are not hurt at all.

193
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:49,817
The impact must've been violent when you landed on the balcony.

194
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:53,517
Just like the robber, I was wearing a helmet.

195
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,017
And also right before the impact,

196
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:57,717
I blew up a soccer ball with this ball-ejection belt Dr. Agasa invented,

197
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,817
in order to absorb the impact.

198
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:01,818
That's why I'm totally fine!

199
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,517
In Mr. Nekota's case, he set the bed mattresses in the balcony,

200
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:12,818
in order to absorb the impact.

201
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,280
Mattresses?

202
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:38,381
Yeah, they were wet when I checked them a little while ago!

203
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:46,980
I see! Because they were exposed to the rain, right?

204
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:51,080
Then, Mrs. Isaka saw and heard the shadow and noise that night,

205
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:54,680
because you were rehearsing this trick.

206
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:55,880
Wait a minute!

207
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:57,380
There was a dead body on the moving truck

208
00:12:57,381 --> 00:13:01,780
when you guys looked down right after the robber jumped off, right?

209
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,480
How would you explain this?

210
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:07,780
He was on the moving truck from the beginning.

211
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:13,680
The truck was parked in the back of this building

212
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:16,681
in order to move things out of the old office above.

213
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,480
Probably...

214
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,981
you told Mr. Atomura to help move, or something like that.

215
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:40,581
Then you pushed him over the window of your old office.

216
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:44,280
Yeah, I remember you said,

217
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:48,580
the whole ninth floor was your old office.

218
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:49,680
So it was possible to drop him

219
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:52,380
on the truck even if it was parked in the back alley.

220
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:53,980
Well, what about the noise?

221
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:55,480
Well, someone would hear the noise,

222
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:58,680
if a person falls on the truck, right?

223
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:02,080
No, because there is water supply work around here,

224
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,581
and it doesn't end until evening everyday.

225
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:13,280
It's likely that the the water supply work shut off the noise.

226
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:15,280
I'm sure there was to the truck when the body fell.

227
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:18,680
So some movers may have noticed something.

228
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:19,880
Yes, and that's why you told everybody

229
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,580
including the driver to come up to the office, right?

230
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:25,780
Because you wanted to tell them which things go first and stuff...

231
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:30,680
The moving people told me that they had to wait for a while in the doorway.

232
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:33,780
That was probably when you pushed Mr. Atomura over the window,

233
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:35,680
and threw the rope to the other building.

234
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:38,280
And then, you closed the blinds!

235
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:43,180
So that nobody would see the trick when it came in to the office!

236
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,780
I see. So, to sum it up.

237
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:49,280
First of all, you told the movers

238
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,080
including the driver to come up to the old office,

239
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,680
which was on the top floor of this building.

240
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,480
Then, while you kept them waiting in the doorway.

241
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:57,680
You pushed Mr. Atomura over onto the moving truck

242
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,381
which was parked in the back of this building.

243
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:03,980
Next, you threw the rope to the roof of the opposite building.

244
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,980
And then, while the movers were moving the stuff

245
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:09,980
from the old to the new office,

246
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:12,280
"Put the jewels in this bag!" -you robbed the jewelry store!

247
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:16,280
Then Officer Takagi chased you up to the roof of the new office building.

248
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,280
All of these were done just to make this incident look like

249
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:21,180
the robber committed suicide

250
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:24,580
after being chased by a police officer!

251
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,380
You got that right! Also, when he jumped off,

252
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:28,180
he dropped the bag with the jewelries

253
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:30,680
and the spare helmet which he left on the roof beforehand.

254
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,580
As these things hit the truck,

255
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:40,780
the people would notice that something fell on the truck!

256
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:45,280
That's probably why the helmet wasn't on Mr. Atomura's head!

257
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,980
So the robber smiled when I told him,

258
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,081
that I was from the police.

259
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:56,780
Because he needed someone to chase him

260
00:15:56,781 --> 00:16:01,780
and someone to witness the suicide on the roof.

261
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:04,680
Yeah. If you weren't there,

262
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,680
he would've probably waited until other police officer came

263
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:09,980
to the jewelry shop.

264
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:14,380
Talk about a trick that is unbelievably reliant on luck.

265
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:16,380
Until you jumped off the building,

266
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,980
surprisingly no neighbors or passersby

267
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:21,880
actually saw the rope or the dead body.

268
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,580
Well, I guess it was the sloppiness of your plan that

269
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,580
made it possible to solve even for kids.

270
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:29,180
It wasn't just his luck that people went blind!

271
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,580
What?

272
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:32,281
It was because of this weather!

273
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:36,680
You mean the rain?

274
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:39,680
I get it! When it's raining, people put up their umbrella

275
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,380
and stay away from balcony.

276
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:43,080
As long as people hold their umbrella,

277
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,380
they won't see what's above their head.

278
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,280
Likewise, as long as people stay away from balcony,

279
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:50,080
they won't see what's below.

280
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:53,280
Plus, the mover used the backstreet when they moved the truck

281
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:56,180
and there were not many passersby on that street.

282
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,380
Under this circumstance,

283
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:01,180
you would have been the unluckiest person to make people see those things.

284
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:02,281
That's true.

285
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:05,380
Yeah, but still,

286
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:09,580
it was a coincidence that he took action on a rainy day, right?

287
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:11,580
It wasn't a coincidence!

288
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,480
You canceled moving twice

289
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:16,381
and postponed it to today, right?

290
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,180
Now, all we need is evidence.

291
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:22,280
That, I think is somewhere in this house

292
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:25,480
or around this building. I'm pretty sure!

293
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:26,680
Because Mr. Nekota showed up at the scene of the suicide

294
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:30,280
soon after the robber jumped off.

295
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,580
So it must be somewhere around here!

296
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:35,580
The evidence includes the rope, helmet and raincoat that he used.

297
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,380
Also the thing that he picked up

298
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,681
and put in his pocket at the jewelry shop.

299
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:47,381
And the brooch that I was going to buy.

300
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,080
I see.

301
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:53,580
Now, it's whether you hid them or dumped them.

302
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:56,180
The helmet and raincoat are somewhere in the same place together,

303
00:17:56,181 --> 00:18:00,080
since you didn't have enough time to go far.

304
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:03,080
We'll probably find the raincoat with that brooch,

305
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:07,481
as well as the helmet with your fingerprints and hair on it.

306
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,481
Mr. Nekota.

307
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:14,881
I think it's time you confess.

308
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:32,881
I don't understand why did you have to take that brooch?

309
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:37,080
Redemption. I guess?

310
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,980
Redemption?

311
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:42,980
My company was heavily in the red.

312
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:47,980
It was necessary to fire those who were close to their retirement age

313
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:50,381
and those who were on a decline work-wise.

314
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:56,381
He happened to be one of those people.

315
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,880
I will spill the secret if you fire me.

316
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,780
The things this company has been hiding.

317
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:05,980
You know, about the deceptive food labeling.

318
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:10,280
All I'm asking is for is you to let me stay here until my retirement age.

319
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,580
All I need is a life in which I can afford a brooch

320
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:15,280
like this for my wife's birthday.

321
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,880
Well, my wife might ask me to buy her jewelry

322
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:21,480
that is more expensive than this, after my retirement age.

323
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:24,281
But for now, you don't need to worry about that, President.

324
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:26,780
That's why you killed him.

325
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:28,980
Yes.

326
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:33,380
I thought I would be in a morass if I let him keep blackmailing me.

327
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,180
But, why that brooch?

328
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:40,780
I was thinking of giving it to his wife on her birthday.

329
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:45,381
And saying it was a present that he left with me before his death.

330
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:48,480
In fact, it's true that he'd been working very hard

331
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:51,581
since the company was established.

332
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:57,480
And not only have I made such person a criminal

333
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:02,280
but also killed him, I just wanted to run away from the sense of guilt.

334
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,581
So I impulsively took the brooch.

335
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:18,980
It's ironic. The brooch was supposed to help me flee,

336
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,681
but it actually helped you guys arrest me.

337
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,780
All right. So where is the raincoat with that brooch?

338
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:01,080
It's in the closet in my bedroom.

339
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:02,680
Did you hear that, Officer Sato?

340
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:03,880
Please go and check!

341
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,381
Oh, okay.

342
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,181
I found it!

343
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:14,881
This wet one, right?

344
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:19,081
I'm pretty sure you'll like it!

345
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,780
It took at a long time for Officer Takagi to decide!

346
00:22:24,781 --> 00:22:27,080
It looks amazing even without diamonds!

347
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:30,580
I'm surprised he has pretty good taste.

348
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,081
Why don't you take a look?

349
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:37,480
Yes.

350
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,081
Officer Sato. Please take a look at it!

351
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:43,380
That must be it!

352
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:45,980
Trust me. Miwako was staring at this brooch.

353
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,180
She wasn't even blinking at all!

354
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,980
It's a perfect present for her, isn't it?

355
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,880
But you didn't hear this from me, okay?

356
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:56,880
Look, coincidence makes girls believe in destiny

357
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:58,481
and that's where the love deepens!

358
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,780
Let us deepen...

359
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,380
Our love story.

360
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:06,280
Oh?

361
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:08,381
This is...

362
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:12,880
A brooch.

363
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:15,381
This is the brooch Yumi wanted!

364
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:21,280
-Officer Yumi? -Yeah.

365
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:23,780
She was all hyper when she saw this in a magazine.

366
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:25,080
Speaking of jewelries,

367
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,380
I think Yumi was wearing a bracelet that looked just like

368
00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:30,980
the one that I gave you a few days ago.

369
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:33,581
Oh, that! I lent it to her!

370
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:35,980
Cause she said she'd been looking

371
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,681
for a bracelet just like that.

372
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:43,881
I'm not interested in those shiny things at all.

373
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:49,081
This necklace looks fabulous!

374
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,280
All right!

375
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:55,381
I'm gonna try Lieutenant Takano next time.

376
00:23:57,781 --> 00:24:01,080
"Next Episode" -Hey Conan! Come over here! Right now!

377
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:04,380
We got a client for the Youth Detective Squad!

378
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:06,681
Just come, we got a nice one.

379
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:17,581
Watch out!

380
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:21,181
Guys, get off the floor...

381
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:27,881
Next Conan, "Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 1)"

382
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,380
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:48,180
"Raging bull."

384
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:49,780
Next time, I'll get what's best for her.

385
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:50,880
What? A cow?

386
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,081
It's no good?
