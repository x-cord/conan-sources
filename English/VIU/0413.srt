1
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:05,890
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:07,790
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,290
The stage for today's episode is a TV station.

4
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,690
The passion for creating a program

5
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,890
gets bent out of shape along the way and leads to murder!

6
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,390
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:16,190
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:18,591
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:02,272
And you want me, Kogoro Mouri...

10
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:06,171
to speak before the scriptwriters?

11
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:10,571
Yes. I'd really like you to tell them your story, Detective Mouri.

12
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:13,371
Have you ever seen the show "Detective Fluke"?

13
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:17,271
Well, since it's a detective story, I've watched it several times.

14
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:19,371
I watch it every week!

15
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,071
Thank you.

16
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:26,271
Three people are taking turns writing the scripts of "Detective Fluke".

17
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,671
However, since we've been doing this for five years now,

18
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:32,671
we're running out of things and tricks to write about.

19
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:38,671
So you want to use my experiences as a reference to make your scripts.

20
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:42,671
It doesn't happen all the time,

21
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:45,671
but once in several times, there are fantastic ones.

22
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:46,871
For example,

23
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:51,371
"52nd Closed Door Murder" had a surprising trick.

24
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,172
If so, Fluke, that locked room was...

25
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:58,771
It was set up afterwards, Inspector.

26
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:02,072
The entire house was lifted up with a crane.

27
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:09,571
No one would ever think that such a large scale method would be used.

28
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:14,572
But you can't fool the eyes of Detective Rintaro Fluke here.

29
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:22,571
It's amazing how they can think up a trick like that.

30
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:25,371
It makes me so happy.

31
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:31,071
I think that the "52nd Closed Door Murder" is a great mystery story, too.

32
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:33,671
But it was broadcast more than 2 years ago.

33
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,071
How old are you now anyway, Conan?

34
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:38,571
Well...

35
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:40,871
I saw it on a video the other day.

36
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,372
Oh, my. Of course.

37
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:47,671
That was close.

38
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:49,071
I understand.

39
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:53,072
I'll tell the scriptwriters all the various experiences I've been through.

40
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:56,171
May I go, too?

41
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:59,772
I'd like to meet the people who are writing "Detective Fluke"!

42
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:08,472
"The Mystery of the Complete Half Crime."

43
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,671
Maybe we came here too early.

44
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,971
There's an hour more before the appointed time.

45
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:24,271
I'm sure there was a coffee shop on the top floor.

46
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,071
I'm scriptwriter, Yagami.

47
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:29,071
I'm going to the producer of "Detective Fluke", Inoue's place.

48
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:31,172
Yes, sir. One moment, please.

49
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:37,071
That guy. He's one of the three scriptwriters, isn't he?

50
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:40,772
He seems somewhat unfriendly and arrogant.

51
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:46,671
Mr. Yagami, long time no see.

52
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:51,372
Well, the cab I was riding got caught in traffic.

53
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:57,571
I think it's been six months already

54
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,271
that we've all gotten together like this.

55
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:02,171
While we're waiting for Mr. Mouri to arrive a while later,

56
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,271
I would like to conduct a meeting

57
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,571
as to the development of this series from now on.

58
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,871
I'd like something to drink.

59
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:09,971
What about all of you?

60
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:11,671
No, thank you.

61
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:14,272
I'll go get it. I'll take your order.

62
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:18,171
Coffee! Hot.

63
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:20,571
-Same here. -Same here.

64
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:21,972
Okay, I'll be right back.

65
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:30,871
I'm sorry. Let me do it.

66
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,372
It's okay, I'm always doing this.

67
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:36,471
Is he a waiter or what?

68
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:39,871
I think the meeting is more important.

69
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,871
Is he really a scriptwriter, or what?

70
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:45,471
He writes great stuff.

71
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:47,171
I'm not talking about what he writes.

72
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:50,571
I'm talking about the way he usually behaves, Sakuma.

73
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:52,771
He's still a newcomer, so...

74
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:55,371
I'm sure he's trying to be as considerate as possible!

75
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:58,471
I think you should take him off the list after all, Ms. Inoue.

76
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:02,771
Sakuma and I can probably handle "Detective Fluke" ourselves.

77
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:04,672
-Mr. Yagami... -Mr. Yagami...

78
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,572
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

79
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:11,471
Thank you.

80
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:14,971
If I remember correctly, you use milk, don't you?

81
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:17,772
I forgot the milk. I'll be right back.

82
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:25,972
I tell you, he lacks composure.

83
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:31,172
He still very young.

84
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:51,072
-Mr. Yagami! -Mr. Yagami!

85
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:59,672
Yes, Ms. Inoue.

86
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,172
What did you just say?

87
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:08,971
Yes!

88
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:11,772
That's right. The address here is...

89
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,571
Mr. Mouri.

90
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:26,072
The smell of almond, it's poisoning by cyanic acid.

91
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:38,772
Four people and four drinks.

92
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:53,571
There was poison in the coffee cup that was on the floor.

93
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:57,371
No poison whatsoever was detected in the other three cups.

94
00:07:57,372 --> 00:08:01,371
In other words, the culprit put poison only in Mr. Yagami's cup.

95
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:02,671
That's right.

96
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:06,271
Mr. Koda, you're the one who got the drinks?

97
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:07,471
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:09,171
I took everyone's order.

99
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:12,672
Everyone usually drinks hot coffee while I drink Japanese tea.

100
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:18,371
But doesn't a staff of the TV station usually the who serves tea?

101
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,971
Yes, but...

102
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:24,571
I'm still a fledgling scriptwriter,

103
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,771
so I try to help out whenever I can.

104
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,271
Is something strange about what I did?

105
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:32,171
No, not really.

106
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:33,471
I see!

107
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,071
One of the cups in the hot water room was smeared with poison

108
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:39,272
and that cup just happened to go to Mr. Yagami.

109
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:44,471
So, you're saying that someone wanted to commit at random murder?

110
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,772
I can't think of anything else.

111
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,771
So you said that you'd serve the coffee,

112
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:54,571
but Mr. Koda insisted on doing it himself.

113
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,872
Yes, he said he'd do it himself.

114
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,572
May I have a moment with you, Inspector?

115
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:08,371
Ms. Inoue, will you please come with me?

116
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,372
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:14,071
Judging from the circumstances,

118
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:15,971
the only one who would've been able to mix the poison in the drink

119
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,871
is Mr. Koda.

120
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:22,671
His remark of it being a random killing is shaky justification

121
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:25,171
and we feel that he's our man.

122
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,571
But what's his motive?

123
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:30,072
You brat! I told you to stay in your room.

124
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,171
He's writing for the same program, isn't he?

125
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,371
Why would he want to poison his colleague?

126
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,671
He may be a colleague, but...

127
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:41,271
Is something bothering you?

128
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:42,671
Please tell us about it.

129
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,772
This is a homicide case, you know.

130
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:49,671
The scripts of "Detective Fluke"

131
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:55,071
were originally being written by both Mr. Yagaimi and Mr. Sakuma by turns.

132
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:57,971
Then, this man who introduced himself as a fervent fan of the program

133
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,071
brings a plot that he had written to me.

134
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:02,071
He was Mr. Koda.

135
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:04,671
I read it, and found it to be very interesting.

136
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:08,471
So I decided to have him work for us as our third scriptwriter.

137
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:11,471
Although Mr. Sakuma evaluated him highly,

138
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:14,072
Mr. Yagami for some reason didn't like him.

139
00:10:15,372 --> 00:10:20,871
Therefore, Mr. Yagami had repeatedly told me to take him off the program.

140
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:23,571
Did Mr. Koda know about this?

141
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:26,171
I think he could sense it from the atmosphere.

142
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:28,371
I'm sure it was a very trying situation for Mr. Koda.

143
00:10:28,372 --> 00:10:29,872
Which means...

144
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:32,271
Ms. Inoue.

145
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:35,671
I want to write as many scripts of this popular program as I can,

146
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:39,272
sell my name and make a name for myself as a successful scriptwriter!

147
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:46,471
Mr. Koda was staking his future on "Detective Fluke".

148
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:51,171
But Mr. Yagami wanted to get Mr. Koda off the project no matter what.

149
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,972
Inspector, there's no doubt that he...

150
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,172
He does have a motive.

151
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,572
But if he did do it...

152
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:22,471
Hey, Mr. Mouri. Wait!

153
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:24,771
We already know who the killer is!

154
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:27,671
But we don't have any material evidence whatsoever yet.

155
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:30,271
Besides, there are things that are not solved yet.

156
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,671
Shut up! I'll make him spit it out.

157
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:35,871
I'm the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri!

158
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:37,272
Are you sure?

159
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:40,971
I killed Mr. Yagami?

160
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:43,071
You're suspecting that I did it?

161
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,471
No way.

162
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:49,071
Well, it's true that I slightly hated him, but...

163
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:53,571
Mr. Mouri, even if I were to have put poison into the coffee cup,

164
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:56,171
I wouldn't make Mr. Yagami drink it.

165
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:59,471
Because out of the three cups, only one would be poisoned.

166
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:03,372
Moreover, I left to go get milk, so I wasn't there.

167
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:06,371
In other words, I didn't urge him to drink it,

168
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,671
but Mr. Yagami drank it of his own initiative.

169
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:11,471
There was no way I could've known

170
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:14,071
that Mr. Yagami would choose the coffee cup he chose.

171
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:15,271
Am I wrong?

172
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,371
Well...

173
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:19,071
That's it.

174
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,271
If he's the killer,

175
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:24,972
how did he make Mr. Yagami choose the cup he drank out of?

176
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:29,672
I see!

177
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:31,872
Mr. Mouri?

178
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:34,671
You brought the drinks

179
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:38,571
and gave the cup without the poison inside to Ms. Inoue,

180
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:40,771
which leaves two cups remaining.

181
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:42,671
Two cups would be the same as I mentioned earlier.

182
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:44,971
I'd have no idea which one Mr. Yagami would choose.

183
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,971
That's easy. All you have to do is line it up this way.

184
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:54,071
Mr. Yagami was sitting just about here in the room back then.

185
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:56,571
He would most naturally take the cup that is nearest to him.

186
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:59,571
Moreover, Mr. Sakuma would never pick up his coffee cup

187
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,771
before Mr. Yagami, his superior.

188
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:03,471
I see.

189
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:05,671
I wonder about that.

190
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:08,071
No, although he is my superior and I came in after him,

191
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:10,471
we know each other quite well.

192
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:13,371
So even back then I took the coffee cup before Mr. Yagami

193
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:16,071
and gave him the remaining cup.

194
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:20,072
If that's the case, doesn't that make me suspicious?

195
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:25,671
Mr. Mouri, if you want to implicate me so much,

196
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,571
just what kind of trick did I use

197
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:31,371
to make sure Mr. Yagami drank the poison?

198
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:34,271
Figure that out first.

199
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,871
Those challenging eyes...

200
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:39,471
He's gotta be the suspect.

201
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:43,072
And he's confident about the trick he used.

202
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,871
Two people and two drinks.

203
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:50,771
The percentage of each choice is 50%.

204
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:54,672
Just what kind of trick he use to get a probability of 100%?

205
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:05,801
Mr. Mouri. To be honest, I have my doubts about suspecting Mr. Koda.

206
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:09,681
If by chance Mr. Sakuma had chosen the poisoned coffee

207
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,781
instead of Mr. Yagami who it was intended for,

208
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:15,781
he would've had to stop him from drinking it no matter what.

209
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:19,581
But he left the room saying that he forgot the milk.

210
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:22,981
If he were the killer, would he leave the scene?

211
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,381
That's true.

212
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:27,881
Didn't it cross his mind that an accident could occur?

213
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:29,381
Hey.

214
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,182
Are you listening to me, Mr. Mouri?

215
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:43,481
I wonder what's going to happen to "Detective Fluke" from now on.

216
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,781
Is it going to end?

217
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:49,681
I don't know. But with something like this happening...

218
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,781
After all the effort that was put into writing the scripts.

219
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:55,081
Is that the list for "Detective Fluke"?

220
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:56,682
May I have a look at it?

221
00:14:58,282 --> 00:14:59,481
Go ahead.

222
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,482
Thank you.

223
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:07,081
What is it?

224
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:10,481
That was Mr. Koda's script, wasn't it?

225
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:12,881
The one entitled "52nd Closed Room Murder".

226
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:17,081
The one you said that you thought was interesting, too.

227
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:22,481
Actually, that was the first plot that Mr. Koda brought here.

228
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:27,182
I was also surprised that a new scriptwriter with such talent existed.

229
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:31,681
Mr. Koda also wrote the "Supporting Performers Club"?

230
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,782
Yes. Why?

231
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,881
Don't tell me that...

232
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:39,881
Most of the scripts are written by both Mr. Yagami and Mr. Sakuma.

233
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:43,281
They're after all the main scriptwriters, so...

234
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:45,381
In other words, no matter how talented he is,

235
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,581
he doesn't have the chance to display it.

236
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:50,381
And if that's the motive,

237
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,481
every mystery is solved.

238
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:55,081
What's the matter, Conan?

239
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:56,981
Ms. Inoue!

240
00:15:56,982 --> 00:16:00,081
I've finally arrived at the goal.

241
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:02,282
It seems that he's figured out the trick!

242
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:05,382
No way.

243
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,681
There are two people and two drinks.

244
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:14,981
The way to make the target drink the poison for sure is...

245
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:18,581
No matter how much I think, there's only one way.

246
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:19,582
That is...

247
00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:26,882
to believe in luck.

248
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:33,281
Mr. Mouri, is that the conclusion you've reached?

249
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:36,181
Inspector, this is no joke.

250
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:38,181
The rate of success is 50%.

251
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:39,281
You took a sink or swim chance.

252
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:42,381
Mr. Koda, your desperate feeling

253
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:46,781
of not wanting to be removed from the script writing of "Detective Fluke"

254
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:50,581
made you take the dreadful risk of sink or swim.

255
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,981
That's enough, Mr. Mouri.

256
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:56,382
No, Inspector! I'm saying this with conviction.

257
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:04,381
Mr. Mouri?

258
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:06,481
Could this be the rumoured...

259
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:08,881
Sleeping Kogoro?

260
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:11,381
I took a sink or swim chance?

261
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:13,681
Are you serious about what you're saying?

262
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:16,481
At one point I really thought so, but...

263
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:19,481
Mr. Mouri...

264
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:22,081
Please hear me out, Inspector.

265
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:27,281
Mr. Koda, you said to solve the mystery of the trick you used

266
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:29,081
to make Mr. Yagami choose the poisoned coffee

267
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,081
if we're going to suspect you.

268
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,481
But that's impossible.

269
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:38,482
Because you used no trick to begin with.

270
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,081
There's no trick?

271
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:42,981
No, nothing at all.

272
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:46,382
If so, how did he make Mr. Yagami drink the poisoned coffee?

273
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,581
Before I tell you that,

274
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:53,881
please let me explain how I came to such a conclusion.

275
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,781
Conan, bring me the stuff.

276
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:56,982
Okay.

277
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:01,781
This is the list of the scripts of "Detective Fluke"

278
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:04,081
that Conan just borrowed.

279
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,581
I was surprised at seeing this.

280
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:13,681
One among several scripts is an extremely well written mystery story.

281
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,781
Ingenious tricks, logical mystery solving,

282
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:20,781
and most of all, a story development that sticks to unbiased standards.

283
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:24,481
For example, "52nd Closed Door Murder" is one of them.

284
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:26,381
So is "Supporting Performers Club",

285
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:28,281
"Evil Well Murder",

286
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:30,682
and "When the Door of Fate Opens."

287
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:33,481
Those scripts are all...

288
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:37,681
Yes, all those scripts that I thought to be amazing

289
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:42,182
were those that you have written, Mr. Koda.

290
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:47,981
When I found out,

291
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:50,581
that's when I changed my mind.

292
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:53,681
A person such as you who writes such a perfect mystery story

293
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:58,381
would never take a sink or swim chance when the success rate is 50%.

294
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:02,381
And I began to question your motive.

295
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:06,981
That is, why did you leave the place back then?

296
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:11,781
You had it in mind beforehand that you would say that you forgot the milk.

297
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:15,381
You may have wanted to instil the impression on everyone

298
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,781
that you had nothing to do with which cup of coffee.

299
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,882
Mr. Yagami and Mr. Sakuma were going to choose.

300
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:23,881
But that action of yours is suspiciously strange after all.

301
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:26,581
Because as Inspector Megure had mentioned earlier,

302
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,581
if by chance Mr. Sakuma had chosen the poisoned coffee

303
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:32,481
instead of Mr. Yagami who it was intended for,

304
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:35,581
he would've had to stop him from drinking it no matter what.

305
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:38,681
That's right. No matter how good your plan is,

306
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:41,081
it can always go wrong.

307
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:46,581
You, who writes flawless mysteries would not overlook that fact.

308
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,381
Nevertheless, you left the meeting room.

309
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:54,381
There is only one possible answer.

310
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:58,382
You did not only target Mr. Yagami.

311
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:02,781
Mr. Mouri.

312
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:04,781
Just what are you trying to get at, Mr. Mouri?

313
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:09,082
It didn't matter whether Mr. Yagami or Mr. Sakuma drank it.

314
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:13,481
That's why no trick needed to be used.

315
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:18,581
In other words, you're saying that he didn't care which of us he killed?

316
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:21,681
You mean it was such a flimsy murder plan?

317
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,781
This is no flimsy plan, Inspector.

318
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:28,481
No matter who dies, the result he wants is achieved.

319
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:31,481
So long as one of the two main scriptwriters disappears,

320
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:33,981
the chance of the third scriptwriter,

321
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,081
Mr. Koda getting to introduce his writings would increase tremendously.

322
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:40,581
He wanted to write as many scripts of "Detective Fluke" as he could.

323
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:44,081
This is probably the real motive for the murder that was committed.

324
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:45,482
Is it not, Mr. Koda?

325
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,381
Ms. Inoue.

326
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:54,881
I want to write as many scripts of this popular program as I can,

327
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:59,981
sell my name and make a name for myself as a successful scriptwriter!

328
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:01,382
Mr. Koda...

329
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:09,881
At first glance, it looked to be a plan with only 50% chance of succeeding.

330
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:12,581
But if it didn't matter which of the two drank the poisoned coffee,

331
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:15,481
the rate of success would be 100%.

332
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,782
I see.

333
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,682
I'm already 29, you see.

334
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:30,482
By age 30, I'll be a writer in great demand.

335
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:36,682
That's my goal as a scriptwriter.

336
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:47,081
What's this thing about being a writer in demand?

337
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:49,781
Even if you write only one in ten scripts,

338
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:52,181
those who read your scripts can all tell how talented you are.

339
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:55,081
Even Ms. Inoue evaluated your scripts highly.

340
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:58,081
I remember all your scripts, too.

341
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,982
They were all very good.

342
00:22:02,382 --> 00:22:04,482
You're so stupid.

343
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,982
So "Detective Fluke" is going to end after all?

344
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:43,681
"Detective Fluke" ends, and a new series of "Detective Fluke" will begin!

345
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:46,481
It says that the name of the main character's going to be changed

346
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:49,481
from "Rintaro Fluke" to "Kogoro Fluke".

347
00:23:49,482 --> 00:23:51,081
Kogoro Fluke.

348
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:54,681
It sounds like Kogoro's a fluke!

349
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:56,782
Isn't that is what you actually are?

350
00:23:59,182 --> 00:24:03,081
"Next Episode."

351
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,781
Based on the look on your faces,

352
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:07,581
it looks like your deduction is messed up.

353
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:10,381
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya has made the mistake of a life time!

354
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,181
We should've told Conan about this to begin with!

355
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:14,682
What if we don't make it in time?

356
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:18,682
-Genta! -Genta!

357
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:23,181
Let's go around to the yard!

358
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:29,082
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad Pursues the Bluebird".

359
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:46,981
Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:49,081
"Soy sauce."

361
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:51,081
-Next week comes the bluebird. -What? A boo-bird?

362
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:53,782
-No, Inspector McGraw. -My name's Megure.
