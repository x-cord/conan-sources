1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,769
The school trip that was memorable

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,670
and shocking in some ways ended, and...

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,569
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm home.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,269
What? Conan caught a cold?

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,569
What does that mean?

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,169
Remember how he went

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,469
to stay with Dr. Agasa the night before you left?

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,469
-Yeah. -He caught a cold then

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,270
and was stuck in bed.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,869
Why didn't you call me right away?

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,169
Dr. Agasa thought you'd be worried and want to come home,

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,470
so he asked me not to tell you.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,170
Well, thanks to him, I didn't have to...

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,670
take care of a sick kid.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,170
Gosh.

16
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,769
Hey, did you see the news about Kiyomizu Temple?

17
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,769
I heard some high school students solved the murder case.

18
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,169
Seriously?

19
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,869
Yeah, Heiji Hattori. Isn't he cute?

20
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,069
Yeah, that's the one.

21
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,069
I heard there was another boy and girl, too.

22
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,869
I wonder who they were. I'm curious.

23
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,869
I heard the girl was boyish and cute.

24
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,769
What about the other boy?

25
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,069
More info, please.

26
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,070
"#FightingRedTenguMurder"

27
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:42,869
I know! I happened to be there!

28
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,970
He's the high school detective of the east, Shinichi Kudo!

29
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:02,470
"Shinichi Kudo - Deceased. Koji Haneda - Deceased."

30
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,069
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

31
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,069
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,069
Everyone's talking about Shinichi online.

33
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,069
They can't be allowed to find out.

34
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,469
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,269
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,170
His name is Detective Conan.

37
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:13,046
"Find Maria (Part 1)"

38
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:16,688
"Mouri Detective Agency."

39
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,087
Your fever seems to have gone down.

40
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:26,287
Then I can go to school today.

41
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:28,087
-You can't. -What?

42
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:31,487
You can't be too careful when you're getting over a cold.

43
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:34,587
Besides, your face is still a little red.

44
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:36,587
Huh?

45
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:40,187
In any case, you're staying in bed today.

46
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:41,588
Okay.

47
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:44,987
Dad, I'll see you later.

48
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:47,587
Okay!

49
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,688
I managed to trick her.

50
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:55,588
I should double-check my messages.

51
00:04:57,188 --> 00:04:58,188
"From: Ran. Subject: Thanks for the message."

52
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,387
Thanks for the message.

53
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:04,888
This means we're dating, right?

54
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,187
Yes! It's not a dream!

55
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:10,788
It wasn't a dream!

56
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:16,587
I'm hungry.

57
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:19,287
I only had porridge this morning.

58
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,987
I guess I'll wait for an opportunity to slip out

59
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,088
and get something to eat at Dr. Agasa's.

60
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:29,388
And I'd better give him these.

61
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:34,587
These are yatsuhashi!

62
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:37,687
I love these! Thank you!

63
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,087
Share them with Haibara.

64
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:44,687
In return, make sure you keep your story straight.

65
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:47,787
They think I was stuck in bed here for three days.

66
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:49,387
Of course.

67
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,687
So, how was the trip?

68
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:55,487
Did anything good happen?

69
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,688
I guess.

70
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:02,887
More importantly, I saw a bunch of people out front.

71
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,787
Was there some kind of case around here?

72
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:07,388
I'm not sure.

73
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:10,588
"Incoming Call, Ai Haibara."

74
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,488
Haibara's calling me?

75
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:16,288
Hello?

76
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,187
I told you not to draw attention to yourself!

77
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:22,487
Everyone's talking about you online!

78
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:23,488
What?

79
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:27,088
"High school detective Shinichi Kudo solves the case!"

80
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,588
"The rumors that he's dead were wrong!"

81
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:33,987
They're talking about me online?

82
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:37,088
This isn't good! The news has spread everywhere!

83
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:44,288
Which means the activity outside is...

84
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:49,587
Please, Mr. Kudo! Give us a comment!

85
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:52,687
Your son is big news right now!

86
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:56,987
I told you, I'm just staying here.

87
00:06:56,988 --> 00:07:00,387
I've never met their son.

88
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:04,887
But the Kudos have told you about Shinichi, haven't they?

89
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:06,987
Do you have anything to say about him?

90
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:09,788
But I really don't have anything to tell you.

91
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:12,687
Gosh! I messed up!

92
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,887
We have to do something.

93
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:18,587
I hear Dr. Agasa's voice. You're at his house, aren't you?

94
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:22,387
Stay there until I get back.

95
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,687
I'll come up with a plan.

96
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,088
Hey.

97
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:30,787
Haibara.

98
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:34,887
You live with Hiroshi Agasa.

99
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,187
His neighbors are the Kudos, aren't they?

100
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:39,587
Yes.

101
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:44,987
Have you ever met their son Shinichi?

102
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:47,587
No, I haven't.

103
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:49,188
Why?

104
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,688
There she is. Ai!

105
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:58,787
Everyone's talking about him right now.

106
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,488
I just thought I'd ask.

107
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:03,787
What's going on?

108
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:06,987
What were you talking about?

109
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,287
Nothing important.

110
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,887
There you are.

111
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:15,487
About Maria Higashio...

112
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:18,287
Come to think of it, she wasn't at school today.

113
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:19,687
Did something happen?

114
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:22,387
Did she eat too much and upset her stomach?

115
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:26,187
We actually don't know why she didn't come to school.

116
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:29,887
I thought you kids might've heard something.

117
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,687
We haven't heard anything.

118
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:34,387
Did you contact her parents?

119
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:38,687
Yes. They both work,

120
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:42,087
so I called their offices.

121
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,087
Both of them were away from their desks,

122
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:47,187
so I haven't been able to get in touch with them.

123
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:48,587
What?

124
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:49,887
I'm worried about her,

125
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:53,187
so could you go to Maria's house and check on her?

126
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:56,587
I'll head there as soon as I finish up my work.

127
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:58,487
-Yeah! -Sure.

128
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,587
You can count on us.

129
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:03,387
Anyway, I'm going to be late.

130
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:04,787
See you then.

131
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:06,188
Wait, Haibara!

132
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:19,188
"Higashio."

133
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:21,887
No one's answering.

134
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:24,487
And it's locked.

135
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:27,287
You guys really have no idea?

136
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:28,587
No.

137
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:32,987
Wasn't she looking forward to having curry for lunch today?

138
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:35,087
Now that you mention it,

139
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:38,487
she said she found a letter from her dead grandma

140
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:42,488
in her desk drawer the other day.

141
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,987
It sounds like Grandma

142
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:49,588
set up a treasure hunt in her house for me.

143
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:53,987
Do you guys want to invite Conan

144
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,187
and look for it together sometime?

145
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,888
Sure, let's do it.

146
00:09:58,588 --> 00:10:01,787
She told me about it yesterday.

147
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:05,587
Then it's likely she went to look for the treasure.

148
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:08,587
Did she say where her grandmother's house is?

149
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:12,087
Yeah. She said it was across the street,

150
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:13,587
so that's probably it.

151
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:14,987
"Higashio."

152
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:16,587
Higashio?

153
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:18,987
-That must be it. -Yeah.

154
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:21,688
-Shall we go check it out? -Yeah.

155
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,187
This house is unlocked.

156
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:30,287
What?

157
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:31,488
You're right.

158
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:37,387
It's Maria's shoes and backpack.

159
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:41,187
Looks like she came here before going to school.

160
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:42,787
Why?

161
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:45,187
To check things out before our treasure hunt?

162
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:46,487
Huh?

163
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:51,087
There's a note next to the welcome mat.

164
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:56,287
It says, "Start! Maria, good luck!"

165
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,887
I see.

166
00:10:57,888 --> 00:11:02,187
So this arrow points in the direction of the treasure

167
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:05,588
or a hint to its location.

168
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:17,388
This isn't good. The crowd keeps growing.

169
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:22,387
"#FightingRedTenguMurder" -Looks like they're here

170
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,588
because of this post.

171
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:28,988
This person writes a blog, too.

172
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:37,387
"Self-proclaimed world's biggest Kudo family fan"?

173
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:38,687
"Yusaku Kudo, Shinichi Kudo, Yukiko Kudo."

174
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,587
"Let's discuss everything there is

175
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:43,488
to know about my beloved Kudo family"?

176
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,988
This isn't good.

177
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,387
"Higashio"

178
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:51,487
I found something.

179
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:52,687
Over there.

180
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:54,387
What?

181
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:55,887
You're right.

182
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:58,887
That's a huge arrow.

183
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:03,087
She must've made it obvious since it's for a child.

184
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,687
There's another note.

185
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:08,887
"Good grooming habits are essential for girls!"

186
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:11,787
"Did you check for bed head?"

187
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:13,987
What a nice grandma.

188
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:15,887
But...

189
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:19,387
the cosmetics in front of the mirror have been knocked over.

190
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:22,887
Maybe Maria did her makeup after reading this.

191
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,887
No. The cosmetics probably fell over

192
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:30,187
because of the earthquake this afternoon.

193
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:33,987
The problem is if we follow this arrow,

194
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:38,687
it takes us back to the first arrow we found in the entryway.

195
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:42,687
There must be another arrow hidden at the entrance.

196
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,487
Like inside the shoe cupboard?

197
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:49,287
This reminds me of the arrow code Dr. Agasa hid in that mansion.

198
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:51,887
-I know. -Yeah.

199
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,587
Arrow code?

200
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:56,887
It was before you transferred.

201
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:58,887
If you followed the arrows,

202
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:00,587
you eventually arrived at a treasure chest.

203
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:04,488
But there was actually another code hidden there.

204
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:09,887
In any case, let's look for the other arrow at the entrance.

205
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:11,388
-Okay. -Okay.

206
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:16,687
Maria will surely be at the end of the arrows.

207
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,888
Yeah.

208
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:26,788
"Good grooming habits are essential for girls."

209
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:32,688
"Good grooming habits are essential for girls."

210
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:39,388
"Did you check for bed head?"

211
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:49,088
This is...

212
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:55,012
"Higashio."

213
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:56,812
Where is it?

214
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:01,811
There aren't any arrows anywhere.

215
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:04,611
There wasn't even one under the welcome mat.

216
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:08,511
Maybe Maria found it and took it with her.

217
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,811
I figured it out.

218
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:14,811
The second arrow isn't pointing at the entryway.

219
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,411
What?

220
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:19,311
This code isn't that simple.

221
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:23,711
This grandmother's code won't be that easy to solve.

222
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,711
And don't forget to clean up over there.

223
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:28,512
Okay...

224
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:34,111
Don't you think this arrow's shape is a little off?

225
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:37,211
Yes. It does seem significant.

226
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:42,511
So if you follow the instructions and open the vanity

227
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:44,612
to check for bed head...

228
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,012
See? Another different arrow appears.

229
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:54,311
-You're right! -Wow!

230
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:55,912
Which means...

231
00:14:57,312 --> 00:15:01,411
The arrow is not pointing toward the entryway,

232
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:05,611
but this way, toward this room.

233
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:06,912
Yeah...

234
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:12,012
Maria, are you inside?

235
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,812
I don't hear anything.

236
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,911
It opened?

237
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:25,512
I'm coming in.

238
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:36,011
The bookcase fell!

239
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:39,911
Oh, right. It fell during this afternoon's earthquake.

240
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:43,011
Is Maria trapped under there?

241
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:45,211
Let's get it back up!

242
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,311
Yeah...

243
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,911
On three. One...

244
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:49,912
Two...

245
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:51,912
And three!

246
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,411
Maria!

247
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,411
Huh? Maria...

248
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,111
She's not here.

249
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:02,711
That's a relief.

250
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,411
Why did only this bookshelf fall?

251
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:12,711
Maria probably removed the thick encyclopedias from the bottom shelf

252
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:15,011
and used them as a footstool.

253
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,611
They became unbalanced while she was doing something,

254
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,711
so it fell during the earthquake.

255
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,811
But what was she doing?

256
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,911
Look at this.

257
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:26,011
There are two weird boxes stuck here

258
00:16:26,012 --> 00:16:29,412
so they won't fall out even if the bookshelf does.

259
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:35,811
These books on the floor are comics Maria likes.

260
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:39,811
Yes. Volume 82 was recently released.

261
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:43,512
Huh? There's a note inside the book.

262
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:49,011
What is it, Mitsuhiko?

263
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:51,311
What does it say?

264
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:54,211
I'll read it to you.

265
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:57,211
"Don't forget to put things in order."

266
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:58,411
What?

267
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,611
"Don't forget..."

268
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:02,511
"To put things in order"?

269
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:07,511
Is she telling us to clean up this room?

270
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:09,411
No.

271
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:13,311
This note seems to have been stuck to the bookshelf.

272
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:16,411
Maybe she meant for these books on the floor

273
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:19,611
to be put back on the bookshelf.

274
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:24,511
Yeah, but which book goes where?

275
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:29,711
The big books only fit on the bottom shelf.

276
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:33,511
Maria removed the big encyclopedias

277
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:36,711
so she could use them as a stool,

278
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:38,711
so we can ignore them.

279
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:44,311
Let's start by putting these comics,

280
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:48,811
that recently published volume 82, onto the shelves,

281
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:51,512
starting at the top left.

282
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:56,311
But some of the books don't have covers.

283
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:59,011
And she might not have all of them.

284
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:05,211
And the books won't fit on the shelves with the weird boxes.

285
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:09,811
If Maria didn't come to school today,

286
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:12,411
then she probably came to this house before school,

287
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,911
followed the notes left by her grandmother,

288
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,811
and became stuck in some room in this house.

289
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:22,711
It's likely she's been trapped for over six hours.

290
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,311
What?

291
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,311
So let's hurry up and put these books in order,

292
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:30,011
just like the note says.

293
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:32,511
We can worry about the details later.

294
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,611
-Got it. -You're right.

295
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:37,011
Let's split up and start organizing.

296
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,511
Yeah...

297
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:39,612
Hurry.

298
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:48,711
This isn't good, Doc.

299
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,412
There's even a TV broadcast car.

300
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:55,111
But...

301
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:58,411
could one social media post

302
00:18:58,412 --> 00:19:01,811
cause this much of an uproar?

303
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:05,812
It's not like they posted a photo of me.

304
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:10,111
This must be the reason.

305
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:11,411
Huh?

306
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:18,011
Search for images of the Tengu murder from two days ago.

307
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:19,912
Look behind the reporter.

308
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:24,112
It's you and Hattori.

309
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:28,811
I'm right in the shot!

310
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:33,611
The rumor that you were dead had spread quite a bit,

311
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:36,512
leading to this commotion today.

312
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:40,611
Hattori's calling.

313
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,112
-Hello? -You moron!

314
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:47,411
The media barged into my school

315
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:51,511
and demanded I tell them about Kudo!

316
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:54,911
I thought you said you told them to keep quiet.

317
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:58,311
I was seen with you on TV.

318
00:19:58,312 --> 00:20:00,611
What? Are you serious?

319
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:03,811
Anyway, I'll handle things here.

320
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:06,011
You'd better handle things over there.

321
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:07,312
Later.

322
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:11,011
Handle things?

323
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,812
What am I supposed to do?

324
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:21,712
We put the books on the shelf in order, but...

325
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:29,111
I don't get it.

326
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:33,811
But each shelf fits 30 books.

327
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:37,611
Now we know the middle four books on the top

328
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,911
two shelves don't have covers.

329
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:44,811
But the third shelf is a mess.

330
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:47,211
We had to put the books in sideways

331
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,911
because the boxes were in the way.

332
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:53,711
Since the note said to put things in order,

333
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,312
shouldn't we take out the boxes?

334
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:01,812
No.

335
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,712
These boxes are the key.

336
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:12,011
Instead of tilting them in the same direction,

337
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:15,311
if you form a V-shape...

338
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:16,712
See?

339
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,211
It's an arrow!

340
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,012
Wow!

341
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:29,811
But how do we go down?

342
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:32,312
There's no underfloor storage, is there?

343
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:47,011
The basement!

344
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:48,312
What?

345
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:53,812
Look. There's something in the room directly beneath that arrow.

346
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:56,611
Let's go.

347
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:58,112
Okay...

348
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:49,611
"Next Episode" -Don't you think that's a huge group of reporters?

349
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:52,611
Yeah. Did something happen?

350
00:23:52,612 --> 00:23:55,611
The bumpy pattern goes all around the room.

351
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:58,711
But it doesn't look like an arrow.

352
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:01,811
The shadow changed for some reason.

353
00:24:01,812 --> 00:24:03,911
That's it. Which means...

354
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:07,611
What? You still haven't found Maria?

355
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,312
But it's already evening.

356
00:24:11,012 --> 00:24:16,312
Next Conan, "Find Maria (Part 2)"
