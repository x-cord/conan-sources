1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,227
The two coincidentally simultaneous murders were solved,

2
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:09,437
and the old man's lecture concluded without incident.

3
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:16,487
Event guest Kisaki Eri arrived, and the panel was just about to begin

4
00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:23,657
with the last minute addition of a surprising guest...

5
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:26,107
I'm Tsukuba Mei.

6
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:28,517
I look forward to working with you.

7
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,306
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness!

8
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:34,257
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills!

9
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:38,026
The old man and his wife appear on a panel, but a detective girl picks a fight!

10
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:39,646
Always determining the one truth

11
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:41,506
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

12
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:43,557
his name is Detective Conan!

13
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:31,247
Mori Kogoro's Grand Lecture (Part Three)

14
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,999
I'm Tsukuba Mei.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,590
I look forward to working with you.

16
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Tsukuba Mei (22) Event Staff

17
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,189
You're appearing on the panel, too?

18
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,010
Yes.

19
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:47,970
I'm actually studying criminal psychology in college.

20
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,209
So that's why.

21
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,590
I see.

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,489
I asked the president and manager to let me go onstage,

23
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,100
since it seemed like there weren't enough guests for the panel.

24
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,559
What do you think, Mori-sensei?

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,529
I apologize for the change in plans,

26
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,709
but honestly, as the event organizer,

27
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,310
I'd like to do whatever I can to dispel the rumors that will surely spread about the murders.

28
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,620
Kisaki-sensei, what do you think?

29
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,459
Sounds interesting.

30
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,500
I don't mind at all.

31
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,460
Huh?

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,109
Very well. Ask me anything.

33
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,629
As the greatest of great detectives,

34
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,370
I, Mori Kogoro, shall reveal all my secrets.

35
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,759
Thank you!

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,410
Then let's get ready.

37
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,140
Got it.

38
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,939
In here.

39
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,999
Thank you. Could I get a coffee?

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,460
Yes, right away.

41
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,650
Oh.

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,910
What's this?

43
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,910
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,730
That's odd. These scraps of paper weren't here when I cleaned earlier.

45
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,310
Wait!

46
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,120
Don't throw those away!

47
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,810
What?

48
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,919
Thank you for waiting.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,999
We'd now like to move onto the panel.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,810
Due to certain circumstances, we've drastically changed the content of the event.

51
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,590
is the new title we'll be going with.

52
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,879
Allow me to introduce our panelists.

53
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,089
First up is the man who just regaled us with his entertaining stories,

54
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,320
the great detective Mori Kogoro.

55
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,300
Thank you.

56
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,710
Next is the lawyer Kisaki Eri-sensei.

57
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,039
Hello.

58
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,439
We're hoping to get your thoughts from a legal perspective.

59
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,840
Thank you for having me.

60
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,340
Dad, Mom!

61
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,709
Finally, representing us as a special guest

62
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,629
is the new generation's detective girl,

63
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,360
and student of criminal psychology, Tsukuba Mei-san.

64
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,360
Hello.

65
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,870
The game should be over by now if it didn't go into overtime.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
All right. The next step is...

67
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,369
That was a great game!

68
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,250
I thought it'd go into overtime, but then they made that comeback with a header!

69
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,000
So cool!

70
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,519
But Conan-kun and Ai-chan never showed up.

71
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,550
I wonder why?

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,060
I know. They could've reached out to us.

73
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,060
Then they'll be treating us to extra large eel bowls!

74
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,320
What? Oh, no.

75
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,119
We've been waiting for you, Detective Boys.

76
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,580
Conan-kun, Ai-chan.

77
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,329
What's going on?

78
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,129
Is it true that there were two murders here?

79
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,299
Depending on your answer, you might also owe us giant pork buns!

80
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,010
Just come inside.

81
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,999
We found three of these in different locations.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,370
Two were at crime scenes, and the other was in Kisaki-san's changing room.

83
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,589
Ran-oneesan's mom?

84
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,230
What is this?

85
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,189
Probably some kind of message or code.

86
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,230
A code?

87
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,329
Which means there must be a codebook for deciphering it.

88
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,739
A codebook?

89
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,309
I know!

90
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,489
It's a set of rules for letters or sentences

91
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,009
that appear randomly organized showing how rearranging them according to certain rules

92
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,409
or removing certain sections creates a meaningful message, right?

93
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,750
That's right.

94
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,010
It's what?

95
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,749
For example, if the menu of your favorite eel restaurant were a codebook,

96
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,389
if you removed only the letters in "eel bowl" (unaju)

97
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,769
or "liver soup" (kimosui) from a sentence that appears random...

98
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,209
Oh, I see.

99
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,029
In other words, we need to find an eel restaurant's menu.

100
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,359
You can count on us!

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,030
No!

102
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,280
We're looking for the magazine these pages were torn from.

103
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,280
It should be someplace visible.

104
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,040
Why?

105
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,709
It's a long story.

106
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,469
But if we don't hurry, I have a feeling something terrible will happen.

107
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,040
So let's find that magazine first.

108
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,609
Got it.

109
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,539
The Detective Boys are on the case.

110
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,680
All right! I'm not sure what's going on, but let's do this!

111
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,679
Yeah!

112
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,550
Event Schedule

113
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Beika City History

114
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,570
Next, new generation's girl detective Tsukuba Mei-san,

115
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,459
it seems you have some questions for the Sleeping Kogoro.

116
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,960
Oh, yes!

117
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,909
My friend asked me about a murder

118
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,580
that happened at a certain college one year ago.

119
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,710
What?

120
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,319
I see. Why don't you tell us the details?

121
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,210
All right.

122
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,050
Research Lab

123
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,609
The victim was a professor at the college.

124
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,069
The police arrested the professor's assistant,

125
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,399
who was also the older brother of my friend.

126
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,229
Allegedly his motive was the professor claimed a paper he had written

127
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,980
was plagiarized from his own work and threatened to ruin his career.

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,980
You...

129
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,980
Huh?

130
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,189
Nothing.

131
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,409
Come to think of it, that did happen.

132
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,349
The suspect confessed to his crime, and he was found guilty in court.

133
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,499
I don't think there was any problem with the case.

134
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,980
There's a huge problem!

135
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,370
I found it! This is it!

136
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,910
Look at this.

137
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,130
This is definitely it.

138
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,809
Caseweek, huh?

139
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,889
Caseweek?

140
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,140
That's a famous American news magazine.

141
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,889
But this is in Japanese.

142
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,159
Does that mean it's the Japanese version?

143
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,150
The American edition and the Japanese edition...

144
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,430
English and Japanese...

145
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,160
I see. So that's how it is.

146
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,139
I've cracked the code!

147
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,589
Really?

148
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,030
There's also this.

149
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,670
University Professor Murdered

150
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,920
And that.

151
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,029
A huge problem?

152
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,359
Yes.

153
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,430
The murder of the professor at that college isn't over yet.

154
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,810
There's no doubt that Ashida Hiroto, who's currently serving time, was the murderer.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,680
Even by my deduction.

156
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,589
But my friend can't believe he'd steal another person's paper,

157
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,690
much less kill someone over one.

158
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
I see. Is that right?

159
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Takagi, I have an urgent request.

160
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,919
But ultimately, he offered no other testimony at his trial,

161
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,120
and no appeal was made.

162
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,210
Why would he do that?

163
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,499
I'd like you to determine that, Mori-san.

164
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,140
What?

165
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,470
I'm not sure what you expect me to do.

166
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,739
Of course.

167
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,979
You couldn't possibly know.

168
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,870
Huh?

169
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,689
After all, you're a hack who couldn't even decipher the mystery message

170
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,730
left at the crime scene!

171
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:57,083
Is that true, Takagi?

172
00:10:57,084 --> 00:11:00,174
Yes. You were right, Mori-san.

173
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:03,393
Got it. Contact the inspector.

174
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,233
Have him return immediately.

175
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:07,453
Tell him this case isn't over yet.

176
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:09,434
I-It's what?

177
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:13,354
Also, Takagi, could you do one other thing?

178
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:16,393
Where did Conan-kun go?

179
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:17,314
Over there.

180
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:19,604
What's up with Conan?

181
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,053
Haibara-san?

182
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,614
Wait, Ai-chan!

183
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,614
Why didn't he make an appeal?

184
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:30,114
Because he lost hope. He was betrayed.

185
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:33,244
Betrayed? By who?

186
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:39,133
By his irresponsible court-appointed lawyer who quit his case!

187
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:40,504
I knew it!

188
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:42,284
Lawyer?

189
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,254
Could it be?

190
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:50,593
Yes. She's talking about me.

191
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:53,503
And you're Mei-san, the younger sister of Ashida Hiroto-san,

192
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:58,024
the man currently serving time in prison.

193
00:11:58,374 --> 00:11:59,774
Sh-She's what?!

194
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:04,733
In other words, you're not talking about your friend.

195
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,284
You're talking about yourself, Mei-san.

196
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:08,873
That's right.

197
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:13,374
I believe Tsukuba was your mother's maiden name.

198
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:18,794
And you're studying criminal psychology at an American university.

199
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:23,313
I remember now that I heard you've been studying abroad since two years ago.

200
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:24,924
When did you return?

201
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:26,924
A week ago.

202
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:29,583
Why didn't you contact me?

203
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:34,353
Because I didn't want to hear your excuses!

204
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,554
Hey, wait!

205
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:37,264
What are you trying to do?

206
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:49,694
I've deciphered the coded message, Mei-san.

207
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,244
Don't do anything hasty.

208
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:53,724
That's it!

209
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:54,953
He's asleep!

210
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,284
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

211
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:01,294
Dad...

212
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:04,453
Then decipher it for me, detective.

213
00:13:04,454 --> 00:13:05,933
Very well.

214
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:10,804
I just received word from someone who found the codebook.

215
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:16,184
The layered pages torn from the Japanese edition of Caseweek

216
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:19,523
were pages 11 and 9,

217
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:25,694
19 and 1, and 11 and 9 again.

218
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,953
When applied to the alphabet,

219
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:33,264
11 corresponds to K and 9 corresponds to I, spelling KI.

220
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:37,323
19 is S and 1 is A, spelling SA.

221
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:40,364
Finally, the last code is the same as the first, spelling KI.

222
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:42,173
When read all together,

223
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:47,044
they spell K-I-S-A-K-I, or Kisaki.

224
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:48,544
C-Could it be?

225
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,244
In other words, I was her target.

226
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,554
But in that case...

227
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:54,404
Yes.

228
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:56,554
She could've acted anytime.

229
00:14:04,664 --> 00:14:06,344
But she didn't.

230
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:12,794
She deliberately left a message and even had us find the codebook,

231
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:14,944
which featured an article on the case.

232
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:17,824
Conan, where did you find the codebook?

233
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:19,323
I'm here!

234
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:22,283
The Detective Boys will answer that.

235
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:23,454
Mitsuhiko.

236
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,623
Oh, uh, well...

237
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:35,173
It was inside her locker.

238
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,293
Mitsuhiko-kun found it.

239
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,594
That's right.

240
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:40,824
I found it!

241
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:43,854
Tsukuba

242
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:48,713
Why did she leave it someplace so obvious?

243
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:51,683
Because she wanted me

244
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:56,864
to reveal her brother's true motive.

245
00:14:57,184 --> 00:14:59,753
And perhaps, if possible,

246
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:04,224
to stop her from doing what she's about to do.

247
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:08,874
So you figured out his true motive.

248
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:13,004
Not even I know that.

249
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:15,264
What? Don't be ridiculous!

250
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:19,764
But I can identify someone who does know.

251
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:21,974
Who?

252
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:26,733
First, as far as I know, she may have been appointed by the court,

253
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:30,774
but Kisaki-sensei would never step down from a case.

254
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:35,674
She was probably dismissed by your brother.

255
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,284
What? Why?

256
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:42,734
Because she identified his true motive.

257
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:45,664
Don't speak.

258
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,313
What do you mean?

259
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:52,414
In order to plead extenuating circumstances, it would have to be revealed in court.

260
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,424
But your brother refused.

261
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:58,573
So he dismissed her.

262
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,573
Silence, Mori Kogoro!

263
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:02,753
Say anymore, and I'll sue!

264
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,303
Be my guest.

265
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:07,124
But allow me to say this.

266
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:11,903
Even after she was dismissed, rather than moving on,

267
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,634
she continued investigating the case.

268
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:18,234
But why?

269
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:22,623
She was probably searching for documents

270
00:16:22,624 --> 00:16:26,083
demonstrating extenuating circumstances that didn't touch on his true motive.

271
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,754
You're lying! That's just an excuse!

272
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:38,174
Mom! Dad!

273
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:44,434
This is bad!

274
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:53,813
What's going on?

275
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,944
Calm down, everyone!

276
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:06,653
Kisaki-sensei, unless you reveal his true motive now,

277
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:08,774
she won't put down the knife.

278
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:16,683
At first she only joined the staff of my event

279
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:18,544
so she could get close to you.

280
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:22,323
But by chance, two murders occurred.

281
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:28,414
She decided to use them to confront you more effectively.

282
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:34,703
So she tore pages from the magazine featuring an article

283
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:37,644
on her brother's case that she always carried with her and left a coded message,

284
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:44,494
all so she could use me to reveal the truth about the case and tell it to the world.

285
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:47,744
Is that true?

286
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:52,004
You really are a great detective.

287
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:56,733
But I'm a lawyer.

288
00:17:56,734 --> 00:18:00,843
I'd never do anything to harm a client.

289
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:03,514
Of course not. However,

290
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:08,094
someday the one truth will be revealed.

291
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,274
Is that not natural as well?

292
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:38,794
Your brother's true motive was you, Mei-san.

293
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,044
What?

294
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:45,933
The truth uncovered by Kisaki was shocking.

295
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:50,054
The plagiarism thought to be his motive for murder was actually the reverse.

296
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:56,514
It was the professor who stole Mei-san's brother's paper.

297
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,913
When he went to complain,

298
00:18:58,914 --> 00:19:02,574
the professor revealed the dark secret behind Mei-san's study abroad program.

299
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:07,423
Her recommendation had been bought by her mother,

300
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:09,444
who had passed away the previous year from an illness.

301
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:12,034
He threatened to expose the truth.

302
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:16,204
N-No... My mom?

303
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,624
You mustn't blame your mother.

304
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,754
She was just trying to do what was best for you.

305
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:28,014
Kisaki's investigation revealed even more.

306
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:34,014
Her mother only made the bribe because that professor had urged her to do so.

307
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,774
Furthermore, he demanded even more money if he didn't want the situation exposed

308
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:42,234
after you concluded your study abroad program.

309
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,274
M-My brother!

310
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,183
Your brother kept his silence to protect you

311
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:52,794
and your mother without concern for himself.

312
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:01,294
I... had no idea...

313
00:20:04,774 --> 00:20:08,064
I... I...

314
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:18,064
Ouch...

315
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:19,734
Huh?

316
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:21,734
Don't!

317
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:28,324
Let go! Let me die!

318
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:31,283
Listen to this, Mei-san!

319
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:33,034
Mori-san, this is Takagi!

320
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:33,994
Huh?

321
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:40,753
As you instructed, I met with Ashiya Hiroto.

322
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:43,773
He'd like to hire Kisaki-sensei again.

323
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:45,294
He'll rescind her dismissal.

324
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:46,494
What?

325
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:49,554
When I told him about the situation,

326
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:54,694
he apologized for making his sister worry.

327
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:57,804
Brother...

328
00:21:02,664 --> 00:21:03,814
Good grief.

329
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:05,814
Mori-san!

330
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,014
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

331
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:14,564
Now we can request a retrial.

332
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:16,824
Wait a minute...

333
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,143
You're just a detective. You should've stayed out of this!

334
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,204
What?

335
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:24,214
This is really bad.

336
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,283
It wasn't because I'm just a detective.

337
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:31,464
I had to do it because I'm a detective.

338
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:39,224
Dad, Mom...

339
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:09,193
The retrial began,

340
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:14,154
but it was unclear if the defendant's extenuating circumstances would be recognized or not.

341
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:18,114
I'm sure he'll be fine.

342
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,743
After all, he's got the best lawyer on his side.

343
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:21,984
Yeah.

344
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:25,554
I still can't remember what happened.

345
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:33,134
Well, whatever. That's nothing new, and beer still tastes good.

346
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:40,023
Don't compare detective work to beer.

347
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:42,664
Although it all works out because he's that kind of guy.

348
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:47,613
Hello, everyone.

349
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:56,154
Thank you for coming to the "Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba" announcement event.

350
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:57,903
Heiji!

351
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:58,784
What?

352
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:01,663
Let's take a picture with Gomera.

353
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:02,784
Sheesh.

354
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:08,924
Wh-What's this?!

355
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:14,744
The next episode of Conan is "Kaiju Gomera versus Kamen Yaiba, Prologue!"
