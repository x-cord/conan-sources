1
00:00:01,227 --> 00:00:03,427
In order to catch up with the members of the Youth Detective Squad

2
00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:05,427
who went before us by bus,

3
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:09,427
Ai and I were given a lift on Subaru's car.

4
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:13,227
We ran into Officer Takagi on the way, I stopped to talk to him when...

5
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:14,727
He fell!

6
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:15,827
Somebody fell!

7
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:17,127
Let's go to the site.

8
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:19,027
Come on, hurry.

9
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,427
When we get to the site,

10
00:00:20,427 --> 00:00:24,027
we see the body that had fallen from the top floor of the condo.

11
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:28,327
Since three people who knew the man who fell were near the site,

12
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,327
we visited the rooms of each of these people

13
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:32,527
to ask them some questions but...

14
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:34,727
How about this?

15
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:37,927
There's still this much beer foam left here.

16
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:39,327
It's because I was drinking beer

17
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,927
and watching TV till just a while ago.

18
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:43,127
I see.

19
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,627
This coffee?

20
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:50,227
That's the coffee I was drinking before I left the room.

21
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:53,327
I can't start my day without my morning coffee.

22
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:56,427
Then, this will for the time being, serve as proof.

23
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:59,727
There still some steam rising from it too.

24
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,327
Hurry and look officer!

25
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,127
Please calm down.

26
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:06,427
After I heard about the steam of Ms. Tsukihara's coffee a while ago,

27
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,027
I happened to remember.

28
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:13,227
No good. They're all snuffed out.

29
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:16,727
I left the cigarette standing in the ashtray when I left the room,

30
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:20,327
so I thought it'd still be lit, but...

31
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,827
Please look, see.

32
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:24,127
The smoke's still rising, isn't it?

33
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:27,527
This is proof that I was here till just a while ago.

34
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:30,727
The things that will serve as proof of the alibis are...

35
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:34,927
foam, steam, and smoke.

36
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:37,327
Inspector Megure.

37
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:40,927
Why don't we experiment while we're at it?

38
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:42,427
Experiment?

39
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:45,827
Yes, an experiment with foam, steam, and smoke.

40
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:48,527
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

41
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:50,427
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

42
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:52,527
A perfect trick that erased all traces.

43
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:54,527
The experiment proves false alibi.

44
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:56,227
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,427
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,727
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:46,506
"Foam, Steam, and Smoke (Part 2)"

48
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,206
Well, just as Conan said...

49
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,706
If the room temperature is low,

50
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:54,206
I think that steam would hold longer but...

51
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:57,706
The room temperature here is 27～C?

52
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,306
"Kaori Tsukihara" -When I entered this room together with you officers,

53
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,606
I didn't touch the remote controller of the air conditioner, did I?

54
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:06,006
No, you didn't.

55
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:08,506
No matter how many times we do it,

56
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:10,706
the steam becomes invisible after about 8 minutes.

57
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:13,606
Then, when you heard the noise and left the room,

58
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:16,306
was there anything you noticed?

59
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:19,806
Like see someone suspicious or hear something queer.

60
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,006
I wonder...

61
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:22,506
It seems that the people on the upper floors

62
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:25,006
were trying to go down using the elevator,

63
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:27,106
so it didn't come for a while.

64
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:29,406
So, I went down using the stairs,

65
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:31,706
but I didn't see anyone suspicious.

66
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,406
Any noise, then?

67
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,906
Well...

68
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:37,606
Just before I left the room,

69
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:41,006
I heard the sound of a bell from Mr. Ogino's room next door.

70
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:43,106
Oh, that bell...

71
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:47,306
It's the alarm clock by the pillow at the bedside.

72
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:49,106
When I'm not staking out,

73
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:51,406
I always get up at 7:30 am.

74
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:54,006
Well, but last night I got up in the middle of the night

75
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:56,606
and was watching the soccer broadcast from abroad.

76
00:04:58,106 --> 00:05:01,806
"Keisuke Ogino (34)" -And? What about the foam in the beer?

77
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:05,206
I tried several glasses.

78
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:08,906
The foams seem to disappear after 6 minutes or so.

79
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:11,206
By the way, when you left the room,

80
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:13,606
did you see or hear anything?

81
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:14,906
Come to think of it,

82
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:16,706
when I was going down the stairs,

83
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:20,306
I heard Sodesaki below, going down.

84
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:23,506
He always carries a bunch of keys on his hip

85
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:26,506
and when he moves they jingle.

86
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,506
Yes, I wear them,

87
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:30,306
the bunch of keys. See.

88
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,406
You sure have a lot of keys, don't you?

89
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:36,606
"Kazutomo Sodezaki (31)" -For my house, my car, my office,

90
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,906
my bicycle and the key for my safe.

91
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:42,106
For cigarettes to burn to ashes completely.

92
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:43,706
It would take a little less than 9 minutes.

93
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:48,406
Your cigarette was on the verge of burning completely, wasn't it?

94
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:49,506
Yes.

95
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:50,806
If so, it would mean

96
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:54,806
that you left the room for around 9 minutes or so.

97
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:56,906
Of course.

98
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:59,206
You officers came to my room

99
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:01,806
after you checked Mr. Ogino's room and all.

100
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:04,406
Then, when you came out of the room,

101
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,606
was there anything that bothered you?

102
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,406
A sound or a person.

103
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:10,406
A sound...

104
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:11,806
When I got to the site,

105
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:14,906
I heard Ms. Tsukihara's cell phone's ringtone

106
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,606
among the spectators, that's about it.

107
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:18,706
Who was the call from?

108
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:23,206
She told me it was from the cameraman in charge.

109
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:27,206
Something about a scoop picture or something.

110
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,706
I see.

111
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,606
What shall we do about those three, inspector?

112
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,406
They all have enough motive,

113
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:41,006
I guess we'll have them interrogated a bit longer.

114
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,006
An alarm clock,

115
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:47,106
a bunch of keys and a cell phone ringtone...

116
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,506
Those three said that?

117
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:54,706
Yes, they're each going through interrogation individually.

118
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,506
And? How did the experiment work out?

119
00:06:57,506 --> 00:07:00,006
The beer foam lasted for about 6 minutes.

120
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:02,206
The steam, about 8 minutes

121
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:05,406
and the cigarette smoke about 9 minutes.

122
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:08,206
So, room temperature had nothing to do with it.

123
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:12,206
Officer Takagi, you look sleepy.

124
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,306
Well, sort of.

125
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:14,506
I was staking out all night,

126
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:16,906
and didn't get to sleep right through after that.

127
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:19,506
If I use the eye drops that Chiba always uses,

128
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,806
I can pretend to look a bit sharp but...

129
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:25,406
He's still staking out.

130
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:27,806
Pretend?

131
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:32,406
Come to think of it,

132
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:35,006
pops told me once before.

133
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:37,006
How about it, surprised?

134
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:40,406
I used to do this when I was a poor student.

135
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:44,106
I see. I get it.

136
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:46,706
So, he's the culprit after all.

137
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:49,206
Do you think it'll really be okay, Conan?

138
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:53,006
I've got to start heading home soon.

139
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,206
Would you like me to give you a lift?

140
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,406
I'll be fine, because I have a car waiting for me.

141
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:00,706
Besides, if you hear what I have to say,

142
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:03,306
I'm sure that you'll end up going back again

143
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:04,706
to that condo.

144
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:11,206
I wonder if this the first time...

145
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:14,206
that I've been with you, just the two of us.

146
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:17,706
Come to think of it, I guess so.

147
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,306
I don't really feel right

148
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:21,006
parking right outside The Metropolitan Police Department.

149
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,906
But, since I have to wait for him,

150
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:24,606
what do you say,

151
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:26,806
I move the car to the parking lot and we wait inside the car?

152
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,406
If you want to do so why don't you force me to do so?

153
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:33,806
I would never force you to do anything.

154
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,406
Because I gave her my word.

155
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:41,406
Then, I'm sorry,

156
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:43,206
but could you both wait for me there.

157
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:46,106
I'm sure that I can be back in about 30 minutes so.

158
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:52,506
I tell you... why can't you just leave it up to the police?

159
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:57,106
Rather, are you sure you don't want to wait in the car?

160
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:59,206
You might catch a cold.

161
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,406
I'll be fine.

162
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:04,506
Like they say, children love the cold.

163
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:09,906
Hey, hey, it's already pass 7:00 in the evening.

164
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:13,106
This is getting us nowhere.

165
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:15,006
I mean you tried it out many times

166
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:16,806
before going to interrogation at the police, didn't you?

167
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,706
Why do we have to return and check the time again?

168
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:23,306
All my cigarettes are gone already.

169
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:26,906
After the incident when I returned to my room with the officer,

170
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:30,306
the foam of the beer was still in the glass, wasn't it?

171
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:33,506
Steam from my coffee was still rising too.

172
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,006
The smoke from my cigarette was still rising, wasn't it?

173
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:39,806
Aren't all these proof that we were all in our rooms

174
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:42,806
until right before the incident happened?

175
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:47,206
Rather, why are you doing that experiment in my room?

176
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:51,006
I also wondered about that, but Officer Takagi...

177
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:54,206
Because we'll find out if we stay here...

178
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,406
who the culprit is.

179
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,206
Conan?

180
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:03,406
Well, the first ones who entered the room were Officer Takagi

181
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:05,206
and I so we realized it.

182
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,506
Really?

183
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:09,106
Yes, sir.

184
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:11,806
What did you realize?

185
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:15,006
Conan, wasn't the one who saw through the truth,

186
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:18,206
not us two, but Shinichi Kudo.

187
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:21,806
That's why if we carry everything out the way Shinichi said we should,

188
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,206
everything will work out.

189
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,706
"When the time ripens,

190
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:29,306
the traces that the culprit failed to erase will emerge."

191
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:32,388
That's what Shinichi wrote in his mail to me.

192
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,120
Conan, wasn't the one who saw through the truth,

193
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,420
not us two, but Shinichi Kudo.

194
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,020
That's why if we carry everything out the way Shinichi said we should,

195
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,420
everything will work out.

196
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,720
"When the time ripens,

197
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,520
the traces that the culprit failed to erase will emerge."

198
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,320
That's what Shinichi wrote in his mail to me.

199
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,720
If so, I wonder why he didn't call Inspector Megure directly

200
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,420
and tell him the truth?

201
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,520
Hey. I don't know what you're up to

202
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,720
but I hope you saying that, "we'll find out if we stay here"

203
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,220
doesn't mean that you think that I'm the one

204
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,420
who killed President Katsumoto?

205
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
No.

206
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,520
The culprit avoided the surveillance camera

207
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,620
in the elevator and used the stairs, right?

208
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,620
If I'm the one who pushed President Katsumoto off the 26th floor,

209
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,320
there's no way that I could've run over to the place

210
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,020
in front of the condo where Katsumoto was found before these two.

211
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,820
Right? I was the first to be there, wasn't I?

212
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,120
Yes. When I got there,

213
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,520
Ms. Tsukihara was already among the spectators.

214
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Then, why did you get there later than she did, Mr. Sodesaki?

215
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,020
You also went there after hearing someone shout,

216
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,020
"Somebody fell!" didn't you?

217
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,220
Why?

218
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
I was right in the midst of writing an article,

219
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,020
and wasn't about to stop in the middle.

220
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,420
But, I was only a minute or two late.

221
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,620
Then, what about you Mr. Ogino,

222
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,220
that arrived at the scene later than Mr. Sodesaki?

223
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,220
It was a scene that I couldn't afford not watching,

224
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,320
so I couldn't leave right away.

225
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,820
Because I was watching the soccer game on TV.

226
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,320
What scene couldn't you afford not to see?

227
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,120
I forgot.

228
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,220
I think a super pass was made or something,

229
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,920
a corner kick... or it could've been anything.

230
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,820
Which means that you were absorbed

231
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,520
in watching the soccer game, right, Mr. Ogino?

232
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,020
Yes, that's right.

233
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,720
So much that I almost couldn't hear the noise outside.

234
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,320
If so...

235
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,920
Wasn't it noisy?

236
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,520
The bell of the alarm clock?

237
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,120
Come to think of it,

238
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,920
I heard it when I left the room to go check the noise outside.

239
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,220
This bell is the sound of the alarm clock in your room, isn't it?

240
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Yes, most probably.

241
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,320
It's 7:30 in the evening now.

242
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,220
I heard that you always set your alarm to ring at 7:30 in the morning.

243
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,420
Why is it ringing even now?

244
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,820
It's because you left the bell ringing without stopping it,

245
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
and made it stop on its own?

246
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,420
In other words, that's proof that you weren't in your room back then.

247
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,120
You couldn't have been calmly watching a soccer game in this room

248
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,720
with the alarm ringing as loud as it was.

249
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,020
So loud that it could be heard all the way to this room next door.

250
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,720
Well, you could've been concerned of the noise outside,

251
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,420
and it's understandable if you left the room

252
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,320
without taking note of the alarm ringing in your room.

253
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,220
If so, you would've at least had to be at the site

254
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,620
before Mr. Sodesaki, no?

255
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,720
How about it?

256
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,120
Oh, that's right.

257
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,220
I remember.

258
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,120
The john, I went to the men's room.

259
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,320
Back then, I was doing my thing in the john.

260
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
I thought the alarm clock was ringing

261
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,920
but I couldn't stop it.

262
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,320
I heard somebody say, "Somebody fell!" before I went to the john,

263
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,920
and was concerned, but I couldn't hold it any longer.

264
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,020
And, you mean the alarm had stopped after you came out of the restroom

265
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,520
and headed for the site then?

266
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,120
Yes. After watching soccer for a while though.

267
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,420
Darn, his story's consistent.

268
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,020
And besides, didn't you say, officer...

269
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,420
If I were the culprit, used the stairs,

270
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,720
went up 23 floors to the president's room to push him off,

271
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,120
and ran down the stairs to the first floor.

272
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
It would mean that my room would've been empty

273
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,620
for more than 10 minutes until you came to my room.

274
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,920
The foam of the beer would've been gone,

275
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,520
like that beer, if left as is for 10 minutes.

276
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,420
But when you came to my room, officer,

277
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,220
there was still a lot of foam in my beer glass, wasn't there?

278
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,920
Or, are you insinuating

279
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,420
that I used magic or something to make the beer foam?

280
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,120
Abracadabra.

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,120
How strange. There's so much foam.

282
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,320
The foam should've been gone and yet why?

283
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,120
I poured in the salt that I found in the kitchen of this room.

284
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,420
If you pour salt into beer, will it foam up?

285
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,820
If it's any type of grain that sinks in beer,

286
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,620
I guess anything will do whether it's sugar, sand, and so on.

287
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,820
The point is, when it sinks,

288
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,920
and a lot of space is created between the air and beer,

289
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,920
carbon dioxide seems to gather there, and create foams.

290
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
So, see.

291
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,520
In the other beer glasses where the foams have disappeared,

292
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
if you pour salt into them...

293
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,420
-True. -Wow.

294
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,220
But, Conan, it's amazing that you knew something like this.

295
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,920
Pops Kogoro told me about it once.

296
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,020
How about it, surprised?

297
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,720
When I was a poor student,

298
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,220
I used to use this method a lot.

299
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,320
When he was a university student he was poor,

300
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,720
so he used to pour in salt occasionally so people wouldn't notice

301
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,820
that he was sipping beer that lost all foam.

302
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,120
By the way,

303
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,120
it seems that this method is also used when taking pictures of beer.

304
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,320
Because it looks more delicious with foam.

305
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,820
It's something that you, a cameraman would know about.

306
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,620
But... I didn't have any salt on me back then.

307
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,720
But, Mr. Ogino, when we came into the room

308
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,720
you kicked the package that was at the entrance, didn't you?

309
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,020
That was something you brought back from the funeral, right?

310
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,020
If so, it would've been inside, no?

311
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,020
The "cleansing salt".

312
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,220
I see, so he used that salt.

313
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,520
Yes, most likely.

314
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,120
Because after he kicked it,

315
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,920
he returned the tea package that fell out.

316
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,620
Back then, he took out the "cleansing salt"

317
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,020
and snuck it into his pocket.

318
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,920
He then broke the packet open,

319
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,720
picked up several grains of salt.

320
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,820
Then, just before showing me the beer glass,

321
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,320
poured salt into it and showed me the beer with foams.

322
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,820
Well, it must've been a trick that he thought up

323
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,620
at the spur of the moment.

324
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,720
Even if he were to have disposed of the salt packet somewhere,

325
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,720
there should be several grains of salt left in his pocket.

326
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,020
Besides, if he did push someone off the veranda,

327
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,720
they must've struggled slightly.

328
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,620
And if you consider the fact that

329
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,820
he had to rush out of the room as soon as possible,

330
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,720
if we check the carpet that President Katsumoto had installed last night,

331
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,420
I'm sure we'll still be able to find it, no?

332
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
The trace of you having gone to the President's room

333
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,220
between last night and this morning.

334
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,820
But, it's hard to believe

335
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,220
that Mr. Ogino would kill President Katsumoto.

336
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,020
Right. Because even the lawyer told us

337
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,520
that our chances of winning were good.

338
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,720
In the first place, you said so too, Mr. Ogino.

339
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720
That on the memory card that had the successive pictures in it,

340
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,120
the fingerprints of the president were on,

341
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,320
so that it would prove that...

342
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,120
the president had chosen the pictures in question,

343
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,720
on his own and put them on the magazine.

344
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,920
Why would he want to kill the president

345
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,720
knowing that he would be winning the case?

346
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,920
It disappeared.

347
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,520
Disappeared?

348
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Since I received that strange mail this morning from the president,

349
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,420
I had this uneasy feeling, so I checked...

350
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,520
and found that the memory card had disappeared from my camera bag.

351
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,520
I had an idea of who it was right away,

352
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,020
so I went to the president's room

353
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,720
and pressed him for an answer. Just as I thought...

354
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,320
Cut it out.

355
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,720
Why don't you ask your assistant who quit the other day

356
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,020
about that memory card?

357
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,220
Well, I'm sure he split somewhere abroad

358
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,220
after making a lot of cash and is enjoying himself.

359
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,020
I don't think you can contact him by phone either.

360
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,620
Just as I thought...

361
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,820
You paid him to steal that memory card.

362
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,020
He told me that you guys were planning to place charges against me.

363
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,420
Well, if you're not going to withdraw charges,

364
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,720
I've got something in mind too.

365
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,120
Those successive pictures will be used as a newly acquired scoop too.

366
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,620
With the headline, "A Ruthless Cameraman who Sold his Classmate."

367
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,920
Classmate?

368
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,420
With that actress?

369
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,720
Yes, we were classmates in intermediate school.

370
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,120
That's why I knew that the guy who was with her

371
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,820
was her younger step-brother.

372
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,220
And I didn't take that picture without permission.

373
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,620
I took it right in front of them so that I could send it to them.

374
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,220
My assistant, mistook that picture

375
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,720
and showed it to the president on his own

376
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,520
and made up that darn article.

377
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,820
That's why I couldn't forgive him

378
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,020
when thinking that the picture that I took

379
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,320
served as a factor in driving her to commit suicide.

380
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,020
By the time I snapped back to myself,

381
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,320
the president was lying flat on the ground like a frog.

382
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,020
But, for a murder that wasn't planned ahead of time,

383
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,920
I thought that the beer foam trick would get me through.

384
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,420
To think that the trick actually lead to me being suspected

385
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,720
and even served as proof against me...

386
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,620
I suspected you as being the culprit

387
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,520
ever since I heard that you were a cameraman.

388
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,720
No joke.

389
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,220
Because when you got to the site,

390
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,020
all you had on you was your cell phone and nothing else.

391
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,720
That's why I had my eye on you from the start.

392
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,520
But, if he heard the commotion and came,

393
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,920
having nothing on him would be natural.

394
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,320
No.

395
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,320
A press cameraman would never forget the camera

396
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,920
that brings in the bread.

397
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,020
Well, how amazing, Officer Takagi!

398
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,020
You're pretty good when you want to be.

399
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,820
Right.

400
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Oh, well, not really...

401
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,720
All I did was talk as was written in Shinichi's mail though.

402
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,920
It seems that the case has been solved...

403
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,620
From here, it's my area.

404
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,620
It's not where you come in.

405
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,220
Adults get cold easily and don't like the cold.

406
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,020
What's the matter? Both of you...

407
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,920
The door's left opened.

408
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,120
It's nothing.

409
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Let's go home.

410
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,520
Let's go.

411
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,820
It's getting a bit chilly.

412
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,720
Wait, Candy!

413
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,820
Kingo Ebisawa and Ginji Kaniyama,

414
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,320
both have previous police records of committing robbery.

415
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,320
What's with you?

416
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,020
What's going to happen to Candy?

417
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
Inspector, if I remember correctly,

418
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,620
you said that the two were listening to police radio communication?

419
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,220
If... if we go that way, we'll run into the next checkpoint.

420
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,020
Where are you?

421
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,720
Next Conan,

422
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,620
"The Car Carrying a Time-Bomb".

423
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,520
No, I think you are.
