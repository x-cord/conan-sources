1
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:08,931
Here! This is for you, Conan.

2
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:13,831
Mystery Train pass ring?

3
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:16,231
You know! The pass that we're going to be using

4
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,631
to ride the Bell Tree Express next week.

5
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,231
It arrived at Doc's place this morning!

6
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:23,727
If you show that ring to the conductor,

7
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:28,152
he'll read it and let us own board.

8
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:31,452
Rumor has it that the train is a steam engine

9
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:34,852
and looks just like the Orient Express.

10
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:38,752
I hope that there are no murders like in Christie's novels, though.

11
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,252
Of course there aren't going to be any.

12
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,352
You're already wearing that ring, too?

13
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:47,452
Yes.

14
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:49,552
We all wore it at Doc's house before you got there

15
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:51,752
and took pictures with it, you see.

16
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,152
When we get to the campsite,

17
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,852
let's take another picture with Conan inside it, too!

18
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:59,252
Geez, take it off. What if you loose...

19
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:02,652
Do you have a cold, Conan?

20
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,052
I may have caught it from Pops

21
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:06,452
because he was coughing up last night.

22
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:10,352
Hey. At least wear a mask, won't you?

23
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:11,452
I don't have one.

24
00:01:11,452 --> 00:01:13,052
Gosh.

25
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:15,952
I'll give you medicine now, then.

26
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:19,452
Drink this and keep quiet.

27
00:01:19,452 --> 00:01:22,752
Where's the cold medicine?

28
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:24,652
Isn't this...

29
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,152
Here, your cold medicine.

30
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:31,652
Hey. Don't tell me that the drug that you just...

31
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:35,852
Yes. It's the antidote for Apotoxin 4869.

32
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:39,352
I keep in on me just in case.

33
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:42,452
Okay then, let me have one just in case too, then.

34
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:43,652
No way!

35
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,552
I can't give this to a love comedy detective

36
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:48,452
who would use it to enlarge himself all over the place.

37
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:49,852
Never mind, just give it to me!

38
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:52,952
-Hey, wait! -What's the use of you holding it?

39
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:55,152
You pervert!

40
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:56,752
What on earth are you doing?

41
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,952
How dare you pick on girls!

42
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:03,452
No. I'm the one who's being picked on.

43
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:06,152
Why you...

44
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,652
It's about time we get there!

45
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:11,452
Is everybody ready?

46
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:12,852
-Yes. -Yes.

47
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:19,952
Aim for a 100% solution.

48
00:02:19,952 --> 00:02:22,052
Clear all mysteries and codes.

49
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:24,052
Bourbon finally makes his move?

50
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:26,452
Three shadows that close in on Ai and me.

51
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:27,952
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:29,952
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:31,952
His name is Detective Conan!

54
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:17,561
"Shadow Closes in on Ai's Secret (Part 1)"

55
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:21,543
What? Conan went on camp?

56
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:23,243
How nice.

57
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:26,443
They said they were going to a campsite in Gunma today.

58
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:29,261
I can't see why they don't get bored going every month.

59
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:32,278
If they went to Gunma, I wonder if they went to Mt. Fuyuna?

60
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:34,378
I'm sure the hydrangeas are beautiful.

61
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:38,678
They told me that they'd be sending the pictures that took to my computer,

62
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,778
so I'll show them to you later.

63
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,778
Please do!

64
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:47,578
It's from Masumi.

65
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,778
Hello, Masumi?

66
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:53,478
Yep.

67
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,278
Huh? Conan told you yesterday that he was going camping, right?

68
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,778
Yep, that's right.

69
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:03,778
On Dr. Agasa's Beetle. The color is yellow.

70
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:06,078
But, why are you asking me this?

71
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:10,078
Geez, unbelievable!

72
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:14,078
How can he forget the canteen when coming camping?

73
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:16,578
Well, Doc and Conan is off

74
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:20,478
to buy it at a store near the campsite, so...

75
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,178
Come on, hurry help put up the tent.

76
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:25,678
We're going to gather firewood!

77
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:28,678
Hey, mister, mister!

78
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:31,278
From here to here is our territory!

79
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:33,178
Don't come in here without our permission!

80
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:34,778
Hey, Genta.

81
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:38,478
The campsite is for everybody, so let's be friendly.

82
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:46,378
From here, it's my area.

83
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,578
It's not for you to enter.

84
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:52,178
What was that?

85
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:56,078
Did that mean not to do anything and just stay quiet?

86
00:05:56,078 --> 00:06:01,478
Or, to resign to being where I am and not fight it?

87
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,678
Here it it!

88
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:07,678
Just as would be expected of a shop at a campsite!

89
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:10,778
They've got all kinds of camping goods!

90
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:14,078
Maybe I'll get some rice too while we're at it.

91
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,178
Because Genta's always complaining that he's not eating enough.

92
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:18,378
Right!

93
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,978
Then, maybe I'd better buy some more canteens, too.

94
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:23,178
I guess so.

95
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:26,278
Either way, Ai's the one who's going to serve you.

96
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:30,278
I can hear her ranting over canteen.

97
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:32,778
Rice...

98
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:35,878
I prefer bread to rice any day.

99
00:06:37,078 --> 00:06:39,078
Masumi?

100
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:40,878
It's you.

101
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,378
What bring you here?

102
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,678
Just a coincidence.

103
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:45,778
A passed by here by motorbike

104
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:47,578
and though that I'd view some hydrangea of Gunma.

105
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:50,178
I got hungry and came in here then.

106
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:53,678
I fateful ran into you!

107
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:58,378
But you're sure buying up, aren't you?

108
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:00,278
It's for lunch and dinner today,

109
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:02,378
and breakfast tomorrow morning.

110
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:05,478
Because you don't have anything ready for me, do you?

111
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,378
You mean you're coming camping with us, too?

112
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,978
"Danger, Snakes!" -Hey, Genta!

113
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:13,978
We've gathered enough firewood already,

114
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:16,978
-so let's go back to the tent, already! -Okay!

115
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,378
There's a sign that says "Danger Snakes" too.

116
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:23,178
Snakes?

117
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:25,778
Hey, everybody! Come over here!

118
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,178
It sounds like somebody's digging a hole!

119
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:29,578
A hole?

120
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:31,278
Is it buried treasure?

121
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:33,878
That's something we'll have to look forward, too!

122
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:47,978
A woman...

123
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:49,878
Is being buried!

124
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:53,078
Run!

125
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:58,978
They saw me...

126
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:04,578
Hello? Conan?

127
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:06,278
The cell phone you have called is...

128
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,578
What's this? At a time like this?

129
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,678
No one's here.

130
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:21,478
Maybe they went to pick firewood or something.

131
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:24,378
She followed us here, after all.

132
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,478
I guess I've got no choice. I'll try giving Ai a call.

133
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:29,278
Oh no. Battery's dead.

134
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:32,378
If your battery's dead, do you want to use my smart phone?

135
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,578
I bought one just like yours, too.

136
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,778
You're going to call the girl called Ai, right?

137
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:40,778
No, thanks. I can use Doc's cell phone.

138
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:41,878
Right, Doc?

139
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:45,678
I'm calling her on the cell phone I had in my knapsack,

140
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,878
but I can't seem to get through at all.

141
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:51,378
I wonder if the waves don't respond to well in this area?

142
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:54,178
Why don't we go look for them anyway?

143
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:57,678
You have an idea of where they may go to pick up firewood, don't you?

144
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,078
Yeah.

145
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,878
Are you all right, Ayumi?

146
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,478
I can't run anymore.

147
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:09,478
Hang in there, Ayumi.

148
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:14,578
Ai, there's a mountain hut over there!

149
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,378
Then, let's hide in that mountain hut for now.

150
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:23,378
-Yes. -Can you get up, Ayumi?

151
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:26,078
-Yep. -Here, grab me.

152
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:27,678
Yep.

153
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:29,778
-Let's go. -Yes!

154
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,778
If we get to that hut, we can rest ourselves.

155
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:35,378
Yep. Thank you, everybody.

156
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,551
"Danger, Snakes" -Where are you, everybody?

157
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,451
-Hey! -Answer me if you're there!

158
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,751
Ai!

159
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:53,451
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

160
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:00,551
This is...

161
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:03,151
The pass ring for the Mystery Train.

162
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,451
Then, they were here.

163
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,951
Hey. Something's strange.

164
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:10,851
There are officers in a remote mountain area like this.

165
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:12,851
Why on earth...

166
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:16,251
A corpse?

167
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,151
Hey, excuse me. What happened?

168
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,551
We got a call just a while ago.

169
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:24,951
When we got here, we found the corpse.

170
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:26,751
What kind of call?

171
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,051
"We're being pursued right now by a man

172
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:31,251
who was burying a woman near the Danger Snakes sign..."

173
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:32,651
was the contents.

174
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,751
It was a girl's voice.

175
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:43,651
We hid in the mountain hut for now,

176
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,951
-but will we be okay? -Yeah!

177
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:48,151
Because the door and everything is locked tightly.

178
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,151
Even if King Gomera were to come, we'll be fine!

179
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,151
Then, I'll go check if there are any more entrances.

180
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:58,551
Hey, Ai. Can't you get through to Conan yet?

181
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:01,751
No. It seems we're completely out of service range, too.

182
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,551
It seems that somebody's been here before us.

183
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:05,651
Huh?

184
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:08,051
From the looks of the bag,

185
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:09,951
I wonder if it's a couple.

186
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,751
How about it, Mitsuhiko?

187
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:15,551
There seems to be no other entrance. That's the only one.

188
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,451
Hey, what's the matter?

189
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:21,651
I'm fine.

190
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:23,351
The floor was just wet.

191
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,951
It can't be...

192
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:35,151
The woman a while ago was...

193
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:39,151
If so, 9 out of 10 he'll come back here

194
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:41,951
to this blood smeared site of the crime.

195
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,251
The culprit...

196
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:47,151
Then we'll have to hurry out of here.

197
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:48,151
True!

198
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,951
Let's go! Ayumi! Ai!

199
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,451
The man came back after all?

200
00:12:02,451 --> 00:12:04,051
What?

201
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:06,751
Shall we try talking to him?

202
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:10,351
Maybe he's somebody who just came by to this mountain hut.

203
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,051
No doubt about it.

204
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:17,951
The person on the other side of the door

205
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:20,151
is the murderer who was burying the corpse a while ago!

206
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:32,151
He's probably the owner of the black bag.

207
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,051
He brought the woman that he was burying a while ago here,

208
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:36,751
and killed her.

209
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:38,651
But don't worry!

210
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,951
The only way in is this door.

211
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:44,251
Let's wait here until help comes.

212
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:45,651
-Yep. -Yes.

213
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,751
Ai, are you shaking?

214
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,551
I just have the chills.

215
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,251
Maybe I caught Conan's cold.

216
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:57,751
"Danger, Snakes" -I see. In other words...

217
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,551
About two hours ago,

218
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:01,951
there was a call saying that a man who was burying a woman

219
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:03,451
near the "Danger Snakes" sign,

220
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:06,351
and the people who witnessed this were being pursued by him.

221
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:07,951
We got here

222
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:10,451
and found the corpse of this woman!

223
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:14,551
And this girl who called in,

224
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:18,551
I think happens to be a friend of yours, no, Conan?

225
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,951
Yep! I've been trying to cal her all this time,

226
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,451
but can't seem to get through.

227
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,651
So, please hurry and search this area.

228
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:28,951
Well, the search team is already looking for them.

229
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:31,151
This area is quite intricate,

230
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,051
so I'm not sure if they'll be able to find them right away.

231
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:34,451
Oh, no.

232
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:36,351
But don't you worry.

233
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:37,951
For we, the Gunma Prefectural Police,

234
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,751
Mt. Fuyuna is like our backyard!

235
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,351
I'm sure that we'll be able to find the children

236
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,951
as well as the killer soon!

237
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,651
Are you really okay or not?

238
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,551
That's that.

239
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:54,951
I think we should check who this corpse is, no?

240
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,151
Huh?

241
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:59,951
From the looks of the death spots and rigor mortis,

242
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:02,751
she was probably killed about 5 to 6 hours ago.

243
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,551
She been slashed in the back

244
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,551
with what looks to be an axe.

245
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:09,551
But she didn't die on the spot.

246
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,351
She seemed to still be breathing

247
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,551
even after she was put inside the sleeping bag.

248
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:14,951
There are traces of her

249
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:18,051
having moved her bloody hands in the sleeping bag, too.

250
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:24,051
Who are you?

251
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:26,351
I'm Masumi Sera, a detective!

252
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,151
Conan's friend!

253
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,351
-Right? -Yep.

254
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,351
I don't know if you're a detective or what,

255
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,051
but you shouldn't be doing this.

256
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:37,551
Like touching the corpse without permission!

257
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:38,751
Sorry, sorry.

258
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:39,751
If sorry is going to let you get away with everything,

259
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:42,051
police aren't needed!

260
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:44,151
And? What's the identity of the corpse?

261
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,851
The thing is she has nothing on her.

262
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:49,751
I think she's a nursery school teacher.

263
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:50,851
Huh?

264
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:55,251
See, look. She has a bruise on her knees, right?

265
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,251
Nursery school teachers have to stand on their knees a lot

266
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:00,051
to talk eye to eye with children.

267
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,751
But I wonder if that's enough

268
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:04,751
to conclude that she's a nursery school teacher.

269
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:07,551
There are sports that require using the knees a lot, too.

270
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:08,851
If she was doing sports,

271
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:10,251
she would have marks on other parts of her body

272
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:12,651
like her elbows and hands, too!

273
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:14,351
If she sits Zen style a lot,

274
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:17,551
she should also have marks on her shins and top side of her feet.

275
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,451
Besides, her hair is straight

276
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,151
and yet the sides are unnaturally fluffy.

277
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:26,251
Her hair is long,

278
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:29,551
but she's tanned all the way to the nape of her neck.

279
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:32,351
This means that she normally has her hair in pigtails.

280
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,651
It's evident that she always out in the sun!

281
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:38,551
She looks to be around 30.

282
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:42,051
But why is her hair so childish?

283
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,251
So, I thought she was a nursery school teacher

284
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,251
who plays with children outside,

285
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:48,751
take them for walks or on excursions.

286
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,351
True.

287
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,551
I'll go back to the station,

288
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,951
and see if there are any reports of missing nursery school teachers.

289
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:58,251
If she's from another prefecture, it'll take some time.

290
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:00,051
If you want a clue on the culprit,

291
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,051
the shoeprints of the sneakers that he was wearing

292
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,751
when he was digging the hole should be there!

293
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:04,851
It's hard to tell

294
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:06,951
what the prints of the sole of the sneakers looked like,

295
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:09,351
but I think that the size of the shoes can at least be determined.

296
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,151
Let's see.

297
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:14,051
It's about 26 centimeters.

298
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:16,551
There was a shovel on the ground nearby,

299
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:19,151
but I don't think we can expect detecting fingerprints on it.

300
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:20,951
Because if he threw it down,

301
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:23,851
it's highly likely that he was wearing work gloves or something.

302
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:26,151
In other words, the only clue we have on the culprit

303
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,451
is that his shoe size is 26 cm.

304
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,251
We'll just wait for forensics to give us more information.

305
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,651
What're you talking about? Take a good look!

306
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:35,651
Huh?

307
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:38,351
Look, her hands!

308
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,751
It's unnatural, isn't it?

309
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,451
I see. I wonder what it is.

310
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:45,051
Sign language or something?

311
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:46,551
I wonder.

312
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:49,951
Judging from the blood stains, just before she died,

313
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:54,251
she must've desperately made this shape with her fingers.

314
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,451
O and K...

315
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,751
No. 2 and 3.

316
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,951
2 and 3... Let me see.

317
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:07,251
I got it! He might be her brother, you see!

318
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,251
-Wrong! -Wrong!

319
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,751
Inspector Yamamura.

320
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:13,551
We were contacted by the search team.

321
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:17,451
They found 3 men walking around the mountains alone,

322
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:20,651
and they're headed this way now.

323
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:24,951
What about the children?

324
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:29,651
Weren't the children anywhere near the place those men were found?

325
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,051
I wonder. I got no such report.

326
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,051
I see.

327
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:39,951
It's been about two hours since then.

328
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:42,851
There's no sound at all.

329
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:45,751
Maybe he gave up and fled.

330
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:48,751
Then, I'll go out and check things.

331
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,451
No! He could be ambushing us outside,

332
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:53,351
making us think that he left.

333
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:56,151
But just a little won't harm, will it?

334
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:58,351
Wait, Genta!

335
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:01,951
Ai, are you all right?

336
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:04,251
You're perspiring so much.

337
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:08,051
I'm fine, so please stop Genta right away.

338
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:10,151
But...

339
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:12,851
He already opened the door.

340
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:15,951
How is it, Genta?

341
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:18,351
Nobody's here.

342
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:21,851
Okay! It seems to be okay!

343
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,451
Huh? What's this?

344
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:27,451
Big trouble!

345
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:31,351
The door's chained and we can't get out!

346
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:34,851
Ai! We've been locked in!

347
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:40,051
Ai. Doesn't it smell like something's burning?

348
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:42,151
Come to think of it, yes.

349
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:45,251
It can't be...

350
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:47,751
Isn't this mountain hut burning?

351
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,451
The window! We should be able to escape from the window!

352
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:53,451
No good.

353
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:55,251
The window are nailed on.

354
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,551
No! You can't open it?

355
00:18:57,551 --> 00:19:01,951
I see. First, he was going to confine her in here

356
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:04,151
and set the place on fire to make it look like an accident.

357
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:11,151
But she found out,

358
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,551
so he killed her using the axe instead.

359
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:15,151
But if her body is retrieved from the ashes

360
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:16,151
and the slash wound is found,

361
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:17,451
everything would go down the drain.

362
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,651
That's why he probably attempted to bury her corpse

363
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:22,251
where the Danger Snakes sign

364
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:25,851
was where people stay away from.

365
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,451
We've got to hurry and flee!

366
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:30,651
Darn it! This door won't budge!

367
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:34,451
What shall we do? We don't have the strength.

368
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:38,251
We'll be fine, calm down!

369
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,451
I'm sure someone will notice the smoke

370
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:42,751
and come to rescue us.

371
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:44,451
That's right.

372
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,051
Conan.

373
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,951
Smoke?

374
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:59,651
Hey, it's some distance away but there's smoke rising!

375
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:04,451
That's probably the smoke from a camp fire.

376
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:06,551
See, there's another one over there, too.

377
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:09,251
For some reason recently, a lot of young kids

378
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:13,451
make large bonfires from noon and really live it up.

379
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:18,051
They're reprimanded, but they keep on coming.

380
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,651
Inspector Yamamura!

381
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,451
Regarding the report we got earlier,

382
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:25,451
I brought the three men.

383
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,951
Is that right? Good work!

384
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:35,451
Then, will you all one by one give me your names, occupation

385
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:39,051
and the reason you came here.

386
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:42,751
I'm Hayamichi Yonezumi, a free-lancer.

387
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:45,251
I don't know what happened,

388
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,251
but I just came to check out the campsite

389
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:49,651
because I'll be coming here again next week with my friends!

390
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:52,551
My name is Chozo Usagi.

391
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,251
I'm a photographer.

392
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:58,251
I take pictures of campsites throughout Japan.

393
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:01,151
I wanted to take pictures of Japanese azalea

394
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:05,151
on my cell phone camera to upload on my blog

395
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,551
because they bloom orange flowers during this season.

396
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:10,951
My name's Takeya Iwakuma.

397
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:13,151
I'm a senior at Beika University.

398
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,951
But you're all dressed very lightly.

399
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:19,351
I just came to check the place out, you know.

400
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:21,551
Same with me.

401
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,451
My camera and equipment are in my car.

402
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,851
I just dropped by.

403
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,351
How is it?

404
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:32,551
I can't get though yet.

405
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:34,751
I'm sure that Ai would move to a place

406
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,551
where the cell phone will work.

407
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:39,851
If they're still being pursued by the culprit

408
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:41,851
and she can't make the call because of it,

409
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:45,351
then maybe the culprit's not among the three?

410
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:48,551
Or I don't want to think this,

411
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:51,551
but maybe they've already been killed by someone,

412
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,851
including those three.

413
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:55,951
Or they may be in a situation

414
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:58,651
where that can't move for some reason.

415
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:45,451
"Next Episode"

416
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:49,251
Don't tell me that the culprit came back.

417
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:53,551
We've got trouble.

418
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:57,751
All the detective badges of the children are in the tent.

419
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:00,551
We've got to find them before it gets dark.

420
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,851
I see.

421
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,051
So, that's the story.

422
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:12,351
Next Conan, "Shadow Closes in on Ai's Secret (Part 2)"

423
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,351
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:32,451
"Pass Ring"

425
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,051
We're in danger.

426
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,151
Yes, we're in a grave fix.

427
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:37,251
Don't worry, that person will come to save us.
