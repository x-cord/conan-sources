1
00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:04,139
A culprit who goes after long-haired women

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,739
attacking them with a hammer.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,739
He is known as Hammer man.

4
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:10,339
Through an eye-witness report,

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,339
the condo where Hammer man is thought to reside is pinpointed.

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,139
Officer Takagi and other officers secretly stake out.

7
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:20,939
They try to keep the culprit from seeing through their surveillance

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,739
by putting on a lovey-dovey situation.

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:24,439
Officer Chiba reports that

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,739
three people went in and out of the room that they were watching.

11
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:33,739
One of them was a male courier who came to pick up a parcel.

12
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:36,239
The second person was a woman motorbike courier

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,139
who came to deliver a parcel.

14
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:41,939
The third one was a man from the pizza shop who came to deliver pizza.

15
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:42,939
However,

16
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,039
all three people say that they did not see the resident of the condo.

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,739
They explain that a note telling them to come into the room

18
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:52,039
and do what they have to was posted on the front door.

19
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:56,739
Thinking that this may be

20
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,539
a strategy that Hammer man thought up to escape the condo,

21
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,439
we decided to bust into the room that was being watched,

22
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,139
but when we got there,

23
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:10,339
we found a man that had been hit on the head and seriously injured.

24
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,839
Is he Hammer man?

25
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:19,139
Did one of the three who entered the room strike him?

26
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,839
There could've been a person connected to

27
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:26,039
one of the women who were attacked by Hammer man among the three people.

28
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,739
Although the police wanted to verify the identities of the three,

29
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,439
they had already been allowed to leave.

30
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,339
After going in to investigate the room with the officers,

31
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,839
we found several suspicious points.

32
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,839
Only the invoice of the pizza delivery was left behind

33
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:43,739
and the invoices of the courier and motorbike delivery were gone.

34
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,539
The plug of a chargeable electric shaver was not plugged in.

35
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:50,239
The bath tub is spic-and-span and super clean.

36
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,639
Strange.

37
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:54,739
There must be something behind this incident.

38
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,739
Something that is beyond our imagination.

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,339
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

40
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,439
Saturday nights are for mystery.

41
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,439
The surprising identity of Hammer man.

42
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,839
Funny Detective Queen Sonoko makes her appearance.

43
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,439
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,339
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,139
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

46
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:57,196
"The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 2)".

47
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,696
When we checked inside the dryer and washing machine,

48
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:06,496
we found these gloves among the laundry.

49
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:09,596
We'll have the forensic officers check it

50
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:13,096
and if the blood matches with those of the victim last night,

51
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,396
the man that was found lying on the floor here

52
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:17,996
is definitely Hammer man.

53
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:18,996
All we need to do now is

54
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:22,496
find the remains of anything that belonged to the one who hit Hammer man.

55
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,096
That could lead to some clue.

56
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:26,096
None here!

57
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,796
All the clothes that are here

58
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:31,396
were inside the dryer and washer, weren't they?

59
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:35,396
If so, I wonder why there are

60
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,596
no underwear or socks.

61
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:38,896
True.

62
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:42,296
Although there are T-shirts, sweat shirts and towels.

63
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:45,396
Maybe they were all thrown away after being used.

64
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:48,596
Well, when I had to stake out for more than a week or so,

65
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,796
I used to throw away my underwear

66
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:52,796
without washing them too, at times like that.

67
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:55,296
Stake out...

68
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,996
You pretended to be lovers so that people wouldn't notice

69
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,896
that you were staking out, right?

70
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:03,696
What did you think it was?

71
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:05,096
Oh, no.

72
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:10,396
Is something the matter?

73
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:11,396
Chiba.

74
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:14,296
You staked out with Officer Sato in the past, didn't you?

75
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:16,096
Yes, two or three times.

76
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:18,596
Did... did anything happen back then?

77
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,296
What do you mean?

78
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:23,596
No, if nothing happened, that's okay.

79
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:24,696
Is it that

80
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:27,396
you want to know whether I pretended being lovers with Officer Sato?

81
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,796
Officer Sato seems to do it a lot

82
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,496
to keep people from noticing that we're officers.

83
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:35,696
But, as for me, something like that during a stake out

84
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:38,696
will totally distract me from my duty.

85
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:40,296
Don't tell me that you...

86
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:45,396
Yes, I could never forget that soft touch.

87
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:48,196
Soft touch?

88
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:50,696
Kiss me. Right now.

89
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:52,996
A hot passionate one.

90
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:55,296
What?

91
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:57,796
Did you find something?

92
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:58,896
No.

93
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,596
Excuse me.

94
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:04,396
I think it's about time I take Conan home, if it's okay.

95
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,796
I guess so.

96
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:07,196
Thank you, Conan.

97
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:10,396
You can leave finding Hammer man to the police.

98
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:11,896
But...

99
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:14,496
Then, the person who was carried away on the stretcher

100
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,696
was also attacked by Hammer man?

101
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:19,096
No, the person that was carried off on the stretcher is Hammer man.

102
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,296
A person connected with one of his victims

103
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,796
probably took revenge and attacked him.

104
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:23,996
No way!

105
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:28,096
I thought that Hammer man was over 180 centimetres tall.

106
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,096
The person who was carried away

107
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:33,196
didn't look to be that tall at all, did he?

108
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:35,496
That's what the urban legend's about.

109
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,796
The victims were all attacked from behind,

110
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:42,096
and only got to see the attacker's rear view from the groundwhere they are,

111
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:44,896
so, the accurate height of the culprit is unknown.

112
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:48,896
Although last night's eye-witness was on his feet,

113
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:51,296
he seems to have been drunk, so...

114
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:53,696
Urban legend...

115
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:54,996
Wait a sec.

116
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:57,096
A bathroom that's too clean,

117
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:59,196
an unplugged electric shaver,

118
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:00,796
and a toothbrush for some reason that weren't there,

119
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,796
including no underwear or socks...

120
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:06,296
And the note that was found in front of the room,

121
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:09,196
the invoices of the courier and motorbike courier that disappeared...

122
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:11,996
Don't tell me that...

123
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:23,096
There is a piece of leather flap attached to the tip of the left shoe!

124
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:24,396
Where are the other shoes?

125
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:28,596
This is the only shoe with a leather flap attached to it!

126
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:30,596
Hey!

127
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:33,396
Conan.

128
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:36,796
Does something bother you about Hammer man's shoe?

129
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:40,296
No, these aren't the shoes of Hammer man.

130
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:43,696
He wasn't here to begin with.

131
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,696
What?

132
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:46,696
The man called Hammer man.

133
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:48,196
What do you mean,

134
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:51,596
saying that Hammer man wasn't here to begin with?

135
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,196
You know, like the woman with snake-like mouth

136
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:55,796
and dog that has a human-like face,

137
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,296
rumour exaggerates

138
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:00,096
and they become really frightening characters, right?

139
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:01,696
Hammer man is said

140
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:05,396
to have run 100m in 11 seconds,

141
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:09,296
or be a tall man with a height over 180cm.

142
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:11,696
What I'm saying is that rumour exaggerates the facts

143
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:14,996
and ends up going around scaring people.

144
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:18,296
Woman like a snake-like mouth and a dog that has a human-like face...

145
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:21,096
You sure know a lot about old horror characters, don't you?

146
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:23,996
My teacher at school told us about them.

147
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:25,796
But Conan,

148
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,296
unlike the woman with the snake-like mouth

149
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:29,196
and the dog with a human-like face,

150
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:33,896
there are actually four people who were victimized by Hammer man.

151
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,896
It's hard to believe that he's an imaginary character.

152
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:38,896
That just goes to show that there's a bad man

153
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:41,896
that's attacking long-haired woman with a hammer,

154
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,796
and we don't really know if that's the Hammer man or not, do we?

155
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,396
He's going around attacking people with hammers,

156
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,296
so he's a Hammer man, isn't he?

157
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,996
Are you saying that it was actually not a hammer?

158
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:54,096
So what I mean is...

159
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:55,296
What?

160
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:57,896
Talk louder so that everybody can hear...

161
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,496
Sonoko?

162
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:05,596
That... that queer dance...

163
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:06,696
Don't say that...

164
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:10,496
Yes, dance.

165
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:14,296
Conan's remark inspired me!

166
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:17,596
We were dancing around.

167
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:22,096
In other words, being deceived by an urban legend called Hammer man!

168
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,896
She's come! Deduction Queen Sonoko!

169
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:29,596
But she resembles Sleeping Kogoro in every way, doesn't she?

170
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:31,296
Of course she does.

171
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,196
No, I think the angle her head is facing down

172
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:35,796
is different from that of Mr. Mouri's.

173
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:37,396
Is... is that so?

174
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:39,496
There's no difference.

175
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,196
But, Sonoko,

176
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:43,996
if Hammer man is simply an urban legend,

177
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:47,996
who was that man that was knocked down and passed out in this room?

178
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,296
The only plausible explanation

179
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,796
is that one of the three who came to this room

180
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:54,896
hit Hammer man because of a grudge.

181
00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:57,996
Think back and try to remember the details.

182
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:01,996
In what order and for what the three came to the room for?

183
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:06,296
If I remember correctly,

184
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:10,996
it was a tall male courier about 180 centimeters in height,

185
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:15,096
a woman motorbike courier who is barely 160 meters tall,

186
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:20,896
and last, a thin pizza delivery man about 170 centimeters tall.

187
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:23,096
Those three who came to the room

188
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,696
because there was a note by the front door

189
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,096
telling them to come in and do what they had to

190
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:30,596
since the resident was in bed with a cold.

191
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,796
You can see that the only person who could've put that note there

192
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:37,296
was the courier who came along first, right?

193
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:39,496
Then, the only one who could've hidden

194
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:42,696
the invoices of the courier and the motorbike woman courier

195
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,496
is either the motorbike delivery woman

196
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:48,896
or the pizza delivery man, right that came after the male courier, right?

197
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:52,396
Yes, that's what's been troubling us from a while ago.

198
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:56,296
But if you think of it this way, maybe the puzzle will fit?

199
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,596
If we were to assume that it was Hammer man who was in this room

200
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:02,596
that left the memo by the door, as well as hid the invoices!

201
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,696
It's true that he could've placed the memo there,

202
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:10,896
but why would Hammer man have to hide the invoices?

203
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:14,996
To keep the police from identifying who is who right away.

204
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:17,296
Because the culprit is just about to switch over

205
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:19,296
to being someone else right now!

206
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:20,296
What?

207
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,796
Switch? Don't tell me...

208
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:26,796
You mean Hammer man switched to one of those three?

209
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:30,096
Yes, Hammer man called the motorbike deliverer

210
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:34,296
and pizza delivery man in order to switch identities with them.

211
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:35,296
In other words,

212
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,496
the one who was knocked out and fainted in that room

213
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,496
was one of the three!

214
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:41,796
I see.

215
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:43,796
So when the people the culprit called,

216
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:47,896
came to the room and followed the instructions on the memo by the door,

217
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:50,996
he knocked them out, put his clothes on them,

218
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:53,596
and set it up as if the man committed suicide.

219
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,196
The culprit left the man in the room,

220
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,196
wore the uniform of the man he knocked out

221
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:59,596
and left straightforwardly out the front door.

222
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:00,896
If so,

223
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,896
the first male courier that came

224
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,396
is cleared from the list of suspects.

225
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:07,696
After all, his physique is much too different from that of the man

226
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:09,596
who was knocked out in the room.

227
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,696
Besides, he couldn't have taken away the invoice of the motorbike courier

228
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:14,896
who came along later.

229
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:19,596
Which means that Hammer man is the pizza delivery man!

230
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:22,796
It's understandable that he hasn't returned to shop yet too, then.

231
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:23,796
Okay.

232
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:25,296
Form a cordon right away

233
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,296
and look for the pizza delivery man.

234
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:29,296
My, my. Haven't you danced enough yet?

235
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,296
What?

236
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:32,996
After hearing of the situation of the room a while ago from Conan,

237
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,696
I figured it out right away,

238
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,396
that is, the identity of Hammer man.

239
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,696
Situation of the room?

240
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:41,296
About the bathroom being spic-and-span,

241
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:45,196
the chargeable shaver being unplugged,

242
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:47,196
no toothbrush.

243
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:52,196
As well as that fact that there were no underwear or socks in the laundry.

244
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:55,096
What... what can you tell with all that information?

245
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:56,496
Can't you tell?

246
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:57,996
As for the bathroom being spic-and-span

247
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:59,896
and the toothbrush being taken away,

248
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,696
it was to get rid of any traces of she living in the room

249
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,596
until just a while ago,

250
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:07,896
and the reason the shaver was unplugged

251
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:10,896
was simply because it hasn't been used recently.

252
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:14,696
There were no underwear and socks among the laundry

253
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:17,196
in order to hide what gender the culprit is.

254
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,896
You get it now, don't you?

255
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:20,696
Don't tell me that...

256
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:23,596
Don't tell me that Hammer man is...

257
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:31,126
Don't tell me that Hammer man is...

258
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,426
a woman?

259
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:34,026
The motorbike delivery person?

260
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:36,226
Yes, the underwear as well as the socks,

261
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,026
she hid because they would obviously

262
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,726
be much smaller in size than that of men!

263
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,326
She didn't want anyone to find out

264
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:44,726
that the resident of this room was a woman.

265
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:48,026
It... it's true that the culprit was called Hammer man,

266
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:52,026
but none of the victims said that they were attacked by a man.

267
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:55,226
It could've been a name that the media gave the culprit

268
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:58,526
because the attack was a brutal one with the weapon used being a hammer.

269
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:01,726
Giving the culprit a certain name catches on fast, so...

270
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:02,826
Come to think of it,

271
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:05,226
I was told that the one who rented this room was a man,

272
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:08,426
but that he had a woman living together with him.

273
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:11,926
In other words, the one who disappeared from this room was the man,

274
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:14,926
and the woman kept living here.

275
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:19,526
Well, if you look at the shoe with the leather flap that Conan found,

276
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,626
everything is quite apparent!

277
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:23,826
This is a shift pad that is used to protect the tip of the shoe

278
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:27,726
from the impact of stepping on the shift pedal of the motorbike.

279
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:30,826
Being that there was only one such shoe in the shoe cabinet

280
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:34,626
and no other shoe with a damaged tip means that...

281
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:37,526
The owner of the shoe wasn't the resident of this condo,

282
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,326
but rather the motorbike person.

283
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:40,426
In other words, it was the shoe of the man

284
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,526
who was knocked out after a blow on the head.

285
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:46,226
She probably took the woman's shoes she was wearing, her clothes

286
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:49,326
and her underwear away with her,

287
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:50,726
after packing them in her knapsack

288
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:53,726
that she said received from the motorbike delivery person.

289
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,226
The high heeled boots that she wore to make the culprit look tall

290
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:59,726
are probably in there too.

291
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:01,026
I see.

292
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,126
The drunk that saw her couldn't have caught up with her

293
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:07,726
unless she was wearing those boots that were in trend some years ago.

294
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:09,126
But...

295
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:13,226
if so, why isn't the pizza delivery man still not back?

296
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,726
It's very likely that he's been hit by the culprit

297
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:18,426
and being confined somewhere.

298
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:21,626
Because if he doesn't return, the police will probably suspect him.

299
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:22,926
Okay!

300
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:24,926
This time for sure form a cordon and...

301
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,226
Maybe that won't be necessary.

302
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,226
What?

303
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:30,626
But, unless we go after her fast, she may flee on the motorbike.

304
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:32,626
If she could ride a motorbike,

305
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:33,726
she wouldn't leave this shoe

306
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:36,726
with a shift pad on it behind like this, would she?

307
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:37,926
In other words,

308
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:40,726
I'm sure she'd like to get out of the jumpsuit she's wearing.

309
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:41,726
Because the way she's dressed now,

310
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:44,426
it would make it difficult for her to even flag a cab.

311
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:46,026
The best place to get out of her jumpsuit

312
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:48,326
would be in a bathroom somewhere.

313
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,926
But if she would go inside a family restaurant wearing a jumpsuit,

314
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:50,926
it would be too conspicuous.

315
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:51,926
And besides, there's a chance that someone

316
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:55,726
would remember her face and clothing after she comes out changed.

317
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:58,526
So, a bathroom where she could avoid all this would be...

318
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:00,126
A bathroom in a park!

319
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,626
The one nearest here

320
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:04,526
is where the incident occurred last night, in Beika Park!

321
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:07,226
It's being investigated now.

322
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:15,826
Phooey, stupid guy.

323
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,126
To take that lie to be true...

324
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:21,426
You know the toilet in the park that I went to a while ago,

325
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:22,926
one of the compartments wouldn't open,

326
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:25,026
so will you come check it out with me?

327
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,826
It bothers me because it's the park where Hammer man appeared, you see.

328
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:30,926
Oh, okay.

329
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:34,026
There's no such toilet.

330
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,026
That's strange.

331
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:38,526
It was closed just a while ago.

332
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:42,726
All I need to do now is get out of this jumpsuit

333
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,326
get out of this park

334
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:47,826
and flee to where the stupid police won't find me.

335
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:50,626
Is anything wrong?

336
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:54,226
I'm the police.

337
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:58,026
You know that an incident occurred here last night, don't you?

338
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,326
Oh, yes, sir!

339
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:04,026
Is there something in the toilet?

340
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:05,426
No.

341
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:08,526
I don't know if it has anything to do with the incident,

342
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:11,226
but a person is lying on the ground in the toilet beyond.

343
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,126
True.

344
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,526
I'll call my men to come over right away.

345
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:23,926
So, please let me interrogate you for a while.

346
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,926
Yes, sir. My pleasure.

347
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:32,626
We've got a report on you.

348
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:35,526
Hammer man, was it?

349
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:41,026
So, Hammer man...

350
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,926
Rather, Hammer woman was arrested.

351
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:47,826
The curtains went down on the urban legend

352
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:50,926
before it was handed down from word of mouth.

353
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:52,326
The motive for her committing the crime,

354
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:55,826
was a grudge she held against the man that ditched her.

355
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,226
The reason she attacked only women with long hair

356
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:02,526
was because the man that left her left with a woman with long hair.

357
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:05,226
Since she was pursued by the eye-witness

358
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,226
and her residence was disclosed,

359
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:11,126
she tried to frame the man and make it look as if he was the culprit,

360
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:14,126
but the police caught on faster than she expected them to,

361
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,026
so she seems to have carried out her stupid crime.

362
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:21,326
Thanks so much, Sonoko.

363
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,526
Your deduction was as fantastic as that of Sleeping Kogoro.

364
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:27,226
Especially when you said, "My, my. Haven't you danced enough yet?"

365
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:29,626
It really sounded like what a Deduction Queen would say!

366
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,326
You don't remember?

367
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:35,226
No, I mean the details.

368
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:37,126
Actually, I don't remember a thing.

369
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:39,626
Thank you too, Conan.

370
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:43,326
And, how far did you go?

371
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:45,026
How far? What?

372
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,826
What else,

373
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,926
but with Officer Sato of course.

374
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,626
It's been quite a while since you've been going with her, right?

375
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:54,826
I don't want to tell you.

376
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:57,126
Are you by chance angry about the fact that

377
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:59,226
I acted like lovers with Officer Sato when staking out?

378
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:01,426
I'm not mad or anything.

379
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,826
No big deal,

380
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,326
because all I did was hold hands with her.

381
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:06,926
Huh?

382
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:11,026
But you mentioned something about a soft touch and all...

383
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,226
The touch of her hand when she grabbed mine.

384
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,526
Well, but right after that,

385
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:20,226
when I saw the way she glared at the suspect during the stake out,

386
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,626
I was scared at the look she was wearing

387
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:23,126
and kind of backed off.

388
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,026
Is that it?

389
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:26,326
Yeah.

390
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:28,426
It was the same with you, wasn't it, Officer Takagi,

391
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,226
when you were staking out?

392
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:32,626
No, in my case...

393
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:35,926
Kiss me.

394
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,426
Right now.

395
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,826
A hot passionate one.

396
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:43,826
I see. She said so, because it was me.

397
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:46,426
Officer Sato said so, because it was me.

398
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,026
We've finally found the residence

399
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:59,826
of the younger brother of the suspect of the murder case.

400
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:02,326
"First Investigation Division" -It's on the 2nd floor of a pachinko parlor

401
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,426
in Okuhocho 3-chome.

402
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:05,626
According to the information we have,

403
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:07,026
it's very likely that the suspect

404
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:09,526
will secretly be meeting his brother soon.

405
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:12,826
I want you to stake the place out like always.

406
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:16,826
I want Officer Sato who was pursuing this case to stake out with...

407
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,226
Me!

408
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:20,126
Please let me do it!

409
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:25,126
How unusual of you to say from your side that you'd like to stake out.

410
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:26,926
Didn't you know

411
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,526
that I actually love stake out?

412
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:31,026
Be on your guard.

413
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:32,726
He's the younger brother of the suspect,

414
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:34,826
but is said to be pretty violent.

415
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:36,026
Yes, sir!

416
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,226
-Be careful. -I will!

417
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:41,226
What? Be careful?

418
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,426
There's no movement at all?

419
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:49,926
Inspector Sato.

420
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,626
The name "Sato" is really common, isn't it?

421
00:20:58,326 --> 00:21:00,926
It's sure a nice name.

422
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:24,826
This is Matsumoto.

423
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:25,826
I'm pursuing a man

424
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:28,826
who looks to be the serial killer suspect at Enha Pier!

425
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:30,426
What? Are you serious?

426
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:31,626
Yes, sir.

427
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,126
The model of the car as well as the color

428
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:35,226
matches the description of the stolen car that was reported.

429
00:22:35,226 --> 00:22:38,826
It's parked right now and there's only one person in the car.

430
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:40,526
Please confirm the license plate number.

431
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,226
Shinjuku 5...

432
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:49,126
What's up, Matsumoto? Go on.

433
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:51,326
Whistling?

434
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:03,226
No doubt about it, it's him.

435
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:05,426
He's whistling.

436
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,026
That familiar song.

437
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,326
Did he see me?

438
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,026
Hey, answer me, Matsumoto!

439
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:17,626
Matsumoto! Matsumoto!

440
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:20,226
Superintendent Matsumoto!

441
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:23,926
Are you all right?

442
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:26,526
You seem to have been having a bad dream.

443
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:31,326
I'm sorry, I must've dozed off a bit.

444
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:35,526
I think you should go home and get some rest at times.

445
00:23:35,526 --> 00:23:37,826
You've been sleeping over here for the past few days

446
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:39,426
and haven't been getting much sleep, have you?

447
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:41,826
I can't afford to rest just yet.

448
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:43,626
There's only a week left

449
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:46,326
before the time for the serial killing case expires.

450
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:48,326
Even as we sit here like this,

451
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:52,326
the hands of the clock are ticking away.

452
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,126
"Next Episode" -They say that the scar may still be there

453
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:00,726
even after a person grows up.

454
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:04,526
And, the two who gave their names, where are they now?

455
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,326
Do you see something outside?

456
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:08,026
Don't you sense it?

457
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:10,526
Like someone's watching you.

458
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:12,226
I can't help feeling that way.

459
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:14,026
The culprit of that incident

460
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:17,026
that's responsible for the scar on my face...

461
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:19,226
The serial killer of the incident 15 years ago

462
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:21,526
is in this house?

463
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,026
Next Conan,

464
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,926
"The Scar of First Love".

465
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:45,226
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:46,926
"Nickname".

467
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:49,526
Just as expected of Detective Queen Sonoko.

468
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:52,026
And the Dance Queen as well, you know.
