1
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:01,689
Blink!

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:05,189
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:06,689
He finally finds the tricks of the men in the Black Organization.

4
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,289
Bring up the big guns and beat the case and evil organization!

5
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:10,689
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:12,289
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:14,189
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,282
With the testimony provided by a family

9
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,582
who visited the Mouri Detective Agency,

10
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:02,082
we solved a murder case.

11
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:05,282
At that time, Eisuke Hondo who was with us

12
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:07,182
used a lie detection technique to figure out

13
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:09,082
whether someone's lying or not.

14
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:10,582
In exactly

15
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:13,682
the same way as Rena Mizunashi used to do.

16
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,182
No doubt about it.

17
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:19,582
This guy is trying to get information...

18
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:24,382
on Rena Mizunashi.

19
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:31,282
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Mysterious Hefty Reward"

20
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:34,382
"Haido Central Hospital"

21
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:29,782
Kir.

22
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:33,582
Our organization is trying to find her but we have no idea where she is.

23
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,482
I guess the FBI is not stupid.

24
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:39,982
Kir is dead.

25
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:41,382
This is for sure.

26
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:46,182
We should be happy if she simply did.

27
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:49,382
What if she was brainwashed and turned against us?

28
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:50,382
That's not going to happen.

29
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:53,882
She didn't confess anything even after being shot,

30
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:57,882
injected a truth drug and beaten until her ribs were broken.

31
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:00,482
There's nothing to worry about, Chianti.

32
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:05,882
Are you talking about Kir getting his recognition?

33
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:09,082
-Yeah. -I have heard about that story, too.

34
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,082
Kir found a guy who snucked into the organization.

35
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:14,182
She got him cornered,

36
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:16,482
but ended up being caught.

37
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:20,182
By the time you guys found her, she was almost dead because of torture.

38
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:23,582
But I still don't get it.

39
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:26,282
How come she got his recognition

40
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:29,082
and happened to be in the same team with us?

41
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,282
It's her teeth.

42
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:31,282
Huh?

43
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,582
It was the only weapon left of her.

44
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:40,582
She bit the guy's wrist so hard that his bone came out from his wrist.

45
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,282
In addition to that,

46
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:48,082
she took the gun away from him who already lost the will to fight

47
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:49,782
and blew up his head.

48
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:55,282
Only crazy animals can do that.

49
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:58,782
But I wonder. The guy died, right?

50
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:01,482
How do we know that Kir didn't leak anything?

51
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:04,982
The guy was hiding a MD recorder

52
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:08,782
which actually recorded his voice torturing her.

53
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:11,782
An MD?

54
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,282
I see.

55
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:17,582
So there was no voice of Kir or whatsoever in that MD.

56
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:24,182
But we still don't know anything about this guy, right?

57
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:26,082
Right.

58
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:29,382
He had tons of driver's license and passports

59
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:32,382
with fake names and disguised pictures.

60
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:34,882
Certainly, he was no ordinary guy.

61
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:39,082
But we actually found out his real name.

62
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:42,282
I remember when you and I got there,

63
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:46,182
the guy's partner showed up at that place and kept whispering the name.

64
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:50,382
Yeah. He was whispering the name to the guy's ear who no longer responded.

65
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,182
It was the name we couldn't find from driver's licenses or the passports.

66
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:56,582
He kept calling the name like a scratched record.

67
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:59,282
Over and over.

68
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:05,482
He killed himself after he realized that we were there.

69
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:08,182
But what was his name anyway?

70
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:10,382
It was too far from where I was. I couldn't hear anything.

71
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,382
Well,

72
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:17,782
I can't really remember dead men's faces and names.

73
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:29,982
Well, I think I know where those guys are coming from.

74
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:32,282
Anyway, let's ask Kir when she comes back.

75
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:37,582
She probably heard that name, too.

76
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:40,382
I hope we'll find her soon.

77
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:41,682
We will.

78
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:48,482
We've already made a guess where she could be.

79
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:55,882
Gosh, what are you thinking?

80
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,582
I've been waiting for this Sunday.

81
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:01,582
I was supposed to forget about all the depressing things

82
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:06,782
and enjoy an easygoing day with a hot coffee at Poirot.

83
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:09,182
And why do I see you here?

84
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:11,382
Eisuke Hondo.

85
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:14,682
Come on. Don't be a mean.

86
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:17,882
You were the one who told him that he could visit us anytime, you know.

87
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:21,782
That's true, but it's 7:00 am.

88
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:23,582
I think it's kind of early.

89
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:27,282
I actually brought an interesting case today.

90
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,882
What? A case?

91
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,582
What's the pay? Is the client rich?

92
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,582
No. Well,

93
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:38,782
I just found something that looks like a case on a website,

94
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,782
-so there's no client. -Thank you very much!

95
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:45,182
That hurts...

96
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:46,482
Dad!

97
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:47,882
Are you stupid?

98
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:50,282
What we are doing is not charity work!

99
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:52,482
But you should at least listen to his story.

100
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,982
He came all the way here.

101
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:55,682
I told you.

102
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,682
-I don't have time. -That's right!

103
00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:01,782
Today is the day that you are going to clean and organize

104
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,882
Yoko Okino's VCRs that you recorded.

105
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:04,882
Right?

106
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:06,682
Yeah, that's right!

107
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:09,182
Conan, what happened to you?

108
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:12,082
You're usually interested in new cases.

109
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:16,882
Yeah, I would.

110
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:19,382
But not with the case he brought.

111
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,182
I'm sorry, Eisuke.

112
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:23,282
That's okay.

113
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:26,682
It looks kind of interesting, but it's not a major case at all.

114
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:32,782
Maybe somebody got the idea from the "Red-headed League" and made it up.

115
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:34,282
"The Red-headed League"?

116
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:36,482
Oh, I know that!

117
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,782
It's a famous case in a Sherlock Holmes series, right?

118
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:44,182
I remember that this red-headed person gets a high salary,

119
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:48,582
but has to work in a room all day to copy an encyclopedia.

120
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:51,282
The truth is, he was digging a hole on the basement of the store

121
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,882
to sneak into a bank.

122
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,582
Hey, tell me about the case you found.

123
00:08:58,582 --> 00:08:59,582
What?

124
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,082
Yeah, tell us. We'll listen.

125
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,782
But really, it's not a big case.

126
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,382
Just tell us!

127
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:08,782
Hey, Dad!

128
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:13,282
It was last night when I found it.

129
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:16,982
It was the diary page of the website on the internet.

130
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:18,482
Diary?

131
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:21,382
Hey, you stole a glance at somebody's diary?

132
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:22,682
No.

133
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:27,382
The owner of the home page laid the diary open so everybody could see it.

134
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:30,482
Really? That's an unusual hobby he has.

135
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:34,882
So the owner of that home page has red hair?

136
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:37,682
No. What's similar to the "Red-headed League"

137
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,382
is the money this person pays.

138
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,582
In the diary, it said,

139
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,782
"Part-time job with super high wage!

140
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:44,782
Hurray for the economy!

141
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:47,582
I got some good luck this year!"

142
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:51,382
The people who are offering this job

143
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,182
are actually a research organization that studies about detoxifying wastes

144
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:57,182
and they need household wastes for their research.

145
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,782
All you need to do

146
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:01,582
is to pick up trash bags from dump sites on burnable trash day,

147
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,982
before the garbage truck comes.

148
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,782
You return the trash bags on the next burnable trash day

149
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:07,282
and pick up new ones.

150
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:11,882
When you pick up trash,

151
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:14,982
you use a car that's parked near the dump site.

152
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:18,282
After loading trash bags, you put the car back to where it was.

153
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:21,782
On that afternoon, money will be sent to your bank account.

154
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:23,982
It's 50,000 yen.

155
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:26,082
50,000 yen?

156
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,582
But wait...

157
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:31,382
50,000 yen per pick up.

158
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,382
There are two burnable trash days a week.

159
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,482
That'll be 450,000 yen per month.

160
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:36,882
450,000 yen.

161
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:38,082
450,000 yen?

162
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:40,082
Come on, Dad.

163
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:42,682
That's a crime. You know that, right?

164
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:48,782
But since it pays well for this stupid job,

165
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,982
it's similar to the "Red-headed League".

166
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:51,982
You're right.

167
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:53,182
The person who wrote this diary

168
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:55,282
found this job on the internet job advertisement,

169
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:57,382
and then communicated with the client by e-mail.

170
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:59,882
Three days later, a car key was sent to his house.

171
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:02,882
It was about two weeks ago that he started the job.

172
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:06,082
But under the agreement that he cannot quit until the client says so.

173
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,682
I got it.

174
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:13,682
Perhaps, some celebrities are living around that area

175
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:16,782
and this rich stalker is enjoying rummaging through their garbage.

176
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:20,082
The writer thought the same thing at first,

177
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:22,882
but he later wrote that no celebrity lived near there.

178
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,382
Really?

179
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:26,782
But there's one thing that's bugging me.

180
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:30,682
This guy said that there was no sign of anyone going through the garbage.

181
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:31,782
Huh?

182
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,682
Since the deal was too good,

183
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:39,282
he got suspicious, so he took pictures of the trash in the trunk.

184
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,382
On the next trash pickup day, he checked if there was any difference.

185
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:45,982
Yet, nothing seemed to be moved from the way they were.

186
00:11:45,982 --> 00:11:48,482
Then why did the organization offer the job?

187
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:49,882
I don't know.

188
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:51,882
Just like the novel,

189
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:55,982
the client must have been doing something bad near this guy's house

190
00:11:55,982 --> 00:12:00,282
while he was picking up the garbage.

191
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:03,282
Anyway, do you know this guy's address?

192
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:07,382
No. He didn't write his home address on his website,

193
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:10,282
but he wrote where the dump site was.

194
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:15,482
I think it was near the 3rd street park in Toriya Town.

195
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,182
Toriya Town?

196
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:21,782
What's the matter, Dad? Do you have something in mind?

197
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,282
Well, actually...

198
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:29,382
A new Pachinko parlour has just opened.

199
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,282
I was just thinking about going there!

200
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:36,382
All right. Why don't we go there now?

201
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:40,082
It's only 7:30 am. This guy might be there, you know.

202
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:41,982
All right. Let's go, guys!

203
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:44,682
Toriya Town?

204
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:52,272
What is this?

205
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,072
Look. Today is February 5th, Sunday.

206
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:58,972
The burnable trash day in this area is tomorrow on Monday

207
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:01,472
and four days later on Thursday.

208
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:02,672
Looks like it.

209
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:04,172
What?

210
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:06,772
What do you mean by that?

211
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:09,872
No place does garbage pickup on Sunday.

212
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,672
Well, actually...

213
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,772
This guy said on his diary

214
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:17,072
that he was told to pick up garbage quietly at early morning

215
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,872
to avoid any problems that might occur.

216
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:21,872
Because their garbage detoxification research was not yet approved.

217
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:24,272
You fool! You should've said that beforehand!

218
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:25,272
Gosh!

219
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,372
That's it!

220
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,572
I'll be walking around here until the Pachinko parlour opens.

221
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:31,772
-You guys take a train and go home! -What?

222
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:33,072
Gosh.

223
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,572
-Excuse me, sir. -Huh?

224
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:37,872
Did see you any tall person with a suspicious look around here

225
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:40,172
between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm the night before?

226
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:42,372
-Hey, Takagi. -What?

227
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,872
Mr. Mouri!

228
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:46,772
What are you doing here?

229
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:47,872
What are you doing here, too?

230
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:50,172
Hey, hey, Mouri! You again?

231
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,272
Oh, Inspector!

232
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:56,172
Please don't tell me that you are involved in this case, too?

233
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,372
Case?

234
00:13:57,372 --> 00:14:00,372
There was a murder. Didn't you see the news on TV?

235
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,072
What?

236
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:03,172
There was a murder?

237
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:11,972
It's this house.

238
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:14,272
Well, it looks great.

239
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,772
They are a family of considerable wealth.

240
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,372
Let's see.

241
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:21,072
The householder is Tatsuhito Funemoto.

242
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:25,572
And the victim is his wife, Kaneyo, 39 years old.

243
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:28,872
Yesterday morning, she didn't get out of bed,

244
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:31,472
so their housekeeper went to Kaneyo's room to call her.

245
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:34,972
There she was found dead, leaning against the veranda wall.

246
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:38,372
She was actually shot in the back of the head.

247
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:41,972
Assuming by the angle of the bullet that was shot into her head,

248
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:46,772
it seems the criminal is a tall person, perhaps above 180 cm.

249
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,772
Also, considering the estimated time of death,

250
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,272
it was between 9:00 pm to 10:00 pm,

251
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:54,172
the night before yesterday that Kaneyo was shot.

252
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:58,072
It was right after she came back from her friend's home party.

253
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,672
I see. Home party?

254
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:03,772
The bullet is missing because it penetrated the victim's head completely.

255
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:08,672
We asked the neighbours in this area to search for it,

256
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:11,172
but we haven't found it yet.

257
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:13,772
So, what was the motive of the crime?

258
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:16,572
It was most likely robbery.

259
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:21,372
Kaneyo was wearing a pearl necklace and bracelet.

260
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:23,572
But both of them were gone.

261
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,672
And, is there any witnesses?

262
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,372
Well,

263
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:34,272
we haven't got any information related to the criminal.

264
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,072
I see.

265
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:39,972
This criminal knows what to do.

266
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,772
This person may be a professional.

267
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:45,272
I was thinking the same thing.

268
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:47,072
What's wrong, Inspector?

269
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,772
You fool!

270
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,972
Why are you explaining every single detail about the case

271
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:54,772
to this man who has nothing to do with it?

272
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:58,472
Come on, Inspector.

273
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:00,772
That's my habit, sir. I'm sorry.

274
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:01,772
Toriya Town.

275
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,772
A murder.

276
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:08,972
No way.

277
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,372
Could it be...

278
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,672
But this guy is involved in this case,

279
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,372
so I shouldn't take this as a normal murder case.

280
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:17,972
What's the matter, Conan?

281
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:21,672
Did you figure something out?

282
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:22,972
No!

283
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,372
No way! No Way!

284
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,972
You guys are not involved in this case, so go home!

285
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:30,472
The police are going to take care of this.

286
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,372
We do not need Mouri's help.

287
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:36,772
Gosh, I'm late!

288
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:38,772
-Mr. Mouri? -All right, Inspector.

289
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,572
We wish you a good luck on your investigation.

290
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,072
Now, excuse me.

291
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:43,672
So you're going home?

292
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,872
Hey, Dad!

293
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,472
Why did Mr. Mouri run off in such a hurry?

294
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:52,372
Well, he's investigating something.

295
00:16:52,372 --> 00:16:54,872
Investigating something?

296
00:16:54,872 --> 00:16:56,372
Mr. Mouri?

297
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:57,572
Yes?

298
00:16:57,572 --> 00:17:00,172
Are you the famous Detective Mouri?

299
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:01,872
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

300
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:03,672
Yes. I am Kogoro Mouri.

301
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:04,672
"Takami Shigeno (48)"

302
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:05,872
Please!

303
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:09,072
Find the criminal who took away Mrs. Funemoto's life!

304
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:10,172
What?

305
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,872
Well, but...

306
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:15,472
You should leave it to the police. They are reliable.

307
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:18,472
I cannot count on those people!

308
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,572
Please, Mr. Mouri!

309
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,772
I really understand how you're feeling right now,

310
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:27,172
but I have something that's really important to do.

311
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,672
I will return the favour if you do this for me.

312
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,472
What? Favour?

313
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,072
Dad!

314
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:34,372
All right.

315
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,272
Leave it up to me.

316
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:40,772
I, Kogoro Mouri, shall take revenge in her place.

317
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:42,172
Thank you very much!

318
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:45,372
What's going on?

319
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:47,372
Tonight is Kaneyo's wake.

320
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:49,972
Master.

321
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:51,772
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:54,172
This is the famous detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

323
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:56,172
"Tatsuhito Funemoto (43)"

324
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:57,272
Mouri?

325
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:00,072
Oh, you are that famous...

326
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:04,272
Yes. I am the famous Kogoro Mouri.

327
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:06,672
But why are you here?

328
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:09,272
Well, it's kind of a coincidence.

329
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:10,672
No, it's not a coincidence.

330
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,072
Hey, Mouri!

331
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:14,372
I've got this.

332
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:16,872
You don't need to worry about anything because I'm here to help you.

333
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:19,372
I will catch the criminal.

334
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:25,372
Master, Mr. Mouri is going to take care of this case.

335
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,572
You don't have to return me the favour right now.

336
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:28,872
Mouri.

337
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,972
Well, what's your concern, Inspector?

338
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:36,372
Mr. Mouri has helped us out on a lot of cases.

339
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:37,372
Takagi.

340
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:40,272
Gosh, Dad.

341
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:44,072
Well, I knew it was going to end up like this.

342
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:46,172
I'm so sorry, Eisuke.

343
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:48,872
Don't worry about it. I didn't have anything to do actually.

344
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:52,072
Am I thinking too hard?

345
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:56,672
It's very hard to think that he has something to do with them.

346
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,072
Mr. Detective!

347
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,672
I know who the criminal is!

348
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,672
-What? -Hey, Toji!

349
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,672
Who is this kid?

350
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:07,172
This is my son, Toji.

351
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:11,272
"Toji Funemoto (8)" -No wonder he looks bright.

352
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:15,772
It was a foreign woman in black who killed my mom!

353
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:17,672
Hey, that's enough!

354
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:19,172
Why, Dad?

355
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:21,872
How come you are not listening to me?

356
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:24,272
Young master, why don't we go over there?

357
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:26,772
No! Leave me alone!

358
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:30,972
A foreign woman

359
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:32,072
dressed in black?

360
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:36,472
Also, that boy...

361
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:39,272
Young master!

362
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:40,372
Toji!

363
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:43,872
You have to believe me! Mister, you have to believe what I'm saying!

364
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,272
That female foreigner looked suspicious!

365
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:49,272
She must have killed Mom!

366
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,772
Have I met him before?

367
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,172
I really saw her!

368
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:55,372
-Mister, please believe me! -Hey, you.

369
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:59,172
Why do you think that this foreign woman is suspicious?

370
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,872
Because she was asking me strange questions.

371
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:03,072
Strange questions?

372
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:04,572
It was about the accident!

373
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,472
She asked me whether I really saw the accident,

374
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,172
or if I saw the face of the person who got into the accident,

375
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:12,472
and whether I talked about the accident to Mom and Dad!

376
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:13,472
Accident?

377
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,372
No way.

378
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:20,172
And what did you tell her?

379
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:23,072
I told her that I talked a little bit about it.

380
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:25,672
She started showing an evil smile after she heard that.

381
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:29,972
So that must be her!

382
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:32,572
That woman killed Mom!

383
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:34,072
I remember it now!

384
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:42,972
He happened to be...

385
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:46,172
in that accident.

386
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:49,572
One of the members of the Black Organization...

387
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:54,072
Kir, also known as Rena Mizunashi.

388
00:20:56,572 --> 00:21:00,572
She was brought to the hospital because of that accident.

389
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:21,272
He was at the scene of the accident.

390
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:22,572
The boy back then...

391
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:25,572
No doubt about it.

392
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:26,872
Which means...

393
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:30,172
Don't tell me this guy actually took us here because of the boy?

394
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,972
What is he thinking?

395
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:37,572
Does he know about this boy?

396
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:41,472
No, does he even know about the accident?

397
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:44,672
The accident that FBI is trying to keep secret.

398
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,472
I guess running away is not an option.

399
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,172
That accident

400
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:56,572
and...

401
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:58,272
Rena Mizunashi.

402
00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:02,472
Perhaps, the guys in the Black Organization are trying to find her.

403
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:04,372
The one who is being protected by FBI,

404
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:05,872
Rena Mizunashi.

405
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:07,872
No, Kir.

406
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:11,772
Finally, it's getting interesting.

407
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:14,272
I don't know what's coming.

408
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,772
All right.

409
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:16,772
I will take it.

410
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,372
This case.

411
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:28,072
I am not going to run away.

412
00:23:57,572 --> 00:23:59,172
"Next Episode" -You're talking about...

413
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:06,172
Maybe they are in the trash?

414
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:08,472
In the trash?

415
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:12,772
There's something here.

416
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:13,772
Onion?

417
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:19,872
Hey! Don't tell me that...

418
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,072
It's a shooting star.

419
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:27,572
Next Conan, "The Shadow of the Black Organization: Pearl Shooting Star"

00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:52,372
Do you hear me, Conan?
