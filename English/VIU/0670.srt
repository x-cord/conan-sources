1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:06,458
Taken by Nanami Kyodo, Ran's senior in the karate club,

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,758
we the members of the Detective Squad

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,658
came to treasure-hunt at the Kyodo residence.

4
00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:13,458
The mansion of the Kyodo's

5
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:17,458
was built by the hands of Seitaro Kyodo,

6
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,058
and because he used to always get carried away with what he does,

7
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:22,358
the mansion was full of tricks and gadgets.

8
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:24,758
The Dark Tower, a mysterious building, is one of them,

9
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,258
not having any entrance or windows.

10
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:32,458
While Nanami guided us around the house,

11
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,758
we suddenly heard a woman screaming.

12
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,458
It's Mom's voice!

13
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,458
Mom! Mom!

14
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,358
Children, stay away!

15
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:46,258
What?

16
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:48,558
Momoe! Momoe!

17
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,658
What's going on?

18
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,558
It looks like she fell off the tower.

19
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,858
But this tower...

20
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,358
Doesn't have an entrance.

21
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:02,158
There's no way she could've made it up there!

22
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:06,758
Since we deduced that the culprit may still be in the tower,

23
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:08,458
we started investigations

24
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,258
to look for the entrance of the tower,

25
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:13,458
but Ai disappears part way through!

26
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,058
Ai's gone!

27
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:16,358
What?

28
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:18,758
Hey, Ai!

29
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:21,858
-Ai! -Ai!

30
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:25,458
There's wind coming from the space.

31
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:28,858
Ai!

32
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:33,358
Gosh. There's got be an entrance elsewhere!

33
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:35,758
Next door is the liquor storeroom.

34
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:38,058
It smells of liquor!

35
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:40,758
I'm used it because of Dad!

36
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,558
There's a mirror!

37
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:45,258
Why would it be left standing in a place like this?

38
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:47,458
Standing it there is just sham.

39
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:51,158
I disappeared. There's no other way to put it.

40
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,258
This smell...

41
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:56,858
If you sniff it too much, you'll really get drunk.

42
00:01:56,858 --> 00:02:00,058
No, I smell the lady's perfume.

43
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:03,158
Her smell is all over this area.

44
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,158
What's up?

45
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,658
Disappeared!

46
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:10,858
The ceiling is reflected in the mirror but we're not?

47
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:13,458
It switched to a screen!

48
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,658
Rubber tape?

49
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:16,158
A person can go under it!

50
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:18,358
It's the entrance to the treasure! Let's go!

51
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:20,558
We'll be in trouble if the culprit is there!

52
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,158
Hey!

53
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:26,758
What shall we do?

54
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:29,258
What shall we do, Conan?

55
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:36,958
Ai?

56
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,358
Ai!

57
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,458
It's not like her to scream like that.

58
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,858
I'll be right over!

59
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:43,758
Stay here, Ayumi!

60
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:46,658
-No. I'm going to rescue her! -Don't!

61
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,658
Okay, let's go!

62
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,358
Don't ever let go of my hand.

63
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,058
Okay!

64
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,358
The vivid colored memories of summer

65
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,458
solve mysteries all season round.

66
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,358
Search for the treasure to a miracle world.

67
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:18,758
The truth of light in an eerie tower.

68
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:20,358
He sees through the one and only truth.

69
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:22,258
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

70
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,658
His name is Detective Conan!

71
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:10,891
"Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 2)"

72
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:20,666
Mr. Tsutomu Kyodo, you are the person who discovered the body?

73
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,866
Yes, it seems so.

74
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,066
What were you doing there?

75
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:27,066
-Watercress. -What?

76
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:30,266
I was gathering watercress to use for cooking.

77
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,666
It is cultivated by hydroponic method

78
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,566
in the stream below the tower.

79
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,966
I see.

80
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:39,966
That "blue" (green) color of the watercress stimulates the appetite.

81
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,166
How strange.

82
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,466
Were the members of the Youth Detective Squad found?

83
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:47,766
Nanami.

84
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,466
I'm calling Conan right now, but...

85
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:53,166
Nobody saw them go out the gate.

86
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:57,166
Don't tell me that they went off on the treasure-hunt on their own?

87
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,566
Dad!

88
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:04,866
"Nagase Kensaku (75), assistant of the previous head"

89
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,666
What's that sound?

90
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:11,366
A flood!

91
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:13,566
Stay calm. It's not for real!

92
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,866
Close your eyes!

93
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:22,466
Hot! It's hot!

94
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,566
It's not for real! It's just hot wind blowing!

95
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:27,066
Cool it, Ayumi!

96
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:28,866
Yep. I'll calm down.

97
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:34,266
When you heard your wife's voice, where were you?

98
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,066
I was somewhere near the rose garden.

99
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:40,466
I went after my wife wanting to convince her one more time.

100
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,466
Could you tell right away

101
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,266
where your wife's voice was coming from?

102
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,166
Huh?

103
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,166
If it's the rose garden, the connecting corridor is near

104
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,266
and so is the storeroom.

105
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:53,066
But you ran right for the tower.

106
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:55,066
That's probably because

107
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:58,866
I heard the scream coming from somewhere high.

108
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:03,566
That tower is the only tall building in that area.

109
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:06,766
That's why I thought Momoe fell.

110
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:10,266
From a tower with no entrance?

111
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:14,266
It was so sudden that it didn't dawn on me.

112
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,366
What?

113
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:19,266
The kid's aren't here?

114
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,466
-Yeah. -I looked all over the house,

115
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,566
but couldn't find them.

116
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,566
Maybe they already went home?

117
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:27,866
No. I tried calling, but was told they're not home.

118
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,466
I tell you those kids are hopeless.

119
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,166
Let's go look for them once more!

120
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,466
If we ask Mr. Nagase,

121
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:36,366
he may know of places I don't know, too.

122
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:39,666
-Dad, come with us too. -Bad news!

123
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,066
Mr. Nagase...

124
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,966
Mr. Nagase's gone!

125
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,366
What?

126
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,366
We walked pretty much, didn't we?

127
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,866
Yes. I wonder where we are now?

128
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:52,466
At any rate, I'm not giving up until I find the treasure!

129
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,266
I guess so.

130
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,966
But...

131
00:07:58,366 --> 00:07:59,666
Is this me?

132
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,866
Genta, since when did you go on a diet?

133
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,566
Stop making fun of me!

134
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,266
Cut it out!

135
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,066
It's a door?

136
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,366
Maybe...

137
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,066
The entrance to the treasure!

138
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,366
Over there!

139
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:21,366
Gosh! Even the door's making fun of me.

140
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,866
I'll catch you!

141
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:25,666
Gosh!

142
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,866
-You won't get away! -After it!

143
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,466
Huh? It's gone.

144
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,366
It got away.

145
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:36,966
Over there!

146
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,966
How do we open it?

147
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,266
Be careful.

148
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,766
Yep.

149
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,366
Genta, Mitsuhiko!

150
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,066
Are you two okay?

151
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,766
-Yeah. -Yes, somehow.

152
00:08:57,766 --> 00:09:00,166
What're you doing?

153
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,066
I'm looking for the switch.

154
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,566
Here it is.

155
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:09,566
-It's starting to open! -Okay!

156
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,466
Somebody's coming!

157
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,866
It's the culprit!

158
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,766
Hurry! Conan!

159
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,866
Gosh. Is it broken?

160
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,366
It keeps going back!

161
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,366
Mitsuhiko, you can make it in!

162
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,766
But if I let go now...

163
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,666
That's right! Wait!

164
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,666
Use this pipe!

165
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:40,766
Hurry! The culprit will come!

166
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,866
Okay, run for it!

167
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,566
-Aye! -Yes!

168
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,266
A child's room?

169
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,266
It can't be.

170
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:10,166
But there's a cute doll.

171
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,466
It's glued on.

172
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,666
This, too.

173
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,366
And this.

174
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:17,066
The books in the bookshelf are drawings.

175
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,266
But the sofa is for real.

176
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:21,466
What was this room made for?

177
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,666
Don't be deceived. It's only an illusion!

178
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,866
The only thing that's spinning is the wall.

179
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,466
Get out of the way.

180
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:03,566
I saw many split images of myself.

181
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:06,366
Is this what Tsutomu's memory is all about?

182
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,766
Genta?

183
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:14,666
What? The culprit?

184
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,566
A mirror?

185
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:23,466
What is it? Don't scare me.

186
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,666
Gosh! Where are you?

187
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,666
Mitsuhiko!

188
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,866
This way!

189
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,866
I thought I just saw the figure of a person.

190
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:44,866
Is anyone there?

191
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:47,466
There's no one here, is there?

192
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:05,066
Ouch. Here goes.

193
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,766
Ayumi!

194
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,266
Where are you? Where are you, everybody?

195
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:18,766
Cool it.

196
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:21,266
Fussing and making big noise is not going to help me find them.

197
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:23,166
Think...

198
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,866
What meaning there is to this tunnel.

199
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,966
And then think it over again.

200
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:35,066
Who of the three could've committed the crime?

201
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:36,466
The fragrance of the perfume

202
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:39,766
makes you want to deduce that the victim came into the tower.

203
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:42,866
But be it Tsutomu who was right below the tower...

204
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,566
Or Mr. Nozomi Kyodo who was in the yard...

205
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,166
Or Mr. Nagase, who ran over from the main house.

206
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,766
None of them could've had time

207
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:53,066
to push the victim off the roof and come back.

208
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:57,966
These tools...

209
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,166
Wait a sec.

210
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,166
Maybe I had it all wrong?

211
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,366
The tower and the underground passage

212
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:09,066
that was built 40 years ago.

213
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,066
It's understandable if it breaks or goes rusty.

214
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,666
So...

215
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,666
That's it!

216
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,566
This place is...

217
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:26,378
It was dimly lit and the ceiling was high.

218
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:29,678
I see! This is the treasure room.

219
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,378
Judging from the height, it the Dark Tower.

220
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,978
But it's supposed to be round.

221
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:36,778
It is a triangular pyramid.

222
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:41,478
A mirror.

223
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:44,978
Which means, this is maybe...

224
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:50,978
Conan nor the children seem to be nowhere in the house.

225
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:53,578
And, of course the same goes for Mr. Nagase.

226
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:55,878
So, the only place left is

227
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,478
the Dark Tower.

228
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:00,778
Nagase knew, didn't he?

229
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:03,978
That Seitaro hid the treasure in the tower.

230
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:05,878
I still can't believe it.

231
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,178
That the treasure that I thought was a dream actually exists.

232
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:11,178
Who cares about that!

233
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:13,678
As long the children are okay.

234
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:16,278
We've got no time to lose.

235
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:20,078
Please cooperate looking for the entrance of the tower!

236
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,778
Conan.

237
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:30,778
According to Tsutomu's story,

238
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:32,878
there should be a button somewhere.

239
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:36,578
Here it is.

240
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:39,778
So these are the buttons of three colors.

241
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,278
What's this?

242
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:44,478
The roof.

243
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:47,378
Okay, now I have a good view.

244
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:48,778
This is...

245
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,278
Momoe's fake nail.

246
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:57,278
She must've pressed it really hard.

247
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:59,278
To the point of her nail coming off...

248
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,778
Chief!

249
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:03,578
Yes, this is Megure.

250
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:06,978
It's just as I've explained, we've got no time to lose!

251
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:09,578
Please dispatch all the officers you can gather

252
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:12,078
because we must thoroughly investigate the Dark Tower.

253
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,478
What?

254
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:15,978
I don't think you need to dispatch the officers.

255
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:18,678
Just what do you mean, Conan?

256
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,978
Wait a while!

257
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,978
The key to the front entrance is...

258
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:26,078
red.

259
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,478
Hey, kid! Come back here and explain!

260
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:32,178
What? It's an earthquake!

261
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:33,978
Wrong, Mr. Mouri!

262
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:36,378
The dark tower is extending upwards!

263
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:43,678
The entrance is over there!

264
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:51,578
Welcome to the Dark Tower!

265
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:54,478
Hey, kid! Hurry and get down here!

266
00:15:54,478 --> 00:15:57,278
Pops! There's something I want to show you.

267
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:59,178
Will you come up here please?

268
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,578
No way!

269
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:03,478
I wonder if he found the treasure.

270
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:05,978
-Could be. -Treasure?

271
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,478
I'll go, I'll go! I'll be right there!

272
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:08,878
Dad.

273
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:12,078
I thought he didn't like high places.

274
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,078
Treasure, treasure!

275
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:18,178
Wait for me, my dear treasure!

276
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,878
Where's the treasure?

277
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:22,878
Watch out!

278
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:29,278
I'm falling!

279
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:36,478
Is he dozing off in a place like that?

280
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,378
How adept.

281
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,178
I'm sorry for troubling you.

282
00:16:40,178 --> 00:16:43,378
I've come up with the truth of this case, therefore...

283
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,578
What?

284
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,778
Mrs. Kyodo falling to her death was no murder

285
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:50,678
but rather, an accident.

286
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,378
An accident?

287
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,678
Are you saying she tripped or something?

288
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:58,878
Of course, it's not as simple as that.

289
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:02,278
Finding the entrance of the tower, she came up here

290
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,178
and discovered the buttons of three colors.

291
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:09,178
First, I'm sure she opened the door leading to the roof

292
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,278
to let the light in.

293
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:13,578
Conan, you're there, aren't you?

294
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,678
Yes, Pops, I'm here!

295
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:19,378
Okay, got you.

296
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:28,378
And she pushed the button. The blue button.

297
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:29,978
I would like to let you know that

298
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:34,478
I, myself haven't tested that button yet either.

299
00:17:34,478 --> 00:17:36,478
However, I do know that something happened

300
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:40,578
and because of that something, the victim fell off the tower.

301
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:43,178
I assume that's what happened.

302
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:45,378
Conan, push it, will you?

303
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:48,578
Yes, sir! The blue button, right?

304
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:56,878
What the? What's happening?

305
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:13,178
Amazing!

306
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:16,478
It's understandable that she, thinking that there would be treasure

307
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:18,878
was shocked out of her wits and fell to her death.

308
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,578
A holograph?

309
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:23,678
I guess it was considered cutting edge technology back then.

310
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:26,578
40 years ago?

311
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:29,678
Theoretically, it was known from way in the past,

312
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:30,978
but it was in 1971

313
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:34,978
when hologram using a laser beam was invented.

314
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:38,678
I saw it on TV the other day!

315
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:42,678
Although very unfortunate,

316
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:45,678
Mrs. Kyodo, was taken by surprise by the hologram

317
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,578
fell to her death from the roof...

318
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:50,578
I have no choice but to conclude it as a tragic accident.

319
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:54,878
So, Momoe went berserk till the very end.

320
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:58,378
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

321
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,278
How strange, though.

322
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:03,078
According to Tsutomu's memory, if the blue button is pushed,

323
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:05,378
the treasure was supposed to appear, right?

324
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,878
I heard from Pops

325
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:10,278
the reason why Mrs. Kyodo pushed the wrong button.

326
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:12,078
What? She made a mistake?

327
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:15,578
She did push the blue button, right?

328
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:20,878
You called the nice green vegetables blue, right?

329
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:24,178
Getting vegetables ready

330
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:27,378
is more of an important hobby to me.

331
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:30,378
You also used "blue" to describe watercress, didn't you?

332
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,778
That "blue" (green) color of the watercress stimulates the appetite.

333
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:35,978
Wrong!

334
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:39,178
When I said blue button, I meant the green one!

335
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,378
What?

336
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:41,578
True.

337
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:45,478
There are many people who refer to the color green as blue.

338
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:49,278
But the victim took the word blue literally.

339
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:51,978
I guess you can call this a tragedy

340
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:53,778
caused by the ambiguity of the Japanese language.

341
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:58,078
But if Mom pushed the green button, then what?

342
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:02,678
She would've seen what Seitaro wanted to show Tsutomu.

343
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:06,178
You're all safe after all.

344
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:07,578
Alive and kicking.

345
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:10,078
Mr. Nagase rescued us.

346
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:13,478
He got me out of the elevator that broke down!

347
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,478
Mr. Nagase kept trouble down to a minimum for us.

348
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:19,178
I'm sorry

349
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:21,278
that you had to go through a frightening experience

350
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:23,478
because I delayed making repairs.

351
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,678
What's with you, Nagase?

352
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:28,778
You mean you knew everything and didn't say a word about it?

353
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:31,078
Seitaro told me.

354
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,278
If I told Nozomi,

355
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:35,078
he would say to demolish it right away.

356
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:37,278
So, he told me that until the time came for Tsutomu

357
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,178
to succeed the family, he would leave it up to me.

358
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:44,778
But Tsutomu has no intention of succeeding the Kyodo family business,

359
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,278
forgetting the words he said when he was a child.

360
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:50,178
If the amusement park inside the tunnel is made public,

361
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:54,178
everbody would really be happy!

362
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:55,478
When I grow up,

363
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:58,078
I'm going show them this land of dreams!

364
00:20:58,078 --> 00:21:00,978
Wanting him to recall those words,

365
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:04,378
I returned to the Dark Tower to make renovations.

366
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:06,878
So, that was the other button?

367
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:08,678
The green one?

368
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:10,478
That's right.

369
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:14,678
The last treasure that Seitaro had hidden in the tower.

370
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:17,578
May I push that button?

371
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:06,278
Wow! Fantastic!

372
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:09,078
It's a super humongous kaleidoscope!

373
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:11,778
This is a kaleidoscope? Gigantic!

374
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:13,778
When the oil inside flows,

375
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:17,378
it creates millions and billions of arrays of different patterns.

376
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:20,378
So, this is the dream that Grandpa made.

377
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:22,878
-Dad! -What?

378
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:25,078
Are you going to destroy all this?

379
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:26,978
The treasure of the Kyodo family?

380
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:28,978
-Shut up! -No!

381
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:32,278
I won't let you do that as the 3rd generation successor!

382
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:34,678
I promised to Grandpa

383
00:23:34,678 --> 00:23:37,678
that I would make Kyodo a factory of dreams.

384
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:43,078
Do it if you dare.
