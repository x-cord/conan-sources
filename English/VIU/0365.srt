1
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:22,733
Today's case is an unimaginable one.

2
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:25,000
One clue however, connects the seemingly unrelated cases

3
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:26,233
and solves the mystery perfectly!

4
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,733
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:29,533
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:31,634
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:56,518
Pop's is tailing somebody.

8
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,818
A person by the name of Shoichiro Hitomi

9
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,919
falls to his death from the Beika Hotel.

10
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,018
At the same time, his twin kid brother, Takehiko,

11
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,019
is found killed by someone at his home in Haido-cho.

12
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:18,518
Could this have been synchronicity, a so called fateful coincidence?

13
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:19,718
"Shoichiro, Takehiko" -Wrong.

14
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,918
"Kanako, Kaoru Minamizato" -This is not a case of synchronicity.

15
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,418
The line that connects Kaoru with the others.

16
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,018
If I can figure out what that is, the mystery would be solved.

17
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:30,018
Why did Shoichiro attack,

18
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,318
rather, try to kill Kaoru?

19
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,519
For what reason?

20
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:41,119
"A Case of Synchronicity (Part 2)"

21
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,218
Pops, about this picture.

22
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,718
What about it?

23
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,518
Ms. Kaoru Minimizato went to the front desk

24
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,218
after Shoichiro made the call, right?

25
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:00,318
Right.

26
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,018
Back then, what was it that Kaoru said?

27
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,018
Huh?

28
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,818
Uh...

29
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,918
Did you receive anything for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

30
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,218
That person call Mr. Anzai.

31
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:16,718
Aren't you going to ask Kaoru about him one more time?

32
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,018
Shut up!

33
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,918
What seems to be the matter, Mouri?

34
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,918
I'd like to talk to Kaoru once more.

35
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,918
Wait for me, dad!

36
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,019
Pops!

37
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,319
Who are you?

38
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,018
What was that?

39
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,418
I think it came from Kaoru's room.

40
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:51,919
What?

41
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,319
Kaoru! Kaoru!

42
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,719
Kaoru!

43
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,518
Darn, they just fixed the door a while ago, not again...

44
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,219
But, I don't have a choice.

45
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,618
Kaoru!

46
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,418
Dad, nab him!

47
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,619
Okay!

48
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:21,819
I'm so sorry!

49
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,218
She's still okay, get the ambulance.

50
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:43,418
"Beika Central Hospital"

51
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:47,718
I was in a relationship with Mr. Manabu Anzai

52
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,319
when I was living in the Kansai District.

53
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,618
We were also going to get married,

54
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,119
but 6 months ago...

55
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,618
His whereabouts suddenly became unknown.

56
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,618
Is that right?

57
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:24,818
Well, I'm sorry to have suspected you.

58
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:27,718
I'm sure the man was only after your money.

59
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:31,418
Have you filed an offense report?

60
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:35,918
No. I wanted to see him and confirm things before doing so.

61
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,718
But, if you don't even know where he is...

62
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,518
Well, I came here because I was told that

63
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,719
he was seen in Tokyo somewhere.

64
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,418
But, when it actually came to looking for him,

65
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,418
I had no idea where to start looking.

66
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,618
Other than his name Mr. Anzai,

67
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:00,618
I realized that I didn't know where he was born or where he worked.

68
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:03,718
Rather, I didn't know anything about him.

69
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:06,218
He didn't say anything deliberately.

70
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:11,218
If so, it's doubtful whether Anzai is his real name or not either.

71
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,318
The only clue that I have, is a picture of him.

72
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,718
What?

73
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:18,918
May we have a look at it?

74
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,218
I met Mr. Anzai on a diving trip,

75
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,919
so I figured he'd be diving over here too.

76
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,418
I've been looking for him here and there

77
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,019
with the picture and contact number of Beika Hotel, but...

78
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,019
He's!

79
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,018
What's up, Conan?

80
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:44,218
Pops, show me your digital camera.

81
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,119
Okay.

82
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:49,519
See, it's him.

83
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,818
Please try to remember, dad.

84
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:59,218
Wasn't there anything between this man and Shoichiro?

85
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,919
No, not that I can recall, I think.

86
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:08,518
Where is that? I'll try and go there.

87
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,018
No, let us handle this.

88
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:14,018
I'm a detective so I'm used to looking for people.

89
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:17,518
By the way, the man that attacked you a while ago,

90
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,018
wasn't he Mr. Anzai?

91
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,318
Oh, I wonder.

92
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,718
Oh no... I don't know.

93
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,319
"Beika Sports Center."

94
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:32,418
It's this man in the picture.

95
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,418
Oh, you mean Mr. Tanizaki.

96
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,818
Tanizaki? His name is not Anzai?

97
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,618
Yes, I'm certain that this is Mr. Tanizaki.

98
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,918
He was using an alias after all.

99
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,118
Well, who knows if Tanizaki is his real name either though.

100
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,619
"Tennis Club Parking Lot."

101
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:54,118
Mr. Tanizaki.

102
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:57,719
Rather, should I call you Mr. Anzai?

103
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,218
May I ask what this is all about?

104
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:05,418
You know Ms. Kaoru Minamizato, don't you?

105
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,018
Who's that? No, I don't.

106
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,918
Please don't play dumb with me.

107
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,418
I'm sorry, Shin.

108
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,618
For making you wait.

109
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,818
Oh, who is that lady?

110
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,218
Who is this old man?

111
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:21,618
It's nothing. He's got the wrong person.

112
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:22,919
Hurry up and get in.

113
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:34,418
I just got mail from daddy saying

114
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,718
that he'd come up with the money for us!

115
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,718
Oh, thanks, you're a life-saver.

116
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,119
It's okay, anything for you, Shin.

117
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,419
I see.

118
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:54,918
Just as I thought.

119
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:59,819
I hate to say this, but I guess he had deceived you.

120
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,818
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako, Kaoru" -I see,

121
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:06,218
it's not all there is to it.

122
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,718
One more man...

123
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,418
whatever his name is, Tanizaki or Anzai,

124
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,919
that guy is involved in this case.

125
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,918
Kaoru's probably not the only one

126
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,518
who'd been deceived by this guy.

127
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,418
Including the woman that we saw a while ago,

128
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:22,418
he probably deceived several others more.

129
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:26,218
If Kaoru found out, she would indict him.

130
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:29,118
That's why he wanted to shut Kaoru up.

131
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,619
There is a motive for him to kill.

132
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,618
In other words, Shoichiro and that guy

133
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:37,618
are connected to each other with the sports center.

134
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,719
But this can be brushed away as mere coincidence.

135
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,119
Shoichiro's accidental death.

136
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:58,318
"Takehiko Hitomi, (45)" -And Takehiko's homicide

137
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,219
which occurred at the same time.

138
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,319
And Kaoru's assault and battery case.

139
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,818
"Unknow man" -I've got to figure this one out after all.

140
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,718
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako, Kaoru."

141
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,818
Wait a sec.

142
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,418
I get it.

143
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,319
So that's the story!

144
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:28,687
"Beika Hotel."

145
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:30,687
Ran.

146
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:32,886
What is it, Conan?

147
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:36,186
Pops told me to tell you to take pictures of these diagrams

148
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,987
because he'll be using them later.

149
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,386
Mouri, everyone's here.

150
00:10:58,387 --> 00:10:59,986
Yes, sir.

151
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:03,586
Thank you all for coming.

152
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:05,786
And, what is this?

153
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:07,286
What're you going to start?

154
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:10,186
I'm going to unravel the mystery of the two cases.

155
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:11,786
Cases?

156
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:15,586
Wasn't Shoichiro's case an accident?

157
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:18,586
Whether it was an accident or had to do with synchronicity,

158
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:19,886
everything fit too well into place.

159
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,786
Until it makes people feel very abnormal.

160
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:28,286
In other words, a frightening perfect murder was being schemed.

161
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,586
Perfect crime?

162
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:33,986
Yes, if it worked out the way it should've.

163
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:36,586
Ran, is the monitor ready?

164
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:38,086
Okay.

165
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:42,286
To be honest, I was concerned about something from the very beginning.

166
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,686
Despite owning a cell phone,

167
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:50,086
Shoichiro made a call using the public phone in the lobby of the hotel.

168
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:53,287
Although the place was not even an out of service range area.

169
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,086
He did so

170
00:11:57,087 --> 00:12:00,886
because he didn't want anyone to know who he was calling.

171
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,886
Why didn't he want anybody to know?

172
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:05,686
He didn't want to leave any evidence behind.

173
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,386
Just in case he had to justify himself and this evidence

174
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:08,986
would work against him.

175
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:12,286
Oh, and who was the person on the other side of the line?

176
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:16,587
Most probably the woman who was staying at this hotel...

177
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:22,487
Kaoru Minamizato.

178
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:33,186
Kaoru, what were the contents of the phone call

179
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,486
that you received back then?

180
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:40,486
Well, that he received something from Mr. Anzai

181
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:43,686
and had taken it to the front desk.

182
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:47,686
But I was told that the front desk didn't have anything for me.

183
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:50,486
Why did he lie and make that phone call?

184
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:53,686
Because he didn't know Ms. Kaoru's face.

185
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,186
Who didn't know?

186
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:57,186
Shoichiro.

187
00:12:57,187 --> 00:13:00,286
That's why he called Ms. Kaoru to confirm what she looked like.

188
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,787
And...

189
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:27,186
He ambushed Kaoru, then attacked her.

190
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,886
However, I happened to be there.

191
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:33,687
Shoichiro who attempted to flee from the veranda...

192
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:44,386
But, why did he attack me, who he didn't know at all?

193
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:48,587
Because it would be very convenient for the culprit.

194
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:51,886
If he didn't know you at all, he would not have a motive.

195
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:55,586
In other words, he would not be suspected either.

196
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:59,786
I don't really understand what you're trying to get at.

197
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:03,586
Kanako, do know why Shoichiro called you

198
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:06,086
to tell you to come all the way to Beika?

199
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:08,187
About that...

200
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:11,886
So that my husband wouldn't find out?

201
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:14,886
No, he used you for his alibi.

202
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,586
To establish an alibi?

203
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:22,086
Shoichiro has no motive to kill Kaoru.

204
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:23,287
However...

205
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:28,487
You're fired, get out of here, this minute!

206
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:32,586
He has a motive to kill Takehiko.

207
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:35,986
But, he could've established his alibi any other way.

208
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:37,186
Yes.

209
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:40,786
But the fact was, he had another important purpose.

210
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:43,786
It was to make Kanako leave the house

211
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:46,486
and make sure that Takehiko was at home alone.

212
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:50,786
After all, it would be troublesome to have Kanako at home,

213
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:53,186
-if he wanted to murder Takehiko. -What?

214
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:55,086
Please try to remember,

215
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,986
the call you received from Shoichiro.

216
00:14:56,987 --> 00:14:59,986
What was his first question?

217
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:01,186
Is Takehiko here?

218
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:02,986
Yes, he is.

219
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:05,186
He wanted to know where Takehiko was.

220
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:06,886
And he made sure Takehiko was home,

221
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:09,586
he went on to say that he wanted to see you.

222
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:11,586
Can you come out to Beika?

223
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:12,986
Okay.

224
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:16,986
In front of the station at 12.30 pm. See you.

225
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:18,186
He called you on his cell phone

226
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,286
from the toilet of the sports center.

227
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,686
I'm pretty sure that there was one other person near him at that time.

228
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:26,786
Shoichiro probably checked on

229
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:29,186
the whereabouts of Takehiko for this person,

230
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,387
as well as lure Kanako out.

231
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:34,786
Ran, can you display the relationship connection diagram?

232
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:35,987
Okay.

233
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,786
At first glance, it looks to be a case

234
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:40,886
that is complicatedly interwoven,

235
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:43,286
But if we omit Kanako,

236
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:46,687
who was just used to carry out the murders...

237
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,386
It's true it starts to look way more simple.

238
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,786
But, who is that character to the lower right?

239
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:55,586
There's Shoichiro who has murderous feelings towards Takehiko

240
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,886
and as for Kaoru, the man over there,

241
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:01,586
who uses an array of aliases had murderous feelings towards her.

242
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,586
I guess we'll just call you Mr. Anzai for now.

243
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:06,986
Murderous feelings that would never had intersected

244
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:10,086
and a plan to carry them out was established,

245
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,286
when Shoichiro and you, Mr. Anzai encountered each other.

246
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:14,987
A plan for exchange murder!

247
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:22,086
You must've really panicked, Mr. Azai,

248
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:24,486
when you succeeded carrying out your part of the deal,

249
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:30,086
and Shoichiro goofed, on top of getting himself killed.

250
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,186
Because of this,

251
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:36,887
you ended up having to kill Kaoru with your own hands.

252
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:44,187
Therefore, you head off to Beika Hotel by yourself.

253
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,786
An exchange murder?

254
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:56,786
Say what you like.

255
00:16:56,787 --> 00:17:00,787
Do you have evidence, though? Some kind of definite proof?

256
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,287
Dad.

257
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:08,786
Well, of course, that's an understandable remark.

258
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:12,186
Inspector Megure, were you able to find the thing in question

259
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,586
in the vicinity of Takehiko's residence?

260
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:19,186
Yeah, it came out of a trash can of a nearby park.

261
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:21,386
That's the key of our house.

262
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:26,186
Kanako, that's the key that you gave to Shoichiro, isn't it?

263
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:28,886
-Yes. -Strangely enough,

264
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:32,487
this key was not found among Shoichiro's belongings.

265
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,786
He had given it to Mr. Anzai.

266
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:40,586
Since he had no intention of getting it back,

267
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:43,587
so maybe it's more appropriate to say, he gave it to you.

268
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:49,586
As for you, Mr. Anzai, although you used the key to go into the house,

269
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:52,786
figuring that it would only serve as evidence if you have it on you,

270
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,586
you decided to throw it away.

271
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,986
Why was the window cracked, then?

272
00:17:57,987 --> 00:18:02,486
Of course it was just to make it look as if a robber had broken in.

273
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,386
There was no meaning for him to leave the key back in the room,

274
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:09,086
so he locked the door and left.

275
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:12,286
Amazing how you deduced that far.

276
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:16,186
Please think back to where Takehiko was lying on the floor.

277
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:18,886
It was right by the front door, wasn't it?

278
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:21,386
If the window had been cracked first,

279
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:24,286
even though Takehiko was in the living room,

280
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:27,286
he would've headed for the study to check out what happened.

281
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:32,187
However, he in fact, heard someone come in from the front door...

282
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:37,086
He ran into you, Mr. Anzai as you came in,

283
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:39,087
and was killed.

284
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,486
Did you find any fingerprints on the key or what?

285
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:53,787
No, you must've wiped it off before getting rid of it.

286
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:56,586
It doesn't matter either way.

287
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:58,986
If you have no evidence,

288
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:00,686
sorry, but I think I'm leaving.

289
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:03,586
Then, how about something like this?

290
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:06,387
-Ran, can you take out the picture, please? -Yes.

291
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:10,087
What is it?

292
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:12,186
Looking for a mistake.

293
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:15,286
Will everyone here look very carefully?

294
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,287
The picture to the left

295
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,086
is Mr. Anzai before he goes into the restroom.

296
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:23,187
The picture to the right is Mr. Anzai when he comes out.

297
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:35,187
The key!

298
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,086
You have no way out at this point.

299
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,587
Admit your shameful deeds.

300
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,786
When I was shown the picture at a diving shop I used to frequent,

301
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:03,486
shivers went through my spine.

302
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,986
I somehow made it through back then,

303
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:09,586
but when I thought of the time that Kaoru eventually finds me...

304
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,487
It was just around that time.

305
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,386
Darn, that Takehiko.

306
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:19,687
He can just drop dead for all I care.

307
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,487
He can just drop dead.

308
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:34,086
What do you say we commit exchange murders?

309
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:36,686
Even if we do get caught, we would have no motive,

310
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:39,287
and besides, we'll have a perfect alibi.

311
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:43,986
Let me sleep on it.

312
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:46,286
I've gone as far as tell you this much,

313
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,187
I really don't want you to refuse this offer.

314
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:52,886
He was not all for it to begin with,

315
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:55,086
but after I convinced him that we would never be caught,

316
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,986
he decided to do it.

317
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:01,486
So, you're the one who talked him into this after all.

318
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:04,686
By the way, Shoichiro seems to have repented

319
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:08,386
after realizing what a serious crime he had committed.

320
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:11,286
Sorry, I don't know what's come over me.

321
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:12,987
Please overlook this.

322
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:18,286
He was probably cornered to no end.

323
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:22,086
That's why he was conned into going along with your plan.

324
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:24,286
A disgusting crime.

325
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,187
You're really going to have to make amends.

326
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:55,986
"Chiezo Nekura, (31). Frequent offenders, arrest!"

327
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:58,586
After his face was seen in the newspapers

328
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,986
people claiming that they were victimized came out one after the other.

329
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:03,486
He must've been a real villain.

330
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,886
Villain is just enough to describe his abhorrence.

331
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:10,186
That's why he comes up with an idea like exchange murders.

332
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:14,786
I wonder if this was a case of synchronicity too.

333
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:18,786
Because the fact that dad was tailing Shoichiro,

334
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:22,886
and dad bursting into the room when Shoichiro attacked Kaoru

335
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:24,586
were all coincidences, right?

336
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:29,686
You gotta remember when Kaoru was attacked by that man too.

337
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:33,086
If I didn't say let's go back, she would've been in serious danger.

338
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:35,486
It was me who said that.

339
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:37,186
Oh, well, who cares?

340
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:39,886
I wonder if this is synchronicity too.

341
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,386
What is, Conan?

342
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,286
Whenever Pops successfully solves a case,

343
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:47,386
we're coincidentally always blessed!

344
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:49,286
-What? -Dad.

345
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:52,186
This is all thanks to my wisdom and chance!

346
00:23:52,187 --> 00:23:53,787
Dad.

347
00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:01,986
"Next Episode."

348
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,287
You got a catch!

349
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:21,087
Mr. Ejiri?

350
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:23,086
Next Conan,

351
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:27,387
"Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 1)"

352
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:45,886
Next Conan's Hint:

353
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,486
"Fishing terminology."
