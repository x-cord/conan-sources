1
00:00:02,453 --> 00:00:04,352
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:06,452
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:07,852
Mystery that's out of season.

4
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:09,752
Everybody's feelings help solve a case.

5
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:11,252
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:13,152
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,153 --> 00:00:15,153
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:04,713
Dear, please hang in there.

9
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:07,513
Don't let go, please.

10
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,613
Take it easy, Mrs. Nagakura.

11
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:11,714
Wait a minute!

12
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:18,813
This is not a mark left by hitting or scraping...

13
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,913
What is it?

14
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:24,613
Don't get in the way, young man.

15
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:26,014
Excuse me.

16
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:36,813
He's unconscious and seriously injured.

17
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:40,413
Questioning at the hospital would be difficult.

18
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:43,813
Well, I didn't notice anything.

19
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,813
I drank too much and was fast asleep.

20
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:47,413
Excuse me,

21
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:51,513
"Shokichi Sakaki (52)" -but Mr. Mouri can solve cases in his sleep.

22
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:54,613
Well...

23
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:56,813
Mouri?

24
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:58,313
You're the the Sleeping Kogoro,

25
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:59,913
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

26
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,613
The detective.

27
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:04,313
The famous detective, yes.

28
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:06,913
Sorry, Mr. Mouri.

29
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:09,113
The higher-ups gave me their consent.

30
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:12,214
So please help investigate this case with us.

31
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,313
From your higher-ups...

32
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:17,614
Well...

33
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:26,714
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 2)"

34
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:28,913
We are expecting this village

35
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:30,713
to be registered as the World Heritage soon,

36
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:33,113
and we do not want any incident like this happening here.

37
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:35,913
As a matter of fact, I'm from this village,

38
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:38,813
and I hope the case closes as early as possible.

39
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:41,913
So please help us on this matter, Mr. Mouri!

40
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:43,013
I see.

41
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,313
If you insist,

42
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:46,413
I, Kogoro Mouri,

43
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:49,013
will give my best in this case.

44
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:51,214
Thank you very much, sir.

45
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:55,113
So rest assured and don't worry.

46
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:57,713
Well then, excuse me for rushing you,

47
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:58,813
but who is the culprit?

48
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:00,313
What?

49
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:03,313
It can't possibly be a ghost.

50
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:04,713
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:07,113
Of course not.

52
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,613
Oh, I'm speaking to the other party.

53
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,513
Then that means the culprit is...

54
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:13,213
Yes, of course.

55
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:14,414
It's him.

56
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:28,113
But you saw Mami too, right?

57
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:31,413
No. Something made you think you did.

58
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:34,314
You mean like the laundry?

59
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,089
But because Ayumi saw something,

60
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:42,014
it helped to find out which way the culprit fled.

61
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:47,413
This way leads to a dead end.

62
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,813
He leaves the village.

63
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:50,814
That means...

64
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,313
The culprit is yet to leave the village!

65
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:56,513
And at this time of the day,

66
00:04:56,514 --> 00:05:00,213
he wouldn't choose to come from outside this village.

67
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:02,213
That means the culprit is

68
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:05,113
one of the people in Onizawa village,

69
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:06,313
including the tourists.

70
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:08,613
Who are you kids to...

71
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:10,913
Don't bother yourself over them.

72
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:14,513
Any layman can think up what they just said.

73
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,613
That's right.

74
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,614
Stay out of it, all of you.

75
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:21,613
Furthermore, there's something more important

76
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,513
that you should note.

77
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:25,213
And what's that?

78
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:28,413
The culprit hid the rope there in the daytime,

79
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:32,013
during the sightseeing tour,

80
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:36,314
and used that rope at night to break into the house.

81
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:39,513
Then it means that...

82
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:44,013
the culprit is somebody who is not from Mr. Nagakura house,

83
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:46,513
where the Mouri party stayed at,

84
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,013
but is definitely among one of the guests.

85
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:51,113
Just as expected, Mr. Mouri!

86
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:53,913
I'm so impressed!

87
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:55,213
It's nothing.

88
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:57,014
It's just one of the things I do!

89
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:00,713
That is that.

90
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,313
But the question is

91
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:05,013
what was the culprit doing there?

92
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:06,514
That's more important.

93
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:12,713
Don't push me, Genta.

94
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:14,213
Hurry up...

95
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:17,313
One more floor to climb.

96
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:20,113
Maybe he was just a thief after all?

97
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:24,213
But what was he trying to steal?

98
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:27,013
Then, did I imagine what I saw after all?

99
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:30,313
If Conan says so, he could be right.

100
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:31,613
But...

101
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:34,313
He was not exactly stealing something.

102
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:38,113
But I'm sure he was looking for something.

103
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:40,314
What was that thing he was looking for?

104
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:45,013
-What's wrong? -Nothing.

105
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:46,413
I just thought from here,

106
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,013
you can get a good view of the scene

107
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:50,413
where Mr. Nagakura was stabbed.

108
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,913
If you can get a good view from here,

109
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,714
it means this place is in clear view from there too.

110
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:59,214
Of course! That explains it!

111
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:02,113
What did you say?

112
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:04,614
Conan, did something happen?

113
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:08,314
Hey, kid!

114
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,114
Just as I thought. It's true.

115
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:18,013
What's wrong with this?

116
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:20,113
Keep off! You'll get a rash if you touch it.

117
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:23,413
A lacquer tree, isn't it?

118
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:26,014
I remember that the hand of Mr. Nagakura got...

119
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:32,113
Yeah. It means Mr. Nagakura passed by here yesterday.

120
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:33,214
Murderer!

121
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:39,913
You lied. Liar.

122
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:41,713
What is this all about?

123
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:42,813
He is the one

124
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:46,513
that was rude to everyone the day before yesterday.

125
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:49,213
Could it be that he did it to Mr. Nagakura?

126
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:53,913
But then, why are those villagers at each other?

127
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:56,013
I can explain that.

128
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:57,313
Why?

129
00:07:57,314 --> 00:08:01,113
I read an article in a magazine on the way here.

130
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,713
When applying for the World Heritage,

131
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:06,613
the villagers were separated into two opposing groups.

132
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:10,113
One group opposed saying that there would be no need for more tourism.

133
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:14,013
The other wanted to promote the existence of this village to the world.

134
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:15,213
If I remember correctly,

135
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:17,813
Mr. Nagakura represented the group that promoted the application.

136
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,413
Is that so?

137
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:21,813
That's why Mr. Nagakura was trying to say...

138
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:23,013
All of you...

139
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:25,413
-Who's behind all this? -Dear!

140
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:28,113
I got it. They are behind all this!

141
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:29,613
When he said "them",

142
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:32,113
he meant the opposing group.

143
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:34,213
Calm down, people.

144
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,713
Let the police take over and please go home.

145
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:39,513
-We can't. -Let's decide now.

146
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:41,613
-That's right. -Hey, he is getting away.

147
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:44,113
-Don't let him get away. Get him. -Stop it, everyone.

148
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:46,413
"Onizawa Village Office."

149
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:48,013
An investigator?

150
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:51,013
Yes. He said he was sent from the committee

151
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:54,213
that is involved in accepting applications for World Heritage.

152
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:55,913
I heard before that

153
00:08:55,914 --> 00:09:00,613
there is a special undercover investigator,

154
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:02,513
who makes a fair evaluation.

155
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:03,613
That's right.

156
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:06,713
But in his case, he is the official investigator.

157
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:09,113
You took bribes from those municipalities

158
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:13,013
as resources for promotion.

159
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:15,013
Am I right, Mr. Kawaji?

160
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,513
I don't know what you're talking about.

161
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,113
"Kensaku Kawaji (37)" -Cut it out.

162
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:19,613
Suits for damage have been filed already.

163
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:21,013
And we've got the goods on you.

164
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:24,613
You asked Mr. Nagakura for commission, but was turned down,

165
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,713
so you got mad at him, lost yourself

166
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:28,613
and did it, didn't you?

167
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,613
Stop talking nonsense!

168
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:32,813
Sure, I talked about money,

169
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:35,113
and it's true that I was turned down.

170
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,813
That's why I gave up and went to bed early

171
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:39,213
because I decided to leave here today.

172
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:41,513
I stayed inside the house.

173
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,113
You are an old dog at this business,

174
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:45,913
and you gave up just like that?

175
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:47,513
Do you expect me to believe you?

176
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:50,013
I'm an old dog at this business, that's why I gave up!

177
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:52,713
My experience told me the sooner I quit the better.

178
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:55,313
I know when I can't expect money!

179
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:56,813
Look at this!

180
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:58,413
This is...

181
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:01,013
It's Mr. Nagakura's watchman's record book.

182
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,313
The record says for the night.

183
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:07,513
"All is well" up to the ninth house.

184
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:10,013
Mr. Nagakura was found

185
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:14,413
on the way to the ninth house.

186
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,913
It's very close to the Ishioka house

187
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,113
where you spent the night.

188
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,613
I don't know anything.

189
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:23,013
I didn't choose to stay in that house.

190
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:25,713
Is there anyone who saw you asleep?

191
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:28,214
I was alone in the room, so no one did.

192
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,613
But it's not me!

193
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:34,313
I didn't do a foolish thing like stab a man.

194
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:35,613
"Onizawa Village Office" -After that,

195
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:38,913
Kensaku Kawaji was taken to the police as a material witness

196
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:41,513
for extortion and attempted murder.

197
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:45,813
But he totally denied attempted murder.

198
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:49,213
He also denied charges for unlawful entry

199
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,513
into the Mr. Nagakura house.

200
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:54,714
So, the case seemed to be closed.

201
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,678
Thank you very much for everything.

202
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,179
Thanks to you, we were able to get Mr. Kawaji.

203
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:15,259
How about drinking to the success of getting him?

204
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:16,483
Gosh.

205
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:19,583
I would like to say sure.

206
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:22,483
But we have to start questioning him.

207
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:24,184
Of course...

208
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:30,083
The Nagakuras went through a series of misfortunes, so far.

209
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,483
It's good that the case is closed,

210
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,183
rather, I'm glad that the case is closed.

211
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:36,783
A series of misfortunes?

212
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:40,883
You're talking about his son, Eiji Nagakura, right?

213
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,583
What a terrible thing to happen...

214
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:43,983
"Jewel Thief Commits Suicide."

215
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,483
"Robbery-murder Case in Shoujin."

216
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:47,983
"Death of Suspect, Half Year Case Closed" -I'm sure it's her.

217
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:52,383
Mami believes that Eiji is not guilty and comes to see him.

218
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:54,083
And Eiji.

219
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:56,083
That fellow is not my son!

220
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:58,183
Keep that in mind!

221
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,783
Well, anyway...

222
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,783
After all of these things, ten days ago,

223
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:07,383
they renovated the rooftop after 30 years,

224
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:12,183
and they moved the whole house to the present site.

225
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:14,183
What? Moved the whole house?

226
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:15,883
What is it?

227
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:18,283
They moved that big house?

228
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:19,383
Is that so?

229
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:22,684
That explains why the foundation looked so new.

230
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:27,284
It sure surprised me but that's not all.

231
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:30,483
What?

232
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:34,183
Mr. Nagakura's house was here until a half month ago?

233
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,583
Yes.

234
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:38,983
The house was moved from here to where it is now.

235
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,783
This Otozawa house had been over there

236
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:43,483
and they exchanged the houses all together.

237
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:45,783
Why did they do that?

238
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:48,383
They said they did it for complete reversal or something.

239
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:49,683
It's probably because

240
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:53,683
the place over there commands the best view in the whole village.

241
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,983
As a representative of promotion for World Heritage application,

242
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,583
he managed to do it.

243
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:01,283
At least some people say so.

244
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:03,483
Well, anyway, they really look alike.

245
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,883
Yes. It sure is identical.

246
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:08,783
You mean to Mr. Nagakura's house?

247
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:11,983
At night, you could easily mistake one for the other.

248
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:14,183
If the motive of the culprit had nothing to do

249
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:18,584
with the application for the World Heritage...

250
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:23,083
In other word, if the culprit simply made a mistake

251
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,084
and took one house for another...

252
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,684
-Hey, Conan! -Did anything happen?

253
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:33,683
Conan!

254
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:36,583
Stop running.

255
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,183
Just as I thought.

256
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,083
They are identical inside, too.

257
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:42,183
When he was in Mr. Nagakura house,

258
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:43,584
he was somewhere around here looking for...

259
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:50,684
I've found it.

260
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,784
What did you find?

261
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:58,183
-Great! -Terrific sight to see!

262
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:01,583
Beautiful, very beautiful..

263
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:02,584
Are these...

264
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:05,183
Yeah. Most likely...

265
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:06,883
Hello?

266
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:08,883
Oh, it's you, Shinichi.

267
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:10,083
What's that?

268
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:13,683
The jewelry stolen in the robbery case...

269
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,783
Where are they now?

270
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,983
They are still missing.

271
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:22,383
Police concluded that they had been disposed of a long time ago.

272
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:24,584
Speaking of missing...

273
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,083
When he made his escape from the shop,

274
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,583
he took a jeweler hostage

275
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,883
and the hostage is still missing.

276
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,783
They say that the hostage was killed

277
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:37,983
when he was no longer of any use, but...

278
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:38,984
It's hot!

279
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,583
It's not... It was...

280
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,384
It's nothing. Nothing to do with you at all.

281
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:54,983
Are you all right, Conan?

282
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:56,383
That thing, you know?

283
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:59,583
We'd better give them to the police.

284
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,183
Keep your voice down.

285
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:04,683
Well, thanks, ladies.

286
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:06,884
Come. Here you go.

287
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:14,583
As I expected. The real culprit is that person.

288
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:17,084
The person who will show up at that place tonight.

289
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,284
"Otozawa"

290
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:23,984
I've found it.

291
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:32,284
We've been expecting you, mister.

292
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:36,183
We've been waiting for you.

293
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,183
And you can't run away this time.

294
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,083
What're you talking about?

295
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:43,383
I just couldn't sleep and took a walk

296
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:46,983
but got lost because the house was so much alike...

297
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:49,783
Then, what's with that jewelry you have?

298
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:52,983
You broke into the jeweler's shop in the neighboring town

299
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:54,483
and took them, didn't you?

300
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:56,183
I don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,183
You can't fool us.

302
00:15:58,184 --> 00:16:01,383
You are the principal culprit of the jewelry robbery

303
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:02,783
who killed Mr. Eiji Nagakura

304
00:16:02,784 --> 00:16:05,284
and made it look like suicide. Am I right?

305
00:16:06,484 --> 00:16:07,983
Mr. Eiji...

306
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:10,483
seems to have been in debt.

307
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:13,783
That's why he was made to watch out for the robbery.

308
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:16,783
So it was you alone who carried out the jewelry robbery

309
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:19,483
and murdered the watchman.

310
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:20,883
I know nothing.

311
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:23,183
What you're talking about is beyond...

312
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:25,083
When fleeing,

313
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,383
you visited this Onizawa village

314
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,383
as guided by Mr. Eiji.

315
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:29,483
You hid the jewelry you robbed

316
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:33,183
in the Otozawa house which was vacant at that time.

317
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,983
You never dreamed that the house itself

318
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:39,583
would be moved in half a month.

319
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:43,183
Then, you pinned the guilt on Mr. Eiji alone,

320
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,183
and killed him making it look like he committed suicide.

321
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:49,483
Then you came here as a tourist

322
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:51,983
to retrieve the jewelry you hid.

323
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:55,684
That's the jewelry in your left hand, isn't it?

324
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,683
That night,

325
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,383
you assumed Mr. Nagakura was away,

326
00:17:02,384 --> 00:17:05,483
you were looking for the jewelry but were discovered

327
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,483
so you got out through the window.

328
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,583
That means that you didn't break into the house

329
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:12,183
but were inside from the beginning.

330
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:16,583
Unfortunately, Mr. Nagakura saw you when he was on watch.

331
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:20,784
When he hurriedly rushed back to his house...

332
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,383
The watch record shows that something went wrong

333
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,583
with the order in which the seals were stamped.

334
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:36,383
I'm just an old man and a tourist.

335
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,983
I just found this by accident.

336
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:43,583
I knew that you're not just an old man and a tourist

337
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:46,584
when I noticed the mark around your right eye.

338
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,783
That mark is the trace of a loupe.

339
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:55,983
The jeweler who was taken as hostage, murdered, and missing

340
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:59,284
is none other than you, Mr. Sakaki.

341
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:02,483
Surely...

342
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:04,483
But after the culprit commits suicide,

343
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:07,383
I was scared and hiding myself

344
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:10,683
and now I conjured up enough courage to come out

345
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:12,983
to retrieve the jewelry and return it.

346
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:16,983
What if I were to say that, kids?

347
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,683
So, you admit that

348
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:21,583
you were looking for the jewelry on the third floor

349
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:22,883
of Mr. Nagakura's house last night.

350
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:26,783
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

351
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:29,283
When you went out through the window

352
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:31,783
and injured Mr. Nagakura, is that right?

353
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:32,883
Oh, that!

354
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:35,983
I was drunk with sake and sound asleep.

355
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,483
So I couldn't possibly have done it.

356
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,584
Then, when and where did you get the rash?

357
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,183
When you both were drinking sake together,

358
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:50,783
both of you had no rash or reddening on you.

359
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:53,083
The people who were with you at dinner

360
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:54,883
can easily prove it.

361
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,783
But the red rash on both of you is evidence

362
00:18:57,784 --> 00:19:00,784
that you were at the same place at the same time.

363
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:06,383
Mr. Nagakura!

364
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:08,083
Call an ambulance!

365
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:10,283
That is the only place in the village that has lacquer trees.

366
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:11,983
There is no other place.

367
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,183
That settles it.

368
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:17,083
You! Who are you to press on me?

369
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:20,283
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

370
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,083
-We're the Youth Detective Squad! -We're the Youth Detective Squad!

371
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:25,283
You are talking rubbish! Get off!

372
00:19:25,284 --> 00:19:27,984
I'm not going to get caught for all the effort I made.

373
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:33,083
Give me back...

374
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:37,183
Give me back my Eiji...

375
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:38,383
Give him back!

376
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:40,383
Keep off, you... Get off of me.

377
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:41,984
Okay! Now!

378
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,084
Get this!

379
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:56,984
It hurts...

380
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,883
You've done well, Ayumi!

381
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,583
That's what real acting is, Ayumi.

382
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,683
You are worthy of an Academy Award!

383
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:25,283
What?

384
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:26,583
Act?

385
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:29,683
I was just standing there all the time.

386
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:32,683
But, then what was that...

387
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:34,784
Look at that!

388
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:41,283
Mist, it's the mist.

389
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:42,284
Look closely.

390
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:44,384
-What? Mist? -Mist?

391
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:48,283
The Brocken spectre.

392
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:50,683
The one you look from time to time

393
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,383
out of an airplane or mountain top.

394
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,084
I see. That's what it was!

395
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:00,583
Yes.

396
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:03,683
There is nothing in this world

397
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:05,184
that you cannot solve by logic and reasoning.

398
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:37,284
Mr. Mouri!

399
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:45,883
Thanks for the call yesterday.

400
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:47,483
What? Call?

401
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:50,583
Thanks to you, we got to check him before he tried to escape.

402
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:52,783
As expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

403
00:22:52,784 --> 00:22:56,483
I, Tamekichi Matsushiro, really respect you, sir.

404
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:57,983
Respect!

405
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:00,183
That's right.

406
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:03,784
Sure thing...

407
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:11,683
I wish I could see you even if just for an instant.

408
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:14,584
I don't mind if you're a ghost, Mami.

409
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:19,483
Hurry up, Ayumi.

410
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:21,083
We're going.

411
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:23,583
I'm coming up.

412
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:25,284
Wait for me!

413
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:29,183
And the two houses that have been moved were returned

414
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,583
and placed back to where they originally were.

415
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,083
After recovered from his injury,

416
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:36,883
Mr. Nagakura thought that the spirit of the girl,

417
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:39,983
who had been a close friend of his deceased son,

418
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:43,583
had revealed the truth about the death of his son.

419
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:44,783
Of course.

420
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:48,584
I, the detective of logic and reasoning, didn't believe it.

421
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:51,383
Two months later,

422
00:23:51,384 --> 00:23:55,684
Onizawa village was officially registered as a World Heritage.

423
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,283
"Next Episode" -Detective is my business

424
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:02,883
and I fight against the darkness of the society they call crime.

425
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:05,284
What's pops doing, anyway?

426
00:24:06,384 --> 00:24:08,083
Kill?

427
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:11,783
If he doesn't do it means he is sloppy or...

428
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,583
Or he foresaw that somebody else would find it

429
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:15,483
at the sound of telephone bell,

430
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:17,883
and hid it here on purpose.

431
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:19,283
Three...

432
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:21,684
3,000 yen! That could be...

433
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,683
Next Conan,

434
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:27,684
"Forgotten Cell phone (Part 1)"

435
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:44,883
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,583
"Telephone number."

437
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:47,584
Question!

438
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:50,283
What is the name of the coffee shop below the Mouri Detective Agency?

439
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:52,584
Are you the young lady who just poured beer?
