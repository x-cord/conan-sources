1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,531
Ski trails.

2
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:04,631
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:06,331
A murder feigned to be an accident.

4
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,731
Disclose the subtle trick using the snowman!

5
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:10,231
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,831
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:13,931
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:58,121
We came to the snowy mountains with Dr. Agasa.

9
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,921
Beside Genta and the others who are making a snowman,

10
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,921
there are four art university students who are making a snowman

11
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:05,721
for their graduation project who we become acquainted with.

12
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:16,721
Yes, this is Sakuko.

13
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,321
Huh? Talk with me?

14
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:20,421
Right now?

15
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:25,721
Then one of them, Ms. Sakuko Kokura,

16
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:29,621
is found dead in a lake below a cliff by the lodge.

17
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:35,321
Well then, let's go to the cliff where she is thought to have fallen from.

18
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,421
There may be traces of an accident left, too.

19
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:39,921
Accident?

20
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:41,621
It can't be.

21
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:45,221
I wonder if a person who promised to have meals with others in an hour

22
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,921
would go out into the blizzard, carry the snowboard

23
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,821
and go all the way up the ski trail?

24
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:54,921
If this is homicide, the culprit must be one of these three.

25
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,021
I can't figure out...

26
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,121
how Sakuko who was in the lodge...

27
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:06,221
was thrown into the lake.

28
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:13,921
"The Unbreakable Snowman (Part 2)"

29
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:19,421
This is probably the place where she fell.

30
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,721
Despite the fence being broken, all that's left is the sign.

31
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,021
It seems to have broken last week

32
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:26,121
and it was scheduled to be repaired this weekend.

33
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:30,521
There seems to be no trace of the snowboard here.

34
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,621
It's possible that they could've been erased by the blizzard.

35
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,321
Snowman?

36
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:41,121
Could this possibly be it?

37
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,621
The graduation project that you mentioned?

38
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:46,421
Yes. What about it?

39
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,421
While you were making this, Mr. Itabashi,

40
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,821
did you hear Sakuko's voice?

41
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:54,921
I mean, you were pretty close to the place where she fell from.

42
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:57,821
No. I was here till before 1 pm,

43
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,321
when I promised to have lunch with everyone.

44
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,621
I didn't hear her voice at all.

45
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:07,921
I was absorbed in making this and the blizzard was pretty bad.

46
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:09,221
The wind was howling loudly, too.

47
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:14,621
And I've been bothered about something for a while.

48
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,821
What's this?

49
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:17,921
A snowman.

50
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,221
But the thing is,

51
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:22,821
Itabashi is the only one who knows how close it is to being finished.

52
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,421
Because the blueprint's in his head.

53
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:27,321
A snowman?

54
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:30,221
Well, even I can tell that it's incomplete.

55
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,721
Because, look,

56
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,021
there are apples, bananas and oranges over there.

57
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,621
You guys were gonna use these later, right?

58
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:37,821
You're wrong.

59
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:41,221
Those are for our snowman.

60
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:43,721
The head fell off because of the blizzard.

61
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,921
What?

62
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:46,921
Is that right?

63
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,021
I see.

64
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,221
Hey, hold up!

65
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,321
Don't step on that place too much

66
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,221
because the detective badges are buried there.

67
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:00,221
Oh, I'm sorry.

68
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,821
How nostalgic.

69
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,521
I used to do this when I was a child, too.

70
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,921
Putting gloves on the tip of a stalk.

71
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:10,921
Not again!

72
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,021
Hey, are you all right?

73
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:21,721
Genta!

74
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,721
Genta!

75
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,721
Is something coming out?

76
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,721
Genta.

77
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,721
-You've got a nose bleed. -You've got a nose bleed.

78
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,321
-A nose bleed. -A nose bleed.

79
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:37,121
Gosh, don't move.

80
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,721
Here.

81
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,021
All finished.

82
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:46,021
All you've got to do is stay still for a while, okay?

83
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:48,121
Okay.

84
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:52,721
Ai, you're fantastic! Just like a nurse!

85
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,721
Talk about unlucky.

86
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,921
No. I envy you, Genta!

87
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:01,921
But I can't believe you got a nosebleed from falling on snow.

88
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,921
I guess something must have been buried under there.

89
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,421
There was nothing like that buried.

90
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,621
But it tasted sort of funny.

91
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,921
Tasted funny?

92
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,121
Funny taste?

93
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,921
-The snow? -Yeah.

94
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,721
Hey, Genta. How did it taste?

95
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,021
The snow. How did that snow taste?

96
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:24,721
It was salty.

97
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:27,621
That's...

98
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,721
Doc.

99
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,221
Did you get anything?

100
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,221
Yeah.

101
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:39,321
The autopsy revealed that the same water from the lake

102
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,921
was found in Sakuko's stomach.

103
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:46,121
That means that this is an accident after all, right?

104
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:47,821
No.

105
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,721
Maybe that's something

106
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:52,621
that'll back up the fact that this is a homicide case.

107
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,421
It could be the ski trails that the culprit left behind.

108
00:06:58,421 --> 00:06:59,921
Yes, that's right.

109
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,621
Although some doubts still remain.

110
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:05,121
I guess this is an accident.

111
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:08,521
I want to rush back to the station and...

112
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:12,121
What? You're treating everyone to a Japanese nabe dish today?

113
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,321
That sounds just great!

114
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:17,321
Please count me in on that seat that's not taken yet.

115
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:18,521
What?

116
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:23,221
But if there are unclear points, I should investigate more?

117
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:25,121
The percentage of this being a homicide is zero!

118
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:27,521
It is 120% an accident.

119
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,421
-No. -So...

120
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:30,421
Huh?

121
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:33,021
It may not necessarily be a plain accident.

122
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:40,321
Hey, hey. Just what's going on, officer?

123
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,421
I mean you called us all the way out here.

124
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:46,421
We've already told you everything we know.

125
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:49,421
Sakuko died of an accident, didn't she?

126
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:53,421
Yes, but he said something strange.

127
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:59,221
No, no. It's nothing strange.

128
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,321
The old man with the children.

129
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:05,121
Sakuko did not die of an accident, but was killed.

130
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:07,421
Moreover, the culprit is...

131
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,421
among you three.

132
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:11,721
That's what I'm saying.

133
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,021
Huh?

134
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,123
Excuse me.

135
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:30,923
I brought them here since I thought you found a new clue to the accident.

136
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:33,523
But you went and act like a detective saying that this is a homicide case.

137
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:36,523
No.

138
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:38,423
Judging from the circumstances back then,

139
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:40,023
it seems only plausible that Sakuko went out into the blizzard

140
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:43,523
and fell over with her snowboard from the place where the broken fence is.

141
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:48,723
Due to snowstorm, she drowned to death in the lake.

142
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:53,323
The only road to get to the bridge that leads to the lake was blocked off.

143
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:57,823
Not until the police got here.

144
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,023
Oh, that's why...

145
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:04,823
Moreover, there are about 10 meters from the edge of the cliff to the lake.

146
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:07,723
So even if someone were to push her down from the cliff,

147
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:10,123
she wouldn't have been able to fall into the lake.

148
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:14,423
And then, there's one last thing.

149
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:17,423
An hour after they parted with Sakuko,

150
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,323
the three realized that she didn't show up at the promised time,

151
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:24,423
so they were looking around for her together all the way,

152
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:27,723
all the way until her dead body was found.

153
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:31,023
Let's say that even if a rope were used,

154
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:32,123
it would've been impossible for the culprit

155
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:35,323
to carry her on his back down the cliff to the lake and bury her,

156
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:37,623
then climb back up again.

157
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:42,823
You can't be telling me that any of them could possibly...

158
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,123
Come on...

159
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:49,123
Hey.

160
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,723
Sorry. I figured it'd be faster this way.

161
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:54,623
Officer?

162
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:56,423
Hey, are you all right?

163
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,223
He looks to be asleep.

164
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,723
True.

165
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:02,123
No, no. I'm not sleeping.

166
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:05,323
I'm so upset at myself that I went weak in the legs.

167
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,623
I guess that's how it is.

168
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:14,223
I couldn't figure out a simple trick like this until now.

169
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,523
Trick?

170
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:17,623
That's right.

171
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:21,323
The culprit put Sakuko in a certain container,

172
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:24,923
then pushed it over the cliff.

173
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,723
Certain container?

174
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:31,323
Hey, don't tell me that she was put in a sleigh or something?

175
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:34,223
Even if she were put in a sleigh,

176
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:38,723
I think she would fall off balance on a bumpy slope like this.

177
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:43,323
Besides, even if someone ride it down together with her,

178
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:46,523
that person would have to climb that cliff anyway.

179
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:50,423
Sleigh? Nothing unstable like that was used.

180
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:53,723
The thing I'm referring to is something that she was put inside

181
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,723
that would definitely land into the lake

182
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:59,223
and will disappear after a while.

183
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:01,023
Land?

184
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:02,023
Then disappear?

185
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:04,823
Ridiculous.

186
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:07,523
Nothing that convenient exists.

187
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:09,323
I see.

188
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:11,323
But instead of beating around the bush

189
00:11:11,323 --> 00:11:13,423
and saying that it landed and disappeared,

190
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,823
a better explanation would be that it rolled down and melted.

191
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:19,323
It's easier to understand by putting it that way, don't you think?

192
00:11:20,523 --> 00:11:22,123
I see.

193
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:23,123
What?

194
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:26,823
Remember? We were making it together yesterday.

195
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,723
We made it?

196
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,023
I see!

197
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,823
We made it together?

198
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:37,523
Yes, I'm sure he's referring to...

199
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:39,223
The snowman!

200
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:46,923
If the lady was put inside the snowman and pushed over...

201
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:51,023
It would simply roll down the cliff and fall right into the lake.

202
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:56,523
The snowman would melt and Sakuko would be found floating in the lake.

203
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:59,323
It seems that lake is a hot spring

204
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:02,223
and the water temperature is a bit high.

205
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,923
Snowman?

206
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,423
Don't be ridiculous.

207
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:06,523
Huh?

208
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:09,223
I know Sakuko was pretty small,

209
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:13,123
but I doubt you'd be able to fit a normal sized person in a snowball.

210
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:18,223
It would break apart before reaching the lake.

211
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:19,623
I guess so.

212
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:22,423
The snowman would at least have to have a diameter of about two meters.

213
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:26,723
But even if such a large snowman were made,

214
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,223
I think it'd be impossible to roll it down the cliff alone.

215
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:32,623
No, it doesn't have to be that large.

216
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:33,623
Huh?

217
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:34,623
Yes.

218
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:38,323
The size only needs be as big as the one I'm leaning against.

219
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:40,323
Leaning against?

220
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:43,023
A snowman about this size would suffice.

221
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:46,623
Like I just said,

222
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:49,623
something that size would fall to pieces half way

223
00:12:49,623 --> 00:12:52,623
and the contents would come out before reaching the lake.

224
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:54,323
That sounds right.

225
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,123
Hey, say something.

226
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:02,123
Hey!

227
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:03,123
Shoots!

228
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:05,823
What's wrong?

229
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:07,523
What's with him?

230
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,923
Hey, are you trying to be funny?

231
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,423
No.

232
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,223
I just wanted to remind you.

233
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:17,923
About the time that Genta fell near this snowman

234
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,423
and had a nose bleed.

235
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:23,323
Genta!

236
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:26,123
Is something coming out?

237
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:29,223
Genta!

238
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:30,223
-You've got a nose bleed. -You've got a nose bleed.

239
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:31,923
-A nose bleed. -A nose bleed.

240
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:36,223
So what about it?

241
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:39,823
Genta, do you remember something about that snowman back then?

242
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:41,723
Yeah.

243
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:45,023
It was hard and salty.

244
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:46,223
That's right.

245
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:48,623
That's the vital point of this trick.

246
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:51,623
Salt.

247
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:55,123
Well, am I right?

248
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:56,423
I see.

249
00:13:56,423 --> 00:14:00,023
He used the chemical reaction of salt to harden the snowman.

250
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:02,123
Chemical reaction?

251
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:05,023
When salt is poured onto snow, the freezing point,

252
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:07,223
the temperature will drastically drop,

253
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:10,023
and the part that salt was poured onto would melt.

254
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:13,023
But before melting, it absorbs the heat from its surroundings,

255
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:15,123
so the snow around the area where the salt is not poured onto

256
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:16,923
freezes and becomes hard.

257
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:21,223
This method is commonly used at ski race courses

258
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:25,723
or when hardening igloos.

259
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,823
But at ski courses,

260
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:29,423
they would normally use sulphate ammonium

261
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:32,723
to prevent damage after the snow melts.

262
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:35,123
Sulphate ammonium?

263
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:38,623
Sulphate ammonium?

264
00:14:38,623 --> 00:14:41,323
Well, I guess when you get older,

265
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:43,623
you'll learn about it in home economics cooking class.

266
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:45,223
Hey, hey.

267
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:47,123
All of this means nothing.

268
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:50,923
But where was that snowman that was hardened using salt?

269
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,623
Are you saying you saw it?

270
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:56,423
I didn't see it, but it probably was done here.

271
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,423
Right at this snowman near me.

272
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:04,023
Since the snowman was hardened here using salt,

273
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:07,523
the snow that accumulated on the ground also hardened.

274
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:10,823
That's why Genta had a nose bleed when he fell.

275
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:12,523
Huh?

276
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:15,423
Was done here? Isn't it still there?

277
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:19,623
This is the one the culprit made in haste after he committed the murder,

278
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:22,123
so that no one would see through the snowman trick.

279
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:25,523
He remade the torso only.

280
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:27,123
As proof of that...

281
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:28,323
Look.

282
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:34,523
The head is also hardened with salt, isn't it?

283
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:37,623
As long as the shape doesn't collapse,

284
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:41,523
all he has to do is put the head back on the torso.

285
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,323
Wait a second.

286
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:44,423
Then...

287
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:48,423
Don't tell me the one who put Sakuko in the snowman and dropped her is...

288
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:49,523
That's right.

289
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:51,823
The person who was making a snowman the entire time,

290
00:15:51,823 --> 00:15:53,223
Mr. Itabashi!

291
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:56,723
There's no one else but you who could've done it!

292
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,023
Although it only required him to put the head back onto the torso,

293
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,023
revisions on the detailed form where the head and torso are joined

294
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:07,423
can only be done by Mr. Itabashi who made it.

295
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:13,123
After Sakuko parted with everyone, Mr. Itabashi most probably

296
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:15,723
used the blizzard to his advantage and called her outside.

297
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:18,723
He did so, because he wanted her to come out wearing her gear.

298
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:21,723
When she came outside, he probably said to her,

299
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:26,723
"Let's go back to the room and talk because the blizzard is bad."

300
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:29,023
He then lured her to his room.

301
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:40,123
You pushed her face down into the wash basin that was filled with water.

302
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:46,223
And drowned her.

303
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:48,823
Then in the blizzard where the vision was unclear,

304
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:52,723
you carried her after putting the snowboard boots on her.

305
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:56,923
You put her and her snowboard inside the torso of the snowman

306
00:16:56,923 --> 00:17:00,123
where you had made a hollow space in.

307
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:02,823
You covered it with a lid made of snow.

308
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,623
You rolled the snowman...

309
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:07,423
to the cliff...

310
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:10,823
and dropped it.

311
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:27,223
You finally succeeded in making her float in the water.

312
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:30,723
But can you do all that in just an hour?

313
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:33,823
After he dropped the snowman with Sakuko inside it,

314
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:36,923
he made the torso of the snowman, right?

315
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,223
When Itabashi came to meet with us,

316
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,723
he wasn't breathing hard or anything.

317
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:46,723
It's true that he'd be tired if he made something this size in an hour,

318
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:49,123
but if he used something that was already half made,

319
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:52,023
only half the time and labour are required.

320
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,123
Half?

321
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:55,623
You people probably didn't know,

322
00:17:55,623 --> 00:18:02,223
but in order to surprise you, the children did something to their snowman.

323
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:03,623
Isn't that right, you guys?

324
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:05,323
Huh? Yes.

325
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:08,123
We did it to surprise you by letting out voices

326
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:10,523
when you came here next time.

327
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:14,023
We did something to our snowman's head.

328
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,723
We put our detective badges into the head part.

329
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:16,823
Huh?

330
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:23,723
Huh? That's the sound of the detective badge.

331
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:26,123
The sound's coming from the stomach of the snowman.

332
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:29,423
Which means, the head of our snowman didn't fall off

333
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,923
because of the blizzard.

334
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:35,923
After Mr. Itabashi removed the fruit parts,

335
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:39,823
he used that as a base to make the torso of the snowman.

336
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:45,523
But that doesn't serve as proof to brand Itabashi as the culprit.

337
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:48,923
The evidence is the wash basin in Mr. Itabashi's room.

338
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:53,023
The autopsy revealed that the water found in Sakuko's stomach

339
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,923
was the same as the water of the lake below the cliff.

340
00:18:55,923 --> 00:19:00,223
So it's most likely that the evidence is still there,

341
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,623
the water that Mr. Itabashi brought from the lake in order to drown her.

342
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:08,723
And her hair may also be found with it, too.

343
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:12,323
It could be the wash basin in her room,

344
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:16,023
but I'm sure that Mr. Itabashi used his own room to commit the murder.

345
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:17,923
If he used her room,

346
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,423
he would've probably brought her goggles, gloves and cap along

347
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:24,623
and put them on her before putting her into the snowman.

348
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,323
But...

349
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:30,123
Itabashi had no reason to kill her!

350
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:31,223
Yeah.

351
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:37,023
I didn't think I'd end up doing what I did either.

352
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:39,023
But when Asaka came into the picture,

353
00:19:39,023 --> 00:19:42,023
I guess I lost my mind for an instant.

354
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:43,023
Huh?

355
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:45,323
Just what do you mean?

356
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:47,923
Itabashi!

357
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,223
You knew, didn't you?

358
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,623
That Sakuko was in love with you.

359
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:57,223
And you're in love with Asaka.

360
00:19:57,223 --> 00:20:00,223
You like the way she gracefully used to ski around the ski slopes.

361
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:07,123
In order to erase Asaka's gracefulness from your heart,

362
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,923
that woman

363
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:12,423
made Asaka wear snowboard boots that she wasn't experienced with yet,

364
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:14,923
lured her to a dangerous course where she got into an accident

365
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,623
and took Asaka's leg away from her.

366
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:19,523
All for such a stupid reason.

367
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,023
Hey, are you serious?

368
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:25,723
Yeah, she was muttering about it when she was drunk once.

369
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:30,223
Hey, you're drinking too much.

370
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:32,823
This is all Asaka's fault.

371
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:36,223
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

372
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,823
Everything worked out up to the time I lured her out

373
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:42,523
and she broke her leg like I expected her to.

374
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:45,023
But why hasn't she disappeared yet?

375
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:46,723
That Asaka.

376
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:50,423
What'd you say?

377
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,223
It's so sickening, really.

378
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:58,423
The doctor told her that she wouldn't be able to ski again and yet...

379
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:03,023
No way.

380
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,223
Itabashi!

381
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:05,523
Why?

382
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:08,023
Why didn't you tell me about it?

383
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,723
Itabashi!

384
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:21,423
I can't do something like sending salt to an enemy.

385
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:23,623
-Enemy? -Yeah.

386
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:26,223
Knowing your character, if you found out about it,

387
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:29,023
who knows what you would've done to Sakuko.

388
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,023
I just couldn't stand giving it away to you.

389
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:38,023
The role of taking Asaka's enemy away and take the blow.

390
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:41,923
I didn't want to give away this crazy role to you.

391
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,323
But it sure was a surprise.

392
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:18,323
Putting salt on the snow hardens it.

393
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,823
-Right? -Nope,

394
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:22,223
it not only just hardens it.

395
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:25,023
If you sprinkle salt on snow and mix them,

396
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:28,123
it breaks down and continues to melt.

397
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:30,823
Eventually, the salt disappears.

398
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:34,523
Calcium chloride is used in the same way on snowy streets

399
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:36,223
to help melt the snow.

400
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:39,323
That's right.

401
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:41,523
He used it in the wrong way.

402
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:43,723
The salt.

403
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,823
He used salt in the wrong way.

404
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:51,023
He didn't melt and dissolve his intention to kill,

405
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:52,723
but rather, solidified it.

406
00:23:57,023 --> 00:24:03,223
"Next Episode"

407
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,723
Alligator snapping turtle?

408
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:10,223
Alligator snapping turtle and one million yen...

409
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:13,723
What's the matter, Conan?

410
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:16,923
Maybe the two cases are connected in some way.

411
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:21,023
I won't let you get away!

412
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:27,023
Next Conan, "Lakeside Mystery"

413
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:45,023
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,023
"X-Ray"

415
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:48,523
The next episode is a story about a turtle.

416
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:49,723
A super vicious one, too!

417
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,023
I'm scared.
