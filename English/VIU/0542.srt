1
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:11,141
Awesome!

2
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,841
We sure caught a lot.

3
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:16,441
All together there are probably about 20 fish.

4
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,541
I guess we're eating fish for dinner

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,241
at doctor's house today then.

6
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:23,841
Well, I'm a bit worried

7
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,641
because doctor's the one who's going to be preparing the fish.

8
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:28,441
You're really something, Genta.

9
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:30,841
You caught another black sea bream again?

10
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:32,841
You're really an expert fisherman already.

11
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,541
Well, sort of.

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,941
I was actually going after eels,

13
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:39,241
but I guess I didn't make it.

14
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:41,941
All you ever think about is...

15
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,641
eating eels.

16
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,341
Let's eat.

17
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:49,341
Okay, everybody, time to put your things away.

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,541
We'd better start getting ready to go home.

19
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,741
The ship's come to get us.

20
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:56,241
True.

21
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,341
-Doctor! -Doctor!

22
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:04,341
Thank you Mr. Ejiri, for looking after us.

23
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,313
No, no, no problem.

24
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:09,641
After all Dr. Agasa and you saved my life in the past, remember?

25
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:11,541
Looking after you all in his place

26
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:15,241
because he had to go home for a while is no problem for me.

27
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,141
We ran into Mr. Futoshi Ejiri

28
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:21,941
before when we came here to fish,

29
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:25,841
and got messed up in a case.

30
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:28,641
Thanks to the prompt treatment doctor and I gave him,

31
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:31,641
his life was saved.

32
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:34,741
What a relief to see him in good health.

33
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:36,841
Doctor!

34
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,641
We got big catch!

35
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,441
-Doctor? -Doctor?

36
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:42,541
Doctor?

37
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,941
That's not doctor.

38
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:59,941
He's the man living next door to doctor, isn't he?

39
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:00,941
If I remember correctly,

40
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,241
he's an upper graduate at the university

41
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,941
named Mr. Subaru Okiya.

42
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,541
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

43
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,141
Saturday nights are for mystery.

44
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:22,041
Fish messages left behind on a Dragon legend rock.

45
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,641
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,541
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,541
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

48
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:12,837
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 1)"

49
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:18,037
Doctor's not able to come?

50
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,337
For real?

51
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:23,337
No, the ham and egg making device that he made

52
00:04:23,337 --> 00:04:26,537
and passed out to the neighbors isn't working right...

53
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,237
and it seems he's being bombarded by complaints.

54
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:35,937
He thought that he could repair it right away

55
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:38,437
but he thinks it's going to take way longer than he expected,

56
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:40,137
so he asked me to come and pick you all up instead.

57
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:45,137
That device wasn't all that stable to begin with anyway.

58
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:48,437
Okay, you can continue talking after boarding the ship.

59
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:50,537
Hurry or the sun will go down.

60
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,037
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir...

61
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:56,637
Here, next.

62
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:58,137
It's your turn.

63
00:04:58,137 --> 00:04:59,137
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:01,037
Be careful of your footsteps.

65
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:02,037
Yes.

66
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,237
What's wrong with you? From a while ago.

67
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:10,637
I sense something in him.

68
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:12,437
Him?

69
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,537
You mean Mr. Subaru Okiya?

70
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:16,637
Just what do you sense?

71
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:17,837
In your words,

72
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,937
I sense the smell of the Black Organization.

73
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,537
You mean you sense it even now?

74
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:28,437
No.

75
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:32,237
The only time I felt that way was the time I first saw him

76
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:35,037
during that fire incident, but...

77
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,937
That unique overpowering air about him.

78
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:03,937
No matter how I look at it, it's all around him.

79
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:05,937
No doubt it's the air of the organization

80
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:08,137
that shrunk your body.

81
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:13,237
Maybe you're just psyching yourself into thinking that way?

82
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,137
Come on, come on. What's keeping you?

83
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:17,537
Hurry and get on board you two.

84
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:18,537
Okay.

85
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:44,537
You should look where you're going.

86
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,737
Okay.

87
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:55,337
Okay, Ida, I'll see you later.

88
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:56,337
Yes.

89
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:02,637
But, how sad, that we don't get to eat this

90
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:04,437
when we caught so many.

91
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:06,737
Doctor sure seems to be busy.

92
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,437
If you like, would you like me to prepare the fish for you?

93
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:15,037
You mean, you can cook?

94
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:17,937
Yes. Just a bit.

95
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,937
Of course, I'm not a first class cook

96
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:23,237
but I can make home-made cooking.

97
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:26,737
So, I'll use the kitchen at doctor's house

98
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,137
and cook you guys dinner.

99
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,737
-All right. -All right.

100
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,037
A treat.

101
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,837
Hey, kids, watch.

102
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:37,737
A beautiful sunset, don't you think?

103
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,937
Awesome.

104
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:44,237
It almost looks like a picture postcard.

105
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:47,137
I wonder what that is?

106
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:49,937
The sharp looking thing below the sunset.

107
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,137
That's the Ikkaku Rock.

108
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:54,937
The Ikkaku Rock?

109
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:56,137
Long, long ago,

110
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:58,237
there was a sea dragon

111
00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:01,437
that was said to have one big horn called one-horned dragon.

112
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:05,737
The legend goes that the one-horned dragon who was angered

113
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:08,137
because a fisherman had taken her child,

114
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:12,437
is watching over her habitat sticking one horn out of the sea.

115
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:16,537
Therefore, any fishing boat that approaches is sunk,

116
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,737
so the fishermen just look at the Ikkaku Rock from a distance.

117
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,137
Would you like to go take a look?

118
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,637
It's easy to anchor the ship by that rock.

119
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:31,537
But, won't our ship sink?

120
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:33,037
Don't worry.

121
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:35,537
The one-horned dragon loves children.

122
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,337
If children stop by there,

123
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:39,437
it is also said that they are giving the power of the sea,

124
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:42,037
and become good swimmers.

125
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:43,537
Really?

126
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:44,737
Let's go, let's go.

127
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:51,637
It's pretty big.

128
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:55,937
Yes. It's a bit eerie when you think that

129
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:58,037
the gigantic body of the dragon below this.

130
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,837
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

131
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,937
That's the Ikkaku Rock!

132
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,637
If you go near it, you'll be cursed by the dragon

133
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:07,437
and your ship will sink!

134
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:10,537
They'll be fine, besides they're children.

135
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:13,637
That's true.

136
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:16,737
Hey, Kaida.

137
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,737
She doesn't seem to be anywhere around here.

138
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:22,637
Rats. Let's try another point.

139
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:31,237
What're those people?

140
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,837
They seem to be looking for something.

141
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:35,437
They're divers who are going around

142
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:38,137
with the daughter of the president of some big company

143
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:40,437
that just started diving recently.

144
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:42,937
They sure get in the way of our fishing.

145
00:09:44,537 --> 00:09:46,837
The sea is for everyone to use, or rather...

146
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,437
I'd sure like them to have a bit more consideration towards us fishermen.

147
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:54,537
Well, but this Ikkaku Rock is a rock for children.

148
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,537
Go enjoy to your heart's content.

149
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:57,737
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

150
00:09:58,737 --> 00:10:00,137
Taking a close look at it,

151
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:02,837
it's more like an ordinary rock with a lot of holes in it,

152
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:04,537
rather than one-horned.

153
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:09,137
Yes. After all it's quite a bit eroded from seawater.

154
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:10,137
Look. Look.

155
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:12,537
The sunset.

156
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:13,837
Let's all take a picture together

157
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:15,837
before the sun sets completely.

158
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:18,437
Okay, if you don't mind me taking your pictures with my cell phone.

159
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:20,637
Okay, we're counting on you.

160
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:21,937
Yes!

161
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,337
Everybody, get in line.

162
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:38,137
The rock behind you...

163
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,937
something's written on it.

164
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:41,737
"Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish."

165
00:10:41,737 --> 00:10:45,837
Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish?

166
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:47,837
I wonder if someone carved the names of the fish

167
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:49,737
he caught on the rock as a memento?

168
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:52,537
What a terrible thing to do.

169
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,137
Hey, come over here.

170
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,037
There's something stuck between the rocks.

171
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,537
What's this?

172
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,637
It's stuck so hard, that I can't pull it out.

173
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:08,837
It's a fin that you wear when going diving.

174
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,837
The fin is still brand new.

175
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,037
If a person leaves the fin behind as a prank,

176
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:17,137
he wouldn't be able to make it back.

177
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,537
And, besides, those words...

178
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,537
Don't tell me it's a message or something?

179
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:22,937
Is someone still here?

180
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:25,237
Conan.

181
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:42,437
A tank and regulator.

182
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:43,637
A diver?

183
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,337
What's with her?

184
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,737
Is she asleep?

185
00:11:50,637 --> 00:11:52,537
No. She's already dead.

186
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,037
-What? -What?

187
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,137
Judging from postmortem rigor mortis,

188
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:58,837
she died several hours ago.

189
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:01,437
The inside of her mouth is completely dried,

190
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,637
and her skin's lost its elasticity.

191
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:05,137
So, she must've died of dehydration.

192
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:07,837
Lipstick.

193
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,137
Wait a second.

194
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,137
The regulator I saw a while ago.

195
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,337
I'm sure that she encountered trouble

196
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,537
while diving that incapacitated her ability to swim.

197
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,437
She somehow managed to get here,

198
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,437
but no one discovered her.

199
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,737
Yes, the Ikkaku Rock that sinks ships is here.

200
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:30,037
No one would dare come close.

201
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:33,637
At any rate, let's all carry her back to the ship.

202
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,837
Yes, we can't leave her here like this.

203
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:37,137
No.

204
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:41,437
It's better not to move the body until the police arrive.

205
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:43,337
Police?

206
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:45,337
Don't tell me that she...

207
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:50,237
Yes, it could be that she was deliberately left behind here.

208
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,437
Look.

209
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:55,837
The mouthpiece of the regulator from where air from the tank is provided.

210
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:57,937
It's clean, isn't it?

211
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:01,637
If the lady wearing lipstick was using it,

212
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:04,637
lipstick should also be found on the regulator.

213
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,737
Just what do you mean?

214
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:11,937
Somebody for some reason switched the regulator.

215
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:14,137
Most probably within these few hours.

216
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:20,637
That is, the killer who came back here again.

217
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:28,384
I see.

218
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:30,384
You stopped by at this Ikkaku Rock

219
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,984
wanting to take a picture of all of you

220
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:34,084
with the sunset in the background

221
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:36,884
and you found the body of this young lady.

222
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,984
So, the sunset and everything else went down the drain.

223
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:41,484
Yes.

224
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,384
I can't say anything for sure

225
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:45,884
until we get her back on land and investigate

226
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:49,984
but judging from postmortem rigor mortis and how smoky her cornea are,

227
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:53,184
5-6 hours have passed since she died.

228
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:55,084
The inside of her mouth is dry

229
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,784
and her skin has lost its elasticity

230
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:59,584
which means she died of dehydration.

231
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:00,984
In other words, this lady has been here at the Ikkaku Rock

232
00:14:00,984 --> 00:14:02,784
from more than three days ago,

233
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:05,284
with nothing to eat or drink.

234
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,384
Since she's wearing a wet suit

235
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:10,584
and carrying a tank with a regulator,

236
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,884
she must be a diver.

237
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,584
Something happened when she was diving,

238
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:17,384
and she somehow managed to make it to the Ikkaku Rock,

239
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:19,384
but nobody found her.

240
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,984
That's how most officers would deduce this case,

241
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:23,784
but not me.

242
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:27,284
As you can see, this lady is wearing lipstick

243
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,384
but, there's no lipstick on the regulator.

244
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:34,584
In other words, somebody calculated the time it would take for her to die

245
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:37,084
and returned to switch the regulator after she died,

246
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,484
and left the body behind.

247
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:44,084
I don't know for what reason yet,

248
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,884
but I'm sure this is a case of homicide.

249
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:48,884
Amazing.

250
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:51,984
No, any police officer will come to that conclusion.

251
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:54,384
No, I meant Conan.

252
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:59,584
Conan explain exactly what you said just now, officer.

253
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:00,984
You did exactly that, didn't you?

254
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:01,984
Yes.

255
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:08,884
Well, but you sure get yourself tangled in a lot of cases, don't you?

256
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:12,784
Don't tell me you came here knowing that the body was here?

257
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,784
No way.

258
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:18,784
Although I did think that when we came here somebody might just be here.

259
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,084
What made you think that?

260
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:22,884
Because of the fin that was poked in between the rocks.

261
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:26,284
In between the rocks on the opposite side,

262
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:29,584
fins that are worn when diving were stuck.

263
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:33,284
He probably thought so when he saw the fins a while ago.

264
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,384
Fins were stuck in between the space of the rocks?

265
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,684
Yes, there's practically no one

266
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:41,084
who would go out of his way to bring a pair of spare fins

267
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,284
to carry out a prank like that.

268
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:46,084
It's most natural to deduce that the owner of those fins

269
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:49,584
tried to leave a message saying that he's still here.

270
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,884
Then, maybe we'll find something written on them

271
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,484
if we pull them out.

272
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,884
No, the other pair was also stuck

273
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:57,584
between some other rocks too.

274
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:59,384
Although we pulled both fins out,

275
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:00,984
nothing was found on either one of them.

276
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:03,684
Talking about writing...

277
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:06,684
Something was written on the rock that was near the fin, wasn't there?

278
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:09,784
Yes. The names of fish.

279
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:11,984
Four names, I think it was.

280
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:13,684
The names of fish?

281
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:15,084
Yes.

282
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:17,184
If I'm not mistaken, Mackerel.

283
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,984
"Mackerel."

284
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:19,984
Carp.

285
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,284
"Carp."

286
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,284
Sea Bream.

287
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:23,784
"Sea Bream."

288
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,784
Flatfish. I think it was.

289
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,784
"Flatfish."

290
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:29,784
"Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish."

291
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,784
What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,084
All the more, maybe somebody who came to fish here

293
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:37,184
left those names back on the rock as a joke.

294
00:16:37,184 --> 00:16:39,184
No way, Jugo.

295
00:16:40,184 --> 00:16:41,884
Are you big brother Ida?

296
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:44,584
Mackerel, sea bream and flatfish maybe,

297
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:47,084
but you can't fish for carp at sea.

298
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:48,084
True.

299
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:52,484
Did you bring them here?

300
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:53,784
Yes.

301
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:56,884
Do you know each other?

302
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:59,584
We've been friends since childhood

303
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:01,984
when he said he wanted to become a good swimmer

304
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:04,184
and came here to the Ikkaku Rock on my father's boat.

305
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:07,784
Back then, he was so terrified and kept clinging onto me.

306
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:09,184
Talk about a nuisance.

307
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:11,284
Come to think of it,

308
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:14,284
what's with your older brother who came with you back then?

309
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:18,084
He was so scared that he didn't get off the boat at all.

310
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:21,884
Yes, that's why Sango still can't swim.

311
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:24,484
I guess minus blessings do exist.

312
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:29,384
But, what's with those writings, sea bream, flatfish and such?

313
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:31,184
I mean, it's not like we're at the Dragon Palace under the sea.

314
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,284
A dying message, maybe?

315
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:38,084
See, because look at this woman's left arm.

316
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:40,684
The part where her wristwatch used to be isn't tanned.

317
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,184
So, just to be sure,

318
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:47,584
before you came, I checked out the Ikkaku Rock area carefully

319
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,084
and found this.

320
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:53,584
A diver's wristwatch that matches the part where she isn't tanned.

321
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:54,584
What?

322
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:00,784
The edges are quite badly eroded.

323
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,084
I see.

324
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:06,384
If the eroded part and the letters of the fish match

325
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:11,184
it's a dying message that this woman left behind.

326
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:12,584
That's what you think.

327
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:13,584
Yes.

328
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:17,684
But the culprit stopped by here once, right?

329
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:20,384
It could be that, that person wrote it down

330
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,784
to frame someone else up?

331
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:25,984
If so, I think that he would've left her wristwatch

332
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,884
on for everyone to see.

333
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:30,884
But, she took it off and hid it.

334
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:32,284
In other words, she didn't want the culprit

335
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:34,584
who she thought would be coming back again,

336
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:37,784
to realize that she had left a dying message behind.

337
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,484
No matter if this Ikkaku Rock is a place where people rarely approach,

338
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:44,084
there's always the possibility that someone is watching.

339
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:48,484
She probably figured that the culprit couldn't stay here for very long

340
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:50,284
and hid her watch.

341
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:52,384
She left the dying message behind for the police

342
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:54,784
who she figured could check the place out good

343
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:57,084
after her body is found.

344
00:18:57,084 --> 00:19:00,884
See, her initials are carved on the back of the wristwatch,

345
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,984
so even if some time passes before they find her,

346
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:05,084
they would still know who the watch belonged to.

347
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:08,084
It's true that there are initials H and A on the back but...

348
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:13,784
Akamine Angel... club?

349
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:17,484
The word angel is eroded and illegible.

350
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:20,884
Gee, sonny, like always your deduction is the tops.

351
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:26,684
He's just an I know I'm a great detective type kid's

352
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:28,984
that's been trained by that measly Kogoro.

353
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,684
From here, it's work for the police.

354
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:32,984
I'm sure that even a kid as bright as you

355
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:36,784
wouldn't know who or where this woman is from anyway.

356
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:43,084
She's the only daughter of President Akamine of a financial company

357
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:45,484
that has recently moved into Kanagawa.

358
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:48,284
Right, pops?

359
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:49,384
Yes.

360
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:55,084
She used to dive a lot around with here with some young men.

361
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,484
If I remember correctly...

362
00:19:56,484 --> 00:19:57,884
Hikari?

363
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:08,884
Hey, doesn't that wet suit look like Hikari's?

364
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:11,284
Rather, who are they?

365
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,484
At any rate, anchor the boat near that rock.

366
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:16,184
If it's Hikari, we've got big trouble.

367
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:17,184
Yes.

368
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:20,684
What?

369
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:23,284
She's been missing for three days?

370
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:24,784
Is that true?

371
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:26,784
Yes. In the afternoon 3 days ago,

372
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:29,284
all four of us went diving together.

373
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:31,984
We were going dive again and go look for Hikari

374
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,684
because she didn't come back but...

375
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,484
"Rokusuke Oto (23)"

376
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,884
I got text mail from Hikari that said,

377
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,084
"I'll leave the rest up to you guys".

378
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,084
So, you all decided to come home

379
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:47,884
without even checking things out and looking for her first?

380
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:49,484
"Shuhei Aosato (25)" -It can't be helped,

381
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:52,384
because she did something like that before too.

382
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,784
Something like that?

383
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:57,184
Even when we went diving at the beginning of summer,

384
00:20:57,184 --> 00:20:59,984
Hikari didn't come out.

385
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:03,984
So we all panicked back then and looked all over for her.

386
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:08,584
We even asked the police to search for her, right?

387
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:12,384
Yes. She eventually came back the next day.

388
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:13,784
We asked her what happened,

389
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:15,484
and she told us that a cruiser steered by a good looking man

390
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:16,984
happened to pass by and picked her up,

391
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,884
so she spent the night at his place.

392
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:24,384
I haven't heard of a search being set out for anybody

393
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,484
these two or three days though.

394
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,384
No, we haven't requested a search this time yet.

395
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:30,684
"Yasuji Kaida (24)" -Because she was really angry with us

396
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:32,284
last time we did so.

397
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:33,584
I sent you mail that said,

398
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,584
"I'll leave the rest up to you guys", didn't I?

399
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:37,584
So, don't make a big thing out of nothing!

400
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:38,784
So, you see.

401
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:43,584
That's why we waited without doing anything for a while.

402
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:47,084
I mean, after three days we still got no word from her,

403
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:50,084
so we came back looking for her and here we are.

404
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:53,184
All three of us took a dive

405
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:56,984
and checked near the point we went diving three days ago too.

406
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:00,884
We called out to every cruiser we ran into too.

407
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:03,484
We had no idea that she'd be found like this

408
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:05,384
at this Ikkaku Rock

409
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:08,584
where people don't usually even approach.

410
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:14,784
Ms. Hikari Akamine was left behind here at Ikkaku Rock...

411
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,284
and died from dehydration.

412
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:22,184
Who on earth could've done something like this?

413
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:25,884
And the names of the fish she carved on the rock

414
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:30,184
mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish.

415
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,884
What's implied in this message?

416
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:59,784
Hey, you guys.

417
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:02,184
What kind of fish do you like?

418
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:04,584
Please answer one by one.

419
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,984
Whether words are to be added or removed,

420
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:09,984
there's got to be a key-word indicating what to do.

421
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,284
The culprit was telling us who he was to begin with.

422
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:19,984
That he was the one who left Hikari back at Ikkaku Rock

423
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,784
and killed her.

424
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:23,184
Next Conan,

425
00:24:23,184 --> 00:24:30,184
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 2)"

426
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:43,962
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:46,362
"Diver's watch".

428
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:48,462
All right I'm putting the mask on.

429
00:24:48,462 --> 00:24:50,062
Masked Diver!

430
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:51,262
Not Yaiba, but diver.
