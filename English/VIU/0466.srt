1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:01,688
Snow White.

2
00:00:02,688 --> 00:00:04,688
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:06,188
A group of four consisting of men and women.

4
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:07,488
The snowman of the Youth Detective Squad

5
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:09,088
watches the trails of the case.

6
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:10,488
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:11,988
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:13,988
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,550
You're pretty good, Shinichi.

10
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,350
Yes, yes. You're so good.

11
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,750
"Unbreakable Snowman (Part 1)"

12
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,150
Huh? Where are they?

13
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,350
Look. They're over there.

14
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,850
Gosh, before we got here

15
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,750
they were dying for me to teach them how to snowboard.

16
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,250
And now they are absorbed in making a snowman.

17
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,550
By the way, are you sure it's okay?

18
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,450
The boy who said he witnessed Rena Mizunashi's motorbike accident.

19
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,950
If the foreign lady that approached him was...

20
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,050
Yeah, she's probably one of the members of the Black Organization.

21
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,350
Vermouth.

22
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,850
What did you say?

23
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,550
Doesn't that mean...

24
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,450
Do you really understand?

25
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,950
If those guys find out that she was badly wounded in the accident...

26
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,350
Yeah. I'm sure they already know

27
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,850
that Rena Mizunashi was transported to the hospital in critical condition.

28
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,650
Hey, Shinichi.

29
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,150
But that's as far as they know.

30
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,950
They don't seem to know which hospital it is yet.

31
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,250
Besides, this case has already been reported to Ms. Jodie from the FBI.

32
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,550
I'm sure the FBI won't let them find the place that easily either.

33
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,350
But will that boy be okay?

34
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,850
It seems that he's under the custody of the FBI for now.

35
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,050
I think the organization is not interested in him anymore.

36
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,250
Because if they wanted to shut him up,

37
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,850
they would've done so when they got in contact with him.

38
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,950
But isn't it strange?

39
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,250
That the boy coincidentally happened to be at the house

40
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,950
where the murder was committed,

41
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,850
and you find out a mysterious woman approached him and asked questions.

42
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,250
-It was no coincidence. -Huh?

43
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,050
That's what bothered me

44
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,450
and made me search Rena Mizunashi on the internet.

45
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,750
I found a deeply buried info about her.

46
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,050
There's a big fan homepage dedicated to the announcer Rena Mizunashi.

47
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,750
Then it hit me.

48
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,950
There was a guy who was hired for that part-time job

49
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,850
and was the one causing the motorbike accident.

50
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,150
He seems to have been wearing custom-made jacket with her picture on it.

51
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,350
This is what was written in his diary,

52
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,150
"On my way back home from my part-time job,

53
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,150
a boy named Toji looked at my jacket

54
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,350
and said that the lady flew off her motorbike."

55
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,850
That's why that guy probably saw the diary, too.

56
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,850
That guy?

57
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,050
Yeah.

58
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,850
He mentioned that the homicide that happened at the boy's house

59
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,350
and the weird part-time job was connected.

60
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,150
He deliberately got Pops and me involved in the case by making us go there

61
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,950
and succeeded in making us encounter the boy.

62
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,850
That guy's name is Eisuke Hondo.

63
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,550
Eisuke Hondo?

64
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,950
The one who suddenly came to Ran's school as a new student.

65
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,750
Moreover, his eyes are identical to Rena Mizunashi.

66
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,550
Hey...

67
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,950
Don't tell me that the new student is...

68
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,150
He's probably a member of the guys who are checking on us

69
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,950
to figure out where Rena Mizunashi is.

70
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,850
That's what I'd like to say,

71
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,750
but somehow it's so unlike him.

72
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,850
Huh?

73
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,350
He seems naturally dense and awkward.

74
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,550
You idiot!

75
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,850
What if that's their plan to make you lower your guard?

76
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,450
But...

77
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,550
I saw him crying.

78
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,450
I've told you before about the case

79
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,250
involving the saw, nail and hammer, right?

80
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,450
Back then, I saw him crying.

81
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,450
I don't know if he was crying because he was having a hard time

82
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,650
solving the case and was angry at himself

83
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,250
or for not being able to get to the point of the matter.

84
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,050
Or that he was annoyed at himself for not being able

85
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,450
to relay what he wanted to, despite seeing through the case.

86
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,150
But I did see him crying back then.

87
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,650
It just looks like its crying!

88
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,350
Gosh, both of you!

89
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,950
But I guess this is okay the way it is. Right, Mitsuhiko?

90
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,850
Yes. I'm glad we bought fruits on the way here.

91
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,850
Yeah.

92
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,350
Hey, you brats! Don't you dare touch that!

93
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,950
"Sakuko Kokura (22)" -That's our graduation project, you know.

94
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,150
"Tanji Kiyama (22)" -Well, it's only a trial piece though.

95
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,350
It's a graduation project?

96
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,850
This snowman that looks like a monster?

97
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,150
That's right!

98
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,350
We're students of the sculpture department of an art university.

99
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,650
"Asaka Onoue (22)" -Since all four of us love snow,

100
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,250
we pleaded with our teacher and got special permission to do this.

101
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,950
But he's the only one who was making it.

102
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,850
"Kazuya Itabashi (22)" -That's because I make the overall framework.

103
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,250
After that, we will discuss it over and add what we want to on it.

104
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,650
After coming up with something that we are satisfied with,

105
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,050
we'll take a picture of it

106
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,850
and use it to help us make the real snow statue that we want to make.

107
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,750
If we make it all together from the start,

108
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,150
we'll most likely come up with something that's not really organized.

109
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,850
The title of this project is "The Grief of the Abominable Snowman".

110
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,050
The head's basically finished,

111
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,550
but I haven't come up with anything yet to his body.

112
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,950
Well, let's go easy on it.

113
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,250
Go easy?

114
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,050
We've got to leave the day after tomorrow.

115
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,550
So we need you to hurry and get it into shape somehow.

116
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,650
That's not nice, Sakuko.

117
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,750
Itabashi's been out here all this time for us.

118
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,450
I'd just like you to know,

119
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,050
it was you guys' idea for the four of us to make this project together.

120
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,350
I didn't really care to.

121
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,350
Now, now.

122
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,450
It's our university project on our last winter vacation.

123
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,750
Right, let's end everything peacefully, okay?

124
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,850
I mean, we may not even see each other again after graduating.

125
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,950
Right, Asaka?

126
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,950
Right.

127
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,450
I guess so.

128
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,550
Shall all four of us go to ski at night on the last day then?

129
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,350
I guess not.

130
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,350
Not all of us can go.

131
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,950
Hey, Sakuko! Wait!

132
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,750
Asaka.

133
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,450
Don't worry about it.

134
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,250
I've worked things out inside of me.

135
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,950
Okay then, Itabashi.

136
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,750
I'm going back to the lodge.

137
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,450
Call me when you're done.

138
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,550
Yeah.

139
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,550
That brunette's leg...

140
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,250
She dragging her leg.

141
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,950
What a snobbish lady, the one with the slant eyes.

142
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,950
Shall we surprise them with our snowman?

143
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,450
Huh? How?

144
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,150
First of all, we...

145
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,950
Yes, this is Sakuko.

146
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,550
Huh? Talk with me?

147
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,650
Right now?

148
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,450
There's nothing better than curry

149
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,150
-after sweating in the snowy mountains. -That's right!

150
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,550
I mean, all you guys did was make a snowman.

151
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,750
Did you find her?

152
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,350
No.

153
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,850
Maybe she went out skiing alone

154
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,150
and because of this blizzard, she can't find her way back.

155
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,050
Hey, hey, Asaka.

156
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,050
Is something the matter?

157
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,050
You're the old man that was with the children a while ago.

158
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,550
Sakuko, who was with us, didn't come to lunch.

159
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,150
So I went to her room to call her, but she wasn't there.

160
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,150
We have already search the stores and all.

161
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,250
Don't tell me she really went outside?

162
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,050
Let's all split up and look for her.

163
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,750
We'll search behind the lodge.

164
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,150
You guys should search the front.

165
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,450
Hey! Sakuko!

166
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,250
Are you there?

167
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,750
Slant eyed lady, where are you?

168
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,650
Hey!

169
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,950
Guys, where are you?

170
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,350
Guys!

171
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,950
Silly, stop crying.

172
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,050
Hang on tight to my outfit and don't let go.

173
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,250
Hey, guys! Is everybody else nearby?

174
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,050
Yes! I'm hanging on tightly to Haibara's hand.

175
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,250
What's this?

176
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,650
It's my hand.

177
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,950
Are you talking about me?

178
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,650
In this white-out condition,

179
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,150
don't you think it's too dangerous to keep searching?

180
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,650
I guess so. We'd better wait till the blizzard subsides.

181
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,350
The head of our snowman is on the ground!

182
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,650
No!

183
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,150
It probably slipped off because of this strong wind.

184
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,750
The gloves.

185
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,950
Darn it!

186
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,250
Wait, Genta!

187
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,450
-That glove! -I'm sure there's a cliff over that side!

188
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,850
That was close...

189
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,950
I told you.

190
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,450
The blizzard is subsiding a bit.

191
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,550
Yes.

192
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,550
Huh?

193
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,250
Is something the matter, Conan?

194
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,750
Below the cliff in that lake,

195
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,050
there's something floating.

196
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,150
Don't tell me that it's...

197
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,150
Use the zoom function of your right lens.

198
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,250
Okay.

199
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,450
There!

200
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,450
It's a person.

201
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,550
A person is floating in the lake.

202
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,750
That's...

203
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,850
Sakuko?

204
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:26,958
The victim is Ms. Sakuko Kokura, age 22,

205
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,758
a senior at an art university.

206
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:32,758
It seems she drowned to death,

207
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:36,658
but shall we bring her in for autopsy just in case, Officer Yamamura?

208
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:39,558
Yeah. Please do that, will you?

209
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:42,558
Well?

210
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:45,158
Was this woman travelling alone?

211
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:46,558
No, well...

212
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:50,758
She came here with her classmates who went to the same art university.

213
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:53,058
From the right, it's Tanji Kiyama,

214
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:54,958
Asaka Onoue,

215
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,458
and Kazuya Itabashi.

216
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:01,058
So, did these three find the body?

217
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:03,058
No, the one who found her is...

218
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:05,058
We, the Youth Detective Squad!

219
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:08,258
We were looking for that lady when it became a blizzard.

220
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:10,758
Then we found her from that cliff over there.

221
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:16,258
We saw her floating in this lake.

222
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:17,958
You're that boy that's always with Mr. Mouri.

223
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,858
Which means that Detective Mouri is also here?

224
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,358
No, he's not.

225
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,458
I'm sorry, but we're the only one here.

226
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,458
Oh, I see.

227
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,958
Which means that the Sleeping Kogoro

228
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,958
won't be disclosing the truth of this cursed case.

229
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,458
Cursed?

230
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,558
Yes.

231
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:42,758
She's wearing snowboard boots.

232
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:45,658
On the lake, the snowboard was floating.

233
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:53,858
Moreover, to come down here below the cliff,

234
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:56,458
you have to cross that bridge.

235
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,958
And yet, that bridge was closed off till we arrived here.

236
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,158
It means that she fell from the cliff when she was snowboarding.

237
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,158
Yes.

238
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:06,658
She accidentally fell over the cliff in the blizzard.

239
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:14,258
It's natural to think she fell over the cliff and drowned in the lake.

240
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:16,458
But it's a complete mystery.

241
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,358
I mean, this lake!

242
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,758
Lake?

243
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:21,958
Don't you think it's weird?

244
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,758
There's so much snow accumulated and yet why isn't the lake frozen?

245
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,758
I'm sure that an evil creature that lives in the lake

246
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:32,958
lured her to jump into the lake and sucked her in.

247
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,358
It's a hot spring.

248
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:36,058
Huh?

249
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:40,658
Hot water flows into this lake and the water temperature is high.

250
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:44,658
Well, it's not the kind of temperature that anyone would like to go into.

251
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:48,958
I've heard that this lake has never frozen.

252
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,958
Is that so?

253
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,758
Yeah, it's written here in this guide book, too.

254
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,658
Shouldn't a local police officer know about this?

255
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,458
Then, it's an accident.

256
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,658
But still, I wonder if this person was really snowboarding?

257
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:05,858
Huh?

258
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:09,358
Because she isn't even wearing a cap or goggles.

259
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:10,858
That's right.

260
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:12,258
It was a blizzard,

261
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:15,658
so it's strange that she went without wearing anything on her head.

262
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:19,358
It probably came off when she fell into the lake.

263
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:22,158
That could be so for the cap and goggles,

264
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:24,558
but her gloves wouldn't come off, would they?

265
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,458
True.

266
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,758
Which means that Ms. Kokura...

267
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:33,858
was a person who perspired a lot.

268
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,358
Hey.

269
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:38,458
You know, it's like the people who hate to wear gloves

270
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,358
because their hands get all sweaty.

271
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:44,758
But I think even people like that would wear gloves when snowboarding.

272
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:48,158
Maybe she wasn't dressed to go snowboarding in the first place

273
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:50,058
and the boots were put on her?

274
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,558
Sakuko was murdered, but made it look like an accident while snowboarding.

275
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:57,058
Maybe somebody planned this out.

276
00:15:57,058 --> 00:15:58,258
No way.

277
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,558
Then, you mean it was someone among the three?

278
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:05,358
I was just stating a possible assumption.

279
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:10,858
Would you give me the details as to what happened

280
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:15,358
up to the time Sakuko's body was found?

281
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:16,958
Yeah.

282
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,258
I think it was just before 12 pm, right?

283
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:24,758
Yeah. She went straight up to her room right after coming to the lodge.

284
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:30,858
After that, we promised to eat lunch together a little after 1 pm,

285
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,958
but only she didn't show up.

286
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,958
I went to her room and knocked on the door, but got no answer.

287
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,958
So I had the lodge manager open the door for me,

288
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,458
but she wasn't there.

289
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,458
We split up and looked for her inside the lodge, but couldn't find her.

290
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,558
And just when we were at a loss what to do...

291
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:51,258
I ran into them in the dining room.

292
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:53,858
Maybe she went out skiing alone

293
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:57,058
and because of this blizzard, she can't find her way back.

294
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,058
Hey, hey, Asaka.

295
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:02,958
Is something the matter?

296
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,058
You're the old man that was with the children a while ago.

297
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,558
Sakuko, who was with us, didn't come to lunch.

298
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:12,058
So I went to her room to call her, but she wasn't there.

299
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:14,958
We have already search the stores and all.

300
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,158
Don't tell me she really went outside?

301
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:19,958
Let's all split up and look for her.

302
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,658
We'll search behind the lodge.

303
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,958
You guys should search the front.

304
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:28,158
So we split in two groups and started searching.

305
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:33,158
Then, Conan found her dead body from on top of the cliff.

306
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,058
And?

307
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:40,058
Where were you guys from the time you parted with her

308
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:42,058
till the time she was found?

309
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:45,158
I was in my room at the lodge.

310
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,458
I was also in my room.

311
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,958
I was in the back of the lodge making the snowman.

312
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,358
Snowman?

313
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:53,558
Yes.

314
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:56,958
I was making the trial framework for our graduation project.

315
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:01,858
By the way, it seems like Sakuko has rented a snowboard and boots,

316
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:03,558
but did you rent something, too?

317
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:06,158
Yes. I rented a snowboard, too.

318
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:09,358
I rented a pair of skis too, but...

319
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:10,358
But?

320
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:13,058
Kiyama hasn't skied,

321
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,658
out of consideration for me, who hurt my leg last year

322
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:17,558
and can't ski anymore.

323
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,158
But even if you can't ski, you can still push a person from behind,

324
00:18:22,158 --> 00:18:23,158
can't you?

325
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:24,358
Huh?

326
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:28,458
Look. You three could've called Sakuko after parting with her

327
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,258
to secretly have her come to that cliff there.

328
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:38,158
I just thought that all you'd have to do is give her a little push

329
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,658
and she'd go falling down into the lake below.

330
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,458
No way.

331
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:48,458
It's understandable if she fell over on a speeding snowboard.

332
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,058
But even if you were to push her from the cliff over there,

333
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,258
she would have landed right about there.

334
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:56,258
There's still more than five meters before she reaches the lake.

335
00:18:57,358 --> 00:19:01,058
I see. So pushing her off is out.

336
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,258
But if it's you who can ski...

337
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:10,058
I think that's impossible, too.

338
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:12,158
Even if he were to somehow make it down,

339
00:19:12,158 --> 00:19:14,058
it would be impossible for him

340
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:17,158
to make it back up in that blizzard in such a short time.

341
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,858
Even with a rope.

342
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,658
If you still suspect me,

343
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:23,058
why don't you go to the locker in the lodge

344
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:26,758
and check the ski board and ski shoes that I rented.

345
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:29,058
If I used them, they should be wet, right?

346
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:31,658
Are you three using the same locker?

347
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,458
Yes.

348
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,458
Which means, anyone of you

349
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,658
could've taken out her snowboard and boots at any time you wanted?

350
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:41,158
Just what are you getting at?

351
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:42,258
-Huh? -Huh?

352
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:48,558
In other words, if you tie her on to the snowboard

353
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:50,158
and make her slide from the cliff...

354
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,458
she would automatically fall into the lake.

355
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:58,658
Are you all right, officer?

356
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,358
This slope is super bumpy.

357
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:05,858
If you do something like that, she's bound to flip over.

358
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:09,458
As to that, if it's Mr. Itabashi who can snowboard,

359
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,458
he could easily choose a slope that isn't bumpy.

360
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,258
Then, where's the rope that she was tied onto with?

361
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,158
That's right!

362
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:21,758
And even if she didn't fell down,

363
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:25,258
I think her body would've been tied onto the board.

364
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:28,758
Besides, Sakuko probably didn't have her gloves on

365
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:31,758
because she got lost in the blizzard

366
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:35,658
and was trying to call us on her cell phone for help.

367
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:40,158
But would she take off the gloves from both hands to make the call?

368
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:43,658
Maybe she wasn't trying to call, but trying to send a text message?

369
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,858
She would be using both hands to type.

370
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:48,358
Text message?

371
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,158
Yes.

372
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:52,858
Sakuko used to always confirm by text message

373
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:58,458
whether we would be able to answer her call, saying, "May I call you now?"

374
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:03,058
Her gloves probably got blown away by the wind when she was typing.

375
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,858
She probably went after her gloves using the snowboard.

376
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:21,158
And fell over the cliff.

377
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:23,458
Was the blizzard that bad?

378
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,558
Yeah, it was unreal.

379
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,158
It was white all over and you couldn't see anything around.

380
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:36,558
Guys, where are you?

381
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:38,958
So it's an accident after all.

382
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,258
I guess so.

383
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:44,058
Please cut out all your strange guesses, officer.

384
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:48,658
Well then, let's go to the cliff where she is thought to have fallen from.

385
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:51,758
There may be traces of an accident left, too.

386
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,258
Accident?

387
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:54,958
It can't be.

388
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,458
I wonder if a person who promised to have meals with others in an hour

389
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,358
would go out into the blizzard, carry the snowboard

390
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:03,058
and go all the way up the ski trail?

391
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:08,258
If this is homicide, the culprit must be one of these three.

392
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:09,458
I can't figure out...

393
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,258
how Sakuko who was in the lodge...

394
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:22,158
was thrown into the lake.

"Next Episode" -Snowman?

396
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,258
Yes. What about it?

397
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:03,258
Genta!

398
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:08,158
The percentage of this being a homicide is zero!

399
00:24:08,158 --> 00:24:10,558
It is 120% an accident.

400
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,458
Sakuko did not die of an accident, but was killed.

401
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,858
Moreover, the culprit is...

402
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:20,558
It could be the ski trails that the culprit left behind.

403
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:26,858

"The taste of snow"

406
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:48,358
What does snow taste like?

407
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:49,658
It's pretty salty.

408
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:51,358
Yes, yes.
