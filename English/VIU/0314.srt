1
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:05,532
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,432
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:09,032
A hike to the scenic viewpoint

4
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:11,032
reveals the hidden truth behind an unfortunate accident.

5
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,632
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,432
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,733
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:58,142

12
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,225
Who said there are lots of girls up here?

13
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:45,725
Not a soul, as far as I can see, man.

14
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,925
Well, the guidebook says

15
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:51,625
this place is quite popular among school girls.

16
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:55,226
Those reporters are so irresponsible and disgusting.

17
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:02,325
Sure, man. Sure thing.

18
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:04,325
You want me to go? Okay, I will.

19
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,825
Wait a minute, Hirai!

20
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,225
What's up?

21
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:08,825
The place is tricky.

22
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:11,325
You need to be very careful when you work.

23
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:12,525
You're quite right.

24
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,025
We may have another fatal accident, right?

25
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:20,525
Well, I'll bet you'd rather like to see me get into an accident.

26
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,225
Hold it there.

27
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:24,626
See you guys.

28
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,926
What's wrong with him?

29
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,125
Good morning, everybody.

30
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:35,125
There is a broken fence at the scenic view point.

31
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:37,025
Please be careful.

32
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,625
All right.

33
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:40,026
Thank you.

34

"The View Point With A Broken Fence."

35
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:01,425
Hold it. Wait for me, guys.

36
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:03,425
Why? So soon again?

37
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,725
We took a rest just a while ago.

38
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:09,425
Be nice, guys. We're not in a hurry.

39
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:12,425
Like we said, it's too much for you, old man, wasn't it?

40
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:13,426
Thanks for nothing.

41
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:16,225
I just worked too much lately and worked myself out.

42
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,926
Sure!

43
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:23,425
Well, Ran, let's leave the old man alone and go, shall we?

44
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:25,126
A good idea.

45
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,526
No, you don't! Hey.

46
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:34,025
Wow. What a beautiful sight.

47
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,226
Yeah.

48
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:40,125
He's the man we saw down there.

49
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:43,225
Right. What is he doing, there?

50
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:45,825
They said there's a broken fence.

51
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,025
He's probably working on it.

52
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:49,526
You're right.

53
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:52,225
Finally.

54
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,825
Oh. Hi, Pops.

55
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,726
You finally made it, dad.

56
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:01,825
He fell off.

57
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:03,726
Darn it!

58
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:05,726
Conan!

59
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,325
Watch out! What're you trying to do?

60
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,925
You want to fall off the cliff?

61
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,025
But...

62
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:13,425
Go down to the office and tell them about this, Ran.

63
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:14,526
Yes, dad.

64
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,626
Is anyone there?

65
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:22,426
What's the matter?

66
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:24,725
A man fell down the cliff.

67
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:27,525
What? Could it be Hirai?

68
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,625
Could be.

69
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:32,725
Anyway, how do we get below the view point?

70
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,025
This... this way.

71
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:36,725
Ran, call an ambulance and the police.

72
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:38,026
Sure, dad.

73
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,725
No good. He's already dead.

74
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:49,926
Hirai...

75
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,726
It's all my fault. My fault.

76
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,625
What do you mean, may I ask?

77
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:58,425
I asked him...

78
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:02,925
I asked him to fix the broken fence at the view point.

79
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:06,125
I should have gone...

80
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:09,226
If I do it myself, then this wouldn't have happened.

81
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,925
Why is it?

82
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,725
The two ropes that were left here are twisted

83
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:32,826
as if they had been tied to something for a long time.

84
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,825
Dad.

85
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:45,325
The police and ambulance will be here soon, they say.

86
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,526
Good.

87
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:49,325
Anyway, this seems to be an accident.

88
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,025
Let's leave everything here as is,

89
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:54,125
go back to the office and wait for the police to come.

90
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,225
Okay.

91
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,125
Conan, we are going back to the office.

92
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,226
Yeah.

93
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:10,926
What's this?

94
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,026
This...

95
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,125
is a spider's web and threads.

96
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,626
Why on earth is it here?

97
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,626
And where did he get it?

98
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,525
Just as I thought.

99
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:37,825
There was no spider's web around here and...

100
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:39,925
At the place where Mr. Hirai fell,

101
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,225
there are no traces of slip marks made by his boots.

102
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,926
It's as if he had jumped off the cliff.

103
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,625
Another thing puzzles me.

104
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:52,425
The ropes that were left beside the body

105
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:56,025
were twisted at both ends as if they had been tied to something.

106
00:07:56,026 --> 00:08:02,625
If the rope was tied, then why Mr. Hirai fall to the ground?

107
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,326
And the way the ropes are twisted...

108
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:10,025
As if they have been tied in a knot for many hours.

109
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:14,326
Why did Mr. Hirai use that kind of rope?

110
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,526
It's just a hare.

111
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:26,926
An animal trail?

112
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:37,325
Conan is still out somewhere, dad.

113
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:39,525
Don't bother.

114
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:41,525
He is playing around somewhere nearby.

115
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:42,625
But...

116
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:45,226
Well, I'll go look for him.

117
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,725
There could've been an accident or something.

118
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:50,025
But...

119
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:53,625
Please stay here and wait for the police.

120
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,625
Don't worry. I'll be back with him soon.

121
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,526
Thank you.

122
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,125
He's a nice person.

123
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:02,726
Oh, dad!

124
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,326
This tree is...

125
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:17,826
the one that is sticking out from beneath the view point.

126
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,826
What's that?

127
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,625
A piton and a ring.

128
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:33,326
It's a mountain climber's piton and a snap ring.

129
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:36,826
Something strange is going on.

130
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,826
It's White-Eyes.

131
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:48,325
What's that?

132
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,226
Darn! I can't see clearly.

133
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,525
What're these?

134
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,425
Traces of spikes.

135
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:58,226
They're still new.

136
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:10,925
A rope can leave traces of scratch marks like this.

137
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:12,925
So it comes up to...

138
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:14,726
Hey. Conan!

139
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:18,525
What are you doing up there? It's not safe up there.

140
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:21,625
I was looking at the nest of White-Eyes.

141
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:22,725
Oh, you were...

142
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:24,925
The White-Eyes are protected birds,

143
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:26,525
it's better if you leave them alone.

144
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,025
Yes, sir.

145
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:30,025
You'd better come down right away.

146
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:31,826
I will, right now.

147
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,325
They are worried about you at the office.

148
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:38,825
Say, Mr. Kondou.

149
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:42,825
Your boots look very old, how come?

150
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:44,925
Oh, you mean these?

151
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:48,125
I got these when I was in college.

152
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:49,126
These are so comfortable

153
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:51,925
so I don't want to change them for new ones.

154
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:54,526
The only thing is that they're heavy.

155
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,625
Now I see it.

156
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:01,325
Just as I thought. This is a murder case.

157
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:07,825
And the culprit is this man, Mr. Eiichiro Kondou.

158
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,425
He pushed Mr. Hirai off the cliff

159
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:12,725
and made it look as if he fell off by accident.

160
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:15,126
He used these tricks.

161
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:26,857
I see.

162
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:29,757
Since there are eyewitnesses to this incident,

163
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:33,857
we can assume, as Mr. Mouri says, that this is an accident.

164
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:34,858
Yes, officer.

165
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:40,957
But if people keep falling off by accident,

166
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,257
you could be held responsible for the safety of the park, Mr. Kondou.

167
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:47,457
I have the responsibility, yes.

168
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,157
What are you talking about, may I ask?

169
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:53,757
Well, about a month ago, another worker of this office had an accident.

170
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,857
She fell off the cliff and died.

171
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:58,458
Oh, she did.

172
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,257
Excuse us.

173
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,657
We want to move and carry the body out, if you don't mind.

174
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:09,257
Sure, guys.

175
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:10,857
Well, everybody,

176
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:13,657
we need to draw up a report at the police station,

177
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:15,957
so please come with us.

178
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,658
Yes, officer.

179
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:29,257
Wait a while, everybody.

180
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:30,657
Dad?

181
00:12:30,658 --> 00:12:33,157
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

182
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:38,057
There is some doubt about Mr. Hirai's death being an accident.

183
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,757
What's that, Mr. Mouri?

184
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:45,757
Ran, when the man fell off the cliff, did you see his face?

185
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:48,757
No. I didn't, dad.

186
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:52,357
You didn't. Conan says he didn't either.

187
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:55,157
And I didn't either.

188
00:12:55,158 --> 00:13:01,157
That is, the man that fell off may not have been Mr. Hirai.

189
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:05,657
But if he was not Mr. Hirai,

190
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:09,757
where did he disappear to?

191
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:12,957
Mr. Kondou, you probably know that

192
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,257
there is a tree sticking out just below the view point.

193
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:21,857
-Is that right? -Yes, there is a tree

194
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:24,357
but it's not a large one

195
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:26,857
and I don't think it can hold a falling man by any chance.

196
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:32,157
True. It's unlikely that the man got stuck to the tree by chance.

197
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:35,057
If that someone actually fell off...

198
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:37,257
What do you mean by that?

199
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:41,257
The man at the view point did not fall off,

200
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:43,957
he jumped off deliberately,

201
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,657
so he could make the people who witnessed the fall,

202
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:50,057
think that they saw Mr. Hirai fall to his death.

203
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:53,357
So, this is a homicide.

204
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:54,657
Right.

205
00:13:54,658 --> 00:13:58,958
This is not an accident, but a case of murder.

206
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:10,257
Then, who on earth is the culprit?

207
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:14,457
The culprit is the person who knew that Mr. Hirai

208
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,257
was expected to go repair the fence.

209
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:19,157
He is also someone who could prepare

210
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,957
the same clothing that Mr. Hirai wore.

211
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,357
In other words...

212
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,257
It's...

213
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:30,258
none other than you, Mr. Kondou.

214
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:36,457
Then it's like this,

215
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,557
Mr. Kondou pushed Mr. Hirai off the cliff,

216
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:43,257
then waited for Mr. Mouri and the others to arrive,

217
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,557
which after he jumped down on to the tree.

218
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:49,957
No, that way the time that Mr. Kondou jumped off

219
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,758
would be different from the time Mr. Hirai fell off.

220
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:58,557
Since we came up here as tourists,

221
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:01,457
we approached the view point completely

222
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,357
irrelevant of what Mr. Kondou had in mind.

223
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:08,357
That is, we could've arrived five minutes

224
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:10,457
after Mr. Kondou pushed Mr. Hirai over the cliff,

225
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,257
or it could've been one hour later.

226
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:20,357
Then, how on earth was he able to do that?

227
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:22,057
The tree.

228
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:23,157
The tree?

229
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:27,957
Yes. Mr. Kondou jumped onto the tree,

230
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,457
where Mr. Hirai was already was.

231
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,557
Mr. Kondou jumped down onto the tree

232
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,957
and pushed Mr. Hirai off the tree.

233
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,957
That explains it.

234
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,857
That way, there would be practically no time difference what so ever.

235
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,957
But how could he dare do something like

236
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,357
risk his life jumping off the view point like that?

237
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:51,657
Well...

238
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,958
I wouldn't say it was such a great risk.

239
00:15:56,258 --> 00:16:01,257
Conan found a mountain climber's piton with a snap ring

240
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,857
driven into the rock above the tree,

241
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:06,857
just below the edge of the cliff at the view point.

242
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:10,857
Probably, early this morning or last night,

243
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:15,957
Mr. Kondou prepared two ropes and tied them to the snap ring.

244
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,457
He put one of the ropes through the tree below

245
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,757
and fastened the rope in place,

246
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:24,257
then he wound the other rope to the pole of the fence

247
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,657
and tied it in place.

248
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:32,157
When he saw us coming to the park, he chose us to be witnesses.

249
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,257
And told Mr. Hirai to go repair the fence.

250
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:39,557
Mr. Kondou saw us go, and then,

251
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:45,557
he ran into the path in the back of the office to short cut us.

252
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:50,057
The climbers' path to the view point is the long way around,

253
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:53,557
so it wouldn't have been difficult for him to get there before us

254
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:56,757
if he ran straight through the mountain.

255
00:16:56,758 --> 00:17:00,957
Then he ambushed Mr. Hirai, knocked him out,

256
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,057
and put him on the tree beneath the view point.

257
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:07,057
He waited for us to arrive,

258
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:09,057
then took the rope that he had tied onto the fence,

259
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,158
tied it around his body as his lifeline, and jumped off.

260
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:19,257
Mr. Kondou who was suspended in air with the lifeline,

261
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:22,857
took the rope that was tied onto the tree,

262
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,657
untied the lifeline, let go of it,

263
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:28,958
then climbed up the rope he was holding and landed on the tree.

264
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,357
He then untied the rope as he previously did with the other rope

265
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:34,957
and let go of it.

266
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,458
In the end, he pushed Mr. Hirai off the tree.

267
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:43,657
You're talking nonsense!

268
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:45,257
It's a whole lot of nonsense!

269
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:49,357
Everything is your imagination! There's no proof!

270
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,857
I passed him out and kept him on the tree, you say?

271
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:54,457
You're talking nonsense.

272
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,357
If you have any proof, show me!

273
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,857
The nest of the White-Eyes.

274
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:04,057
You know that there's a nest of White-Eyes, don't you, Mr. Kondou?

275
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:06,057
Wha... what about it?

276
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:08,657
When the White-Eyes make their nest,

277
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:12,457
they collect twigs and weeds and bind them using spiders' webs.

278
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:17,258
There was a web on the right side of Mr. Hirai's body.

279
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,457
I saw a spider's web.

280
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,457
So, it's there, but what does it have to do with me?

281
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,657
I said, show me proof that I did it!

282
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:34,157
There were traces of metal spikes on the trunk of the tree.

283
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,158
The spikes of mountain climbing boots.

284
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,557
I've heard that because of improved quality,

285
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,557
mountain climbers' boots nowadays have no metal spikes

286
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,457
since they are slip-proof even without them.

287
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:52,957
Mr. Kondou, you've been using your boots since your college days.

288
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,557
Why?

289
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,158
Are your boots spiked, Mr. Kondou?

290
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:12,458
Darn it!

291
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:21,457
That Hirai, he kept on picking alpine plants

292
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,457
and capturing the protected animals

293
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,657
to sell them at premier prices.

294
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:31,957
She... I mean the worker who died, and I were after him

295
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,758
wanting evidence of what he was doing.

296
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:42,157
And that evening, we caught him in the act.

297
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:45,757
But, while I was struggling with him,

298
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:49,458
my arm hit her and...

299
00:20:06,658 --> 00:20:11,058
She fell off the cliff.

300
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:21,157
Since then, Hirai has been blackmailing me.

301
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:23,458
I couldn't put up with him any longer.

302
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:35,157
But maybe this was all for the better.

303
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:42,558
I can finally amends for what I did to her.

304
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,657
I thought he had enough sleep already.

305
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,158
Apparently not.

306
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,858
What's the matter, dad?

307
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,857
Let me have them.

308
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,758
Hey, don't. You can't.

309
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:18,258
No, it's not what you think.

310
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:22,957
Just what're you peeking at, dad?

311
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,557
Well, it just so happens that...

312
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:26,057
You're looking through the binoculars of your own initiative

313
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:28,057
and you dare say it just so happens that!

314
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,557
Like I said, it just so happens that I...

315
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:32,157
What're you going to do if Conan gets interested

316
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:33,158
and tries to take a look?

317
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:35,557
I told you, it just happened to come into view!

318
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:38,357
-My. You dirty old man. -You obstinate dumbbell of a girl.

319
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:41,457
-I'm telling mum about this! -What?

320
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,357
Hey! This is none of her business, is it?

321
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:45,757
Don't blame me for what happens to you after she finds out!

322
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,757
Hey, you wait.

323
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:51,558
-No way! -Please. Ran, dear.

324
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,158
Pops, just what did you happen to see?

325
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,757
It's a nightingale.

326
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,458
It's on this way.

327
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:13,258
This is Mr. Seizan's studio, I guess.

328
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,158
I've got it. This could explain it.

329
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:29,358
Next Conan, "A Place in the Sun"
