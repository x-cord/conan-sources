1
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:03,403
Beware of fire!

2
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:08,502
This feel kind of nostalgic.

3
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:10,302
It's like in a samurai movie.

4
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:13,002
No, you should call it the Showa Era.

5
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:15,502
An elementary school student saying this is nostalgic.

6
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:17,002
The Showa Era.

7
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,402
Actually, I'm concerned.

8
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:21,402
Because it's been going on for some time already.

9
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:23,002
You mean the arson.

10
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,403
It's true. There was one four days ago and two days ago.

11
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:30,202
Once in two days means...

12
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:32,603
Yeah, there may be one tonight.

13
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,402
What?

14
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,602
What's that?

15
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:42,002
No joke!

16
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,802
Hello! There is a fire.

17
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:45,303
Yes! It's burning!

18
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:50,703
Don't tell me that...

19
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,602
Maybe it's an arsonist.

20
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:54,902
No way.

21
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:57,302
Wait.

22
00:00:57,303 --> 00:01:00,002
I know him.

23
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,403
What?

24
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:09,402
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

25
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,602
Love and cases come from the same origin.

26
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,402
The evil hands of an arsonist sneak up

27
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:15,502
to a playground where there are no signs of fire.

28
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:17,202
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:19,102
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:21,203
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:07,026
"Pitfall of Fire Prevention"

32
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:09,725
Is it really true, Genta?

33
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:11,225
I'm sure.

34
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,825
Whenever I go to buy eel bento,

35
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,525
that guy comes and buys a large serving of seaweed bento.

36
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:18,925
Not that.

37
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:21,225
Is he the same person as yesterday's arsonist?

38
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,725
If it's the wrong person, we'll be in big trouble.

39
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:24,726
Found it.

40
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:26,025
"Series of Fires at Children's Park. Culprit on the Run"

41
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:27,225
"Fourth Incident Produces Casualty!"

42
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:29,625
That's last year's case.

43
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,525
I was concerned about that, too.

44
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,925
The site's the same as this time, right?

45
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:36,125
Including that site yesterday.

46
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:40,325
Yeah, at the playground within a range of three kilometers.

47
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:43,526
It happened consecutively within a period of two weeks.

48
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:47,925
And finally at the 4th site, there was a casualty,

49
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:51,325
but no suspects were arrested and the crime stopped all together.

50
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:53,225
And a year later,

51
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,425
the crime started again at the same site

52
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:58,425
using the same MO. (Mode of Operation)

53
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:01,325
It might be the doings of a copycat.

54
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:07,025
Yeah, but it's also very probable that last year's arsonist revived.

55
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:08,826
That guy! It's that guy!

56
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:12,425
Too loud, Genta.

57
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,025
Yes, no mistake about it.

58
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,126
It's the man we saw yesterday.

59
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:20,625
"Suguru Kamaishi (25)" -Madam, give me the usual.

60
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:24,025
"Harue Yatabe (48)" -Okay, the usual large seaweed bento.

61
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:26,025
Your chopped burdocks are the best, Madam.

62
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:28,225
I'm not flattering you.

63
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,725
Really? You're going to give me that much?

64
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:33,926
Is it because I'm a lefty just like you?

65
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:36,626
Here you go, your change.

66
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:39,025
Thanks, Madam!

67
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:41,225
You're really helpless.

68
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:44,025
You should eat salads sometime, too.

69
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,725
Did I ignite a flame in your heart?

70
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:49,926
Oh, bad me, an arsonist of love.

71
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:53,725
Just kidding!

72
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,425
See you.

73
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:56,725
What a punk.

74
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:58,625
I'm sure it's him.

75
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:00,525
Let's expose his true identity.

76
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:03,225
The Youth Detective Squad is going.

77
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:04,226
All right.

78
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,225
What now?

79
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,325
I think you should leave this to the police, no?

80
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:16,925
What? Yeah.

81
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:20,225
But maybe he was just near the crime site yesterday.

82
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:23,725
Then I guess we'll just have to find out for ourselves.

83
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:24,726
Yeah.

84
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,425
I'm starved.

85
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:49,625
You just ate three meat buns at the convenience store a while ago.

86
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:52,225
I should've gotten myself an eel bento instead.

87
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,425
Right.

88
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:56,525
What if he goes to sleep just like that?

89
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:59,425
The arsonist has been committing the crime every other day,

90
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,926
so maybe the arsonist won't do anything tonight.

91
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:06,726
So he fell asleep after all.

92
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,326
Okay, let's go!

93
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:46,825
We lost him!

94
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:48,225
Darn!

95
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:50,425
I wonder where he went?

96
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,925
Until the third crime yesterday,

97
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:54,625
the crime site was the same as last year.

98
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:57,725
If the fourth one is to occur from now...

99
00:06:57,726 --> 00:06:59,826
It would be the same fourth crime scene as last year, too.

100
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:02,525
Wait!

101
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:04,225
Let's go, Genta!

102
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:05,926
But I'm starved.

103
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:10,826
Here. This is the fourth site of the fire.

104
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:15,325
This is where one person fell victim for the first time last year.

105
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:17,525
If I remember correctly, a drunk office worker

106
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:20,325
who wrapped himself in the plastic sheet used for repair of the equipment

107
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,425
fell victim, right?

108
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:24,925
The park sure is creepy at night, isn't it?

109
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:27,425
They should set up more lampposts.

110
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:30,225
Yeah, it's because of all these skyscrapers.

111
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:32,325
It's still on the bright side, though.

112
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,825
I wonder if there were no eye-witnesses

113
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:37,025
despite so many people here?

114
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:39,326
It's towards the aisle facing north, that's why.

115
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,625
The fire is out.

116
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:00,325
That was close.

117
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:01,925
We made it in the nick of time.

118
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,426
Thank God we made it.

119
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,726
Are you guys okay?

120
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:08,225
Arsonist!

121
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:10,325
Hey, I saved you, you know.

122
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:12,325
What a thing to say.

123
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,925
Darn, he got away again.

124
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:17,626
-Again? -Yesterday, too?

125
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:21,025
I almost got him and then...

126
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,125
Why?

127
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,125
-What? -Don't tell me

128
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:25,825
you thought that this had something to do

129
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,825
with last year's arson too, sir?

130
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:31,125
Is that why you were keeping watch?

131
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:33,325
Yeah, sort of.

132
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,725
So why are you doing something like that?

133
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,625
That's because...

134
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,025
It's only natural, isn't it?

135
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:41,225
If it's last year's arsonist,

136
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:43,825
I've got to catch him with my own hands.

137
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:46,825
What's with you guys, anyway?

138
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,125
We are...

139
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,425
The Youth Detective Squad!

140
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:51,925
Detective squad?

141
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:55,625
Thank you for saving us from danger.

142
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,825
We mistook you for being the arsonist. We're very sorry.

143
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:00,325
Why didn't you hurry up and tell us?

144
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:02,825
We are on the same side.

145
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:05,525
The same side?

146
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:08,025
Yeah, that's right!

147
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:09,925
I'm a "lone detective squad"

148
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,825
who stood up to catch the hated arsonist

149
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:13,725
in order to protect this town!

150
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,825
A lone detective squad.

151
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:19,326
I don't think you need the "squad" if you're alone.

152
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:24,025
I see.

153
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:27,225
Then that'll be all for today.

154
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,225
Okay, I'll be going then.

155
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:31,025
What? Are you leaving?

156
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:33,125
What about the arsonist?

157
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:36,325
That's... Leave it to the lone detective squad.

158
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,425
It's too dangerous for only kids to handle.

159
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:40,225
If so, let's work together.

160
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:42,825
We're protecting the town, too.

161
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,426
Don't be so unfriendly, mister.

162
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,025
Do you have any other reasons why you don't want to work together?

163
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:51,126
Of course not.

164
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,125
Then it's all set!

165
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,125
This is the start of a new detective squad!

166
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:57,526
All right!

167
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:09,325
Seriously, I can't be wasting my time with brats.

168
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:10,326
What?

169
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:11,926
Good morning!

170
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:15,925
"Sumire Park"

171
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:18,625
This is the first site of the fire, right?

172
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:21,325
That swing is what was burned last year.

173
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:24,525
This year it was this seesaw.

174
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:26,625
And what are we going to do here?

175
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,425
We're going to reinvestigate the case.

176
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,825
And figure out how the fire was set.

177
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:34,025
We'll look for eye-witnesses and hear what they have to say.

178
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:35,625
But if there were such people,

179
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:39,625
I think the police would've got the arsonist long ago.

180
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:40,925
Don't you think so, mister?

181
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:43,325
Yeah, true I guess.

182
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:46,525
I haven't eaten breakfast yet.

183
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:47,925
Me neither!

184
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:50,125
You ate breakfast already, didn't you?

185
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:52,725
I did, but I'm hungry.

186
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,025
Darn.

187
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,325
What now?

188
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:59,025
I'm sure that the police are in the process of investigating now.

189
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,625
Yeah, true.

190
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:02,626
"Tsutsuji Park"

191
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:07,625
This monkey bar was burned last year.

192
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:11,225
And that arched bridge was burned in the second fire.

193
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:12,426
True.

194
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:18,825
I'm hungry.

195
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,425
I guess I'll go have some ramen.

196
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,325
Yeah, me too!

197
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:24,325
It's not lunch time yet!

198
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:26,325
The investigation is first. You too, mister!

199
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:27,326
Sorry, sorry.

200
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,025
"Himawari Park" -The third one

201
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:30,825
is the site from the day before yesterday.

202
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,925
The jungle gym was what was burned.

203
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,026
Last year it was that "horse", right?

204
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:38,626
I'm starved.

205
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:43,625
Hey, you want to eat eels?

206
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:44,626
What?

207
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,126
I'll eat!

208
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:50,626
Is this a coincidence?

209
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:53,426
Is anything wrong?

210
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,225
It looks so good!

211
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:58,625
And I got extra!

212
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,925
Are you sure it's okay that we eat, too?

213
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:04,125
Eat to your heart's content. I got paid.

214
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:05,225
Thank you!

215
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,725
I ordered you some soup, too.

216
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,625
So go ahead and enjoy yourselves.

217
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,925
Excuse me.

218
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,826
Thanks for the food!

219
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:16,726
Shoots!

220
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:23,625
Darn.

221
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,225
He got away.

222
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:26,625
Yeah.

223
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,425
What's wrong, the two of you?

224
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,625
Wait. Where's the guy?

225
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,725
He got away. He took us in beautifully.

226
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:36,825
He got away. Why?

227
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:42,025
I think we'll be getting in the way of what he's trying to do.

228
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:43,825
About what he's trying to do?

229
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:45,225
What? Don't tell me...

230
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:47,626
Then, he's probably the...

231
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,426
Arsonist after all?

232
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,670
"Closed"

233
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,469
He deceived us, didn't he?

234
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,769
How could he?

235
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,669
It was delicious, but I can't forgive him.

236
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,669
It's true that his perseverance wasn't normal.

237
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,469
Because...

238
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,969
It's only natural, isn't it?

239
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,969
If it's last year's arsonist,

240
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,469
I've got to catch him with my own hands.

241
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,469
Either way, there's no doubt that he's in some way involved.

242
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,269
Right.

243
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,470
Last year's...

244
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,670
"Fourth Incident Produces Casualty!"

245
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,169
This is...

246
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,269
What's wrong?

247
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,570
Let's go, all of you!

248
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,869
What? Conan?

249
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,169
Ai?

250
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,970
Wait up!

251
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,269
This is yesterday's...

252
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,469
You guys. Stay here.

253
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,570
What?

254
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,069
Just as I thought.

255
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,369
I see.

256
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,769
That's the story.

257
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,169
And where is the person in question?

258
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,170
That's the problem.

259
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,070
Over there!

260
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,469
"Ninja Fortress"

261
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,969
I couldn't see last night because it was dark,

262
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,369
but this is no coincidence.

263
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,069
It's a countdown.

264
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,769
Just what do you mean?

265
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,569
These characters circled in red were left at each

266
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,269
and every place that was set fire to.

267
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,069
The first site.

268
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,269
What're you going to do?

269
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,169
I'm sure that the police are in the process of investigating now.

270
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,669
Yeah, true.

271
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,670
"Houses for lease"

272
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,170
That character can be read as "To".

273
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,270
The second site.

274
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,669
I'm hungry.

275
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,370
I guess I'll go have some ramen.

276
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,370
"Towards Beika"

277
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,270
"He".

278
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,270
The third site.

279
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,869
Hey, you want to eat eels?

280
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,069
"Walking"

281
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,370
"Ho".

282
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,869
And the fourth site is...

283
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,170
"Ninja Fortress"

284
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,669
"Ni".

285
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,269
To-Heh-Ho-Ni...

286
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,369
I see.

287
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,869
Iro-Ha-Ni-Ho-Heh-To

288
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,869
written backwards.

289
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,169
In other words, it's a countdown.

290
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,669
Yeah. In other words, the crime will still continue.

291
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,069
There's going to be a fifth.

292
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,169
It was the same last year, too.

293
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,769
But somebody died in the fourth case,

294
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,369
so out of fear or because investigations were becoming more severe,

295
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,269
the crime was discontinued.

296
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,669
Probably at the fifth site...

297
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,069
But why is it always at a playground?

298
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,969
And only targeted seesaws, slides and so forth.

299
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,170
Maybe...

300
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,569
"Iroha Toys"

301
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,569
This is...

302
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,169
"Iroha Toys" -Iroha Toys.

303
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,170
"Iroha Toys"

304
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,669
This, too.

305
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,069
Same here, too.

306
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,769
This, too!

307
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,769
They all say Iroha Toys.

308
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,369
I thought so.

309
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,769
It's highly likely that the burned playground equipment

310
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,169
at the other parks were also of the same company.

311
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,369
Look.

312
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,170
"Iroha Toys" -The main factory is near here.

313
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,969
Just what does it mean?

314
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,169
Did you figure out where he is?

315
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,069
Maybe it's the next...

316
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,370
Yeah, it's the fifth and last site where the fire will be set.

317
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,570
They seem to be closed because it's Sunday.

318
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,569
That's... If I'm not mistaken...

319
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,670
Look.

320
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,269
The arsonist?

321
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,469
Left-handed.

322
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,069
It's him after all.

323
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,069
Haibara, call 110 and 119.

324
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,170
Okay.

325
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,169
-Hey! -Conan!

326
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,370
Where are you going?

327
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,670
The police will be here any minute!

328
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,269
Who are you?

329
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,969
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

330
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,369
You'd better turn yourself in.

331
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,269
Madam at the bento shop, the arsonist.

332
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,769
No joke?

333
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,769
What about that guy then?

334
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,470
He's also a lefty, but she's the only one who can use that car.

335
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,869
Just as I thought.

336
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,070
Why, Madam?

337
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,770
Here you go, your change.

338
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,770
Thanks, Madam!

339
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,069
You're helpless.

340
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,670
You should eat salads sometime, too.

341
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,469
This is the smell of kerosene.

342
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,269
Don't tell me that...

343
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,270
"Closed"

344
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,070
Madam.

345
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,070
I wonder where she is.

346
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,869
A year and a half ago,

347
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,369
because of a piece of playground equipment that was out of order here,

348
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,970
the child who was playing was seriously injured.

349
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,369
The company put the entire blame on me

350
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,469
because I was the head of the factory.

351
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,769
They fired me,

352
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,869
and they didn't care about what happened to me after that.

353
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,869
It was no joke!

354
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,269
You used to be the head of the factory here?

355
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,369
What was the Iroha countdown for?

356
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,770
Why go out of your way to?

357
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,269
I wanted to give them what they deserved.

358
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,069
To make them repent.

359
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,669
If the company said just one word of apology,

360
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,069
I would've stopped the whole thing.

361
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,269
The only ones that eventually realized what was going on

362
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,370
turned out to be just all of you.

363
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,869
How stupid of me.

364
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,769
Come off it, Madam!

365
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,569
A person died because of you, you know?

366
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,069
Did you forget?

367
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,869
No way. This can't be happening.

368
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,269
I really loved your chopped burdocks.

369
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,770
I really loved them.

370
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,469
Please arrest me too, officer.

371
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,869
What?

372
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,269
You, in fact, witnessed the fourth arson

373
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,269
that took place last year, right?

374
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,969
What?

375
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,869
Yeah, exactly.

376
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,369
What?

377
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,169
-No. -Seriously?

378
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,969
But why?

379
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,969
This.

380
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,269
"Nearby House Robbed!"

381
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,669
A burglar?

382
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,369
Yeah, that's me.

383
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,469
You?

384
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,369
You're a burglar?

385
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,869
That's right.

386
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,569
And one of his crime sites was over there.

387
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,269
Near the site of the fire where a person died.

388
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,569
I stopped being a burglar since then.

389
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,469
But I was afraid of being arrested

390
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,969
so I never called to turn myself in till now.

391
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,069
I justified myself

392
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,969
saying that I didn't get a clear view of the arsonist's face,

393
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,869
and so deceived myself as well as others.

394
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,069
But if I had turned myself in back then,

395
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,469
the arsonist would've been arrested sooner.

396
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,369
Her feelings of vexation may have already been cleared, too.

397
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,069
Then she started to set fire again.

398
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,169
That's why I was determined to catch her with my very hands.

399
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,670
I was also planning to turn myself in after doing so, too.

400
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,669
But most of all,

401
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,869
it's amazing how you figured all this out, sonny.

402
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,169
What? Well, that's because...

403
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,569
You discussed it with pops, right?

404
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,469
That's right.

405
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,769
When I talked to him about the MO of your burglary and your actions,

406
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,569
he made a deduction for me on the phone.

407
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,469
The Sleeping Kogoro.

408
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,169
The Sleeping Kogoro?

409
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,669
I see. I get it now.

410
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,369
I could never get away with this, then.

411
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,470
You got me there.

412
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,669
So, a peaceful night returns to the town.

413
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,069
As to the playground accident that happened a year ago

414
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,169
that started the series of arsons,

415
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,870
the news reported that a reinvestigation of the factory is now underway.

416
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,970
Beware of fire!

417
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,470
Beware of fire!

418
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,670
"Next Episode" -I know.

419
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,570
-No way. -Seriously?

420
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,470
-I know about you, too. -Yes?

421
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,069
That's nothing new.

422
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,670
What about this cameraman?

423
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,970
Why's he here?

424
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,170
I'm the one who chose Iwami.

425
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,269
Next Conan,

426
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,370
