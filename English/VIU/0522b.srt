1
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:02,452
A crisis is gracefully revived.

2
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:04,552
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

3
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:06,352
The unbelievable truth that Heiji discloses.

4
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:09,252
Ran's tears doesn't stop as she watches Shinichi.

5
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:10,852
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:12,752
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:14,752
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:53,435
Hey, this is...

9
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:55,235
He's a perfect double.

10
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:00,035
But, why would you change your face to Shinichi's?

11
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:03,135
He called me out to that hut,

12
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:05,335
confined me there and after becoming me,

13
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,535
he was probably scheming to commit some sort of crime.

14
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:10,535
His intention was to probably annihilate I, Shinichi Kudo...

15
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:15,035
as a person, and from society too.

16
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,235
Annihilate you?

17
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,735
He pretended to have amnesia

18
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:23,035
so that he wouldn't have to answer anything

19
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:26,835
that my friends who he supposed would come along with me may ask.

20
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:28,835
He went into the lake naked and had a hoarse voice

21
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:31,935
as if having a cold for the same reason.

22
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,535
Although he could make himself look like me,

23
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:36,235
he couldn't copy my voice.

24
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:40,235
Neither did he know what kind of clothes I would be wearing.

25
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:47,135
Well, I too, when escaping from that hut fell into the lake,

26
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:50,635
and have a bit of a hoarse voice with a cold.

27
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:53,735
Then, the one who called the ambulance and police this morning

28
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,935
-right after the incident was... -Me.

29
00:02:55,935 --> 00:03:00,035
I saw Mrs. Kawauchi and he come into this house,

30
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:02,235
so I prepared for the worse.

31
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:05,535
Then, why didn't you yourself rush inside and stop him?

32
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,135
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

33
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,035
Because when he came out of the house last night,

34
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,735
from the protrusion in the back of his clothes,

35
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,935
I was sure that he was armed with a gun.

36
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:17,835
I guess it can't be helped.

37
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:20,335
After all, "Failure means death"

38
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:22,935
was carved on the desk too.

39
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:23,935
Yes.

40
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:27,835
If he was ready to shoot a specific person,

41
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:30,035
maybe I could've stopped him.

42
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,735
If he had his mind made up to kill himself

43
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:35,535
as soon as he found out that his scheme didn't work,

44
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:39,135
the time I had to stop him was limited.

45
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,335
That's why I took the bullets out of Officer Shiroyama's gun

46
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,535
and scattered it before his eyes

47
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:46,735
to make him hesitate and putting him off guard.

48
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:52,735
Because he was probably planning to carry out his scheme

49
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:55,135
as soon as I appeared before him.

50
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,035
Isn't that right, Okuda?

51
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:00,635
Rather, Makoto Hinohara?

52
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:09,435
Makoto? You mean you're Makoto?

53
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:10,635
He sure is.

54
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:11,935
To do this much with plastic surgery

55
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,935
would cost a lot of time and money.

56
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:18,535
But, Makoto could do it because he got a lot of estate

57
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:20,335
and his whereabouts were unknown for six months.

58
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:28,735
If so, he would've hidden the gun in his own room in this house.

59
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,535
He assumed beforehand that they would bring him back here

60
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:33,535
to help him regain his memory.

61
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:35,835
He then tells everyone that he wants to be alone,

62
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:38,735
and that's when he retrieves the gun.

63
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:43,435
But, why, why did he have to stab the newspaper reporter?

64
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,535
He probably thought that she found out about everything

65
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,935
because of her remark last night.

66
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,635
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

67
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:53,635
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

68
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:58,535
That you underwent plastic surgery to make yourself look like Kudo.

69
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:00,435
But, I don't understand.

70
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:03,335
When I came over to the house this morning,

71
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:08,035
why didn't you say that you stabbed Mrs. Kawauchi?

72
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:09,735
If you wanted to frame Kudo for the murder,

73
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:12,135
wouldn't that have been faster?

74
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:20,935
I was testing you detectives out.

75
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,435
I wanted to see what kind of deduction

76
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:27,235
you'd come up with after the evidence all pointed

77
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:30,535
to Shinichi Kudo being the murderer.

78
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:37,535
Well, it seems they saw you through completely.

79
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:40,935
Then, what about the incident that occurred a year ago?

80
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:43,935
What's with Shinichi Kudo who made a stupid deduction

81
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:46,335
saying that Mr. Hinohara committed forced double suicide

82
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:50,435
when a robber made away with the valuables and murdered them?

83
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:53,635
What about him?

84
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:59,735
Kudo didn't make a mistake.

85
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:02,735
That was a forced double suicide.

86
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:03,835
What?

87
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:05,935
The murder weapon of the killer,

88
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:07,135
Mrs. Hinohara's jewelry,

89
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:09,835
as well as her valuable Nioh statue were taken, you know?

90
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,935
It's more than obvious that the killer took it with him.

91
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:14,235
The lake...

92
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:18,335
After Mr. Hinohara stabbed his wife,

93
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:23,135
he sunk the murder weapon together with the jewelry into the lake.

94
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:25,035
What're you talking about?

95
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:29,035
It's close to 30 meters from this house to the lake.

96
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,435
How would the culprit be able to take all that

97
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:32,735
to the lake without leaving footprints behind?

98
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:35,035
Not only the murder weapon and the jewelry,

99
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:36,235
but the strings for the gold medals

100
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,335
and the loops for quoits are also gone.

101
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,335
Quoits?

102
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:44,535
Mr. Hinohara's son Daiki was saying, remember?

103
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:46,435
That his father was good at quoits

104
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,235
and always played a perfect game, right?

105
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:51,635
The scores that are written on the target of quoits

106
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:54,235
are 10 points, 5 points, 2 points.

107
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:56,135
So, if he wants to play a perfect game scoring 100 points,

108
00:06:56,135 --> 00:07:00,335
he needs 10 quoits, but there were only 9.

109
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:04,835
Besides, one pair of the Nioh statue was left untouched

110
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,635
and taking into consideration

111
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,635
that Mr. Hinohara used to be a player of field sports,

112
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:12,235
the answer is obvious.

113
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,635
Hammer throwing.

114
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,035
He packed the Nioh statue that he used for weight together

115
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:23,035
with the murder weapon, shoes and jewelry into a bag,

116
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:24,635
and used the quoit as a handle

117
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:28,535
by tying on the string of medal onto the package.

118
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:31,635
He did this all to throw the bag into the lake from the veranda

119
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:33,735
as he would do when hammer throwing.

120
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:35,135
I see.

121
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,635
He left one Nion statue behind

122
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,735
because putting both in the bag would make it too heavy

123
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:43,335
and the bag wouldn't reach the lake.

124
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:44,935
Ridiculous.

125
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:47,835
The bag would've never made it because of resistance from the wind.

126
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,735
No, the bag made it.

127
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:53,035
The bag, string and quoits

128
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,935
have already been retrieved from the lake.

129
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:59,435
Of course on the blade of the murder weapon knife,

130
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:02,735
Mrs. Hinohara's blood was found and on the handle of the knife,

131
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:05,035
Mr. Hinohara's fingerprints were found.

132
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:08,035
There's no mistake that it was a forced double suicide

133
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:09,435
committed by Mr. Hinohara.

134
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:11,835
Not true.

135
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:15,735
He probably made it look like the doings of an armed robber

136
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:19,435
so that his son, Daiki wouldn't realize what happened.

137
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:24,535
That's a lie! Mr. Hinohara who was cheerful and kind man

138
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:27,435
would never commit forced double suicide with his wife.

139
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:30,235
Besides the Mr. Hinohara's cancer was found to be benign

140
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:33,535
and it turned out that the motive for his murderous act

141
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,035
which was because he was depressed over it was also a lie.

142
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:37,935
After the doctor told him about his cancer.

143
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,435
Another problem came into the light.

144
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:43,335
After the physical exam,

145
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:47,035
it turned out that Mr. Hinohara's blood type was...

146
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:51,035
in fact, AB.

147
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,035
Hey, wait!

148
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:55,835
I thought I heard that Mr. Hinohara's family

149
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,835
was a cheerful blood type O family.

150
00:08:58,835 --> 00:08:59,835
Yes.

151
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:02,135
According to Mendel's Law of Heredity,

152
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:04,235
a child with blood type O is not born

153
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:06,135
from parents whose blood type is AB and O.

154
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:07,535
In other words,

155
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:11,535
Daiki is not Mr. Hinohara's son.

156
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,035
Oh no.

157
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:15,835
My god.

158
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,135
Don't lie.

159
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,035
I see.

160
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:28,935
If that was his motive for committing the murder,

161
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,835
it's something that people would want to keep secret.

162
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:32,635
Yes. That's why it was announced

163
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:34,435
that the motive for him committing the murder

164
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:36,335
was because he was told he had cancer.

165
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:41,435
But if so, why didn't he tell me about it?

166
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,735
I was a part of the family and yet!

167
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:46,435
I already told you why.

168
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,835
Because Mr. Kudo told me to.

169
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:52,635
Don't dare tell anybody.

170
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:56,235
But, please do tell Makoto about this.

171
00:09:57,335 --> 00:10:00,535
When? Where did you tell me this?

172
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:05,435
Here, the night after Mr. Kudo finished investigating the case and left.

173
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:08,335
But, come to think of it.

174
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:12,835
The truth about Mr. Hinohara having committed forced double suicide

175
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,435
that I told you about first was so shocking

176
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:18,035
that you may not have been listening to what I was saying.

177
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:20,935
No.

178
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,535
It's not possible.

179
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,535
What the heck is wrong with me?

180
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:29,535
What the heck did I go and change my face for?

181
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,235
What the heck?

182
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:50,335
A tragedy brought about by a much too unfortunate coincidence.

183
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,735
Seeing my face breaking out in tears before me,

184
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:57,035
I thought that...

185
00:10:57,035 --> 00:11:00,135
I can't ever forget this face.

186
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:02,935
That I should engraved it deep inside of me.

187
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:16,235
So that guy called Makoto was Death.

188
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:19,635
Yes. He was the 2nd one though.

189
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:20,835
The second one?

190
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,735
The first was his father.

191
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,035
In order to prevent the children of the village

192
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:27,835
from going through the same misfortune as his daughter

193
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:30,635
who had died in the forest.

194
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,435
He built a hut in the forest

195
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:34,535
and lived in it as Death,

196
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:38,335
to scare and keep people from entering the forest.

197
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:41,835
He did so until he fell ill and died 3 years ago.

198
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:45,435
So the stone that was placed near the hut was...

199
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:48,735
Yes. It's Makoto's father's grave.

200
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:51,835
How come you know so much?

201
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,135
When I came here a year ago,

202
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:57,235
there was another incident other than this case happening.

203
00:11:57,235 --> 00:12:00,235
Mrs. Kawauchi's daughter who had come here on an interview

204
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:03,735
went into the forest and never came back.

205
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:06,035
I heard about it from the person at the inn.

206
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:08,835
That Mrs. Kawauchi also went inside the forest to look for her.

207
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:12,435
Yes, just when I was about to go to look for her too,

208
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:15,435
her daughter came out of the forest on her own.

209
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,935
She said that Death found her in the forest

210
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:18,935
and she was chased around.

211
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:21,235
She was so scared that she kept running around

212
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:24,035
until she found herself outside the forest.

213
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,035
I figured I had to solve this mystery

214
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:27,635
before taking care of the murder case,

215
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:28,835
so I went into the forest.

216
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:31,435
I found Death, went after him and found that hut.

217
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:37,535
Then, I ran into Makoto who was dressed as Death.

218
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:39,035
I see.

219
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:43,135
So, you borrowed the outfit that you found in that hut this time.

220
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,335
Yes.

221
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:46,635
I did so because I had no choice after I fell into the lake

222
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,735
and my clothes got wet.

223
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:51,235
Besides, with these clothes on everybody fled from me too,

224
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,535
so it turned out to be a great way to hide my face.

225
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:58,435
But I feel sorry for Makoto.

226
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,135
He'll be fine.

227
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:05,335
It seems that Mrs. Kawauchi wasn't that badly hurt

228
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:09,235
as we thought she was at first either.

229
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,535
When she finds out who had saved her daughter's life a year ago,

230
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:14,935
she will be grateful to Death.

231
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,135
Shinichi?

232
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,135
What's the matter, Shinichi?

233
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:30,835
This is?

234
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:33,535
Shinichi? What's the wrong?

235
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:35,935
Oh no, it's come.

236
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:38,335
Oh no. It's almost 24 hours.

237
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:41,135
I've got to take Shinichi away from everybody quick.

238
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:45,435
I almost forgot.

239
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:48,235
The Inspector had asked Kudo and I to come

240
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:51,335
and tell him more in detail about the case.

241
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:54,035
So you guys go on ahead by car and...

242
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:55,035
No.

243
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,535
I'll go with you too.

244
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:59,135
I have things that...

245
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:02,035
I want to ask you too, Shinichi.

246
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:04,135
Lots and lots of things too!

247
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,235
Ran...

248
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,935
Shinichi?

249
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:14,935
Kudo?

250
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,135
Are you all right?

251
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:21,035
My body's... my body's hot...

252
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,835
Oh no. He's really hot.

253
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:26,735
If things go as is, I'm going to return to a kid.

254
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,535
I'll transform back to Conan again.

255
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,735
I can't afford to go back

256
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,335
to how was in front of her.

257
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:37,735
It's his cold, his cold.

258
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:40,235
Remember he said he fell into the lake?

259
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:43,035
The cold he had back then got worse.

260
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,635
I guess so, but...

261
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,035
He seems to be suffering abnormally.

262
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:48,535
What?

263
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,735
You want to go to the john and let out what you have to?

264
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,235
I see! I see!

265
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:56,635
Okay, I'll go take Shinichi to the toilet at the inn,

266
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:59,335
so Kazuha would you bring my bag and come along.

267
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,435
Why do I have to take your bag?

268
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,435
Change of clothes, I need change of clothes!

269
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,035
Kudo is sweating profusely

270
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:08,135
so we can't keep him in Death's outfit forever, can we?

271
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,135
So, okay? Bring it for me, will you?

272
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:12,835
"Okuho Inn"

273
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:15,235
Twenty four hours?

274
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:16,735
Are you serious?

275
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,635
Yes. The little lady at doctor's place said so.

276
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:23,935
The drug only stays effective for 24 hours.

277
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:29,135
She told me to bring you back to her before the time is up.

278
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,935
Isn't it almost time?

279
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:34,535
If you do get small again,

280
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,335
go inside this bag.

281
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:42,235
Then, I'll somehow get you out of here safely.

282
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:43,935
You can count on me.

283
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:45,535
Yes.

284
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:46,735
Heiji?

285
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:47,835
Kazuha?

286
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,235
What're you sneaking around about?

287
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,035
Stupid, don't come in.

288
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,635
This is the men's room.

289
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,935
But, we're worried about Shinichi.

290
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:58,335
We brought a doctor that we found in the neighborhood along.

291
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,335
He's fine. He's fine.

292
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,335
Besides, I just gave him some cold medicine now.

293
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,635
What kind of medicine did you give him?

294
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:07,335
Well, it's a secret potion

295
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:09,835
that has been handed down in my family for generations.

296
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:16,235
Darn it.

297
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,835
It always turns out like this.

298
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:23,035
It always turns out like this!

299
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:28,335
I always go back being Conan

300
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:31,135
without being able to say anything to her.

301
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:35,135
Am I going to have to start all over again?

302
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:53,138
Shoots.

303
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,538
I'm Conan again.

304
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:57,438
Shinichi? What's wrong?

305
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:59,138
Hey, don't!

306
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:00,338
Shinichi?

307
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,338
Hey, Shinichi?

308
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:06,638
I've to hide in the bag quick.

309
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,538
Shinichi.

310
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:10,138
Well, so you see...

311
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:12,738
Or, Ran will find out about me.

312
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:14,238
Shinichi.

313
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,538
Shinichi!

314
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:21,438
Oh no.

315
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:27,038
The toilet next door?

316
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:30,338
Who is it?

317
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:33,338
Shinichi, please answer me.

318
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:36,338
I'm telling you he's okay.

319
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:40,438
How can he be okay screaming like that?

320
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:41,538
Get out of my way.

321
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,438
Please, Heiji!

322
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:47,638
No... Don't...

323
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:51,938
You idiot.

324
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,038
Kudo?

325
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,138
Shinichi...

326
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,838
What is it? Stop bugging me.

327
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:09,738
The least you can do is give me peace using the toilet.

328
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:12,838
How're you feeling?

329
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:15,038
Yes, since I let everything out,

330
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:16,438
I'm feeling much better.

331
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:20,938
It looks like your fever came down too.

332
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:21,938
See?

333
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:25,038
I'm glad. I was really worried.

334
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,338
Shall we head on home then.

335
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,638
Don't we have to go to the police

336
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:32,038
and give them the details of the case?

337
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:34,338
Well, we can do that after we get home.

338
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:35,838
True. And just to be on the safe side,

339
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:38,338
you'd better go to the hospital too.

340
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:39,438
Yes.

341
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:41,338
Okay, let's head home then.

342
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:46,038
I'm very sorry, after you came all this way.

343
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,838
Not at all.

344
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:51,438
Kudo, what the heck is going on?

345
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:53,238
I'll tell you later.

346
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:56,638
Wait, Kudo.

347
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:08,438
We seem to have somehow made it through.

348
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,738
He seems to have regained his memory too.

349
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:13,038
Yes. What a life saver.

350
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,538
Thank god you remembered the name of the inn they were staying at.

351
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:18,938
Good gracious, too, that we were able to assume

352
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:21,138
that if he was cornered,

353
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,038
he would flee into the toilet of the inn.

354
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:29,338
Ai?

355
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:31,338
How'd you get here?

356
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,238
I've no time to explain.

357
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,438
Just drink this right away.

358
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,138
This is, don't tell me...

359
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:44,338
Yes, it's the prototype of the antidote of the APTX 4869

360
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:46,638
that shrunk your body.

361
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:49,638
It's the same medicine you drank yesterday.

362
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:51,538
Then, it'll keep for 24 hours?

363
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:53,438
Don't be silly.

364
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:55,938
Just as when you frequently keep drinking the same medicine,

365
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:58,238
the effectiveness wears off.

366
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,038
Your body builds up resistance to the medicine,

367
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,738
and by taking it repeatedly,

368
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:06,538
the length of time the drug remains effective shortens too.

369
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,838
If you want to continue hiding your true identity,

370
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,338
you'll have get out of their sight

371
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,938
before the effect of the drug wears off

372
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:14,638
and go back to being Conan Edogawa.

373
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:28,038
And?

374
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:31,738
What is it that you want to ask me?

375
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:39,038
I just wanted to say thank you for treating my wounds.

376
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,638
You're the one who treated them, right?

377
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:46,138
Yes. Since there just happened to be a first aid kit in that mountain.

378
00:20:47,838 --> 00:20:49,638
You didn't look, did you?

379
00:20:50,938 --> 00:20:54,338
You know when you were treating me...

380
00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:58,938
When I was wrapping the bandage around your thighs,

381
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:01,838
I saw the white stuff.

382
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,438
So you did look after all!

383
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:04,738
How dare you!

384
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:05,738
You idiot!

385
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,738
I didn't look at it because I wanted to,

386
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:09,438
I just happened to see it, you get?

387
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:11,038
Well, I'm so sorry!

388
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,138
That I showed you what you didn't want to see!

389
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:16,338
Ran.

390
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:18,038
Would you like to change seats with me?

391
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:20,638
I think it'll make it easier for both of you to talk.

392
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:23,738
It's okay, Kazuha, stay right there.

393
00:21:23,738 --> 00:21:26,938
I'm going to throw that guy over my shoulder after we get home.

394
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:28,238
Give me a break.

395
00:21:31,738 --> 00:21:35,738
No. This isn't how it's suppose to turn out.

396
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:38,338
The thing I wanted to ask Shinichi about was...

397
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:41,738
The thing I really wanted to confirm was...

398
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:48,938
Ran.

399
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:54,838
Officer Sato and Takagi. What's up?

400
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:57,538
I went to the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department!

401
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:59,138
And, since I finished doing what I had to do,

402
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:01,638
I'm having my driver drive me home.

403
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:03,838
I'm no more than a driver.

404
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:05,338
What about you people?

405
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:08,438
Did you have any case to solve or something, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro?

406
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:11,038
Yes. Well, sort of.

407
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,738
Really? Well, excuse us, since we're in a rush.

408
00:22:14,738 --> 00:22:17,138
Tell us about the case some other day then!

409
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,038
Since that incident is big news,

410
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,538
as long as they read tomorrow's papers they'll find out about it

411
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:23,638
without us telling them about it.

412
00:22:23,638 --> 00:22:26,738
No, I don't think it'll be in the papers.

413
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:30,038
Nobody died as a result, and besides,

414
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:32,238
the culprit is still a juvenile.

415
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:34,938
Neither his name nor picture will be publicized.

416
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,638
It seems that the newspaper reporter lady who was stabbed,

417
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,438
also said that she won't write about it.

418
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:44,838
You were sure lucky, Kudo.

419
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,538
What's with that car?

420
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:56,038
It's moving along scraping its body against the guardrail.

421
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:03,538
Maybe he's sleeping at the wheels?

422
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:05,438
If we leave it as is, there's sure to be a big accident.

423
00:23:14,238 --> 00:23:16,238
Hey, get up!

424
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:17,838
Hey, you!

425
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:28,038
Hey, something's not right.

426
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,038
Get this car in front of that car.

427
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:33,038
Hey! In front, don't tell me that...

428
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:39,238
When you go up front slow down little by little.

429
00:23:39,238 --> 00:23:42,038
Idiot! If I do that, the rental car will...

430
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:43,438
Never mind, just hurry.

431
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,238
Gunpei? Gunpei?

432
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,438
Hey, wait. Don't touch him.

433
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:11,738
Please step back.

434
00:24:11,738 --> 00:24:13,338
Who're you people?

435
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:18,338
-No good. -He's not breathing anymore.

436
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:21,138
Look, Kudo.

437
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:24,038
There's hemorrhaging under his eyes.

438
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:26,638
Don't tell me that this is...

439
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:31,338
a rope mark.

440
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:33,538
Kudo, this is...

441
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,138
Hey!

442
00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:36,538
What's wrong?

443
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:39,638
Ran. There's a toll gate a kilometer from here.

444
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:42,338
Call Officer Sato and have them block it off.

445
00:24:42,338 --> 00:24:43,738
Why?

446
00:24:43,738 --> 00:24:47,238
The driver of this car is dead.

447
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:48,838
He was strangled.

448
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:51,938
Strangled?

449
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:53,338
Yes.

450
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:58,338
In this moving car that's locked.

451
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:33,338
There are only three suspicious cars here.

452
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:36,738
He's leaving.

453
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:39,438
Shinichi's going to leave again.

454
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:41,938
You're not the only one.

455
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:44,338
I'm the one who have things

456
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:46,238
I want to ask you as well as tell you,

457
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:49,338
So, wait, okay?

458
00:26:51,338 --> 00:26:53,338
No joke. It's already come.

459
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:59,438
Next Conan, "The Real Question".

460
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,438
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:04,638
"The car window".

462
00:27:04,638 --> 00:27:05,638
Where's Conan?

463
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:08,138
I think I saw him together with Shinichi.

464
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:09,338
You couldn't have.
